i will do my best said the innkeeper of the pont du gard shutting up his knife   15.965838464485273
monsieur has returned then   11.69576112917108
do not speak to me of that said monte cristo with the first movement of anger he had betrayed   15.206702625853342
upon my word you did well to come back   15.151446581215438
the prisoner heard the cry which sounded like the sob of a broken heart and leaning from the coach he called out good bye mercédès we shall soon meet again   10.273568015508221
and you have succeeded exclaimed d avrigny   13.267331612773457
he recognized the place where he had awaked by the bed of heather that was there   16.835813121925213
lieutenant in the king s musketeers   8.676970854326273
he lowered his gun in the direction of the traveler   12.195240353302458
for i saw god s justice placed in the hands of benedetto and should have thought it sacrilege to oppose the designs of providence   7.519046287105644
you can dispute together and that will pass away the time   10.005147662401992
he arose rushed out of the room and to the stairs exclaiming energetically julie julie emmanuel emmanuel   10.47435667048554
then suddenly bursting into laughter ah   10.334648180266402
under her apparent emotions her icy coolness never abandoned her   12.024804461204871
de monte cristo at the opera yesterday he apologized on the ground today   8.513002799295386
if not i will apply to the chancellor i will apply to the king i will apply to the hangman i will move the courts against you i will denounce you as branded i will bring you to trial   12.03916870920541
edmond found some solace in these ideas   17.57976044710503
and he set his mind actively to work   9.55418696277274
murmured milady between her teeth   11.902293062642277
at the corner of the street they met the count s steward who was awaiting his master   14.526848633317615
groslow jumped in followed by mordaunt and in five minutes they were quite away from that world of houses which then crowded the outskirts of london   10.19187660469622
in these caves   10.196424984493643
he urged the horse again into a trot   10.930127978890246
morrel fell back in his chair his strength was failing him   8.874037816660193
villefort retained his place but his marriage was put off until a more favorable opportunity   11.65687670221787
but you do not know this man   16.525020893095665
have we overtaken them   12.068469803414718
and that is the reason why i have the honor to inform your eminence of what has happened   8.612664665413408
yes replied mme   8.37711598485392
no lest on the first demonstration i make in favor of mehemet ali the sultan send me the bowstring and make my secretaries strangle me   7.523494279267376
but you will leave the city on your right   9.435497268457656
he has i repeat the longest head of the four and for my part i declare that i will obey him   10.906819823152407
mousqueton shrieked with pain   11.046019868446495
a ball at this season   6.715289669810353
d artagnan my dear m   8.453325844416675
and yours   11.140349807771472
and he broke from the priests struggling and raving like a wild beast and striving desperately to break the cords that bound his hands   6.966917892101531
but it was his servant who this time put the letter in the post   12.72685943480749
but he who was addressed stood there stupefied bewildered stunned   9.800879946438258
five minutes afterwards the doors of the drawing room were thrown open and bertuccio appearing said with a violent effort the dinner waits   13.623076751599358
good day sirs said the duke advancing   10.583699409662037
benedetto is nothing more nor less than an assassin   11.801162906124011
did he not make a million in spaniards this last year   10.719765121105443
come along said caderousse   13.160312245980915
madame said the president may reference be made to the count of monte cristo who is now i believe in paris   13.660319038564296
i do not know the man who deserves being regretted during the whole life of another man   9.863444331402047
do these things concern me   11.209722252226303
yes if you really wish it said d artagnan and even with great pleasure i confess   12.45991661423169
one of the most agreeable possible my dear sir   16.085327788806865
in the baroness s box i believe   9.611128048903296
what are you going to tell me   12.71010139552742
i am listening said la ramee leaning back in his armchair and raising his glass of madeira to his lips and winking his eye that he might see the sun through the rich liquid that he was about to taste   15.307497147308913
i bitterly reproach myself i assure you   13.61017585532635
i shall expect you then in half an hour baron and valentine will be ready   14.938523052818685
he was waiting for a woman continued tréville   13.080386477263588
how far is mazingarbe   12.455989308474186
monseigneur will be with him in an hour   11.667473044258626
his guards taking him by the arms and coat collar forced him to rise and dragged him towards the steps that lead to the gate of the fortress while the police officer carrying a musket with fixed bayonet followed behind   12.92125907470901
the night chapter 90   6.822136103478208
the sergeant with the air of importance which such people assume when they are clad with military dignity said who are you gentlemen   12.883214240264186
he knows them then   8.466893290674328
he began as you begin   9.778515510536206
40168m no   10.858189709369496
fly then   10.77460473665473
de villefort talking to m   10.338892887319684
i acknowledge i would have given anything to find it out   8.847340479865888
an angel alone could have saved one of us from death that angel came from heaven if not to make us friends which alas fatality renders impossible at least to make us esteem each other   10.154040740401
my god grant that he may one day suffer what i suffer   12.124041323374739
d artagnan bent forward ready either to attack or to stand on his defense   6.603772126626114
during all this time a sentinel who had been relieved at eight o clock had been watching his door   14.09843670302438
again repeated villefort   12.836613516931406
this was a sort of boudoir circular and lighted only from the roof which consisted of rose colored glass   12.041528849956851
said athos madame in the name of heaven whose empty glass is this   10.643168223117328
yes said d artagnan till she comes out   15.062988867255823
my name has been mentioned to you the comte de la fere   13.719115346173973
everything was in the same state   11.967488159547804
returned monte cristo that is a prejudice on your part m   15.314272745935547
said albert passing his hand across his eyes i know she would   7.817232212935924
i have heard porthos speak of her that s all   13.216217901468678
but the comte de la fere had spoken and he had no thought but to obey   11.33814980827935
monsieur boisrenard   14.355137274239087
you do not understand me gentlemen said d artagnan throwing up his head the sharp and bold lines of which were at the moment gilded by a bright ray of the sun   10.667008737813322
cried mousqueton   14.402868861023338
it is as if they guessed what you wanted by your manner of ringing and made a point of keeping everything you can possibly desire in constant readiness   14.419560735092151
take them said cromwell   11.347406195194585
left alone the cardinal seated himself again and wrote a letter which he secured with his special seal   9.626234960095061
just then the sound of finger nails slightly grating against the door of the library informed valentine that the count was still watching and recommended her to do the same   13.31011571464402
i mean because he wants petting   14.05023014960135
d artagnan more surprised than ever at the tone and manners of the abbé d herblay which contrasted so strongly with those of the musketeer aramis remained staring with wide open eyes at the face of his friend   8.370479360784548
and then having no subject left for contemplation he shut his eyes and fell asleep   16.951199486572733
said the count with a smile which petrified the dying man when you had just broken your knife against the coat of mail which protected my breast   18.65720172669385
athos fell into a profound reverie and answered nothing   16.588582362224997
the major recovered his self possession   7.128726739919875
yes continued morrel death had entered that house twice within one month   15.314671273353506
and as they reached him he found himself in a condition to meet his engagements when the end of july came   13.462852415288594
sir said aramis you allowed yourself just now to treat us in a most extraordinary manner   10.207918879909357
did not the messenger say your father s safety depended upon it   11.776208179156335
albert ran to fetch a carriage   14.004124049221101
was i a major   11.491947920841355
whispered mme   5.370418605086833
of what else should i speak   14.423183342501035
and monte cristo with an expression of majesty and sublimity advanced with arms folded toward the young man who involuntarily overcome by the commanding manner of this man recoiled a step   14.972809509129952
the palace of whitehall was guarded by three regiments of cavalry and by the fierce anxiety of cromwell who came and went or sent his generals or his agents continually   9.05344535446273
nor did he say more than the truth for in paris and the circle in which the viscount moved he was looked upon and cited as a model of perfection   13.528806461074508
i am with the person to whom this letter was addressed and to whom i desired to prove that luigi vampa was a man of his word   13.280602883283503
said caderousse crossing himself   12.979149976696004
in that quality i say what i please and at this moment it pleases me to say that you weary me   15.050923470125166
anne drew up as she always did when anything touched her pride   9.437316974736298
and nothing more   11.182100038431976
and if he is not captured or killed he will endeavor to pass over into france to recruit soldiers and to refurnish himself with arms and money   12.579558934796962
said villefort raising his arms to heaven with a threatening gesture   9.058149363005544
now when evening came dantès put his plate on the ground near the door   9.701396895460144
the knocker had scarcely sounded under the hand of the young man before the tumult ceased steps approached the door was opened and d artagnan sword in hand rushed into the rooms of m   7.1648480339446134
you are mistaken planchet replied d artagnan   18.084270340766132
as usual   11.151491923862704
you know i am waiting said monte cristo smiling   18.885052311620647
and you married her at last notwithstanding the opposition of her family   17.611549989412445
do not disturb yourself on my account i beseech you   9.695870700464885
d artagnan approached her with his usual gallantry   6.038316654506589
and added he with a smile she will take her own   10.003705053870135
the president frowned imperceptibly   12.244028145098179
let us see said he i have swum above an hour but as the wind is against me that has retarded my speed   12.081658477912791
oh yes yes i thank you with all my heart said valentine   10.584695844385445
demanded villefort   10.779250782110271
you will excuse this poor fellow madame he said as he preceded the baroness but his orders are precise and m   11.121372198456681
but i am grateful i swear to you   17.966675448972296
since i became an abbé i dream of nothing but battles   7.9322426307778775
however he remained standing clinging to a window   10.978422471169853
caderousse quickly performed the stranger s bidding   3.03235857971468
said danglars laughing   11.097486872481943
i have told you that without being able to regain the complete exercise of my faculties i retained the sense of my danger   9.697762051595998
mazarin who was sitting at a table folding up papers as if he had only been a secretary of state looked up   17.83599907626417
the steamer soon disappeared and in an hour afterwards as the count had said was scarcely distinguishable in the horizon amidst the fogs of the night   10.244380384012928
go from hence to blangy and from blangy to neufchâtel   13.122207851571632
why replied he i think it just possible dantès may have been detected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as contraband   12.959376073782908
and having snatched a hasty dinner they continued their journey to louvres   15.402250672992224
it was with him she agreed and not with me   8.636730224426447
true i had forgotten that   8.350551439691012
and the mystifier appears to me to have the air of being a certain young gascon of my acquaintance   11.123979820835428
no doubt said aramis but it is far from here to the enemy   18.28976013932454
he venture himself amongst us to be hung   15.322101383692187
the branches of the great trees in the garden of the count s house stood out boldly against the azure canopy of heaven which was studded with golden stars but where the last fleeting clouds of a vanishing storm yet lingered   9.980851843069274
like mère simon s son who has not chosen the worst strawberries   8.235454047318035
is not that word known in france   7.924669874999903
but with regard to myself who am traveling quietly with my own servant i have not the same reasons as you have to conceal my name   10.581534240990067
to all the simple things which escaped our gascon milady replied with a smile of kindness   12.052426829509143
thrown over the foot of the royal bed my simar madame looks not unlike the mantle worn by kings   7.61937306572716
the tenth of your income that would be fine work   13.269298182446782
the cardinal made an approving gesture and retraced his route with the same precautions he had used in coming   12.908052747979129
who has   13.926121041383148
whilst this scene was going on d artagnan remained with open mouth and a confused gaze   13.15873253195396
besides the letter from mr   15.887457821289068
my friend monsieur du vallon is of a very melancholy disposition so much so that one can scarcely get three words out of him all day   15.433028978693798
and what i have suffered said the young girl you shall never know my lord   13.096127044742602
seven o clock   13.157907260232422
i have seen him sleep with a sword suspended over his head   11.635419483796333
but i cried morrel groaning with sorrow i love her   12.245547815988148
still i was but an agent led on by an invisible and offended deity who chose not to withhold the fatal blow that i was destined to hurl   10.817415438221985
poor valentine   13.159804258935807
you are in love with a woman whom the cardinal has caused to be shut up and you wish to get her out of the hands of the cardinal   13.180995874493252
are you not married   11.574510279934904
ah that is true   13.025436867451715
my child is there   14.36310237562072
and was told on inquiry by comminges that he was looking on the back of the pavilion where d artagnan was confined   12.194918021189208
she moved forward   8.420432369380972
it has been in the family a very long while returned monte cristo a sort of treasure expressly forbidden to be touched for a certain period of years during which the accumulated interest has doubled the capital   13.593132013656437
no sir do not call him i conjure you   10.758161144330778
andrea cavalcanti may appear to those who look at men s faces and figures as a very good specimen of his kind   14.469528743406483
no more theses no more glosses upon the fingers or upon benedictions hey   11.804864486267165
i am murdered   11.597010303788739
d artagnan arose   12.967209891211784

the thing is worth looking into and i will take pains to investigate the matter thoroughly   6.596797066196077
he was just taking one up and looking for the point to aim at on a little iron plate which served him as a target when his study door opened and baptistin entered   16.713732925085022
thank him then madame if you have any affection for me   9.769432019868717
has monsieur bonacieux sent anything to you for his wife or for any other person   13.87440873122778
he will amass wealth he will injure the king s revenue and pay to himself the pensions which richelieu paid to others   12.284909250992095
it was thought rather dear but people wanted to sleep and who would not give even two or three louis for a few hours of sound sleep   12.323296775917804
the two prisoners a year after louis xviii   8.616203519322678
he intended returning some hours after me and doubtless he is now at home   10.88966092614761
madame de villefort is dressed   12.09914054632547
there is nothing to do now but fold the letter as i am doing and write upon it to the king s attorney and that s all settled   11.383609832163112
there are only two persons who have the key to that door murmured morrel cocles and julie   15.866372543563902
in fifteen days at most rochefort would be back   5.961703083224746
i have preserved this diamond cross which came from my mother and this order of st   8.186285233614068
and the cardinal made him a sign with his hand to which bonacieux replied by bowing to the ground   8.033672329663787
you think then that you can help me more efficaciously than your brothers   8.650559525069843
stop what   4.727143502971504
then said mercédès i will lead the way   9.57710982538946
you great people always lose something by scandal notwithstanding your millions   13.32778822434994
monsieur said the cardinal are you a d artagnan from béarn   13.697928132950056
let them come on   14.019442006043004
and now said athos while they bring the wine tell me d artagnan what has become of the others come   16.942892024654803
but i like mine as well   12.329246536033441
and now he ruins her fortune deprives her of liberty and even threatens her life   9.297499992073016
everyone has not black slaves a princely retinue an arsenal of weapons that would do credit to an arabian fortress horses that cost six thousand francs apiece and greek mistresses   10.131773501091006
you will do as much as that will you   10.551811195681536
julie emmanuel and some of the servants ran up in alarm on hearing the cries of maximilian   10.78528013125382
andrea indeed inhaled the scent of something cooking which was not unwelcome to him hungry as he was   15.054171092826106
one of us went to him and invited him to the rue saint jacques where he would find some friends   19.863618333167032
felton said he   12.642463220096381
he despised flatterers but he appreciated enthusiasts   8.776516745652636
i promise you i will sustain my part to admiration   9.143649802467218
athos fixed upon a certain cahusac a favorite of the cardinal s   10.180350907269855
when he saw the formidable and chosen body with which louis xiii   11.738119170621912
demoustier says and i will not retard its course or disturb its calm   11.98939698908031
we are going in order to win it to remain an hour in the bastion   12.606160810147733
mazarin returned pale and evidently thoughtful   13.483020615610867
he begged for another week which was granted to him   15.116193180270546
the attendant was at the door holding the cardinal s horse by the bridle   15.734882454777264
notwithstanding that assurance morrel still hesitated   13.061380645735875
well then why do you wish me to give up seeing such a man   9.402764297086327
and although it is generally with her husband s money that she procures herself this indulgence the gratitude for it seldom reverts to him   15.338098163738467
basset   9.539704996258836
true i was a tailor till the trade fell off   9.427407383882962
the city grocer had ornamented the chambers with two hundred flambeaux of white wax a piece of luxury unheard of at that period   13.174843150623632
chapter 73   5.848792461756268
about this time the nurse s cough was heard on the stairs and the woman entered the room with a cup in her hand   11.312036892927813
muttered porthos shaking his head never should i have thought this of him   13.465888562319751
i rely on you valentine said morrel   11.78558658943253
the article having been read during the painful hush that followed a universal shudder pervaded the assembly and immediately the closest attention was given to the orator as he resumed his remarks   7.635065277398661
where is the treaty   10.914065307513647
found himself opposite his house in the champs élysées   7.813677045114416
then he is there   15.231494685978554
d artagnan followed but less nimbly showing plainly that this mode of ascent was not one to which he was accustomed   7.094056366517307
in a blue frock coat buttoned up close decorated with the legion of honor   14.214276683162003
why everything is relative answered the abbé   7.843729496215898
oh sir she said   13.550683594097006
how many men think you you could collect together to night   18.7837866049884
well take them   13.44611830139444
come hither i say and don t be afraid continued athos   9.879127559744227
we shall take the place of those two fellows   11.80330142411773
recovering himself however he wiped the perspiration from his brows and stopped not again till he found himself at the door of the house in which his father had lived   11.158983159205745
she will repent and no one will know that she has been guilty   13.126829576487825
but d artagnan who had no longer a motive for staying so near the enemy abridged the testimonials of his gratitude   14.852035372969294
one can no more now reckon on one s friends than on one s footmen said porthos   14.122384551308572
he held in his hand a tankard full of a dark substance and approaching the gleam of light shed by the lamp he uttered this single monosyllable oh   16.427824277184772
i know you do not like to converse in our language replied the envoy   4.650206038212962
cried my father   16.625965400053015
god has not cursed me then i cried since he permits me to save the life of a human creature in exchange for the life i have taken away   12.524130451653503
is he pleased with you   11.553510899800886
very well to morrow sir   16.81392595780771
why buy what one can take   12.62867515531098
i have its fellow he took his watch from his waistcoat pocket and it cost me 3 000 francs   13.627984124335484
besides i know what travelling is   16.695889519839973
the executioner walked behind them and lord de winter d artagnan porthos and aramis walked behind the executioner   19.04740947678775
the name of edmond s betrothed was mercédès   14.173612788754431
one of our clients is a horsedealer   15.74815124210395
athos played and that as a rule unfortunately   10.063800381067534
the prisoners are escaping   7.323664728455604
but this year continued the horticulturist i ll take care it shall not happen even if i should be forced to sit by the whole night to watch when the strawberries are ripe   15.31306863588166
the french way of living is utterly unknown to me and up to the present time i have followed the eastern customs which are entirely in contrast to the parisian   10.884368736228934
at the corner of the quai they encountered bazin who was running breathlessly   12.866244790533075
d artagnan began by making his most splendid toilet then returned to athos s and according to custom related everything to him   15.752427928009602
and maximilian morrel left the room with the baron de château renaud leaving monte cristo alone with morcerf   15.304036325016838
but four vigorous arms seized him as his feet quitted the bottom of the boat   14.833446097589007
no to the cardinal   10.235217720869898
and my father who you know is a strong minded man himself appeared deeply impressed   16.879610600950734
i may acknowledge this to a daughter whom i know to be philosophical enough to understand my indifference and not to impute it to me as a crime   6.469147775305893
how can you know that   12.923210125797944
de tréville they obtained from him special permission to be absent after the closing of the camp   7.857277981098086
then only d artagnan remembered the languishing glances of kitty her constantly meeting him in the antechamber the corridor or on the stairs those touches of the hand every time she met him and her deep sighs   15.185696483546604
a genuine englishman your eminence   7.224257228986568
if those who remain of the troop persist in coming to the assault we will allow the besiegers to get as far as the ditch and then we will push down upon their heads that strip of wall which keeps its perpendicular by a miracle   16.4438364892003
milady had him one day turned out of doors with sundry blows of a good stick to accelerate his motions   13.958719802751162
alas no monsieur replied the count   12.614780911086697
the enemy s army extended from cassel to courtray   10.790508043832006
she believes in dreams   14.789450945850852
then she is dead   11.840866346592708
that is my grand story of the fair lady and when i relate that i must be very drunk   13.124814051467997
and as the man approached d artagnan in order to have more freedom for his actions leaned half out of the door   13.517578022498448
and it is a rather difficult matter   8.213817425624155
besides added he if the smell of their roast meat tempts you i will go and offer them two of our birds for a slice   13.549409351460616
this amused him sometimes a little and made him endure the siege with patience   10.938740370852976
in the meantime follow debray s example and take a glass of sherry and a biscuit   12.34796528665862
finally the cardinal whose vengeance i have balked   13.087127460978556
but with the hope of soon becoming enemies   14.260576871089636
monsieur olivain a lackey ought never to disobey said d artagnan sternly   19.068301106505164
they soon tired of the sport   13.503914753243128
here is one he said   17.655734408788007
oh he conceals them too little for you not to divine them   13.858615553858181
that s quite as many as we shall want   12.777478029761191
you know it is you alone whom i love   9.011017685808751
and the queen believes well what does the queen believe   7.646311188426298
how long a delay do you wish for   14.785625617859882
in that case let us go said the shipmaster   4.15988649144086
he was to be back on the sixteenth day by eight o clock in the evening   12.39349103900679
in fact the side of the letter opposite the seal was blank   14.79870362761419
well then lend him the twenty francs said the keeper leaning on the other shoulder   15.994924760832678
morrel shuddered as he thought of the conversation of the doctor and m   14.46089922162244
yes replied she trying to recover her self possession   10.758008411553906
be prudent   13.796120919977522
paternal affection   11.490656673823354
20353m the count smiled as if the child bade fair to realize his hopes while madame de villefort reprimanded her son with a gentleness and moderation very far from conveying the least idea of a fault having been committed   17.256829047410463
i see no objection to that   11.530364348001196
edmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim oh my friend my friend speak not thus   9.106726671012833
9 money and sanctity each in a moiety   15.336895437798582
more reason then when he spoke to you for sending him about his business   11.601654198080896
so then he no more knew where aramis was than where athos and porthos were and the affair was becoming a matter of great perplexity when he fancied he heard a pane of glass break in his room window   13.644700989430929
it resulted then from this habit that on the said first monday of april 1625 the citizens on hearing the clamor and seeing neither the red and yellow standard nor the livery of the duc de richelieu rushed toward the hostel of the jolly miller   10.902593477783935
no never   5.016226279942365
when i saw you at your chateau at bragelonne i made certain proposals to you which you perfectly understood   13.441438059143092
the count s features displayed an expression of the most intense curiosity   10.745841061899204
i say that he is ill informed   8.506694062763872
have i by any means displeased you   9.410779366849619
he lifted up the drapery over the entrance to edward s room and his eye reaching as far as madame de villefort s apartment he beheld her extended lifeless on the floor   14.36216686897935
morrel made another step back staggering breathless crushed   12.188124649163116
i love you i   13.86447914397225
my dear fellow replied albert with perfect ease of mind remember for the future napoleon s maxim never awaken me but for bad news   12.869626435824573
this noise acted upon her joy like the storm which awakens the sleeper in the midst of a happy dream   11.057908487318231
yes my lord my mother replied the young man advancing into the room until he was face to face with lord de winter and crossing his arms   15.894560448706907
yes nothing more true   12.872874857949693
yes miserable wretch   13.44218296840296
if so depend on it you will be happy   16.86529916992838
valentine who understood sooner than anyone her grandfather s answer and who had often seen two scars upon his right arm drew back a few steps   16.23714090497296
the night monte cristo waited according to his usual custom until duprez had sung his famous suivez moi   12.613548446995079
he is no longer in my hands replied villefort   8.946563785355341
selim was still at his post and smiled sadly on us as we entered   12.985511658797952
instead of being knocked on the head as you would be if once they caught hold of you he is simply sentenced to be guillotined by which means too the amusements of the day are diversified and there is a spectacle to please every spectator   8.730283985318923
it was time for the jailer was coming   7.869962708006339
that you have ordered a little romance of a satirical nature to be written upon the adventures of amiens with a plan of the gardens in which those adventures took place and portraits of the actors who figured in them   15.57255696541598
shall i see you   12.479346644818271
she reached her hand quickly to her bosom drew out a paper and held it toward athos   7.76916426225003
at ten o clock milady began to appear restless   7.638804877696664
this is an officer s cross   13.144517314227542
i know that such viands pass with difficulty through convent gratings   11.63408725538529
and how do you make your twelve thousand francs   13.431261650873704
it was at the traitor s cross that his journey and his destiny were about to end   11.401434969056313
no country can say it saw my birth   14.456383262825856
misfortune is needed to bring to light the treasures of the human intellect   8.851589688335853
and the cardinal s spies brought bad news from every direction which greatly agitated the minister but was calmly received by the queen   14.827403945736584
milady followed him with her eyes and made a gesture of satisfaction   10.061797345655677
madame du vallon was of doubtful gentility   11.908375229981747
madame wait at the door whilst i shall be at the head of the king s bed ready to die for him   11.19526892615142
only the king who was bored as always but perhaps a little more so in camp than elsewhere resolved to go incognito and spend the festival of st   6.894110530833222
the inspector asked if they had anything else to ask for   10.625756937693055
i must confess to you count said danglars that i have hitherto imagined myself acquainted with the degree of all the great fortunes of europe and still wealth such as yours has been wholly unknown to me   13.901979851792632
planchet watched the flight of flies   12.236857266423975
do you understand master benedetto   13.963510285900535
said maximilian in consternation   13.603159095798764
to your health   7.620990427771225
that is a dream also   9.096493344024447
and he entered the little room in which edward slept   10.43896153446965
she was told that he had left the castle an hour before on horseback   8.84175559149111
at all events it is best that he should follow us to athos s   3.593773528843668
he thought of aramis who without possessing any greater advantages than himself had formerly been the lover of madame de chevreuse who had been to a former court what madame de longueville was in that day   15.697508171441168
monkeys are not found in our woods chained to trees said i   14.264384464419289
if he stays in we will break in the window   10.791726250749184
when this was pressed to effect the opening of the cupboard of which the lock was difficult the person was pricked by this small point and died next day   16.371169771111006
and her mother madame de saint remy have they yet told her of it   11.708561615650286
here at least said athos pointing to the bastion they will not come and disturb us   13.062795697523168
if you die i will die with you   10.586012814088388
and it was remarked that like the king she looked dull and even weary   9.992697818838662
as to you good sir you wear too magnificent a baldric to be strong on that head   11.389054023513332
i was wrong then no i said what you say there is a crisis at hand   8.552445584069698
come now do smile instead of looking at me so solemnly   12.23605907895267
first love is accompanied by such excessive joy that unless the joy be allowed to overflow it will stifle you   11.489731094161225
buckingham saw by the expression of the young man s face what was passing in his mind and he smiled   10.9087667950221
the two friends set to work and crowded the space before the door with all the furniture in the room as not only to make the passage impassable but so to block the door that by no means could it open inward   12.716315842639103
the friends at ease with regard to the future did honor to the repast the remains of which were abandoned to mousqueton bazin planchet and grimaud   8.485734896658888
take care   10.10133235725674
wait your reverence there is a letter   16.219597326550414
and he folded her in his arms   11.746587298869315
danglars is to see mademoiselle eugénie settled   17.09251985691477
he rings   15.95643559512558
maximilian settled himself in his corner without uttering a word   18.14127787242564
he would have preferred an obstinate resistance on the part of the cardinal to this sudden yielding   11.525131254026396
a piece of bread was brought and jacopo offered him the gourd   14.291627810903321
when their hands touched he felt as though he should swoon   14.070948793509551
asked the count with deep emotion   15.578067037690051
indeed said louise i admire you and i could almost say respect you   9.315194533921096
the cardinal drew near to the king and placed in his hand a small casket   11.004429148269038
the horses were also refreshed   13.14482874566561
milady s robe was not the less stained with blood in a second   12.472840960291116
porthos as we have seen had a character exactly opposite to that of athos   15.176100781873211
oh by that by that i was branded indeed   8.81242249322533
d artagnan made a violent effort over himself to keep his face from being too expressive   7.815714235472889
my friend said andrea i have been dining at saint jean aux bois and expected to catch the coach which passes by at midnight but like a fool i have lost my way and have been walking for the last four hours in the forest   17.77901347698229
because all gentlemen are brothers because you are a gentleman because the kings of all countries are the first among gentlemen because the blind populace ungrateful and brutal always takes pleasure in pulling down what is above them   16.40649342286266
i gratify my wishes by two means my will and my money   13.848855607942982
fernand pale and trembling drew back like a traveller at the sight of a serpent and fell into a chair beside him   14.070901162162258
i have a post by which i live   7.696930537970835
ah this letter gives me an idea a capital idea   16.673860058733453
forty thousand cried la carconte   12.922285554195142
well now that all is arranged do not let these newly awakened remembrances be forgotten   13.471818059483152
i hope to see monsieur de chatillon whom i ve hated for a long time there   10.470702670850153
said porthos placing a finger on his lips   13.442978562617935
he was shown in directly   11.09816089754489
i am cold i am hungry   10.756679740270531
ah monsieur said mousqueton then you have come here only to awaken our regrets   11.713165944535698
on one side was the vast wilderness of the saint lazare on the other paris enshrouded in darkness   12.306420352811985
oh i am sure of that   12.45297204571855
then i will go to the governor of algeria   6.625239581344884
monte cristo advanced a few steps which were heard on the gravel   11.183804585253386
as for the other knife it would serve a double purpose and with it one could cut and thrust   10.82709241592866
but i can t be severe with him he is really so bright   13.984482893937702
remember madame if our god forbids falsehood he much more severely condemns suicide   19.97046949700783
i will even ask the count to keep it for my sake   7.434629520757847
he had heard so many utter the same things indeed he heard nothing else   4.20402902538838
half an hour will suffice to apprise them   12.120474591844324
whose will has been thwarted and spirits broken from the age of ten years beneath the iron rod so sternly held over me   14.781787970231157
the vicomte and myself will go and find a priest   10.400981493487414
well said he when franz had concluded what do you find to object to in all you have related   8.588555930601563
then she retired so gently that valentine did not know she had left the room   10.759108406530673
he had no doubt it was the cardinal and his escort   9.70794711278368
yes these noises prove to me indeed that the destiny of favorites is precarious   17.88927878398588
no replied he with an air of triumph which would have puzzled the most clever diviner   10.194350860573495
consequently i have covered it with the veil of respect and hid it in the innermost recesses of my soul   13.243713909695055
and you say that one of your friends lives in that house   16.155209869473495
porthos unbuttoned his sleeve raised his shirt and looked complacently on his strong arm as large as the leg of any ordinary man   14.749826317516195
that will do very well said aramis   15.685521607971072
replied the king betraying some uneasiness   11.70542346124894
henry said charles call me your father   11.474324132319262
do you know my dear fellow why master pastrycooks never work with their hands   15.866980465142131
here excellency said peppino offering him a little blunt knife and a boxwood fork   12.135411329230577
but aramis after having blushed two or three times up to the whites of his eyes at the gross pleasantry of porthos begged his friends not to revert to the subject again declaring that if a single word more was said to him about it he would never again implore his cousins to interfere in such affairs   11.417128518993213
at midnight   11.208712136258175
we can find out his   12.315415011918743
no said aramis but that fellow is a fiend   13.068002898398964
having gained his room he raised his hand to his face and observing that his fingers were covered with the monarch s blood fell down insensible   17.095404121435834
but there was none   11.512166578376405
never answered de guiche   10.28123671170035
on a day of the carnival he had taken a notion to provide an unusual entertainment for that good town of which he was the life and soul   10.396139850421207
is this carriage for us   9.507333706972457
the same period was given to his creditors and the manner in which he intended spending their money   15.758405195186322
let us alight   8.019481440431944
therefore sir if you will agree henceforward we are friends until death   14.096996728397826
this very night   11.59211637210996
he approached her   10.8498592806796
now give me the cardinal up here   9.7060756260794
degenerate world   13.905804792156346
at the moment she entered the curtain of a small gallery which to that time had been closed was drawn and the pale face of the cardinal appeared he being dressed as a spanish cavalier   8.559347392069181
it is more than we need   15.550307753567662
is your name bonacieux   12.21073966852881
but let us first settle the question as to its being the interest of anyone to hinder you from being captain of the pharaon   12.46704867496015
through the opening an arm was passed to find the fastening then a second   14.61910249523941
noirtier raised his eyes to heaven   13.44427318641976
you held her hand you were feeling her pulse and the second fit came on before you had turned towards me   15.874794346594308
pray was not monsieur d artagnan in the time of the cardinal mixed up in some intrigue from which he came out according to report quite cleverly   12.238197096549085
madame danglars had often heard of the terror to which the magistrate alluded but without the evidence of her own eyesight she could never have believed that the sentiment had been carried so far   13.936570842151921
i can hold out no longer for i fear i shall be wanting in strength at the moment when i shall be forced to undergo the struggle and confess my faith   13.959834501190205
well then said athos what are your schemes   11.848541172315079
de villefort who took her arm and led her into the drawing room   6.268636335022198
that is the reason which has induced you to leave via reggio where you have lived since the death of your wife   11.055221643132382
a wax light placed on the mantle piece threw some of its pale rays without and a shadow was seen for one moment on the balcony   10.660682775451262
she will not rest contented beaten   16.214307947593518
yes he checks his pace   6.470249725606161
like all popular movements the shock given by the rush of this mob was formidable   16.39094273869803
he related the manner in which he had become acquainted with valentine and how he had loved her and that valentine in her solitude and her misfortune had accepted the offer of his devotion   17.33995709240275
de tréville accompanied by the four young fellows directed his course toward the louvre   13.869385159821906
one thing alone frightened her   14.98602355226539
when the shot was fired   12.744480274382354
bertuccio you are going to stay in the carriage then   12.032657616888601
d avrigny bounded towards the door flew down the back staircase and almost knocked down madame de villefort in his haste who was herself going down to the kitchen   9.024785238364515
certainly but you make me out better than i am dear count   14.987208231303178
but i feared to disturb you by presenting myself earlier at your apartments   11.406129208700229
must i tell you replied the duke on what i most reckon and what i determine to try first   8.346105367005134
have you anything to do with it   12.061843628774348
what is done is done   5.17640075433657
i set off for france after having fixed upon the plan   16.774607152409125
how will you prove continued the jesuit without allowing him time to speak that we ought to regret the world when we offer ourselves to god   12.967207344645937
that is a large sum   11.847579293332076
emmanuel and his wife conversed with natural astonishment in their little apartment in the rue meslay upon the three successive sudden and most unexpected catastrophes of morcerf danglars and villefort   8.575436991061482
he waited silently striving to pierce through the darkness   11.157284957608857
row   11.166723175108515
i require the proof of a pre engagement   18.07292055699766
bonacieux then became a mousetrap   15.761001527431196
faith it is franz and debray   14.629004722817706
then too when alone i can call forth mighty pictures of the past see vast horizons bounded only by the towering mountains of pindus and olympus   13.81815159365561
oh grace grace pardon   18.49611640719132
oh the good father the brave father the very honest father   11.534182318822296
no sire replied tréville who saw at the first glance how things would go on the contrary they are good creatures as meek as lambs and have but one desire i ll be their warranty   9.512003260428614
it is really wonderful said the count   8.522708466024927
behind him blacker than the sea blacker than the sky rose phantom like the vast stone structure whose projecting crags seemed like arms extended to seize their prey and on the highest rock was a torch lighting two figures   10.218363354603323
the french ladies madame   9.96107595253971
the king s friend you understand   11.141006366811643
i have always served you faithfully cried bertuccio in despair   12.32560717082945
as i have said she was twice married once in france the second time in england   12.6023069718755
is there anything new in the wind   14.471964894374251
then he saw the remains of the bed on which the poor prisoner had died   11.436717547276194
monte cristo pointed out morrel to the young woman who advanced towards him with clasped hands and a smile upon her lips   8.762838495941391
the king attacked in a manner so direct did not know what to answer   15.971085423884432
he ascended into grottos paved with emeralds with panels of rubies and the roof glowing with diamond stalactites   15.162664412908684
three other windows looked into the court and two at the back into the garden   6.191308585305326
carried off   14.105535913322262
yes said porthos but there are the equipments   14.543109737495092
that last order is useless interrupted d artagnan   10.863401337709833
just then the lamp again flickered   14.38624831028957
you are not convinced yet   10.755582673262428
and the prince was pleased with you   14.798574917348049
there is your money the same sum as that you have received already   14.77582358744876
it rests between his conscience and his god   14.006761713462694
someone has vexed you   15.095297357903299
a man bringing a letter from oliver cromwell   17.400325234672327
as an interpreter of the law do honor to your profession by sacrificing your selfish interests to it   13.025756059101912
you are wrong   8.266055162884419
cried he and why does he come   9.19031655661065
and bazin   11.300390080906272
then just as i am arriving at the climax you defeat your own end and seek to make an ordinary man of me   8.932806860089146
but but what   11.96504494049771
yes said grimaud   11.687263826716373
i don t want anybody else to talk to me   7.91655166055108
confiteor   11.045005892057494
do not breathe a word nor make the least sign to me or porthos said d artagnan to athos and aramis that you recognize this man for milady is not dead   13.639581865583413
i will run then till my legs no longer serve till my heart bursts in my bosom but i will arrive before they do   15.125916320663395
cried d artagnan driven to extremities biting his moustache   10.208707118628368
but these thieves stand in far more dread of a policeman than a lord   9.962648055514029
let us go on   7.640450849906412
tréville had grasped the weak side of his master   13.633661654721024
every one nowadays wants auxiliaries   14.615490943814539
monsieur returned the inspector providence has changed this gigantic plan you advocate so warmly   12.783275710823196
and he rendered very important services to your father   9.963230436129852
but you need not fear   7.754483261122117
anne followed him with her eyes and as he withdrew at every step he took a disdainful smile was seen playing then gradually burst upon her lips   13.107269391982932
but i wish he were here that i might tell him that i did not believe him capable of so noble an act   7.29321472548884
it was he who introduced himself to us   8.73046326930329
at these words every sword was drawn and glittered in the air like lightning   8.731434037362733
well dantès you do not thank me   16.266304877515175
but i do not know if it is feeling or the wind that makes me weep   13.567476006236227
do you hear baron   13.49913062023523
but when at last the regiment separated penetrated the heart of the city and placed itself at the extremity of the rue saint christophe near the rue cocatrix in which broussel lived then friquet remembered that he had not had breakfast   9.601823972476977
de villefort received the following note the person called the count of monte cristo is an intimate acquaintance of lord wilmore a rich foreigner who is sometimes seen in paris and who is there at this moment   10.38704683716595
meanwhile come along with us   12.601163350869529
but in a word what are you going to do   8.5764488136344
by turning to the left therefore he would find it   12.998139955322488
during dessert the servant inquired at what time they wished for the carriage   13.738934632463494
d artagnan frowned at him   11.716250899621022
the innkeeper himself was a man of from forty to fifty five years of age tall strong and bony a perfect specimen of the natives of those southern latitudes   9.799957982513229
bertuccio bowed respectfully and turned away sighing heavily   14.87484774366942
my lord understands that there can be no supper unless he is allowed to be present   11.45770670008299
at length the escort passed through paris on the twenty third in the night   13.55189148191311
you have seduced this young girl   10.24403033759821
besides i know not why but he seemed to dislike seeing me   10.301869802669522
charmingly as you see   13.78329214670845
athos examined it and became very pale   13.44761700323356
it ran as follows you know that i was a good mother since it was for my son s sake i became criminal   9.306049053891666
in the midst of her despair a new affliction overtook her   14.83664832761337
that means balls dinners and lawn parties without end in all of which i trust the count will remember us as he may depend upon it we shall him in our own humble entertainments   13.937561591056431
but the captain eager to escape from his false position placed between french and english cruisers like the bat between the mice and the birds was in great haste to regain england and positively refused to obey what he took for a woman s caprice promising his passenger who had been particularly recommended to him by the cardinal to land her if the sea and the french permitted him at one of the ports of brittany either at lorient or brest   14.986449096851398
he brought with him the woman of whom he had spoken the evening before and who had just arrived   12.79175121963394
what would you have proposed maximilian had you found me willing to accede   10.886580624365731
alas he exclaimed how can i restore the happiness i have taken away from these poor innocent creatures   8.183978603558241
was born   14.681452604346891
monsieur is i am sure an honest man   6.178384600005045
the queen s famous diamond answered d artagnan with a sigh   10.748830223471998
it is because you have had faith   15.38127665986946
a little basin was near him and he held a holy water brush in his hand   11.775642795488505
and aramis   13.935603679626343
i think it would be well to sleep here and to start again very early to morrow   10.107853977640843
his nose though large was well proportioned   8.385697295529878
not crush that accursed race   9.388805443116594
the carriage went on and left the two men facing each other   11.778239273342267
and i sign my orders said mazarin taking a piece of paper and writing some lines   8.042067128769695
one may be very comfortable in a convent   9.883657649548663
i dare say it is a pretty one   15.197042802066292
open it instantly sir monk   14.37188923871817
monte cristo watched and saw him approach the valet who drew a small sealed parcel from his pocket containing a newspaper and a letter   9.860490045201932
how does he call himself   11.708023896278924
yes frankly and loyally replied the cardinal in the same tone   11.665313862173736
and has he found consolation   10.338209065275507
come in here monsieur chevalier said she   10.089379234655262
then following the clew that in the hands of the abbé faria had been so skilfully used to guide him through the dædalian labyrinth of probabilities he thought that the cardinal spada anxious not to be watched had entered the creek concealed his little barque followed the line marked by the notches in the rock and at the end of it had buried his treasure   13.825289307557046
i say there for as i did not consider my house safe enough or lawyers sufficiently discreet and as landed property carries evidence with it and moreover since you have no right to possess anything independent of your husband i have kept this sum now your whole fortune in a chest concealed under that closet and for greater security i myself concealed it there   8.206981675799867
when you arrive at the first step of the church of san giacomo be sure to fasten a knot of rose colored ribbons to the shoulder of your harlequin costume in order that you may be recognized   16.930946279110515
i have frequently seen shadows pass close to me approach and disappear   17.6572262559707
at rimini the room of francesca and paolo   15.435503202456276
at the end of this time they had reached the thickest part of the forest   14.893319831043568
alas yes said milady   14.97294821717527
at midnight the two travelers were at dammartin but it was then too late to make inquiries the host of the cygne de la croix had gone to bed   9.24224107704093
mandé to make some inquiries after a servant as i can not possibly do without one   12.376659878683089
the coadjutor has promised   12.885791127504886
but very likely i am on the road to it   1.1587417230032546
try to gain his esteem   4.739757527560797
how do you wish to occupy yourself during tea time   14.690750853059306
how can i know that   13.049229162221422
a bed my lord replied d artagnan   14.047125365636042
ah ah murmured he is dantès then a member of some carbonari society that his protector thus employs the collective form   10.556642729408791
he calls me his dear monsieur said the mercer to himself   13.185052314826436
but that was not all   9.025111636988418
and yet milady at the same time detested and despised this weak fanatic   14.853147244344992
it came without the least resistance   9.172996970103956
the count is a speculator who will certainly ruin himself in experiments   7.152563751692537
said porthos drawing himself up proudly   11.675196110429246
it appeared light and well constructed   12.260639127496294
monte cristo pressed his hands to his forehead   7.095691087233694
indeed you are adorable like that   14.463942171077344
we leave paris tomorrow   12.955392259569676
d artagnan now saw that affairs were growing worse and he beat the guard s march upon the door   12.48366256595788
the road as d artagnan had observed was the way to blois   10.074206342358975
besides the pleasure there is always remorse from the indulgence of our passions and after all what have you men to fear from all this   11.951686079661785
de morcerf is sometimes occupied his business makes him reflective and he might without intending it nothing could be in better taste than my father s demeanor madame said albert   12.418133879178427
his soldiers formed a legion of devil may care fellows perfectly undisciplined toward all but himself   9.217783148462605
you are very happy exclaimed athos laughing in spite of himself at the sally of the irresistible gascon   15.779163705301272
you are very fortunate my friend   13.400360151842383
i thought it looked much the same as usual   14.093067813896402
yes yes but they took part with the princes without apprising us of it   14.178282203352694
d artagnan shook his head and set off at full speed   11.593591241870262
on their way he confiscated the two magnificent beasts which were being sent to us and substituted these horrible animals   10.814178926799908
but for my part before he could reach the good prelate i would kill vitry at once   12.972334089964486
you do not know the italian nobility   15.010294430000023
porthos boasted of the strength of mousqueton who was big enough to thrash four men of ordinary size   8.387991999462203
i am mate of the pharaon belonging to messrs   13.86551668234608
yes yes said the young man yes   11.758270534912937
the game was played in an inclosure called the little court of the chateau a place quite deserted except when monsieur de beaufort was playing   12.791996751334572
exclaimed porthos without supper   12.414980301439885
good all right said a voice almost lost in the distance   7.74411438015257
it was exquisite sir   13.178701313875571
myriads of hoarse cries forming one vast uproar were heard mingled with guns firing   17.779769613734
hush cried valentine suddenly   7.917643630309215
porthos whilst i get up watch the cardinal   13.407977447142066
on the same day the cardinal received this letter the king put his customary question to him   14.875792908705805
the decorations of the boudoir had then been left entirely to madame danglars and lucien debray   16.087110631190548
in that case my brave lieutenant let us leave milady to find out something else and go to supper   9.224323344755447
if all the prisoners followed your example the government would be ruined   5.950474749974212
he was right said luigi   11.364199155111736
now go down said the abbé folding his arms   18.836865057914864
albert instantly rose to meet him but franz remained in a manner spellbound on his chair   11.121797452328654
oh my beautiful sovereign a hundred times thanks   11.123869426958926
barrois asked mademoiselle valentine   12.768564815708235
i tell you that you know these things as well as i do since this gentleman has forewarned you both as a doctor and as a friend   14.918881101692282
cried de winter   10.510648471909942
at ten o clock the vessel cast anchor in the harbor of dover and at half past ten d artagnan placed his foot on english land crying here i am at last   11.570040736534127
but the contract   13.306567974510028
you and i will always consult upon our verdicts   12.188273548103671
i know that is the coin in which you were paid for your poems   9.187740434566157
the story will be very long excellency   16.38770449460578
well then let us talk about it since you desire it replied aramis patiently   12.136446722255391
dead animosities   10.951106902924778
asked milady seizing both his hands and endeavoring to read with her eyes to the bottom of his heart   15.896748807030677
debray reseated himself   13.25256968520768
in paris   14.475798445267507
it was cowardly i confess but it was not criminal   7.779788847288724
d artagnan ate in silence revolving in his mind the most audacious plans   10.088597473478806
two hours passed thus   13.218583851295651
and hold madame suggested comminges who was near a window out of which he could see   13.48958402067532
and that particularly at this period the compatriots of d artagnan had the reputation of not being easily intimidated   3.8539118425881203
my friend said he slowly i wish as the son of an ancient friend for i consider this story of the lost letter perfectly true i wish i say in order to repair the coldness you may have remarked in my reception of you to discover to you the secrets of our policy   8.281402672958537
you know that the english laws are inexorable on the abuse of marriage   13.390147264145465
de chevalier dessessart to admit d artagnan as a cadet in his company of guards   8.767742739829256
the other the physician   10.713334370687877
said he good advice advice of a friend   11.75942151078769
still there but i only speak of him in order that i may introduce the name of another man   12.719672081064534
i will make you another offer   13.80276946871639
oh murmured the young girl   14.454572224000865
you are joking now replied andrea   18.421793947786185
chapter 66   9.570473224264934
he has i believe two hundred thousand francs in morrel s hands and if there be any grounds for apprehension as this is a greater amount than mine you will most probably find him better informed than myself   6.07613840886416
if we had you my friends   9.869377516314085
the valet held a wax light   12.625811863556875
there was a moment of silence   9.31547488434782
heigho   11.53144232746475
sir said villefort striving to struggle against this triple force and his own emotion sir you are deceived   5.659855464513952
cried athos whose vision was still rather obscured by the uncertain shades and demi tints of daybreak   11.651460028265458
another might reply to your eminence that he had his pardon in his pocket   10.83769385251702
officer meanwhile the cardinal looked anxiously for news from england   13.956136981358068
but as he exposed himself like a vagabond or a thief he should have been louis xiii   11.983319303985333
ah this marriage will never take place said beauchamp   15.607061480791792
yes and without violence said louise   10.289583282821148
things passed as on the night before   7.7000878339409455
an officer who saw me with a jealous eye reading the lives of the saints to the mistress of the house entered suddenly and without being announced   14.620119993072286
and through this corridor mazarin passed whenever he wished to visit anne of austria   12.66447044043438
taste of this   18.040364576358918
now hate me if you can   17.525716927684172
so much the better duke so much the better said the king advancing toward the door   10.746546052735074
in the kitchen   12.779857071319247
saddled   12.446514374261012
at this moment the door opened and the young henrietta appeared   8.847466491548936
attracted by his prepossessing appearance he renewed his offers of an engagement to dantès   10.680652593298046
d artagnan walking and soliloquizing had arrived within a few steps of the hôtel d arguillon and in front of that hôtel perceived aramis chatting gaily with three gentlemen   11.995366428175364
one of the persons whose conversation i overheard was the master of the house   11.98645730087708
cried a young voice that made athos start   9.937979632976509
dantès raised his head and saw faria s eyes injected with blood   15.728146126085804
do we breakfast or dine   9.976555769316738
the insult at the banker s door beauchamp stopped morcerf   12.828658894362514
then assisted by bicarat the only one left standing they bore jussac cahusac and one of aramis s adversaries who was only wounded under the porch of the convent   16.80664701674837
to whom then   11.182671105376778
you sustained me powerfully sir and i protest to you that to day i feel very lonely   12.61629933694665
but then he could tell of what complaint the poor marquis had died   13.104253768211406
to join the army under the prince count   10.954695593909307
for you know more than we do   11.4508957866196
anne it may be easily imagined how the relationship between aramis and a seamstress who called the queen her sister amused the young men   11.004620990536552
she asked   12.21447211401242
why how can you manage to do so   9.888770347848052
the number thirteen was always fatal to me   12.62767150176384
de winter remembered the monster that milady had been   12.13974544162531
scarcely had they reached by the rue de la mule the iron gate of the place royale when they perceived three cavaliers d artagnan porthos and planchet the two former wrapped up in their military cloaks under which their swords were hidden and planchet his musket by his side   15.980321951404404
dantès drew back and gazed on the abbé with a sensation almost amounting to terror   16.745668555657033
monseigneur i feared i had incurred disgrace with your eminence   16.164515135930657
in five minutes he will speak   10.504487417826205
franz read these last words in a voice so choked that they were hardly audible and then stopped passing his hand over his eyes as if to dispel a cloud   11.599496311123005
they then determined to depart   13.535417372305773
he was received in triumph as if he came from conquering an enemy and not frenchmen   14.235865074973828
let us visit this one first added he   8.72935973217869
monsieur morrel   14.589840319884123
their three graves were there rising above the ground and a fourth was also there yawning for its ghastly tenant   13.44472308574765
in the meantime as we have said mazarin was in his closet putting his affairs in order   10.981253804518012
he waited ten minutes a quarter of an hour half an hour no change took place   8.133222100910416
stop but it is very strange oh my god my head swims   13.369742692612183
the young man recognized at the same instant the voices of his father and the chevalier d herblay   11.009478197921203
still persisted franz i suppose you will allow that such men as vampa and his band are regular villains who have no other motive than plunder when they seize your person   10.05631163165451
and that is situated   15.39319149150693
i have the honor to inform your majesty continued m   17.654924598904945
the man of superior abilities always finds admirers go where he will   16.161443516089115
and he caused himself to be announced to the minister   8.625599682940901
i mean mercédès that you are thus harsh and cruel with me because you are expecting someone who is thus attired   12.341393475551396
this was quite out of the question especially to a man like andrea perfectly conversant with criminal matters   10.93678373812889
on what was d artagnan thinking that he strayed thus from his path gazing at the stars of heaven and sometimes sighing sometimes smiling   10.464088509799234
said d artagnan whom anger began to take by the hair as minerva takes achilles in the iliad   12.331877920807012
if i strike with the sword or discharge the contents of a pistol at man with whom for three years i have been on terms of intimacy i must at least know why i do so   12.481898287458156
arrest them   12.203284122864407
it was at this moment of discomfort that the inspector s voice called him to the visiting room   18.905147050381572
another rascal like himself perhaps his accomplice   10.152996522640443
the voice became more and more indistinct   10.392866902546421
de villefort and see what this new fancy of your grandfather s is   13.523387907661059
you foolish fellow   10.104751955387144
the cry proceeded from the grotto   12.641733538058503
i have a great mind to return it   12.624992593928525
do you know him aramis   10.730456400644593
at this moment there was a tremendous clap of thunder accompanied by a flash of lightning so vivid that it quite eclipsed the light of the lamp   13.11811186602785
and i of speaking to baron danglars chevalier of the legion of honor and member of the chamber of deputies   9.904676180170366
yes continued the young man   10.928724611554752
it is not natural for letters to enter people s houses in this manner   12.621266162998813
then turning towards monte cristo count said he in the name of all that is dear to you i entreat you not to kill albert   12.309061461044937
which was as we have related that his sword had been in his first conflict broken in two and which he had entirely forgotten   15.53965081815965
but her lips closed again without articulating a word while the color gradually faded from her cheeks   11.456435115668524
go out   13.06363069394075
but if he made allusion to me it was because he is ignorant of the relation in which i stand to you   11.187102099860967
but you say you have watched   14.116091357724768
and you suffer that you wretch   15.154739088378248
but i still trust you will not esteem me the less for it and that is my object beyond all others   13.579976500986444
in england the post was well served   14.563212310389034
well do you not adopt this means athos   14.493130959898824
a plain and simple beggar as i have said my lord who asks for alms as he gives holy water   3.3433253770299753
d artagnan looked at kitty for the second time   15.300069762641598
i know too well the wisdom of the queen and that of her advisers to suppose that they will leave the capital long in trouble that may lead to a revolution   11.5466658877206
de wardes one of the cardinal s men a cousin of rochefort   14.359625705868329
the boat indeed seemed to be animated with almost human intelligence so promptly did it obey the slightest touch   10.345729140023689
and our hopes are thus far the only recompense we have for labors in comparison with which those of hercules were pygmean   15.070988847032694
that s the man my dear fellow   12.464039697039077
in that case exclaimed athos let us not lose an instant but set off   17.856477046385155
on his side buckingham in pretending to maintain the honor of england was moved by interests exactly like those of the cardinal   13.360333346879212
but lose no time   17.091363177013676
go and rest   8.298155936199706
mordaunt bowed with a smile of triumphant ferocity   8.845073446094514
they heard the guard going its rounds   11.002205088548328
you may depend upon it he will repay you by some ill turn   3.864764512296878
perfectly true   7.833232753862074
his feeble eyes endeavored to distinguish objects and behind the bandit he saw a man enveloped in a cloak half lost in the shadow of a stone column   9.596924197489656
had morrel even any suspicions so much kindness would have dispelled them   9.889008648383543
an hour of terror elapsed for every spot they passed showed that they were on the road back   17.90992451557525
mazarin uttered a cry and became paler than the man who had brought the news   16.85118167278793
he aimed a terrible blow at d artagnan who avoided it by springing to one side   9.645299615468165
he attributed it i believe to a political cause   12.459421540125831
so that monsieur watched bassompierre   10.422086312112738
my lord replied haydée i never will leave you for i am sure i could not exist without you   12.51696803492282
my father took me in his arms telling my mother i was dead wrapped me in a napkin marked with an h and an n and carried me into a garden where he buried me alive   12.950836715595688
valentine now requires only the ministrations of the priest   18.61850860010891
at this instant a shudder passes over me as i reflect that possibly i am now standing on the very grave in which lies m   11.990837802758975
men of loyalty are scarce   10.213411791576666
thus dressed she scarcely appeared thirty five years of age   11.570983956315285
and the two young girls began to heap into a trunk all the things they thought they should require   9.477508346734574
i have told you and i repeat it that to night we rescue charles i   12.46297395377581
the lady appears to be about forty years of age the girl about fourteen   10.552312489352378
in sardinian   11.773973126194882
they are worth about fifty thousand pounds   11.029585820959069
dantès dived again and remained a long time beneath the water   16.781355055252615
these were the only words that this proud and violently enamoured woman could utter in response to debray   8.741328579797429
all at once he uttered a terrible cry   15.526894990453652
in the first place there is a little intrigante named bonacieux   12.919469960693398
ah my dear replied d artagnan upon that very horse i came to paris   10.509358125793607
what happened during the night   13.39790257109305
morrel understood it   10.594421723365452
and their captain see   11.041785634075044
it was there he must dig   11.12747744258213
alas alas alas   11.226851794392196
oh how happy you must be in not having either wife or children   16.571084795097676
yes madame replied villefort it is not only projected but arranged   10.42620197155
to make madame in the name of the king and without prejudice to the respect which i have the honor to owe to your majesty a close examination into all your papers   9.403748735467087
i can my lord said raoul   8.538883283926904
d artagnan will not have let slip an opportunity of drinking a glass of this liqueur and at the same time leaving some trace of himself   11.052004449854104
come beauchamp said château renaud i will bet anything you do not believe a word of all you have been telling us   12.940333184378298
as soon as the child perceived the queen he escaped from laporte and ran to meet her   11.90438483783103
well my dear parry said he what is the matter and what can affect you in this manner   11.873696145851445
but said d artagnan it is the queen s diamond   12.875190822956114
nothing makes the future look so bright as surveying it through a glass of chambertin   12.952711745525042
oh i am guilty then   15.34772025231704
franz m   10.569794682832367
he continued to follow the path to the glade   11.458807744222518
de tréville s was as gay and cheerful as possible   16.686742165333214
again the moderate fortune which athos possessed concealed as it was so skillfully seemed to show a regard for appearances and to betray a latent ambition which might be easily aroused   11.284304981339627
the first available cardinal s hat seems to belong already to his noble brow   11.096505175557063
read and answer or i will blow out your brains   14.7267792124209
how he stares at him the insolent dog   14.356461447501028
dessessart and inform him of his promotion   10.606005236645423
my labor is all in vain for i find that the corridor looks into a courtyard filled with soldiers   14.393849731721957
once taken they will be pressed   14.072430762617419
poor madame du vallon   12.26977250266251
at drake s or aaron s one pays twenty five lire for common days and thirty or thirty five lire a day more for sundays and feast days   12.908092202458715
the place royale be it so   13.637763804367232
i have not the honor of knowing madame danglars   15.04378366526302
no it is not finished   15.820055269849629
if you refuse this right you may kill me but i shall not fight   11.433158972688105
a terrible vision chapter xli   7.56720827216884
i shall give him a good dinner he will confide his son to my care i will promise to watch over him i shall let him follow in whatever path his folly may lead him and then i shall have done my part   16.93724005529374
and that mysterious staircase the passage through which not to disturb their sleep the doctor and nurse pass or even the father carrying the sleeping child   10.850113293916525
himself and the two young men represented the body of the army whilst olivain with his rifle upon his knee and his eyes upon the watch protected the rear   11.934475149411144
he led us to the park wall which we climbed over without accident and then we fell in with grimaud   13.985069429416669
and then falling upon the chair nearest the door she burst into a paroxysm of sobs   8.21656488090413
must i leave alone   9.471406138557494
beauchamp s i found madame in tears   14.075257092189446
do you think it possible to rouse that as well as provence   13.092702758343215
this brother was my only friend   14.530340907870203
those that you asked about yesterday   5.469813894310617
though all bowed before her as etiquette required she had now but a single arm on which she could lean   13.021709216413406
well and you said i offended the good god said la carconte with a horrid smile   12.811236552932382
non capisco do not understand was the reply   11.768213129086384
madame resumed athos two of my friends named d artagnan and monsieur du vallon sent to england by the cardinal suddenly disappeared when they set foot on the shores of france   12.727441917803217
i have warned you   11.344432609915577
assunta took care of all and our little fortune increased   15.691334027727429
it is precisely to avoid that necessity that your father was sent for from lucca   10.714830970501442
he was drawing in this circle geometrical lines and seemed as much absorbed in his problem as archimedes was when the soldier of marcellus slew him   10.705135458773153
and he turned around so stern with anger strength and threat that the most excited rebels hustled back on one another in order to escape and some of them even rolled into the seine   11.71340885376099
at me   10.327816840287781
and on what will you sleep   14.022289530469553
do you say so now mercédès   8.92380342905142
the truth is i m very sorry that i did not strangle him as you advised me said porthos   12.563102429565863
really villefort you surprise me   11.720143777421029
dost thou know noisy well   5.830888974419833
she has a fruitful imagination and the second act of the comedy will not delay its steps after the first   14.971786850945936
it has so chanced that i met with a spaniard in my peregrinations who had seen many countries and among them the new world   13.186044384330891
appeared walking fast   15.657321777132507
but after all these arrangements he does not come himself said château renaud   12.363868488224147
and it is not yours   6.176059275257402
don t let it out at the hotel rambouillet   15.91591162919411
d artagnan finding a lantern on the deck took it up and with a pistol in his hand he said to the captain in english come being with the classic english oath the only english words he knew and so saying he descended to the lower deck   15.646638958844935
that s it then and the foolish fellow lost all he had   17.05910507007741
accordingly d artagnan on awaking found his breakfast waiting for him   12.763976641890478
but shall i likewise return worthy of your love   9.46014977699481
he took with him several of his subordinates and amongst them dantès jailer   10.548297731233117
i am doing what is right   11.81644166827124
and if i were a woman and fate had made me a banker s wife whatever might be my confidence in my husband s good fortune still in speculation you know there is great risk   8.760540590615673
it was precisely similar to his sister s apartments except that for the breakfast parlor he had a billiard room where he received his friends   17.0371966794452
and yet in spite of the incertainty which the vapor of three or four bottles of burgundy carries with it to the brain d artagnan when awaking on the following morning had all the words of athos as present to his memory as if they then fell from his mouth they had been so impressed upon his mind   7.445386782987498
albert she asked did you notice that   14.941446403842818
no my lord madame has visitors   13.456356724613224
at that time it was believed that the separation of the musketeers and the guards would be but momentary the king holding his parliament that very day and proposing to set out the day after   6.395270185076827
i leave you bearing a remembrance of you a remembrance of esteem which i hope will not be disagreeable to you when you know me better   6.390298549106864
a man with gray hair had thrown himself from the boat into the river and was swimming vigorously toward the person who was drowning   17.25185092866897
to answer you would be to acknowledge you as my judges and i only acknowledge you as my executioners   9.019471561552201
and advancing alone towards the sentry he said a few words to him in a low tone   12.298193622571661
he is not curious thought d artagnan   8.794492598237511
if we may believe the signs grimaud is making we are about to have to do with a very different number of people   12.358380570771988
both were evidently stimulated by the same impulse   10.0658518038109
exclaimed the queen with a burst of gratitude   15.6598740127872
come come choose your part replied jussac   10.320766576070653
jesus   15.748791101001698
not only was he the elder but he had been presented to the prince by his father   10.86103698971401
no for that very resemblance affrights me   11.714225704166617
but how pale you are   18.72996743024973
a neighboring church clock slowly struck the hour   11.714907013266501
27 guilbert de pixérécourt french dramatist 1773 1844   12.702812049537044
monsieur du vallon your barony is on the back of the duc de beaufort s horse   10.481636788791999
and as i am only a musketeer provisionally i hold it good to be prudent   12.0959721422396
apply to the steward on the first day of every month and you will receive the same sum   17.626728906802274
soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight at the entrance of the cave formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight which had found their way into this gloomy retreat   7.922354405907878
she fell into so deep a reverie that her eyes gradually closed   10.575102423094817
yet replied carlini   12.85165439693067
now let us return to your particular world   12.187884167058181
bah said andrea a little overcome by the solemnity of bertuccio s manner why not   16.83948222320784
then as his eye caught sight of him in the mantle he grasped a floating mass of thickly matted boughs and glided down by their help to within three or four feet of the ground and then leaped lightly on his feet   14.498119632336612
he was told that twenty citizens headed by one man had attacked a carriage which was escorted by a troop of the cardinal s bodyguard   16.084603379402992
it is not usual i say for such privileged and wealthy beings to waste their time in speculations on the state of society in philosophical reveries intended at best to console those whom fate has disinherited from the goods of this world   10.96832109125539

athos aramis and d artagnan surrounded bicarat and required him to surrender   14.375411311666142
but let us embark   8.094385288651711
madame de longueville was persuaded   16.34607487293349
the thoughts of your heart are fully understood by mine   11.09703261263462
to reflect   14.98774816146279
besides they were followed by the curious who hearing of the wager were anxious to know how they would come out of it   13.086543324431764

the slave of the count of monte cristo   15.634061804970383
for on approaching nearer instead of one extended figure the young men discovered two   10.933883731863617
that s a daring rascal whispered the count   12.313218237546852
caderousse looked at him with amazement   15.19843631737627
to do justice to them who had condemned me they kept their word   14.039466743562542
said aramis blushing   6.46882569610716
true sir   14.729762947057859
he knows all   12.093103591163771

luigi vampa s bill of fare chapter 116   16.745797749254525
i am at your orders   11.486746857975863
you were walking one evening in m   10.955881675020022
do you remember aramis that it was here he received that famous bullet wound   15.337718271039492
i will get access to her without her suspecting me and when i catch my beauty i will strangle her   15.042402698913268
no doubt fortune and honors have comforted her   12.370029969484046
but there as he was alighting from his horse at the gate of the jolly miller without anyone host waiter or hostler coming to hold his stirrup or take his horse d artagnan spied though an open window on the ground floor a gentleman well made and of good carriage although of rather a stern countenance talking with two persons who appeared to listen to him with respect   9.788839650129887
i went to your house and they told me you were out but that they expected you home at ten o clock to breakfast   8.306006407438112
so allow me to salute your majesty and to tell you who i am and for what i am come   10.831205576350614
he placed the casket on the table   14.541843437223088
you have only to wait here till i release you   10.683770797568856
exclaimed madame de villefort the punishment monsieur   10.89795639848654
it is as i tell you   13.184965627967838
she then tried to seize the sword with her hands   11.163516770980333
said albert enraged beyond measure at beauchamp s last remark   13.530875094116796
de la trémouille to interrogate him himself   5.46192016511017
do you think they will grant it   10.545168853906228
is he not a singing boy at notre dame   15.178651491274362
i examined the thicket with my dark lantern   8.074978422644453
i believe he has not a franc in his possession   14.320500466685283
athos did not move   15.247401145920273
what do you think of all this   12.383079581719436
said madame de chevreuse say on   12.540821812834464
you asked the name of that young lady   14.987071450541105
but now all is lost   10.80545347405567
the life of the four young men had become fraternal   10.031701851570135
the rest of the troop took to flight   14.364220961836306
you can sign it   11.824860857125236
exclaimed villefort in an agitated tone   16.23406919938384
he is waiting till your majesty is ready   11.546181508067487
nothing at all said groslow   17.521413191287213
who informed you this was the master i propose to you   9.856527992374744
and caderousse began to sing the two last lines of a song very popular at the time tous les méchants sont buveurs d eau   11.273175938972418
asked debray of the sergeant at arms slipping a louis into his hand   12.583349126798286
thither mazarin went in his turn and found the two friends walking up and down   8.318166815514882
that is according to the sense you attach to the question sir   12.703883486189005
on perceiving athos aramis advanced toward him took him by the hand and presented him to scarron   9.247926833065993
oh this time returned aramis i haven t seen her   10.688175676631584
you are going already   10.141749776016669
if any harm come of it it should fall on the guilty person   12.315499253812451
i am just as poor a gascon as when i saw you at meung twenty two years ago you know   7.175482232859662
her name her name   15.572857617524534
each one asked what strange influence had brought them to this house and yet astonished even uneasy though they were they still felt that they would not like to be absent   11.802040867992304
your kind attention in providing for the safety of the baroness by disposing of the horses does not seem to have made the least impression on her   13.261239693008623
for two years i have loved her for two years i have seen written in her heart as in a book all the virtues of a daughter and wife   12.795138768088963
i see you no longer i am dying help me   10.979448580227562
cried porthos who had a great inclination to vent his ill humor on somebody   15.1235748966063
d épinay arrives in paris 30319m my dear grandmother interrupted valentine consider decorum the recent death   13.826603087383347
are you sir the chief of the people who brought me here   17.626763829356925
besides you must have something on the panels of your carriage to escape being searched by the custom house officers   15.382508049765802
so that for the sake of his master he puts us all under his feet and as he thinks we might refuse what he asked for he takes all he wants without asking at all   8.267939175824166
i will give them   14.690836182648415
cucumetto placed his sentinels for the night and the bandits wrapped themselves in their cloaks and lay down before the fire   12.507640969429689
but this is a frightful abuse of power   13.58316284879102
she spoke french with an elegance and a purity that left no doubt on that head   11.779638917478083
he even went so far as to show us the way out   10.042760308949536
as i before said i thought the whole thing was a joke nothing more   14.533414963831074
had already placed his hand on the knob of the door   9.321587470463188
he left four days ago said d artagnan   10.16859629631685
thank god the queen is still of an age to give one   9.485342184612403
on recovering the use of their limbs and tongues they could of course tell nothing but what they knew that they had been seized stripped and bound   14.411659966792637
while he was thus agitated by gloomy uncertainties wretched waking dreams of grief the first rays of morning pierced his windows and shone upon the pale blue paper on which he had just inscribed his justification of providence   15.05511389836952
inquired château renaud   13.63687274062808
i am no acquaintance of m   13.533712744971096
athos remained sitting   14.989582052613455
ah is that you d artagnan and you athos   9.30917914927765
father that woman was a monster   11.51242533803847
the term for which edmond had engaged to serve on board la jeune amélie having expired dantès took leave of the captain who at first tried all his powers of persuasion to induce him to remain as one of the crew but having been told the history of the legacy he ceased to importune him further   15.771927197400428
it is indeed a favor young man replied m   14.668616784968702
it is true that my patrimony will go to endow charitable institutions and my father will have deprived me of my lawful inheritance without any reason for doing so but i shall have the satisfaction of knowing that i have acted like a man of sense and feeling   15.590753042333088
true monsieur said mousqueton   10.56954392814379
oh no monsieur   9.463175154550912
de nargonne had married m   14.062496853918615
thou hast prospered and grown stout   10.733415587868805
consequently the odd names of their adversaries were for them not only a matter of surprise but of annoyance   8.345179703376855
no excellency returned bertuccio   11.120251891484788
what shall i say to them by way of inducement to serve your eminence   12.59360378418596
however i shall have no occasion to work for the little sum of money buried by you and which i found in the place you mentioned will be sufficient to maintain me   13.383465542863522
monte cristo returned to his bedroom and glancing rapidly from the garden to the street he saw first caderousse who after walking to the end of the garden fixed his ladder against the wall at a different part from where he came in   6.136470713445452
for pity s sake said the executioner extending his arms   10.469575679694525
i thought it was for something else   13.720338412341766
at the end of a quarter of an hour m   12.119829749481982
there is your jussac thrust paid for   11.293041861376196
as d artagnan had presumed on receiving his letter milady in a delirium of joy had told her servant everything   10.262475814397755
however scarcely was the imperial power established that is scarcely had the emperor re entered the tuileries and begun to issue orders from the closet into which we have introduced our readers he found on the table there louis xviii   13.139877616057703
it followed that d artagnan who was as yet purely and simply in the guards found himself for the time at least separated from his good friends athos porthos and aramis   12.515429142709724
said morrel as he went away may your new master love you as i loved you and be more fortunate than i have been   13.100662004473376
taste this cutlet my dear d artagnan   13.059350205381257
you can suppose porthos that what i have to say relates to most important matters   15.669811436998277
comminges was near the queen who was questioning him upon the details of his expedition and every one was listening to his account when d artagnan and porthos were perceived at the door behind the cardinal   9.792453480734425
then put me to the proof   12.262258932646734
be so good as to give me up your sword count   11.534904721712108
i confess i had my fears in the state in which politics then were and i held my tongue   13.914900360958342
a moment after caderousse s face appeared at the grating in the door   11.784623615942621
hold your tongue and take it   11.349776404771285
this will teach you said d artagnan to treat the guests god sends you in a more courteous fashion   8.702559346989386
he had refrained from talking of the treasure which had brought upon the abbé the accusation of madness   8.469064122939242
you are right my love   11.577456908070022
what will it signify if one two or three more are added   12.794463971435876
the young man bent low with an expression of sorrow and gratitude mingled and retired in order to saddle his horse   10.539550235210973
the one was a little billet genteelly folded with a pretty seal in green wax on which was impressed a dove bearing a green branch   11.417282420700639
but methinks i need wine   17.671922799937448
i beg you to understand sir i will go no farther unless you tell me whither you are taking me   6.287487347064272
de morcerf affect me   16.192078275691998
said the jailer   16.674109316450043
noirtier resumed m   17.014875782897256
and you have chosen the path strewed with flowers   10.366508167926396
dead or desperately wounded as i left without having been able to hear anything of him   14.372236243402462
i will assist your memory madame continued the count   10.869175750506377
i am always curious to see the downfall of your honor s enemies and he was not among the least of them   11.708878149604349
i inquired immediately on my return to paris   14.260140011005022
i understand said the child with that jeering smile which marks especially the gamin de paris   14.69265799602776
will you not give it sire   14.095386848812044
it was caesar s commentaries which la ramee had lent him contrary to the orders of the governor   15.381268017887738
this short interval was sufficient to determine d artagnan on the part he was to take   13.263164079151615
ideas do not become extinct sire   12.795783799747333
have you not read in my eyes that there is nothing but devotion and sympathy in my heart   9.037489630917356
one paragraph spoke of the return of bonaparte and promised another letter and further details on the arrival of the pharaon belonging to the shipbuilder morrel of marseilles whose captain was entirely devoted to the emperor   9.917910224460883
dantès made no reply   16.746939789759374
if you happen to have any debtors make them pay you or any creditors don t pay them   15.945358154493317
d épinay was quite a child when his father died he knows very little of m   9.123893585695924
if you heard the cry of mad dog   10.347966273396446
and i have none   10.294822332565992
but at the moment he prepared to proceed to his chamber his friend entered the room in perfect costume for the day   12.907152104663032
athos and aramis followed him   13.02689622391434
alas said she i did all for the best   15.009159512566342
fine counsel indeed   13.21187048629848
tis the same thing you understand me d artagnan a court   12.573435644534122
has it not been agreed that i should take you with me and did i not tell you yesterday to prepare for departure   16.34963823185572
here s a sword and a dress said porthos   14.018633468871078
ah replied he guessing franz s thought i know this is a serious matter   16.14643553920194
and as there could be no doubt but that the queen was leaving paris full of terrible projects of vengeance every one had warned parents and friends of what was about to transpire   14.007061198931432
for the count must be furious   11.897117706247347
withdraw young man cried jussac who doubtless by his gestures and the expression of his countenance had guessed d artagnan s design   10.157324377785816
and the popular party could with difficulty accord him favors so entirely royal   17.21531522466092
poor maximilian   12.985604673190275
one evening as i was looking over the wall i saw a young and handsome woman who was walking alone in that garden which was not overlooked by any windows and i guessed that she was awaiting m   13.431819899394633
be sure of that   12.379908242235455
are you then pressed for this money   10.058736046572315
for you know if a wound in the head does not kill at once it is cured in a week   11.902859771871402
oh he laughed and in that singular manner so peculiar to himself half malicious half ferocious   13.225475531142044
by a chance which added yet more to the intensity of the darkness the moon which was on the wane did not rise until eleven o clock and the streets which the young man traversed were plunged in the deepest obscurity   11.930002612502244
if you make a single step to find her you are lost   12.321740053887531
empty   9.855234067211079
but do not breathe to a living soul sir the rendezvous which i give you   11.049401692606398
the host fearful of consequences with the help of his servants carried the wounded man into the kitchen where some trifling attentions were bestowed upon him   12.279889951837442
very true said d artagnan fixing his eyes in spite of himself on the queen s diamond which mazarin wore on his finger   16.474331670761543
well listen said valentine throwing herself on her knees and putting her arm round her grandfather s neck i am vexed too for i do not love m   11.51001166627735
i say that it is probable that things have fallen out so but i will not swear to it sire   10.034688022042445
yes efficacious grace has touched you as that gentleman said just now   11.727095478886035
cried kitty and i am very wretched   13.661895265607265
hey   14.137930452022918
only till the queen has given an heir to the crown of france   14.015231237162517
you are the inspector of prisons   17.706030094554315
de monte cristo did not make his proposal for you   11.193679877427957
that s true said kitty   7.4719427311112465
all his emotion then burst forth   12.442441099552157
through what medium   13.605528344400613
on no account speak to her of henry iv   11.712191184292713
albert glanced carelessly at the different missives selected two written in a small and delicate hand and enclosed in scented envelopes opened them and perused their contents with some attention   12.279607673086646
then you no longer love me   10.000843063466448
the young man is better said danglars   14.74226478788824
0107m chapter 8   6.811602667824097
cried mercédès stretching out her arms to him from the balcony   8.785932936442324
so that since i have been in prison a very slight effort of memory has enabled me to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open before me   5.9997337616776605
said athos it was hardly worth while to distribute ourselves for twenty fellows armed with pickaxes mattocks and shovels   8.108705853763919
she gradually approached the invalid and said then doubtless dear m   14.913645789192234
this was d artagnan s mount   13.403488100245417
but you have broken all the bottles   9.177258998350487
that two hours after the messenger has set out all the capuchins all the police all the black caps of the cardinal will know your letter by heart and you and your clever person will be arrested   8.683128586404715
was he in the wars   15.78961445520766
de villefort s answered morrel but i was of madame de saint méran   10.415428245654354
de la trémouille approached him and made him inhale some salts which recalled him to life   13.192890084971628
that was all   6.528665573043602
in reality replied the latter who with his aristocratic glance and his knowledge of the world had penetrated at once all that was penetrable in monte cristo albert has not deceived us for the count is a most singular being   9.163111767049338
we therefore represent six fighting men   8.018398084270501
let them hold themselves in readiness to march to night   13.947172884775714
leave me i command you   14.017646419501459
it was mousqueton   10.11325661869468
must i use any password to procure a horse   5.3522836791262725
hardly had the police officer observed comminges at the end of the rue cocatrix when he said one word to the coachman who at once put his vehicle into motion and drove up before broussel s door   8.781262293097562
why what good would it do   16.286224512580993
the cardinal interrupted mazarin was a great politician and therein shone his vast superiority over me   10.913872769640077
they halted for a minute during which he strove to collect his thoughts   9.199814719305408
ideology chapter 49   13.705133755549593
as for me i will give my last sou for it   11.13188924870519
diavolaccio seeing himself thus favored by fortune burst into a loud laugh   16.60375609533499
how hot you look my good barrois said valentine   3.5748474110205386
order my lord he said   9.108191575507336
friends my lord   15.710608964578928
but he could not succeed   9.886533835581842
give me your horse porthos   9.888763929294795
cried the host in the most pitiable voice imaginable   6.612280732693013
but to this hireling valentine only appeared to sleep   8.88301264817224
scendi   14.64829882409271
but none the less he conceived for the officer under whose orders he had for the moment placed himself that consideration which even prudence pays to careless courage   11.043379488014086
to her and to you   11.574340615213298
what does scandal signify to me   12.116173450221067
i confess i am accustomed to priests of a very different appearance   14.90217900893099
ready money is needful for the present time and we must learn how to make sacrifices   11.67399416240761
do you not see that the wind has blown off my hat   10.588950622837876

ten minutes afterwards the surgeon and the procureur arrived the one accompanied by the porter the other by ali and were received by the abbé busoni who was praying by the side of the corpse   12.616007929936876
because you remain eternally encircled in a round of general conditions and have never dared to raise your wings into those upper spheres which god has peopled with invisible or exceptional beings   4.926175053904672
no indeed i am calm said morrel giving his hand to the count   14.483422112867395
good thought gondy she is going to yield   11.056074021220114
it was therefore necessary before everything else and at all risks that i should cause all traces of the past to disappear that i should destroy every material vestige   10.80045239783542
in the midst of all the strange events which had crowded one on the other an indefinable sentiment of dread had taken possession of valentine s mind   11.765419574420878
i don t conceal this from you   10.081348713866365
who and what is this man   11.432312469370626
de blacas had duly forwarded the brevet   16.375249588330135
but he wrote the name of buckingham on a piece of paper and everyone pointed out to him the way to the duke s hôtel   13.806327047418879
d artagnan ran out and returned directly after   12.890960314004449
who can say whether d artagnan may not have betrayed us to the cardinal   11.730549849052508
he went and resumed his post beginning to be rather uneasy at this silence and this solitude   18.84486259882175
and wherefore fire   12.313359398714052
the major passed his hand across his brow   13.846218076481174
asked tréville quietly   16.199547403039354
you are pale   15.017437795194208
these were pistols of an especial pattern which monte cristo had had made for target practice in his own room   11.40959009984627
you were among the first who tasted any of my dishes and i think you relished them tolerably   14.620367546994174
inquired the notary   17.672425496286653
you have no sister no son no father   10.5548854578241
mazarin bent low before her   13.485301983249094
it was to that obedience i owe her portrait   9.601936153533579
you pretend to pardon me and you poison me   6.904495503743462
0059m when one thinks said caderousse letting his hand drop on the paper there is here wherewithal to kill a man more sure than if we waited at the corner of a wood to assassinate him   14.353252696691133
monsieur d arminges who was at the door perceived his hesitation   11.73362198547381
go then take what guards you find here and pursue him   11.181422189984747
the count made a sign to albert and they bowed to the ladies and took their leave albert perfectly indifferent to mademoiselle danglars contempt monte cristo reiterating his advice to madame danglars on the prudence a banker s wife should exercise in providing for the future   9.899273117092587
go to him with this letter and make him your model in order that you may do as he has done   11.48129716357766
but without even giving himself the trouble to enter into any discussion with me he took one of his pistols laid it on his table day and night and said that at the first word that should be spoken to him about removing either within the house or out of it he would blow out the brains of the person who should be so imprudent as to meddle with a matter which only concerned himself   10.337656143034998
two men how do you mean   16.059972703441762
said she to her brother   9.172598923505683
and one day after dinner he went to bed calling out that he had pains in his stomach and that mazarin had poisoned him   9.061196069351958
and immediately put spur to horse which set off along the rue saint honore with the speed of the whirlwind   12.914790097307842
it was a chestnut that the king had ridden for three years and of which he was very fond   5.8328116943841515
he led the enterprise   13.823486560136182
you know i hate moralizing except when it is done by athos   9.20334925887813
why did you deprive yourself of the merit of doing so at once   11.646374102003854
and dantès required but a short trial of his beautiful craft to acknowledge that the genoese had not without reason attained their high reputation in the art of shipbuilding   9.454316813788216
now then said cucumetto advancing towards the other bandits are you coming   13.455828328801815
there is but one   13.18205499291321
edmond gazed very earnestly at the mass of rocks which gave out all the variety of twilight colors from the brightest pink to the deepest blue   11.398963883516922
cried d artagnan quite stunned by the relation of this horrible adventure   15.660821585210513
when the landlady made her appearance she expressed much astonishment at seeing planchet   12.817157546894562
i was delighted to see you again and forgot for the moment that all happiness is fleeting   6.859921762874924
replied mordaunt in a tone of deep despair my penitence is sincere   7.298864395149053
they were parting to meet again when it pleased god and if it pleased god   13.621712507637342
and they both set forward as fast as they could toward the country house of the worthy functionary   19.58709172972615
germain presented itself to the mind of the presumptuous gascon   14.960880134107065
you can take it away when you bring me my breakfast   5.517231407717457
i shall complain to m   14.161160620722907
i will i swear to you   12.319953920129262
in his regiment maximilian morrel was noted for his rigid observance not only of the obligations imposed on a soldier but also of the duties of a man   15.446037276541098
i was inspector general of the pasha s troops replied morcerf   10.725033623964135
de tréville on turning round found himself alone with the young man   12.648521482883805
he crept from his hole and stood hidden by the black drapery beneath the scaffold   10.770273052812696
said the young girl sorrowfully   14.615474138065709
after dinner morrel usually went out and used to take his coffee at the club of the phocéens and read the semaphore   10.791136680707112
we must let them leave the village and ride after us on the northern road and when they have passed we will take the opposite direction   10.222425727722758
cried olivain   10.816663812756012
but just stretch out your hand   14.549076649220378
the young man drew from his pocket a second letter presented it to the cardinal and took his seat   13.315281532993527
cavalcanti his presence soon produced its usual effect and it was with smiles that the baroness received the count although she had been a little disconcerted at the announcement of his name   13.923970288145883
he credited this woman who appeared to him the equal of a demon with agents as supernatural as herself   15.990554144489487
de villefort replied the doctor with a tone which redoubled the terror of the young man i have not led you here to console you   12.732213086903037
on entering the room noirtier s eyes met those of the abbé and no doubt he read some particular expression in them for he remained in the room   18.50967640935135
an hour afterward rochefort set out at a grand gallop   13.305306721114153
i am ready to speak my lord   12.022616022729922
the poorly fastened boards which alone divided me from it yielded to my efforts and i found myself in the house   12.101651186820868
you are tempting me you make me doubt the goodness of providence it is impossible it can not be   15.308620192025781
d artagnan inquired of everyone he met with went down to the ferry came up again by the rue de seine and the red cross   13.0449568151037
don t be in haste to celebrate a victory porthos interposed d artagnan   12.940532785098801
he profited by this distraction to slip away among the crowd without even thanking the worthy priests who accompanied him   9.051208496019182
for as soon as i leave this place i will tell everything   7.590433755705427
so my dear bazin   13.101640375968797
yes said athos magnificent   12.662190734658296
lend me your back but don t let the cardinal go   6.65481235459174
cried bonacieux   14.768585006514977
he is most likely at my hôtel   11.35349859444253
de villefort he said will you conduct the baroness danglars   9.1052270787144
that is it my son   16.75620404702081
notwithstanding all his inquiries respecting mme   16.995092948208537
de saint méran repeated the doctor then madame de saint méran a double fortune to inherit   7.513569652861147
said d artagnan wishing to have the air in the eyes of the citizen of being posted as to court affairs   11.043031354330243
father father in heaven s name exclaimed the young man what are these weapons for   14.51267180048997
what next   11.711019099003138
have you not mentioned that name to me   17.599729782299626
i knew that said monte cristo   12.631940774206987
and how is he connected with the question you asked me   12.918713850715077
in the first place that unfortunately your husband is a simpleton and a fool   13.51087310526301
the count frowned apparently in gloomy hesitation   13.943896046864637
middling   10.927564963689385
athos asked of him in english   9.768968224860059
you are prudent which is still better   14.580508243745447
we expect it   13.568263009614109
we have our clothes some more splendid than others this is our credit   13.492094294561559
your affair has become more complicated since yesterday evening my good man and i advise you to tell the whole truth   11.270243133548348
i had but one gerfalcon and he died day before yesterday   16.088148108735982
your husband then is at last dead   16.312582868230464
but that can not apply to the time previous to our acquaintance valentine   10.879107992888512
but allow me to say there is great danger in what you undertake   6.390346973814449
why don t we go in with them   14.471394890133762
i must return to my post   14.789381800150023
monte cristo took albert into his study and pointing to a seat placed another for himself   14.625832608220705
after having lost my own horse nine against ten see how near i formed an idea of staking yours   16.933423172501428
my love for you   12.0433609271482
if you deprive me of that take away my life also   9.571310333904469
because we want to know said de guiche haughtily   9.330794534673917
then the count brought the taper to the window that it might be seen in the champs élysées that a man was getting out of the window while another held a light   12.13534910705707
exclaimed a general burst of voices   9.118105561992909
how many shots   12.9914913038291
then i can well understand your indignation my dear albert   13.370571311355677
i shall do the same   14.157267256283559
but as the prisoner is a woman after all i wish to pay her the attention that every man of gentle birth owes to a woman if not on her account at least on my own   12.132523753026167
and he shouted with laughter   17.736293824196512
the coachman received his master s orders and drove down the via del babuino   12.304834538833532
bonacieux where art thou   9.922296793063012
the baroness had been tolerably composed until the name of villefort had been pronounced   14.359724899898069
it seemed to him a dream   17.749653433283804
what consoles me said the cardinal after reading the letter is that at least in this chase d artagnan has done me one good turn he has destroyed broussel   12.097551645067325
the sound of heavy steps was heard above his head   8.427968761375379
never have i seen you look so young so beautiful   12.681187851412593
the groom cried aloud for help   15.456147624924835
nevertheless bonacieux manifested real joy and advanced toward his wife with open arms   14.953010597495712
he wished to hasten their steps   13.889145002256289
de guise had who so nearly became king of france and whose cousin was emperor of germany   10.716020423821757
once more danglars bit his lips   11.20066243103155
the queen will never banish me and even were i obliged to yield to the populace she would yield with me   13.73598495475593
his parents are unknown   10.816557302120795
and the procureur again becoming a man lifted up his eyes and groaned   10.526795155082542
that s nothing new   11.53655763499415
for you alone   5.575428340655963
it is sublime   14.161620295046253
one funeral is generally very much like another in this magnificent metropolis   13.525791494457732
it is not courage that is needed   8.237679780831689
all we have hitherto done in the matter has been child s play   15.316946769287014
don t allow anybody except one person to enter here   11.662329376943099
the old man looked at her with that stern and forbidding expression with which he was accustomed to receive her   14.977173917696188
for upon my honor you will kill me with your indifference   14.666230999718882
i am at home to nobody said milady   13.056277305697337
we have before stated that all the servants had fled   9.96703067472796
bonacieux to take twenty steps ahead and then followed them ready to execute the instructions of the noble and elegant minister of charles i   13.482123152046867
if i only were a a baron don t you mean   1.0047814451575814
and there the king and his minister took leave of each other with great demonstrations of friendship   15.453403077435347
this was followed by rather an awkward silence   7.6160631365761775
laporte entered   10.67804463477992
and here is danglars who is a wide awake clever deep fellow who will prove to you that you are wrong   12.49771402496353
occasionally however a deep flush would overspread his countenance and a nervous contraction distort his features while with an agitated and restless gaze he would glance in the direction of marseilles like one who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event   11.768217465628181
morrel to be admitted   12.501964069714582
you see said she when the lackey had gone out everything is ready   16.48161547211066
he saw la ramee twirling his thumbs ten feet from him and his guards laughing and drinking in the ante chamber   9.012140026616617
that you are to be at no   14.092501429130234
he couldn t understand visits of ceremony made under arms   13.788762489081904
at ten o clock every one was in his appointed position   15.446592358290603
i rely much on external impressions   11.766219241067922
every one madame   10.124815903336792
thanks my brave lover   15.507061927413027
in fact said athos this delay is not natural   8.230295655484785
de villefort so that no one could reach the sick room excepting through that of madame de villefort and little edward   11.097379218401258
a very respectable lady said aramis   9.512978763480444
he threw himself at the feet of cromwell and in spite of the efforts of the puritan general who did not like this almost kingly homage he took his hand and kissed it   9.453666826992155
the sailor departed without reply   7.037215665324864
at this moment a shot was fired and a ball passed through the hat of comminges and broke the arm of one of the guards   16.98791187063633
had stolen away this child in order that your name might become extinct   13.334465309032327
charles smiled   10.293698207636062
andrea cavalcanti a murderer a galley slave escaped a convict   10.241949355251212
said the pilot in bad french   14.765964789948962
there is another method said aramis   13.547992859309563
at others relating to him the history of nations and great men who from time to time have risen to fame and trodden the path of glory   12.9096155617643
the king turned upon his heel without reply and almost at the same instant the captain of the guards m   5.590601952740718
comminges knocked at the door at the same moment and friquet was waiting behind comminges until the door should be opened   11.946608377971351
madeleine was the daughter of m   12.145580177877928
when i am in the pulpit if by chance a pretty woman looks at me i look at her again if she smiles i smile too   12.547956678855245
and be my witness that i have done all that human power could do   14.778998508041951
and he thought that this was the moment for expressing the desire which he was not going to have made until the evening before the fête   5.80852604451885
and wherefore were you called away just now   15.780243345428772
there he found everything arranged in due order the accusation examination morrel s petition m   11.29009497171833
i am going to scold you   13.198892660259572
there was a moment of silence which proved that the cardinal was employed in seeking the terms in which he should write the note or else in writing it   12.805228364154162
they deposited the supposed corpse on the bier   12.031987084668065
but in spite of himself his eyes were directed to that door which kitty said led to milady s chamber   13.343001942730666
it is in my arms and shoulders answered porthos with gratified naivete   7.2822971356187844
i had the money with me   13.923191982052371
anne trembling with anger and scarlet with humiliation left the room shutting the door violently after her   17.635254275496802
we shall soon succeed in sending him to join his boon companions   16.003909496652643
bonacieux and a convent was not impregnable   14.324447935424336
but morrel albert is your friend   14.203331143340495
the door was opened and the young men eagerly alighting found themselves opposite a cicerone who appeared to have sprung up from the ground so unexpected was his appearance   10.794750327101783
that s where we are   13.448613937877806
nay madame the law is frequently powerless to effect this   13.833863625625778
you may behave politely to the bearer who is a count and a grandee of spain   9.520141997523076
can you mean it valentine   14.29929191953656
the queen smiled but instead of answering see de winter she said i have at least gained one thing in being only half a queen   8.811464612333333
de saint méran and that no less surprising of the countess   10.950759432321112
well what have i learned since   9.631884945871214
i went to work   10.131762072756164
dear mother interposed renée you know very well it was agreed that all these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside   12.290968800623155
he calls that a language   10.41384972104855
the witnesses thought he was dead but his adversary who knew he had not struck him offered him the assistance of his hand to rise   11.97267137718639
some one must go for help said a lad who could not comprehend that this little man should make a stand against that other man who was so large   19.052144595888045
monsieur de chavigny the governor of vincennes waited upon the duke to request that he would amuse himself in some other way or that at all events if he drew likenesses he would not put mottoes underneath them   16.375729620128332
i shall strangle you both if you don t get out said porthos at last seizing mousqueton by the throat   13.579691209652786
he was pale but calm and collected and saluting his judge with easy politeness looked round for a seat as if he had been in m   9.999109448795561
and since when have you become afraid of a quarrel   13.277014607557872
au revoir not farewell   15.27285160627492
perhaps you would prefer being alone   14.667574418703426
and in virtue of that compact put to flight the police who had arrested your wife and has placed her beyond reach   9.501792245589176
indeed cried eugénie you are very pale   15.068663509281272
i will not admit that word returned the young man   14.717025033013044
rochefort knew well the tones of that soft voice in which sounded sometimes a sort of gentle lisp like the hissing of young vipers   12.639498726638699
the comte de la fere will not do you the honor of fighting with you   12.693859580752054

everything degenerates   15.045902575758195
planchet shook his head and said nothing   11.67045802821535
don t be uneasy on that score replied villefort   16.21595178361802
no for i think he never liked me since the day when i was silly enough after a little quarrel we had to propose to him to stop for ten minutes at the island of monte cristo to settle the dispute a proposition which i was wrong to suggest and he quite right to refuse   11.425851684796863
i am stricken by fate   8.961613466502692

this point of union was noirtier and it was he who had just sent for morrel with the request that the latter would lose no time in coming to him a command which morrel obeyed to the letter to the great discomfiture of barrois   10.896515419522103
as for villefort instead of sending to paris he carefully preserved the petition that so fearfully compromised dantès in the hopes of an event that seemed not unlikely that is a second restoration   11.700430442368413
and having first married his banker s daughter who left him a widower he has married a second time a widow a madame de nargonne daughter of m   9.575105835095323

i still had a loaded pistol and you were in full fight sword in hand   9.731452538158408
gracious heaven exclaimed he   7.015615489658868
d artagnan took his hat examined the hole made by the ball and shook his head   8.830960241307256
edmond listened intently   6.930152297467483
but it was not upon corsica the very houses of which he could distinguish   12.44987490123381

from congo if you will   14.883524103159926
but unless i am much mistaken there will be a storm in that quarter   12.777762484796394
arrived near a clump of trees he stopped   11.591620277616236
at least i advised him to do so   16.820434942140945
we need no proofs   9.826901244735257
i think him capable of everything   17.651570290633884
and he read the paragraph for the third time laying a stress on each word as he proceeded   11.672249844800403
then you know what i have suffered said mme   12.295753202175028
what is he doing   8.632187808294432
said monte cristo and i have forgotten my smelling bottle   12.108240795861347
it is my intention so to do   8.089663863801956
oh mon dieu it is a matter of the greatest urgency to find them out said the queen since you think these worthy gentlemen might be so useful to the king   11.988452122850681
oh that depends upon circumstances   11.309052050115854
pray let that napkin be sent to me   13.31359520458938
he is a subtle conscienceless italian who though he very likely dreams of crime dares not commit it   15.347198202087194
yet thither it was that dantès guided his vessel and at monte cristo he arrived at the close of the second day   13.116239487999604
is this the decanter you spoke of   9.889054241414943
true said he and i have some questions sufficiently serious to put to you   9.341839087256435
the two parties would then be equal   10.266639108111388
you were in the south of france i think   16.97650856981946
and what message shall i convey to the baroness   11.049352901025344
i have none nor have i ever possessed any   11.281407008089314
for mine was broken at the first parry   10.770153914595419
thinking that i might wish to settle in france he left me at his departure together with the papers establishing my identity a letter promising if he approved of my choice 150 000 livres per annum from the day i was married   9.458251039476842
zounds i thought as much when the wretch kept moving around the room   11.866205164432728
no god forbid said the cardinal   12.517800161860217
i dare say it is the doctor grandpapa   8.321419573908328
she was seated   7.1648842715633645
and you did not show any favor it was your duty   7.820366533328991
but swear that you will not strike me as i go down   13.959649592562663
athos shook his dead doubtfully   14.81552663129887

said the general   13.148488173534057
the only thing i recollect is that i awoke in bed in a round chamber the furniture of which was sumptuous and into which light only penetrated by an opening in the ceiling   9.40398597596845
we have no litmus paper but see here they come with the syrup of violets   9.532092060658572
cried mademoiselle d armilly taking the bell from her companion s hand and ringing it yet more violently   9.961389095396918
i do not accuse them sire   13.85185204314164
mounted on an excellent horse which he was to leave at the end of twenty leagues in order to take the post planchet set off at a gallop his spirits a little depressed by the triple promise made him by the musketeers but otherwise as light hearted as possible   11.895054650146406
anne of austria started   7.866684718808099
fernand was a spaniard and being sent to spain to ascertain the feeling of his fellow countrymen found danglars there got on very intimate terms with him won over the support of the royalists at the capital and in the provinces received promises and made pledges on his own part guided his regiment by paths known to himself alone through the mountain gorges which were held by the royalists and in fact rendered such services in this brief campaign that after the taking of trocadero he was made colonel and received the title of count and the cross of an officer of the legion of honor   18.48880841237216
asked athos quietly   10.612763865718186
the brigadier had a moment s hope   8.78118531373854
two hours passed away   13.912725471405679
undoubtedly said villefort moderating the tones of his voice a marriage once concerted and then broken off throws a sort of discredit on a young lady   10.52855072189002
did you not say so just now   9.601350847761582
but to return to what we were saying   13.731100679495336
well said beauchamp let them now say that drama is unnatural   12.373807118583022
he had passed and re passed his island of monte cristo twenty times but not once had he found an opportunity of landing there   14.021864647179468
you know you may say anything to me   10.093885244062502
he had grasped the hand of valentine and unable to weep vented his agony in groans as he bit the sheets   11.890708750155527
i do not at all wonder at it one can not think of everything   10.724768858882832
grimaud leaped down   6.909257001458414
i answer for his consent   12.1764639028535
ali drew himself up proudly and then returned a sign in the affirmative   9.093554224636133
de villefort said monte cristo fixing his eyes on madame de villefort   12.371703164550135
war has broken out in flanders   9.9790096133251
that was the principal thing   7.61793274346548
this young man terrifies me my lord   13.952938736134449
different in your fate from us you will have a king without a minister whom you may serve love respect   11.020774469453352
the widows and orphans depute me to receive alms to the amount of five millions from you   13.273445813755938
milady smiled with a strange smile   12.217624855147482
as to myself i shall go around to see athos   5.934852569296569
two months said he   10.239908328627298
he soon arranged a prompt and certain manner of traveling by sending relays of horses to chantilly so that he might be in paris in five or six hours   14.311555630955304
cried d artagnan to the man with the scythe taking one of the pistols up by the muzzle and preparing to strike with the handle   10.56568427903438
it will then be said of me that i died for the king   15.213905524755347
about two hundred persons had accompanied her in her flight   17.54168795927464
and whose room is this my dear child   8.53811157595392
his excellency does not receive visitors today   17.456862919079988
take care madame said the young man coolly you will kill yourself in jumping   14.611663567636244
because he is in love   9.88956048259818
ah monsieur interrupted aramis permit me to observe to you that you have not acted in this affair as a gallant man ought   14.92236840303594
perhaps he had come to tell captain gaumard of his good luck and to offer him employment from his new master   14.20304355072252
the count of monte cristo the very same in whose house we are   15.084762796485482
my dear said she as she took the pen is it not vexatious   13.321631384316603
always ready   10.20375768807675
but i swear to you that this crime shall be her last   17.6059418162624
as for grimaud he seemed more sullen than ever   11.091822384585459
i am an officer of fortune nothing else   10.431133469665571
cried the king drawing up his horse with a sudden jerk which threw it on its haunches and seizing the bridle of athos s horse   10.331399477019989
as to the rest of the blade the master had slyly put that on one side to make himself a larding pin   14.038645017243873
so that i shall have performed my duty without the expense of an outfit   8.690344739227154
i have come to speak to you of a very serious matter   16.31630240888205
in fact of the twenty rose trees which formed the parterre not one bore the mark of the slug nor were there evidences anywhere of the clustering aphis which is so destructive to plants growing in a damp soil   16.68174962563562
this humble picture would have but little interest for you accustomed as you are to behold the pleasures and the misfortunes of the wealthy and industrious   10.326793710392343
well here i am   11.545897534103952
is it that excellent m   12.374933278071245
read it again dantès and then i will complete for you the incomplete words and unconnected sense   11.559152622532505
the stone seems very brilliant answered the count   14.95291955722534
sir said de guiche to his tutor we will precede you and you can rejoin us on the road to cambrin   12.138077733616052
said the deputy shuddering in spite of himself   7.224378996296684
but contrary to all expectation when the 31st of august came the house opened as usual and cocles appeared behind the grating of the counter examined all bills presented with the usual scrutiny and from first to last paid all with the usual precision   14.10983033673534
but it seemed that the history which the inspector had related interested him greatly for after having perused the first documents he turned over the leaves until he reached the deposition respecting edmond dantès   7.982459732266776
the chancellor himself would be puzzled how to write such a letter and yet the chancellor draws up an official report very readily   12.118090962483029
but my messenger is like the stag you refer to for he has posted two hundred and twenty leagues in scarcely three days   10.37252115050618
chapter 9   9.448923932214536
the men i have put to flight will return reinforced   10.19970422553767
said the queen blinded by her obstinacy   11.825528542013421
s confidential valet who never left the door entered in reply to the call   10.937292084242426
that puts a different face on the matter   14.764172945302542
but he did not know that matters had reached such a point   9.79525785150457
take it take it   14.63645191602899
count you render me sadder than before if it be possible   10.26068369036473
and he jumped off his horse   7.313817088218869
i hoped for a moment that it might said villefort   9.879788346203572
take care of yourself and act so that we may from time to time hear you spoken of   12.769880307110364
at the fifth or sixth blow the pickaxe struck against an iron substance   13.693534724579065
de tréville was not at his hôtel   10.960344387408764
to place my lackey at your disposal   13.302974485116595
yes yes yes signed the paralytic casting on valentine a look of joyful gratitude for having guessed his meaning   9.128605240568248
the castle of bragelonne   15.281433847290122
that man knew of retreats more secure than rueil darker and more silent even than the bastile   11.135721754603653
allow me then if you please to answer in different order or i will not do so at all   11.279957736181556
willingly said d artagnan   11.858117553268814
you are most welcome monsieur said the count of morcerf saluting monte cristo with a smile and monsieur has rendered our house in preserving its only heir a service which insures him our eternal gratitude   12.141078037597417
now   13.53158454998216
you were rich when i married you but little respected   9.925093738096805
asked mordaunt   13.01511441335603
i will in the meantime go and prepare the young man for this much desired interview for i presume that he is not less impatient for it than yourself   5.905361995843437
ah stay   13.804887230236812
as true as i am a christian stammered caderousse you will make me die of fright   14.33734436855479
as he however had no other hat he picked up this as he ran and arrived at his quarters very pale and quite out of breath   10.68319102835595
villefort hastily quitted the apartment but reflecting that the sight of the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to throw the whole city into confusion he resumed his ordinary pace   6.428409933034608
i who have nothing to lose i should go   15.460148963972387
the races like the moccoli are one of the episodes peculiar to the last days of the carnival   12.796395140821074
for naturally enough it must have pained him to hear the emperor he so devotedly loved and served spoken of in that depreciating manner   10.884437882198496
and the young man delighted with his joke went away laughing loudly   12.126728493769924
you refuse   11.263205542081106
said madame de chevreuse trying to read in athos s eyes   7.328727476608935
as to porthos that is certainly droll   8.209783181004127
during this time the empire made its last conscription and every man in france capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the emperor   11.536604886780488
now we must have badly painted the character of our adventure seeker or our readers must have already perceived that d artagnan was not an ordinary man   8.337985222865981
and i may profit by monsieur s happiness and go to bed   16.14765600105221
then he dragged himself cautiously to the top of a rock from which he had a full view of the sea and thence he saw the tartan complete her preparations for sailing weigh anchor and balancing herself as gracefully as a water fowl ere it takes to the wing set sail   10.698660781529938
la ramee was going out   11.759210058623886
and i came sir added raoul gazing at the count with a smile of real affection for i thought you would be glad to see me again   10.223108046903238
these words struck d artagnan like a thunderbolt   9.249308787937796
oh your excellency it was not yours then   19.620849953665516
cried a third   13.654003618520736
the queen was in a morning gown but it became her still   11.74812532993924
had doubled pomègue and approached the harbor under topsails jib and spanker but so slowly and sedately that the idlers with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board   13.105544367769532
which of my friends my lord   9.337592973696893
after some minutes the door opened and a footman announced mademoiselle paulet   8.070634933254766
a prisoner   17.32873769221169
come tell me all the good fortune that has befallen you   12.772834493184043
she made her interlocutor observe the corner of this unfolded object   16.42834649347534
continue said the queen   9.275713423644232
of what country is he a native   16.82593181454866
before all who are here   10.46683983587647
hastily raising myself on one arm i looked around but all was dark   16.62180791908467
dantès was about to speak   11.624215072535375
now here we are obliged to own that andrea ought to have felt remorse but that he did not   10.951935501664485
we say proud as a scotsman murmured the duke of buckingham   10.491731579436252
porthos seized his opportunity caught the next soldier by his neck gagged him and pushed him like a mummy through the bars into the room and entered after him   15.16575286422097
wait a moment said the banker stopping the young man   11.746437520045275
but the lightning will not strike until there is a hand to guide it   18.605477774549065
the two friends after a cordial pressure of the hands separated   14.516167574872643
well here s the case here s where the saddle hurts me as we french say   16.337980100322625
morrel understood that the old man attached great importance to an oath   14.404542493894539
athos glanced around at his friends with a melancholy smile   7.143638504873135
but seven in two days i repeat it is too many it is far too many   10.823458101499456
he did not wait long for in five minutes the queen entered in full gala costume   11.816015671137343
duhallier s men and half of m   9.39434044917408
asked the driver   9.952915021049032
danglars it is i   9.832984601998383
yes the written order said porthos who now began to comprehend what d artagnan was aiming at we ask only for that   11.739084414813235
without any inquiry without any formality   12.61734857805598
he is preparing a way for your majesty to escape   13.050569727040362
oh no poor dear man   12.453647618469397
sir monk said he whether he is now or has been an executioner this unfortunate being is none the less a man   11.530811835041785
but i shall be always happy and proud sire to sacrifice myself to the harmony which i desire to see reign between you and the queen of france   11.409532751580796
the other cavaliers were only twenty steps from them   14.712595658513045
he had seen château renaud who had promised to be in the orchestra before the curtain was raised   10.636655004789516
the air and water were shining in the beams of the morning sun   14.282144477051514
when i entered the house the first thing i beheld in the middle of assunta s chamber was a cradle that might be called sumptuous compared with the rest of the furniture and in it a baby seven or eight months old   12.139967975575498
in the midst of his amorous projects for the mercer s wife he did not forget his friends   12.685572438509897
i have it a sailor who was about to marry a young catalan girl   18.373788296247028
here and there they passed little copses crossing the path which they were following   8.791273645274423
d artagnan deposited his clothes under the arm of one of the valets   10.911266997775211
danglars informed you of the ceremony   15.502611798338293
it is easy to suppose that morrel s agitation would not escape the count s penetrating eye   13.20882914321219
not a modern picture among them   8.797330107390248
of what packet are you speaking danglars   17.039587306015008
you say that with four men you will undertake to disperse a hundred low fellows   10.695290126443128
that makes seventy   17.51952307776906
a burst of laughter was the answer but finished with a groan   10.758058720971794
understand sir i do not in the least suspect your veracity   15.817729673805784
as she had a loose muslin dress on and as nothing concealed her figure i saw she would ere long become a mother   10.02804139240133
monsieur you insult the majesty of justice   9.26863889973772
you knew i should be killed on leaving this house and did not warn me   13.65215985579341
your lordship must have observed that he could not continue his journey   15.278772527037017
you have an opportunity now count   15.282726292603316
what orders   14.879369134457132

the garden became darker still but in the darkness he looked in vain for the white dress and in the silence he vainly listened for the sound of footsteps   8.230089450079163
said the cicerone to the coachman and the carriage drove rapidly on   13.965723862855299
mazarin shuddered   12.301299449016186
then athos raised his hand and pointing to the coffin this temporary sepulture is he said that of a man who was of feeble mind yet one whose reign was full of great events   9.621365485465683
father i will said maximilian   7.491924412958714
come gentlemen addressing the troop let us return   12.905020944286514
for a moment d artagnan thought that parry s brother had disappeared   7.928574048101607
because he is an actor in the drama   8.452870173848858
from that time he had watched them and profiting by the moment when her lover had left her alone had carried her off and believed he at length had her in his power when the ball directed by the unerring skill of the young herdsman had pierced his heart   16.160124009813586
the dead man and the two wounded were carried off by their comrades and i have heard nothing of either of them since   13.405849236836959
we too said athos to the footman who had given him that answer not only bring news from england but have just come from there   14.118802915687146
in the time of the cardinal people fired better than that do you remember the road to crevecoeur mousqueton   8.982502552352315
what had you to revenge on the marquis de saint méran   13.263836637826573
the house to which d artagnan and porthos conducted athos and aramis was the one assigned to them by general cromwell and of which they had taken possession on the previous evening   12.665408766718812
i think this is about your position is it not   10.375515757427557
de boville and on the 30th the 32 500 francs of bills for which as well as the debt due to the inspector of prisons he had time granted he must be a ruined man   13.746758513569823
now you understand porthos   12.44851807472369
inquired franz taking the letter from him   12.867398893386696
the two friends sat down and aramis began to cut up fowls partridges and hams with admirable skill   6.521657290839403
when then the count of monte cristo hearing of the dilemma in which you are placed has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two places at his windows in the palazzo rospoli   11.579690920049561
said athos emptying a glass of excellent bordeaux wine which without having at that period the reputation it now enjoys merited it no less poor fools   8.005762249194344
edmond said mercédès i have but one word more to say to you   8.915683934566648
monte cristo cast one rapid and curious glance round this sanctum   12.871017285758064
the verger opened the iron grating that guarded the royal tombs and stood on the topmost step whilst athos and raoul descended   16.386599819558164
at the names comte de la fere and chevalier d herblay charles opened his eyes and raising his noble head in spite of himself threw a glance at all the actors in the scene   13.509943258063682
yet you have unquestionably some ambition   13.3692650389902
why when a man has friends they are not only to offer him a glass of wine but moreover to prevent his swallowing three or four pints of water unnecessarily   11.642489263412843
when they reached a certain spot these men appeared to be annihilated one after the other as if the earth had opened under their feet   14.33072896982453
i had a similar attack the year previous to my imprisonment   9.359022423372366
but pride restrained him and he did not utter it   8.677405106441856
half the 15th of this month half the 15th of next   10.875339187770793
i accelerate your ruin   11.80405966214511
in that case replied the abbé he should be a man blessed of god rich happy   8.963137378016272
and madame danglars four   10.05452861251562
the horses had done ten leagues that day and needed rest   11.654886051081618
i went to france with a determination to remain there for the rest of my life   9.807826259238478
but said d artagnan shall we not pursue that woman   5.843831682378925
four days replied his friend are necessary to reach blois   12.737873475814391
d artagnan was the first to recover from his surprise   13.160037963055897
but this i know that he is noble as a borghese and rich as a gold mine   14.650200214972912
to bring news of monsieur de mazarin the freshest news there is   15.974095519757384
but her strength failed her   10.734511156927054
morrel was deeply in love and barrois was dying with heat and exertion   11.8453537778277
why there is nothing improper in our conversation my dear planchet and no one could find fault with it   12.098768450832042
that was the very evening when the abduction of mme   12.179047938344484
madame de villefort rose monte cristo did the same and the rest followed their example   15.079211289426048
albert poured himself out a glass of lacryma christi which he sipped at intervals muttering some unintelligible words   17.15359305434064
at bottom the character of m   13.108072844677146
and yet we become accustomed to them her voice is so beautiful   8.168664983745812
i shall not be sorry to see the face of an acquaintance   17.540306079380798
am i then to remain here eternally   3.5197782415409726
we talked of you an hour after you left us the other day   14.26287118385178
this man was the comte de rochefort the demoniacal tool of his eminence   13.748085345351964
the good understanding between the two friends was not in the least altered by the morning s skirmish   12.566254386643873
de villefort begged me to tell you that he could not act otherwise   14.70579812174848
40036m she pointed to each letter of the alphabet   8.216589445016531
i can therefore tell you beforehand you shall be tried and even condemned   9.699608479855419
said kitty in a low voice what is the matter with you   14.334683402770303
i am free to do so   7.305003944701972
he will spare me the ennui of the bastille or the tediousness of a trial   9.130803726216755
marie michon continued athos   15.248447248417708
when he had gone monte cristo breathed a profound sigh and said enough of this poison let me now seek the antidote   12.241165125647932
noirtier made a sign that he would listen   14.126572653148667
that he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merely referred to without entering into particulars but that whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ship s owners would have his preference also   8.622675584834749
oh madame said the count when valentine had left the room was it on my account that you sent mademoiselle de villefort away   19.753624716319727
and he turned up two cards as usual a king for d artagnan and an ace for himself   6.114605218631931
bonacieux rising all in a tremble supported herself upon her chair to avoid falling   5.879539698435567
how badly   3.9616481802197345
whither does your excellency desire to be driven   11.411692690844392
morrel guessed all this   12.736110947288504
john of the golden mouth   14.222594539857429
the officer reappeared   18.45945474604941
madame replied de winter provided i can find some of my good old friends of former times i will answer for anything   13.890417157709061
and do you think mazarin commissioned them to act as they have done   15.726927689033323
he the all powerful he before whom others were accustomed to fly he who had taken for his device they hate me   10.48171420051281
it was apparent enough   13.812311902766531
he had assigned himself the task of saving a man s life that day   8.759968659776785
why yes very nearly   12.257500290965726
why it seems m   13.801268967919476
a mattress was laid upon the deck for him   13.441023608231976
at nine o clock guided by planchet the little cavalcade set out taking the route the carriage had taken   11.579436149909077
this last explanation was wholly lost upon dantès who had always imagined from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in the mediterranean that it moved and not the earth   9.471452117023393
and you sit there tearing your hair instead of seeking to remedy your condition   12.698607762531118
his nostrils dilated like those of a wild beast that scents its prey and his lips half opened disclosed his white teeth small and sharp like those of a jackal   6.602768377056246
but i recollect perfectly one thing that being unwilling to let such talents as mine sleep i wished to try upon the arabs the new pistols that had been given to me   10.796892438301846
yes replied the brigadier   15.034967856508315
perhaps i am not mortally wounded i may not die   8.535078961367113
this species of masonry had been covered with earth and grass and weeds had grown there moss had clung to the stones myrtle bushes had taken root and the old rock seemed fixed to the earth   9.160069932955942
albert looked around and perceived franz   16.18737641480045
the duke approached the altar knelt as a priest might have done before a crucifix and opened the casket   13.025041832696951
d artagnan started on seeing these tears   15.770967125265662
if you cross a bridge feel every plank of it with your foot lest one should give way beneath you   15.493106395404451
and where are they looking for her   15.424275999361345
your excellency has given me a louis on account   11.562211189281209
my dear franz replied albert when upon receipt of my letter you found the necessity of asking the count s assistance you promptly went to him saying my friend albert de morcerf is in danger   14.63335501188961
i am sorry for it madame but i acknowledge no other power but that of the great man whom i have the honor to serve   11.345393995540748
but as you have transformed that house into a vast ruin i will not be the foundation of another man s fortune   11.191772425908647
when our turn comes our revenge will be sweeping   18.249033992401273
and she went out but instead of going to her apartment she hastened to consult emmanuel   9.352499948583901
then that is monsieur s determination   11.414378869023267
thomson french said he   5.888774206771931
the young man s eyes kindled in secret but he restrained himself   8.431967772897123
oh said monte cristo i allow of no excuse   12.29340423012975
come along danglars and let the young gentleman return to the catalans if he chooses   9.183668018916455
and the patron accosting him said the signor sinbad has left his compliments for your excellency and desires us to express the regret he feels at not being able to take his leave in person   15.215715377065901
and a gentleman to hobnob with a bailiff   16.744086143137995
cried mousqueton with open arms and eyes full of tears   12.23340776202362
notwithstanding his shattered nerves the ringing sensation in his ears and the madness which turned his brain villefort rose as he perceived her   9.373937411493824
the two witnesses followed   13.70795939679886
i have not tried to discover her other name   13.965006574050804
they do not want my papers said monte cristo they want to kill me   10.700131166575375
gentlemen cried the coadjutor tightening his sash which he wore after the fashion of the ancient military prelates over his archiepiscopal simar there s the enemy approaching   7.87463149106506
cambalet his niece   11.700601074470928
asked monte cristo seeing morrel return   11.483334102848625
indeed no said château renaud   12.651580397156552
but where will you manage to stow me   16.619534925081233
yes that the usual phrase   11.742602642417731
simon was already putting his horn to his mouth to sound the halali crack all the pack takes the wrong scent and sets off after a two year older   12.304366522243244
and for what   13.727591116666659
cried caderousse ah sir do not jest with me   12.07312103462417
they stamped upon the carpet with their feet   10.04551790289846
you who speak english like john bull himself are master tom lowe we your three companions   10.497724135567973
thereupon aramis had given him a clasp of the hand and had disappeared under the arcades   16.839776005853725
something to drink   7.671341689618422
but to the great astonishment of d artagnan the shutter remained closed   14.371648429914213
with another man milady might have preserved some doubt   9.152852475004702
in what state was the house when you left   9.11160427304123
the prisoner had discovered the danger and had substituted a lever for a chisel   14.856536066611326
from the moment he perceived them he did not cease to look at them and seemed to burn with the wish to speak to them   9.07424099766762
and adding to this if there be need of it meaning to offer you fifty pistoles if against all probability you should be short at the present moment   8.931029064649037
yes my son   13.764818310577944
a house with a garden a master a physician and where there have been three unexpected and sudden deaths   14.302447247364777
good my dear rochefort   14.424110521798749
what s possible they say they can effect themselves and they are right   12.70815830121024
aramis stopped   15.187653406027563
they had the misfortune to be devoted to that very queen for whom just now you were seeking servants   15.076652387623373
oh no indeed the count will do me the justice to assert that i have on the contrary always entreated him to break off my engagement and happily it is ended   15.461516316851602
you know that i don t like it   9.519221034223985
i was to have been presented to her when i met her at madame villefort s ball   10.808786032548726
when he affirmed that he the cardinal was about to unravel the most closely twisted thread of this intrigue   13.275832514268677
too big for a youth too small for a grown man an experienced eye might have taken him for a farmer s son upon a journey had it not been for the long sword which dangling from a leather baldric hit against the calves of its owner as he walked and against the rough side of his steed when he was on horseback   11.910139513107216
but really said d artagnan   9.313639746506539
porthos instead of returning directly home d artagnan alighted at the door of m   8.206516709155888
he called for d artagnan but in the midst of such tumult he little expected to see him d artagnan not being on service   7.160596082093481
now then cried carlini rising in his turn and approaching the corpse his hand on the butt of one of his pistols does anyone dispute the possession of this woman with me   15.288468948820663
it may be supposed that his desire to hear the conversation was augmented by this discovery   6.957813963960517
and they apologized to him for having carried you off   12.430284051628123
certainly replied the jesuit a little put out while the curate greatly delighted turned upon d artagnan a look full of gratitude   10.872109619421966
the man took the bag from the hands of the coadjutor who heard the sound of his fingers counting and handling the gold pieces   10.812215451112634
come be frank gentlemen you have settled accounts with somebody   13.904329807852857
yes you are right d artagnan a fatality that will separate and ruin us   11.799681653803551
then he must be playing in the garden   14.564649285616142
then turning to monte cristo said m   11.217997362973751
to the letter but at the same time remember we must continue to play our respective parts   8.798757773334238
and for the second time haydée stopped overcome by such violent emotion that the perspiration stood upon her pale brow and her stifled voice seemed hardly able to find utterance so parched and dry were her throat and lips   16.14059683629683
said scarron he may die now   12.545135514522448
but why did it not kill my father   15.709760415505698
and what said your cavalier to you   14.395653078263114
did you really think me capable of that   15.434237571481747
he was in fact in the unhappy position of the victim marked for sacrifice   11.718614182352914
have you not tears in your eyes porthos   13.750626414602111
he had at once declared for a military life and had in consequence studied hard passed brilliantly through the polytechnic school and left it as sub lieutenant of the 53rd of the line   9.670552861218443
now the cabbage had not the slightest appearance of disease in the world and the rabbit had not the smallest distrust   3.484842968314476
the fair woman on whose account i gave you advice which naturally you took care not to adopt   12.81772848291986
be not alarmed at what i say   16.45168263550499
planchet called his master s attention to a gentleman who had just arrived with his lackey and only preceded them by about fifty paces   15.1686060036755
said the wounded man collecting all his forces as if to get up let us not lose time in useless words   12.579496761094264
now d herblay said athos dismount and come here   15.45588520310968
ah very well that s an explanation   7.705870572238295
thanks gentlemen thanks   13.33911812516388
besides he is unarmed   6.615142885707172
let us do things in order   13.153519902686352
monte cristo looked inquiringly at his guests   10.364629577118613
in conscience i can not kill him   14.325028089837378
he called himself vampa   15.775365258777574
at the corner of the cimetiere saint jean d artagnan upset a man   5.90452651610575
when once i know the hour i will hasten to this spot you can easily get over this fence with my assistance a carriage will await us at the gate in which you will accompany me to my sister s   7.3424562988385755
meantime he uncorked the bottles and went to smell if the pie was good   10.8916072761413
the petition finished villefort read it aloud   14.008600451153846
for five hundred thousand   16.066505089241517
i get tired of it and leave it   12.166310720961173
said the doctor   12.522899198505172
yes to make him come to paris   16.301895440452004
i do not know you said the executioner   8.497713293786122
instructions have been given   12.666023874558666
let him decide and we will execute   16.29540854355146
in fact said aramis there is no time lost and we made our journey quickly   6.543675334017644
she took it or rather just touched it with her little hand and they together descended the steps lined with rhododendrons and camellias   14.62586485019052
yes pray accursed woman   11.15996853869753
among some unimportant papers he found the following letter that which he had sought at the risk of his life since you have lost sight of that woman and she is now in safety in the convent which you should never have allowed her to reach try at least not to miss the man   10.817070032659256
get up   16.464472519071606
the brand disappeared   14.143785917424658
you have known him for some time then   10.491039741691838
they fell into the line of carriages   11.153734710573735
well monsieur you understand that uneasiness makes us do many things   15.587451818505109
the queen bent in token of submission and followed the ladies who were to conduct her to her room   15.731434789023005
when a carriage is chosen it ought to be strong   7.490217327010358
to morrow morning   17.293060750118656
the next morning he left that inn as he had left the hôtel des princes without being noticed walked down the faubourg saint antoine along the boulevard to rue ménilmontant and stopping at the door of the third house on the left looked for someone of whom to make inquiry in the porter s absence   14.95943961489986
besides and rochefort drew a deep breath as he spoke i am going into the country to make a tour   10.297323163761694
de villefort a second time raised his head looked at benedetto as if he had been gazing at the head of medusa and became livid   12.384093999512876
and as a custom existed among the inhabitants of that part of france where caderousse lived of styling every person by some particular and distinctive appellation her husband had bestowed on her the name of la carconte in place of her sweet and euphonious name of madeleine which in all probability his rude gutteral language would not have enabled him to pronounce   15.120705210543147
but i was at my own house you understand so there was nothing to be done but to send for the cards which i did   17.028775260869025
morrel uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of his son of whose arrival he was ignorant   12.048986359978896
in the first one handy provided it is safe said the commissary with an indifference which penetrated poor bonacieux with horror   11.87929278668377
murmured the queen whose teeth chattered with fright   11.07347466924587
at the moment the boat began her course they lost sight of the yacht as it disappeared in the gulf of porto vecchio   14.67297803568928
i have courage enough for any danger i can foresee for every misfortune which i understand   14.581502948003683
yes it was so my lord it was so in the left side and with a knife   13.1089132137426

if my unknown be as amiable as she is beautiful said albert i shall fix myself at rome for six weeks at least   13.808914394883317
the young king looked at the officer with his large formed eye and repeated monsieur d artagnan   13.464239579359473
but i think you have still a good number of falcons sparrow hawks and tiercels   8.877554278441384
i thank you for having insisted on seeing me   13.290044864326884
the epistle is laconic said d artagnan   8.045758418187827
the palace of justice would not be burned down for everybody monseigneur   15.980079139705698
has no one owned him   11.137194056433817
there is the beginning of an adventure   10.736443413357346
milady at these words which recalled frightful remembrances hung down her head with a suppressed groan   15.40858836825052
the three lieutenants of the generalissimo   17.347426252039575
do you know the house of thomson french   13.480861681070165
since it is opened i will take advantage of it to enter your room   18.875387177958647
but in that same banker s study where you very willingly presented yourself yesterday to ask for the thousand francs i give you monthly for pocket money you must know my dear young lady that many things may be learned useful even to a girl who will not marry   10.881012749129852
the devil i am   17.163365528015923
you know this chief then   16.838053424702238
what is he then   10.286323892945997
she said and why art thou not at notre dame   10.016928556076104
at this moment the four guards appeared at the door of the antechamber but seeing four musketeers standing and their swords by their sides they hesitated about going farther   14.15335241085765
ma foi i haven t consulted my daughter   8.365685649851132
peter and represents the three divine powers   11.352591275497899
in a few moments notwithstanding their wet clothes the icy blast that blew and the previous scene of terror these hardy adventurers with their iron frames inured to every hardship threw themselves down intending to profit by the advice of athos who sat at the helm pensively wakeful guiding the little bark the way it was to go his eyes fixed on the heavens as if he sought to verify not only the road to france but the benign aspect of protecting providence   13.722454188113181
there are no horses   7.482247370000266
shall you never leave me again   13.087781730310736
come said madame danglars leave music and compliments and let us go and take tea   11.52305688445913
yes i know that you charged by the side of mordaunt   10.664006586730283
my uncle answered mordaunt   6.310660621681882
let us come to some conclusion   9.135414776557415
a third time at monsieur de tréville s where it surprised us all   10.563035722651563
a cold sweat broke from d artagnan s brow   15.347171307669068
and he felt as if he were also dying   10.611714354339579
the fact is that you have inspired not only the pontifical government but also the neighboring states with such extreme fear that they are glad of all opportunity of making an example   9.234895557151393
which is the young man   14.405660366486222
and now continued he with one of his most charming smiles having finished talking to the father in law i must address myself to the banker   17.50602005261556
and even they who had begun to open negotiations interrupted them being resolved to await the succor so pompously announced   9.954379194531587
we can wait for him   8.5360034476375
and a quarter of an hour after having made this assertion he found her hanging on the arm of aramis   13.06745296573629
my master had appetite enough three days ago but what can one do   8.699001773164682
the voice of the king was tremulous with anger   10.021271516177416
yours your own property   18.123787758784786
patrick discreetly kept in the background   13.243285752325606
sire said the queen i can send for them to the louvre where they are and thus your majesty s wishes will be complied with   17.220058761499978
let us get ready gentlemen   11.69481366304152
de tréville employed this powerful weapon for the king in the first place and the friends of the king and then for himself and his own friends   11.683005870716155
what the devil shall we do now gentlemen   13.088410807057267
the baroness then thought of m   15.445305855700953
it seems the fellow had been caught wandering nearer to the harem of the bey of tunis than etiquette permits to one of his color and he was condemned by the bey to have his tongue cut out and his hand and head cut off   15.952801641604575
an enormous one   10.393856353862772
do you then believe in god   17.434550103779756
the baroness did not wait for a repetition   12.388587599663111
how can you exist thus without anyone to attach you to life   16.395189105891465
for the sake of fighting   15.33738157560141
athos shook his head   11.456262401783059
he gave me his hand and called me his friend   17.67602347124886
come near to us from time to time as if to speak   10.03730685861039
henceforth valentine you will never again be separated on earth since he has rushed into death to find you   9.208391160027936
i noticed them for their remarkable beauty   10.93062880084338
mute as a carp   12.427450554490605
said d artagnan in great anxiety   17.013074808149533
i told you true replied he coldly   13.35930375651104
no matter whose voice had spoken we should have heard him with the smile of doubt or the anguish of incredulity and yet how many times has your father blessed life while embracing you how often have i myself ah exclaimed morrel interrupting the count you had only lost your liberty my father had only lost his fortune but i have lost valentine   9.596558983073
tomorrow then monsieur tomorrow   8.442396519966005
because instead of expecting two hundred wretched francs you expect five or six thousand perhaps ten perhaps even twelve for you take care not to let anyone know the utmost   12.741833030561297
i came here only to meet de chatillon   11.443213335340587
it was the last yearning for life contending with the resolution of despair   8.782235417029344
pray sir explain yourself said villefort more and more astonished i really do not understand you perfectly   10.473223277529435
besides had he not begged of morcerf not to mention his father s name before haydée   10.538687074625363
bonacieux sorrowfully   14.327457773930835
sir said planchet in a mournful tone do you abandon me thus to my fate   13.864101883671271
he smiled on perceiving that he was a child hardly fifteen years old   17.193713557513856
he added that he did not know either m   11.13220068661928
sire cromwell has arrived this night at newcastle   9.535024910055924
it followed that his hat was forever in his hand which procured him some severe reprimands from d artagnan who feared that his excess of politeness would lead people to think he was the lackey of a man of no consequence   5.507038179053689
yes said he at length it is so   13.054556102285485
and sighing deeply he began to turn the hoop of his ring outside again   12.310079994574098
to whom was this letter addressed   15.888801000791897
i have seen so many remarkable things in him that if you would have me really say what i think i shall reply that i really do look upon him as one of byron s heroes whom misery has marked with a fatal brand   8.208249384281885
really that is a good idea   7.590795342327498
i often ask pardon of god i swear to you because this action the only one with which i have seriously to reproach myself in all my life is no doubt the cause of my abject condition   6.220846624966056
my husband could accompany me   17.705773270818568
i have three who would be honored by joining in the sport with me   10.103901120310077
you are not busoni   4.994764492356296
she was of the color of ashes   7.989873204762555
the door opened and bazin entered   12.648969451620028
monsieur my majordomo will there be a pie   13.886415612149358
muttered the four friends exchanging glances   9.451950170529678
we would have replaced the parents it has lost have called it benedetto and then in consequence of this good action god would have blessed us   12.34789263512386
but whoever you may be i charge you not to advance another step   11.932613039580179
oh my god my god have pity on me   12.042892955611952
no friends left my lord   11.431764696040808
if he could have made any use of me he would have taken me with him   9.156569081264653
do you leave us thus so suddenly without any preparations for your journey without even a passport   13.201068076923443
at what number   14.78929774006711
are you sure that the other is dead   14.479326339367006
my dear sir will you allow me to ask you a question   8.110443088940123
vitray said he you will go with all speed to london   12.044047280988142
that will be the simplest plan   11.160416438581994
and these men are in france my lord   9.581857171286543
worn out at length he fell asleep at daybreak and did not awake till late   10.318724546680102
faria since their first acquaintance had been on all points so rational and logical so wonderfully sagacious in fact that he could not understand how so much wisdom on all points could be allied with madness   14.320090879274296
shall we take our valets   17.33542810447727
he saw me this morning for the first time and has already forgotten he has seen me   5.64005141516548
they went to find porthos and at the corner of the rue bac met mousqueton who with a most pitiable air was driving before him a mule and a horse   13.186534806292935
it is unnecessary for you to bind yourself by any vow said he   13.393974253069024
if the serpent be dead why not its brood   11.231737983267353
and the cardinal began to examine with the greatest attention the map of la rochelle which as we have said lay open on the desk tracing with a pencil the line in which the famous dyke was to pass which eighteen months later shut up the port of the besieged city   13.602390281202553
and the more so that thanks to my skill in all bodily exercises and the indifference to danger i have gradually acquired i should be almost certain to kill my man   15.02340457849058
fernand more happy but not more at his ease for i saw at this time he was in constant dread of edmond s return fernand was very anxious to get his wife away and to depart himself   12.195530483183619
he added putting his lantern on one of the casks   10.134654221913213
good bye for the present replied the count walking upon tiptoe towards the library door and smiling with an expression so sad and paternal that the young girl s heart was filled with gratitude   7.339296901089886
and that executioner you saw that executioner who you say told you everything that executioner if he told you everything told you that he leaped with joy in avenging on her his brother s shame and suicide   12.737841840916904
3 a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of receipt of the work   9.187883751333494
that is quite true said barrois   13.009126309142692
and woe to those who forgot that i was there   12.243490138272334
i drew near and found he was bidding a hundred pistoles for a chestnut nag   15.692535252229238
i will follow you then sir   9.674468557724605
before tomorrow   12.736144868635924
pray signor pastrini asked franz is not some execution appointed to take place today   15.154018823380632
but at these words so natural in themselves your father is indeed here and is seeking you young andrea started and exclaimed my father   14.194144724893912
then the vehicle disappeared round one of the turnings of fort saint nicholas   9.026686581440991
we shall discover the cause of her sudden death and we shall say dear villefort if this thing has been caused by negligence watch over your servants   14.450008455589769
for his father s death he was in some manner prepared   6.58352507994234
we must return to paris   11.59945767330136
it is enough to have killed the mother said athos hoarsely   12.651711255487951
i possess nearly 50 000 livres in right of my mother   9.95818500162008
i am not going there to be imprisoned said dantès   13.519462505514245
but as during the greater portion of the year this island is deserted if the secret of this abode were discovered i should doubtless find on my return my temporary retirement in a state of great disorder which would be exceedingly annoying not for the loss it occasioned me but because i should not have the certainty i now possess of separating myself from all the rest of mankind at pleasure   8.993500916424178
our breakfast is a philanthropic one and we shall have at table at least i hope so two benefactors of humanity   12.82572164406379
all those fighting citizens went out to battle and they have been massacred   11.691761707210214
and the rich caparison is that mine too   15.77064761224418
well then you shall see it now   16.02289232611234
and king charles x   12.660291885399062
devoted to it   7.1254554659975495
yes said the executioner   13.99367458891969
for stealing   6.867116965061943
arras was encumbered with fugitives   6.557878235602613
but i tell you a million   10.443681368673435
upon my honor said rochefort it takes you my dear countess to perform such miracles   12.951961155826908
at la réserve the day before the betrothal feast   10.942680222799243
only a few days replied monte cristo   11.269171374317981
no replied the abbé it was not of such a size as that   11.745870277274497
he then took his cane which he had placed against an old cupboard and went out   11.85440812181197
up to this point said faria interrupting the thread of his narrative this seems to you very meaningless no doubt eh   11.647186744686303
all has gone according to my wishes   11.230846667551656
and morrel could read an indescribable joy in the eyes of his beloved when she knew that the termination of this affair was as happy as it was unexpected   15.202258672751324
it is extraordinary   13.323027541378394
and with a deep sigh he again sank into the reverie that had been interrupted by mordaunt   10.463321353011636
do not let me interfere with you in anything my friend said the count   11.977050154255455
my recovery lasted six months   5.343989317782944
at this very moment mazarin entered   21.50989230827159
oh i saw the snare and i answered you would be quite in despair on your return   9.581980859607542
however he had not ventured thus far to draw back   8.517492909954392
all took their places or rather the ladies formed a circle while the gentlemen more indifferent to the restraints of what boileau calls the style énergique commented on the feverish agitation of andrea on m   10.423539232290322
do you mean is he a good comrade   17.771721846048
besides d artagnan from her own admission knew milady culpable of treachery in matters more important and could entertain no respect for her   16.212887931260454
asked franz of his host   14.381289084757146
the spaniard sprang forward and seized the gun by its muzzle in order to strike raoul on the head with the butt   15.492042027125738
they brought him into this room and placed sentinels at the doors and windows   14.090888733136254
the noiseless door again turned on its hinges and the count of monte cristo reappeared   12.617448163683585
he is a fine young man of fair complexion a little too fair perhaps pleasing in manners   10.464163322751189
that would have been difficult   10.998741182033237
if any one asks you whose it is you can say that it belongs to an irish gentleman   11.558296877813621
why the thing has made a tremendous noise   10.591209863003554
your eminence said the august visitor it was my first intention to speak of the matters that have brought me here to the queen my sister but i have reflected that political affairs are more especially the concern of men   4.310648028641269
and recently we have had information that the bonapartist clubs have had meetings in the rue saint jacques   13.773253889155823
may heaven prosper you   8.702790077119072
the young man having left his horse tied to the gate in the court mounted the great staircase and addressed the guard in the first chamber   13.828829974288091
ah said albert it was she   17.35288206037157
then the hand was withdrawn leaving in his an object which he perceived to be a ring   7.576396364344582
how foolish you are   11.01601262559307
asked d artagnan who did not at all comprehend the hilarity of his friend   10.934599646793352
whom pagans and unbelieving gentiles call duke of buckingham replied milady   11.679075520466428
we shall be carried in triumph   10.814851212034611
and she fell full length on the floor   13.893422807485855
return with all speed   14.709481376538493
but as i am not quite properly dressed i chose my opportunity that i might not compromise you   8.040685344382396
on yourself   11.325271734472942
very well indeed sir replied comminges   12.628830317005916
said the individual whose description we have twice given entering the door what a great deal of ceremony   8.41897386082679
said the major with a deep sigh and raising his eye to heaven   11.689194802205794
well said porthos it appears to me that the means are very simple   11.586516685575173
they were said however to be of good extraction   13.098113057866547
where were you then   6.075965554535476
d artagnan obeyed like a child without the least resistance or objection which proved that he was really in love   13.195944932789496
did you credit it   15.141354708038726
asked the count assuming all air and tone of the utmost simplicity and candor   11.752444177789208
the poor mercer remained standing at the door while the eyes of the personage we have just described were fixed upon him and appeared to wish to penetrate even into the depths of the past   10.457080263537362
cried aramis you have a magnificent horse there porthos   12.650888707111626
edmond opened his eyes complained of great pain in his knee a feeling of heaviness in his head and severe pains in his loins   9.950083918798047
when you wish to obtain some concession from a man s self love you must avoid even the appearance of wishing to wound it   18.789015692834752
therefore i shall return to italy as soon as i can   11.002608572275971
porthos was perfectly indifferent   13.020164022081357
then there is his son andrea a charming young man about your own age viscount bearing the same title as yourself and who is making his entry into the parisian world aided by his father s millions   9.381495818503186
well be it so at length said eugénie   12.976164758378628
my good dame asked d artagnan can you tell me what has become of one of my friends whom we were obliged to leave here about a dozen days ago   13.787070015373226
well you rascal what is it   16.76614225603882
you are mistaken friend d artagnan said aramis always on his guard   9.795245684545108
what are you doing here at such an hour   8.283748750072938
but did you receive my letter yesterday   14.659483329002114
i know that and we sent him to the bastile said mazarin   7.695542895247908
at first they appeared like black specks and now they looked like birds skimming the surface of the waves   15.087922760759193
this winding sheet was nothing more than a beautiful piece of cambric which the young girl had bought a fortnight before   15.526724166414187
valentine rushed towards him   9.869966944557943
the executioner let fall his mace drew his knife and with one stroke opened his throat and mounting on his stomach stamped violently on it with his feet   12.10475086402684
at eight o clock she had embarked   16.965096574105072
you thought to make us unhappy strangers trot at the heels of your processions like so many lazzaroni because no carriages or horses are to be had in your beggarly city   12.544867863170849
wherever these men passed frenzied cries were heard   10.069633067207416
the terrified servants were on the stairs and in the passage where the doctor would pass   15.114030963165932
the ambassadors   10.202703895350691
he was already on board the admiral s ship where they had been obliged to seek him   7.682734200541136
there are four men come to arrest me   16.31110552034137
he fancied also that in going he had already observed the street watcher who had attracted his attention   12.445429545171876
you will see the same at every opening from this palace to which i should lead you   13.177505951997858
you appear to forget yourself sadly   10.513703060095509
one night twenty years ago my master fetched you from bethune and conducted you to armentieres   8.654565277097392
five or six days hence at the latest   9.617010804928766
my spirit is willing my head is clear but this demon the gout o ercrows me   13.527600455869646
the chief went towards the place he had pointed out as albert s prison and franz and the count followed him   10.405820016989058
that will be sufficient   9.82148869523225
while exclaiming loudly against duels and brawls they excited them secretly to quarrel deriving an immoderate satisfaction or genuine regret from the success or defeat of their own combatants   13.401052508407705
man of ability as he was louis xviii   16.286954157699704
at this period it was not the fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long   12.653999688035126
it is the voice of of my husband   17.124660049258026
and what was this man s name   15.37578448750567
sure to gain   11.480903304965251
i thought i had told you a most lamentable story   13.031600937918729
albert then took a pen and wrote frs   10.066170036319608
let what may remain of revolutionary sap exhaust itself and die away with the old trunk and condescend only to regard the young shoot which has started up at a distance from the parent tree without having the power any more than the wish to separate entirely from the stock from which it sprung   7.764142085931658
you will find mine on my saddle already loaded   17.73335679673974
do not bring on me the horrors of remorse   16.321739749027778
it is not my fault madame   12.19489222667376
andrea at his departure inherited all the papers which proved that he had indeed the honor of being the son of the marquis bartolomeo and the marchioness oliva corsinari   3.334589751533292
why should i leave you   13.48534773952434
grimaud nevertheless was resolved for certain reasons not at once to come to a full rupture with the prisoner   5.81946760829282
that is all   9.559655203446521
have you any knowledge of him   12.492065311769858
i will tell him the ties which bind me to mademoiselle valentine   17.13549673750701
we must then as it appears to me travel in company   15.230077488961257
my lord they shall be yours   10.659862636753603
those casks which i took for casks of port wine are filled with powder   13.56050365150394
at the next inn you will find a wounded man now being attended by our servants who has asked the assistance of a minister of god   12.139016755141034
may god protect you my son   9.495420142208717
as to d artagnan he remained perfectly insensible to the enthusiasm of the two men in black   9.148584843816282
my friends said athos this is what i expected from such hearts as yours   17.122307982247236
since my brother s assassination in the streets of nîmes i had never entered the town   14.57377897075102
bonacieux looked earnestly at the young man   10.132834439226508
oh come then come   8.528678547028175
own now that you did question her on the subject   9.441720972525363
but said bazin yawning portentously the ladder is still at the window   12.311010245914156
the host obeyed   12.470552563654886
they left the chamber at the same time   11.880633008044292
are you then making a thesis   9.134095149015472
stay there said aramis   14.181143559868847
that is your name is it not sir   13.531287513212373
he knelt down on the ground raised winter s head and unfastening the order of the saint esprit placed it on his own breast   13.796099584701704
and then ashamed of having been betrayed into such a demonstration of joy she half turned away and bent over a vase of roses as if to inhale their odor   14.886490162867727
give me back my child   6.338773723974945
another pause   8.899488096224701
you are free you leave the count s house and you take your mother to your home   5.307618314194603
true enough   15.332908128641915
16   9.83936250073803
do you wish anything   15.233937423182361
just so madame replied chatillon in so low a voice that though the two friends were listening eagerly they could hardly hear this affirmation   16.815968831017898
she is at béthune   15.687845945395484
a nightly patrol   8.796573862270858
i tell you i am sure of it continued the host   10.415702363849482
this was one of the humiliations which mazarin made anne undergo more frequently than any other and one that bowed her head with shame   14.089081130704407
uncle and nephew   12.501236844799406
god knows planchet that i should fly from a sight so sad if i did not wish to show my respect for the illustrious shadow of what was once the comte de la fere whom we loved so much   10.001232037401083
come father added dantès put this money back in your box unless neighbor caderousse wants anything and in that case it is at his service   12.380371736624072
the old man spoke not and grew pale as death   15.769328121755585
there was already three feet of water   15.2065281758735
care not for me sire   3.792231884373612
and today that you reproach me with my want of appetite is my day of appetite for i have not eaten since yesterday morning   16.101720353028693
well there s just the man we want said athos   6.690249683808346
why that s impossible   11.296261163888834
two shots were fired at once one by d artagnan the other by the adversary of porthos   9.695351153863664
thomson french set no bounds to their engagements while those of m   9.9762210121191
he was very nearly at the end of his humoristic tether but one despairing effort saved him   12.519631907019328
yes i was thinking whether we ought to come armed or not   9.086873148157961
monte cristo had seen enough   15.481648711225677
this was albert s favorite lounging place   16.09083534194889
now he continued withdraw a little and let me say my prayer i beseech you   12.653656982961769
the youths spurred on   15.805565889861857
my dear friend said albert to beauchamp it is plain that the affairs of spain are settled for you are most desperately out of humor this morning   6.997812873226922
she demanded   12.427545246508819
he went out chiefly to avoid this dangerous enemy and returned as late as possible in the evening   13.718002848477537
now sir said albert if you think my apology sufficient pray give me your hand   9.792360686902182
at ten o clock in the evening it is well known the streets in provincial towns are very little frequented   14.009335228342685
if we are attacked we will defend ourselves   16.00891628317617
said mazarin writhing beneath this simple eloquence your majesty does not understand me   13.451163675389997
besides although you suffer much you do not seem to be in such agony as you were before   13.533907944737988
ah you are right monsieur said d artagnan   14.139429897081595
he instantly rose and cast the remainder of the bouquets into the carriage   10.01400573365103
but what have i done to you   9.168108423614196
a being was commissioned to arrest the fatal hand of death about to descend on him   12.279620778095781
because then you might witness a spectacle calculated to break down your pride   11.1968394682116
if you will only agree to my request i promise you never to mention another word about escaping   11.279493310548773
a terrible laugh that showed he must have suffered horribly to be able thus to laugh   11.587326047362994
madame de villefort wiped his forehead pressed her lips upon it and sent him back with the ball in one hand and some bonbons in the other   12.207367774998243
well sir at last said anne of austria you are silent after rendering such a service   8.066153045293483
well said felton till tonight   14.723507812452414
die in peace   15.02658486981148
at this moment emmanuel entered his countenance full of animation and joy   9.576287909555363
like everything else we must habituate the senses to a fresh impression gentle or violent sad or joyous   8.304756657143093
two angelic faces   11.891500458604508
i exist no longer for you any more than if you had never seen me   14.192954689035945
albert shook his head and looked thoughtful   15.245430109184078
and shall we begin at once   17.963371819590904
he was one of those men who do not rashly court danger but if danger presents itself combat it with the most unalterable coolness   7.5568978277126515
benedetto if still living will become the instrument of divine retribution in some way or other and then be duly punished in his turn   13.771579288131358
we shall have to look elsewhere for our dinner   7.540191195147148
how should i know where the most beautiful and active of the frondists was at midnight   8.18728723646802
said benedetto laughing   16.8209431858887
blaisois returned disconsolate to the hotel of the grand roi charlemagne and when athos inquired if his commission was executed he related his adventure   9.469795078847655
cried he starting up   12.188309225715992
he assumed his costume and fastened on the mask that scarcely equalled the pallor of his own face   13.506778459031388
i am anxious to see that young man nearer   18.18514153435664
there is then one said monte cristo whom you do not condemn like poor danglars   15.537070636404284
said the unhappy young woman in the excess of her pride and joy presenting a letter to milady   8.793405490191494
it has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer the victims of their persecutions to reappear   15.666842330177852
oh it s nothing said d artagnan   11.497009425910873
why should not the king of france have the same chance as the emperor   15.36006879856117
asked the count with an affectionate benevolence whose sincerity no one could for a moment doubt   14.320680974590672
a passage of st   10.723390104800911
debray said the banker do not kill yourself tonight listening to the follies of madame danglars for you can hear them as well tomorrow   10.38491932260971
then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the windows   10.714477724779545
to receive the cardinal   12.510471552339745
in the meanwhile he looked upon athos as an achilles porthos as an ajax and aramis as a joseph   14.5798721425328
40124m listen cried he   8.221904457477242
at length he saw a dark mass against which it seemed as if the carriage was about to dash   13.061270163484606
yes said milady lord de winter   10.417635630169105
i married that woman when she was a young girl   14.378356495563576
come and may heaven hear you   12.15191459160903
with me   10.200323999669582
but to die   9.937530505860057
and yet perhaps there still remains some hope   18.842736417090478
now my work is accomplished my mission is terminated now thou canst neither afford me pain nor pleasure   16.466533168960332
exactly so said d artagnan   10.79880811231815
a terrible battle between the two men seemed imminent   14.073273255445748
why by your marchioness your duchess your princess   4.293436492435626
so the duke had more than enough to think about   16.84966760572237
well my dear aramis you may enjoy that pleasure for one of those three horses is yours   12.952174955317973
and who spoke to him of me   11.938163027310067
asked the lady   11.725515715615314
still i must own i am sorry to be obliged to give up the cart and the group of reapers it would have produced such an effect   8.813913854049442
perhaps some day they will want to make you king instead of the prince of wales or the duke of york your elder brothers   12.603172536593588
madame said d artagnan rising i have only one thing more to wish which is that the next thing you ask from me shall be my life   12.651635015294099
dandré is not a man to be accused of treason   13.970102648945184
dangerous   11.339137157267709
at this moment carlini heard a woman s cry   9.17841632403755
you wish to see me and you come to england   16.013781092406518
i think decidedly observed aramis gentlemen that the son hasn t his mother s energy   16.69542333042058
mordaunt rapidly sprang back a step   13.919315174107426
the first door barricaded with furniture had aroused in him certain suspicions but without communicating his suspicions to any one he had patiently worked his way into the midst of all that confusion   10.956955792740128
the chamber cuts down their salaries every day so that now they have scarcely any   13.762629601671712
now there is one said kitty who appears to me quite a different sort of a man from that poor monsieur d artagnan   7.025444970172333
he raised the cover and saw a kind of greenish paste something like preserved angelica but which was perfectly unknown to him   15.543059415325008
then a launch came to shore took him on board and conveyed him to a yacht splendidly fitted up on whose deck he sprung with the activity of a sailor   9.718818334822046
dantès laid the different things he had been looking at on the table and stood with his head drooping on his breast as though overwhelmed by the perseverance and strength of faria s mind   16.69240623595762
the wall was built of rough stones among which to give strength to the structure blocks of hewn stone were at intervals imbedded   10.819608777259994
he determined to make two cardinals   8.765085010861386
in rome as everywhere else the arrival of a post chaise is an event   7.803008795102274
he cried this is no moment for compliments   9.480727370028216
somebody is coming   15.093174779603038
at this moment the clock of la samaritaine struck six   9.831831124176903
i tore up several of my shirts and ripped out the seams in the sheets of my bed during my three years imprisonment at fenestrelle   13.928828287286798
if you absolutely insist   11.678013733801347
but there is another over me   9.257242519652584
my ideas are never so clear as when i have had plenty of wine   7.532576028025765
i can assure her majesty that if she does not sign to day she will not have time to sign to morrow   8.441002099168811
you did   6.92370869880569
if i wish to leave   14.100081983378601
the idea was welcomed by the prince to whom it was of little importance whom he married so long as he married some one   9.603577597512988
i am completely ignorant   13.347486444214772
a gentleman in his opinion and according to d artagnan s portrait of him the stranger must be a gentleman would be incapable of the baseness of stealing a letter   7.6405822380891015
moreover its port was the last in the kingdom of france open to the english and by closing it against england our eternal enemy the cardinal completed the work of joan of arc and the duc de guise   11.38090004705234
you have promised to save me from her anger   9.844825118843998
felton approached her and said lord de winter who is a catholic like yourself madame thinking that the deprivation of the rites and ceremonies of your church might be painful to you has consented that you should read every day the ordinary of your mass   9.127941236551978
dantès continued at his post in spite of the presence of the pilot until this manœuvre was completed and then he added half mast the colors and square the yards   11.066077150425265
well how much for the equipments   7.013289703142668
i do not say that i did know it and i do not say that i did not know it   12.53088496393918
with your belt my lord   17.459969353953355
you are not so always   8.733198115537746
and bassompierre had little chance of leaving his prison   10.479462383717008
let us speak frankly continued louvieres and act in a straightforward manner   13.013510350083914
come i shall engage your passage   9.58965104056405
that is easily done said aramis   15.947068476774753
14 greek militiamen in the war for independence   13.734458494367107
although a christian may god forgive me i have always sought to revenge my illustrious father   12.863243134747664
i had it from aramis replied the musketeer   14.104031302044698
and she rose with her hair dishevelled and her lips foaming   11.810507580482742
and he offered him his shoulder as another stay and support so that his head almost touched that of mordaunt   17.799642604204998
unhappy girl unhappy girl   6.400225844029925
and yet that is the most simple thing in the world my dear sister   7.784955592911149
as the day advanced the tumult became greater   9.995595196611706
exclaimed rochefort   8.718235539592072
bertuccio bowed and left the room   14.792385497613433
porthos completely used up by three nights without sleep and a journey of seventy leagues on horseback retired to his cabin and went to sleep   12.35090484488035
that s true said athos after a moment s silence that s true   12.081259448244143
that letter you have received and which you believe to be from madame de chevreuse well   11.278063873908534
there fermented in that sublimated brain plans so vast projects so tumultuous that there remained no room for any capricious or material love that sentiment which is fed by leisure and grows with corruption   13.619617212239485
if we put these three men together monsieur comminges said mazarin we must double the guard and we are not rich enough in fighting men to commit such acts of prodigality   9.234867789404781
we hastened to obey this order   12.413492015092455
well then will you do as much for me in paris as franz did for you in rome   15.621554096752337
and if your eminence were to offer to make me at this moment governor of the castle of vincennes i should refuse it   9.175802485492973
this door was guarded by a sentinel and there was also a guard placed in the courtyard ready to obey the orders of the prince de conti s lieutenant   12.64915403300239
these are but indifferent marbles in this antechamber said monte cristo   13.50188400527278
if she flies kill her   10.90971960026222
in proof of which i may remark that while my family remained among the staunchest adherents of the exiled princes your father lost no time in joining the new government   10.433658861291738
it is too bad a habit   13.48658437477976
yes yes continued he twill be the same as it was in england   12.496561653150401
attend to yourself   10.76316532551298
morrel pulled the bell but though he nearly broke the cord no one answered   13.363354099525884
that is not worth while said aramis you can have one of mine   8.787490738378729
the governor then went out and words of pity fell on dantès listening ears mingled with brutal laughter   9.502527923483202
moreover he was a viscount a recently created one certainly but in the present day it is not necessary to go as far back as noah in tracing a descent and a genealogical tree is equally estimated whether dated from 1399 or merely 1815   10.639418035904008
and may god often send me such passengers as your ladyship   13.387214306316556
can porthos have negotiated for it with the duc de longueville   9.618664468801295
then he re opened them and stood motionless with amazement   10.203544951259909
when the chancellor had opened and shut twenty times the drawers of the secretaries it became necessary whatever hesitation he might experience it became necessary i say to come to the conclusion of the affair   6.03613949034156
at midnight the sentinel gave the alarm and in an instant all were on the alert   15.405283622078247
porthos alone made no reply   14.214355861635816
hallo dantès   10.304383748478545
d artagnan turned to porthos   9.347776427550457
shall you be happy if i do what you wish   11.407636258273008
there is the true reason   14.017044206873738
as to remitting a letter with safety to her majesty said aramis coloring i will take that upon myself   9.427327031831183
bonacieux alone   15.233356854515781
but this is indeed civil war which you propose to me dear aramis   7.0841982097167175
your wisdom and your affection must serve me as guides   14.92232052681188
lucien said the baroness i assure you i have no desire to sleep and that i have a thousand things to tell you this evening which you must listen to even though you slept while hearing me   9.73839567687968
but the wine said d artagnan who furnishes the wine   15.506825437244434
one of them carried a roll of paper on which were written these words they are following us   14.393171680133502
is it then so terrible a poison   13.976791133402664
two feet below you   13.445707427624146
at the end of this time he gave up his search and gaetano smiled   13.000460613659964
mazarin was by degrees recovering his senses   9.985824541318765
a door opened through which the attendant and the baron disappeared   5.8381153234909595
ah sighed caderousse a man can not always feel happy because he is about to be married   9.47971956502152
but added he seriously you understand it is on the king s service   10.502861397947434
i am as i trust you do not doubt your devoted du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds   12.713484385104431
relate what has passed during the night since these gentlemen desire to know it   9.58614252072794
and now go mordaunt   11.519706566420973
give him alms bazin and bid him pray for a poor sinner   15.798472752793197
the peasants were in great commotion   7.769254400506811
all day dantès walked up and down his cell   7.974733913207155
downstairs in the decanter   16.572143835054554
you hold the bit too tight and so make his mouth hard so that you will not be able to make him manoeuvre quickly   11.022413503009643
and then we have our hours of recreation and our holidays   12.82986832366093
madame de villefort wishes to remind you sir he said that eleven o clock has just struck and that the trial commences at twelve   10.094799314472583
only think of the poor old man s being so pleased to think that you who were a perfect stranger to him had been made an officer of the legion of honor   13.791897909808979
but to be in the midst of persons elevated by myself to places of honor who ought to watch over me more carefully than over themselves for my fortune is theirs before me they were nothing after me they will be nothing and perish miserably from incapacity ineptitude   8.525550249556776
true monsieur le comte replied d artagnan who felt that by degrees athos was resuming that great influence which aristocracy had over him   12.751662558667935
you can imagine so since i have not even brought my carriage out yet   9.67483472674084
the sharp gaze of caderousse was instantly directed towards the priest s garments as though hoping to discover the location of the treasure   7.330334674863161
well my lord before i became a confectioner i myself was three years sergeant in the piedmontese regiment and before i became sergeant i was for eighteen months the servant of monsieur d artagnan   14.466169878015036
i see said the count in a voice hoarse from emotion   13.855248106153178
the successor of father marteau who makes the excellent pies you know of   12.24356332756538
have you ever seen a snake rise up on your path   12.888169405011716
listen said the guide   8.712147858903508
everyone exists   15.079775776527116
this time said d artagnan when they were sufficiently distant to proceed at a trot i think all is lost and we have nothing better to do than to reach france   12.242306191673528
but if your reason for inquiry is that you may procure a window to view it from you are much too late   17.051480521532202
cried la ramee give me your gibbet my lord   14.587022651063966
i am fifteen years younger than he is   13.620357667667058
martin and the fort of la prée as on their side the french were besieging la rochelle   22.411821449514342
her looks her eyes her smile were all for morrel   14.52193696688665
neffer replied the swiss enchanted that a man like athos could envy him anything   15.3656201992138
unhesitatingly repeated debray   11.578423539244817
3 which he had occupied on his last stay at compiègne   9.279919750163257
but pardon me here are the health officers and the customs inspectors coming alongside   9.833329592703766
and thus by giving them a low place in my esteem and preserving a neutrality towards them it is society and my neighbor who are indebted to me   8.451631081200258
it is nevertheless the only one we can give   3.320934314936542
that he has given the diamond to us only   20.563529345672663
than the son of peter mazarin   4.453518526528789
the closet was empty   11.965279878173634
do you say that m   10.271215267688289
he answered the appeal of his friend by an affirmative nod of the head   13.278020921402124
and he assured them that they would be perfectly satisfied   9.804998583629573
we need hardly say that many of those who gave him this epithet repeated it because they had heard it and did not even know what it meant   13.325726680257226
then with his hands covered with dirt his hair darkened by means of a leaden comb his complexion embrowned with a preparation for which one of his old comrades had given him the recipe he intended by following the wooded districts to reach the nearest frontier walking by night and sleeping in the day in the forests and quarries and only entering inhabited regions to buy a loaf from time to time   13.9832668694685
come if you will only put this scheme into execution and be steady nothing could be better   8.935747396793653
and turning to her grandfather she repeated wa we wi the old man stopped her at the last syllable   11.300757076372408
i wish you may with all my heart if that will amuse you   9.602865015780333
la carconte still kept her eyes fixed on her husband but as he made no sign of changing his position she extended her hard bony hand and touched him on the forehead   3.313379494939813
and why day after to morrow   15.753900143459118
the horses are waiting   13.727043976162355
let us first withdraw from this house   9.32756735036204
but the thing itself is at m   9.115167834442769
give the horses some hay   7.102279503398587
i see you are a thoroughly good fellow and will detain you no longer   15.984313019298858
when i see you merely you look like a reasonable being   10.37621810016535
now said felton we are safe   12.951976209737975
the captain of the king s musketeers   10.861884314821431
d artagnan looked at his friends as if to say well what did i tell you   11.801934860843552
under pretense that he s a king it appears he can not dress or undress without assistance   10.851098820342145
a million   12.92391920085227
he picked up the paper and recognizing his wife s writing ran his eyes rapidly over its contents   13.32589124366444
bravo bravo said franz   7.7264581005915085
on the eve of departure i carry my egotism so far as to say do not forget me my kind friends for probably you will never see me again   12.885826836870416
you see said the young man with an air of sorrowful resignation to faria that god deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for what you call my devotion to you   9.617751704859192
once in france he turned his course toward paris and reaching paris went straight to rue tiquetonne   13.79853117813775
but i wanted first to see if thou wert grown proud   13.438245298343432
god s justice   13.041560018018854
the contract answered dantès laughingly it didn t take long to fix that   14.246922455473223
the thing was discussed for a long time but finally decided in his favor   10.365602298847685
shells   11.033196787104117
then infusing all the humility he possessed into his eyes and voice he addressed the inspector and sought to inspire him with pity   16.962062826490175
chapter 72   12.079427789280885
said mazarin you are worth your weight in gold   15.450437828812841
indeed maximilian did you hear that   12.152096132770847
the snow was falling thick and icy   10.73211660877264
what are you thinking of this evening   12.636089960638147
tis settled replied d artagnan   12.91635716793922
now then let us breakfast   12.412679820954951
that s well madame   10.49304399853526
you have nothing more to ask of me my lord   8.273582216775806
we shall ascertain who and what he is he comes   10.551187958956511
in this case replied caderousse let s have some more wine   14.306167422905222
they were both aroused at seven o clock by the entrance of an unliveried servant who brought a letter for d artagnan   15.257258363164613
the king pointed this out   7.18696966876912
the answer known he had yielded to albert s wish to be introduced to haydée and allowed the conversation to turn on the death of ali and had not opposed haydée s recital but having doubtless warned the young girl in the few romaic words he spoke to her not to implicate morcerf s father   6.292800211233976
the two friends departed aramis to return to paris athos to take measures preparatory to an interview with the queen   8.843561782524006
asked peppino of his friend   12.470491417162139
yes yes signed noirtier   15.303908383009215
at the top of the stairs upon the most conspicuous door of the corridor was traced in black ink a gigantic number 1   9.402724954080945
so suddenly   16.217281383907178
although they gained you much reputation they were surpassed by others   12.031287553844589
oh no he was afraid to encounter him face to face   6.29537507597773
de saint méran oh doctor   7.539987935042247
but a letter which madame bonacieux has received from madame the constable and which she has had the imprudence to show me leads me to believe that these four men on the contrary are on the road hither to take her away   15.087089793811337
he neither supplicated nor exclaimed   12.985805156024384
he sighed and set to work again   11.552236525911193
the register of the birth of andrea cavalcanti of your son   18.16934147826464
you still leave me the love which i have always enjoyed   10.13068560110021
27 do not let us jest gravely replied bertuccio and dare not to utter that name again as you have pronounced it   17.086688549562698
said the cardinal eagerly rising with a promptitude which proved the degree of importance he attached to the commission with which he had charged the count   14.405289406993553
and athos threw fifteen paces from him an empty bottle from which he had poured the last drop into his glass   13.099545821021618
to the left a bedroom and a dressing room   15.52354250820942
precisely what i was about to say cried danglars   9.587486880078114
i have told you of her attempts to propitiate m   9.427103366693657
i will begin again then order to conduct to the person named charlotte backson branded by the justice of the kingdom of france but liberated after chastisement   6.722535014456769
no indeed replied monte cristo with a smile i do not arrogate to myself the right of so doing   15.456704985097232
planchet was armed with his musketoon and a pistol   12.049382244841366
say to him that when he is alone it will help us if he will knock on the floor for then i can continue my work in safety   14.783562930437705
well go down to her then to make your request   11.391946938575028
against whom do they cry out   9.346308641812985
the horses bounded beneath the whip   10.458194336614953
for as you very well know bois tracy is an intimate friend of mine and i can not allow the property of his wife to be sported as a trophy   10.47418311176622
i said nothing for we must have peace in the house   7.91916703794744
god forbid that the queen should suffer the least inconvenience or uneasiness on my account   14.981541976121616
no be not anxious   12.5739843424401
nobody serves me for nothing   11.974396289074214
did you never see him   13.060486425226575
tis some travellers who are visiting the colosseum by torchlight   14.73039453017399
franz was not sufficiently egotistical to stop albert in the middle of an adventure that promised to prove so agreeable to his curiosity and so flattering to his vanity   21.7736175929031
at last when pistache was sufficiently well trained monsieur de beaufort invited the governor and officers of vincennes to attend a representation which he was going to have in his apartment   10.58601068242839
i will prevent you   16.345611159538294
said the lady glancing inquiringly at lucien m   12.857097987049881
the man fell like an ox beneath the poleaxe   12.242604213613845
improve yourself   10.597424104394847
speak then i am all ears   10.068245748698383
was that my soul if i may say so waked in my sleeping body   11.308959890677851
these words were an allusion to the sentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much confidence an hour before   8.228121013193991
all the same i should like to do him that service what do you say to it   15.46452134194134
i have uttered it when frozen with cold crouched on the straw in my dungeon   13.17826680166931
in any case sir you will allow replied madame danglars that even if the fault were alone mine i last night received a severe punishment for it   12.455036158851398
mademoiselle s lady s maid says sir that mademoiselle is finishing her toilette and will be here shortly   12.542297095172382
how could she extricate herself from this labyrinth   13.532953070145178
said villefort he is a noble fellow   6.676965846665548
and athos confessed to himself that he was unprepared for so prompt a departure   9.373234833839948
take this said madame de villefort giving her smelling bottle to valentine   13.574471902261893
planchet my friend interrupted d artagnan you are really a precious fellow   7.858320353321673
he immediately called d artagnan   5.903573711553917
and the only resource the governor had was one day when the duke was playing at tennis to efface all these drawings consisting chiefly of profiles   6.8770210355196975
you see said raoul we have done wisely   12.771802879579232
then calling to the crew he said let go   10.337536053667414
all therefore of the vast resources of his genius were at work night and day engaged in listening to the least report heard in any of the great kingdoms of europe   10.092939309743672
wild eyes the iris of which contracts or dilates at pleasure said debray   17.80922267483284
yes but yesterday at five o clock in the afternoon thanks to you she escaped   12.179791306850511
the idea of asking how i hear the news he said   16.06680634388649
this must be one of your friends   14.219294183164
entirely   9.064472786717136
said villefort turning pale   13.823290379229558
i have one the seal of which i am not to break till i reach london   12.996241472420326
la renaudot warms his sheets   12.661010300036049
i will not dishonor you since that would be dishonor to myself   12.801685653119181
he said taking up his hat which he placed on the red handkerchief tied round his head we will soon find out   12.574096746263889
stop a bit said the dragoon placing his saber like a spit upon the two large iron dogs which held the firebrands in the chimney stop a bit i am in it   13.12712437857717
those glaring eyes seemed to watch over the threshold and the lips bore the stamp of a terrible and mysterious irony   18.973750236143633
but you my dear d artagnan what has happened to you   16.382405167582597
your logic is most powerful valentine but say what you will i can never renounce the sentiment which has instinctively taken possession of my mind   10.93673781690014
the chemist who came here with me   13.088347955624638
of course said the gardener but that does not make it the less unpleasant   13.074107352502569
that is it said the old man s eye   18.541227452145783
and it immediately occurred to us that they were but pseudonyms under which d artagnan had disguised names perhaps illustrious or else that the bearers of these borrowed names had themselves chosen them on the day in which from caprice discontent or want of fortune they had donned the simple musketeer s uniform   17.147605324343054
and he told you nothing   11.993046152186745
make me understand once for all that you are trifling with my happiness that my life or death are nothing to you   10.41423124689685
for nothing frightens old people so much as when death relaxes its vigilance over them for a moment in order to strike some other old person   12.38609735946385
four arms threatening the four cardinal points or turning toward a single point must inevitably either subterraneously in open day by mining in the trench by cunning or by force open themselves a way toward the object they wished to attain however well it might be defended or however distant it may seem   15.92829108497602
you say that the horse was entered under the name of vampa   15.769352891142915
but how do you know all this   6.517557190637563
murmured tréville   14.346964684091356
my name must rest unknown replied franz   10.565210492606878
when such resolutions are made albert they should be promptly executed   14.758035550038116
moderato   13.772675248871355
he then took the cabbage to the room where he had rabbits for the abbé adelmonte had a collection of rabbits cats and guinea pigs fully as fine as his collection of vegetables flowers and fruit   15.908149844243649
noirtier watched her with evident anguish   4.586694053541304
take courage sir   12.286955063052604
chapter 19   8.883086147770962
he thought how one day in a less dangerous situation than the one in which he was now placed he had already endeavored to sacrifice her to his honor   12.865878499529108
in that case said athos planchet must receive seven hundred livres for going and seven hundred livres for coming back   9.120245232437384
and how he used to break the stem of a glass or the neck of a bottle   9.489982449715594
he was in ecstasies   12.659361939859743
i am not called louis the just without reason   13.509865309565306
50109m certainly he said your receipt is money   14.457532364044887
as the door closed after them kitty rushed toward it   9.841669762679745
at the end of an hour she was completely out of sight   10.775854047610585
seeing this the gentleman drew his sword and sprang upon d artagnan   13.270165056216827
i do not condemn you albert   14.570696522727655
de caderousse was murdered by his friend benedetto   14.29370210544373
you believe in sorcerers then you fool   20.033653953324
they went towards the forest and soon entered it   13.836510049570853
worthy wife of such as i am   12.808396663548766
i love the life you have made so sweet to me and i should be sorry to die   13.07839481885724
i am on the earth to punish madame he added with a flaming glance   5.946950687426669
and that is nothing   11.412676738756513
this is strange returned monte cristo seeming to yield to his reflections that you should find yourself without any preparation in a house where the event happened that causes you so much remorse   10.024990385356254
has she then been appointed provost of merchants   12.996651295410853
the evening before the day he was assassinated when he was playing at chess with m   11.63643591527825
it must have been the devil who taught it you was it not   9.482021193699202
comminges went out with a soldier s passive obedience   5.0935695453123
one would say you were carrying me off   14.64381724735112
20039m penelon rolled his quid in his cheek placed his hand before his mouth turned his head and sent a long jet of tobacco juice into the antechamber advanced his foot balanced himself and began   3.877712288588354
extremely replied he   16.377276595134163
mademoiselle eugénie was dressed with elegant simplicity in a figured white silk dress and a white rose half concealed in her jet black hair was her only ornament unaccompanied by a single jewel   11.132137254180659
and your excellency now owes me 4 999 louis   13.776769047082709
did you see him   14.05196476848779
andrea pricked up his ears   8.163446554150081
it was easy to perceive he was revolving some unfortunate idea in his mind   17.95014781729399
his zeal had procured him advancement and he was said to be one of the first who had informed the government of the departure from the island of elba   10.810026609394214
we will soon alter our direction   14.867567152705885
i am gaspard caderousse at your service   11.953510012007065
as for her she returned to her place with a smile of savage contempt upon her lips and repeated blaspheming that terrible name of god by whom she had just sworn without ever having learned to know him   13.409921796113789
he determined therefore to direct his course as clear from it as he could when on the opposite side of the road from behind a rock he perceived the extremity of another musket   16.78882633273221
look at it aramis   15.534933563632189
my lord pythagoras made his disciples keep silence for five years that they might learn to hold their tongues   11.291928937827297
but drink some of this   13.130719550328608
chapter 18   17.683243291203254
yes my lord on one condition   14.194421597275902
what did you refuse to dine with him   13.662441740935265
that man made a deep impression on me   8.068905464024429
said cavalcanti   16.33123410327561
i know monsieur de tréville   11.697013450251745
the interrogatories preceded by a minute search operated upon the persons arrested were almost always framed thus has madame bonacieux sent anything to you for her husband or any other person   7.696419538834661
i made the tour of the room at least twenty times in search of an outlet of some kind   15.655144534026046
do you call that nourishment   15.21558476555642
ah faith   10.216747058306032
teach your flocks that the queen is a tyrant   9.77463770472037
his head hanging down his eye dull his speech slow and painful athos would look for hours together at his bottle his glass or at grimaud who accustomed to obey him by signs read in the faint glance of his master his least desire and satisfied it immediately   8.534150456546477
indeed i am replied the young magistrate with a smile   6.104907697062411

winter s regiment was ranged on some high ground above the camp   12.846209132052989
if you are already aware of the conversation that passed the wooden partition which interposed between us and you has proved but a slight security   11.351761854141275
there living retired or mingling in society as you wish we shall be enabled to use our power to resist oppression and not suffer ourselves to be put to death like sheep which only defend themselves by sighs   17.014557255081925
it is a syllogism   15.283399627509148
villefort entered   11.45548316561707
yes yes she said softly to valentine let her leave   15.761213265217094
for during his fainting we rummaged his valise and found nothing but a clean shirt and eleven crowns which however did not prevent his saying as he was fainting that if such a thing had happened in paris you should have cause to repent of it at a later period   12.51824525302303
but perhaps i shall not be admitted to the grand marshal s presence as easily as you expect   5.207406962937625
your misfortune is laughable said athos shrugging his shoulders   7.092012665620919
my faith monsieur   15.88620317616682
you surprise me   9.131460957833664
the second notary was sitting at a table prepared for writing and his colleague was standing before the testator in the act of interrogating him on the subject to which we have alluded   16.47641593341681
the other will be paid in a year   9.962346830102504
villefort hung his head d avrigny approached nearer and noirtier said yes with his eyes   13.627922385803313
adieu monsieur de rochefort he said   8.550822196382203
her eyes raised towards heaven were watching a silvery cloud gliding over the azure its form that of a shadow mounting towards heaven   10.296403510761735
ah he ll come round thought d artagnan   13.117739478693958
then i heard the well known creaking of the door although i had heard that door open but twice   14.343134896472847
no replied andrea dryly no i can not   14.316797333135098
but you must do the like for me   11.377151539955282
and the coadjutor and madame de longueville   14.959735444999168
a man who nearly killed mazarin between two doors   8.529205618036594
not more than five or six hundred thousand francs said lord wilmore   13.041075855367508
and monsieur leaves me here alone   5.2055614251273425
porthos however found that he had no straw left for himself   12.114534046360873
then internally if renée could see me i hope she would be satisfied and would no longer call me a decapitator   13.383444938478966
if you get out don t take it up again   10.972537798247128
there are no tears in my eyes nor is there fever in my veins yet i see you suffer you maximilian whom i love as my own son   5.893621507106434
no cried d artagnan no steel   16.999009964032936
and in spite of his efforts to prevent it the eyes of edmond were suffused in tears as he reflected that on that spot the old man had breathed his last vainly calling for his son   13.439690478684614
then opening a casket that stood near he drew forth a phial of bohemian glass incrusted with gold containing a liquid of the color of blood of which he let fall a single drop on the child s lips   14.268202837816984
milady who had arisen threw herself quickly into the armchair her head thrown back her beautiful hair unbound and disheveled her bosom half bare beneath her crumpled lace one hand on her heart and the other hanging down   12.035712968227346
and i wish to know what has become of our young man   12.960116258949387
and how do you know it   16.225682485415877

but we will send to the villers coterets and noyon roads and search the forest when we shall catch him no doubt   8.804051724720948
i can not cry   11.478542957796039
oh for pity s sake said she you will live will you not   15.982541891650097
major cavalcanti is already one perhaps   10.611658303034623
as it is not our intention to give a journal of the siege but on the contrary only to describe such of the events of it as are connected with the story we are relating we will content ourselves with saying in two words that the expedition succeeded to the great astonishment of the king and the great glory of the cardinal   10.537868564194664
d artagnan then returned home in thoughtful mood finding a somewhat lively pleasure in carrying mazarin s bag of money and thinking of that fine diamond which he had once called his own and which he had seen on the minister s finger that night   15.862022753068402
the frenchman threw her a bouquet   11.402221066232933
i have work to do   13.101110374139285
you must be aware at all events that it is impossible for me to understand motives before they are explained to me   14.253800080637602
i yesterday engaged a servant who had just left m   6.445597611921472
de cavois instead of m   13.083167527510629
exclaimed caderousse whose countenance flushed darkly as he caught the penetrating gaze of the abbé fixed on him while the clear calm eye of the questioner seemed to dilate with feverish scrutiny   14.440152617113725
the two sentinels at the door still had their swords unsheathed but they were leaning on them while they watched the game   12.077654859297576
but said porthos if he was not crushed completely ah   11.764774168128552
replied d artagnan and disappeared   14.704101827843534
no sir said the honest servant it was monsieur aramis who posted me here to take care of the horses   13.612866082036959
well in the absence of champagne and chambertin you must content yourselves with that   15.045905690150073
the honor bestowed on me is too great for me to be unmindful of it   10.542638053277708
de villefort s house and behind the gate half screened from view by the large chestnut trees which on all sides spread their luxuriant branches we shall find some people of our acquaintance   15.173428066609777
deliberations were being held when a lieutenant in the guards named comminges made his appearance with his clothes all torn his face streaming with blood   12.619706354923046
the marquis de saint méran one of the most zealous and faithful dignitaries of louis xviii   11.942001174872296
it is not for nothing that i am styled louis the just and he signed emery s appointment   13.56682662470023
it was he who told you to invite me to appear with these studs   10.482590217394474
come monsieur come   12.039066785369204
is it not natural that the madman ignorant of his folly should attempt things beyond his power   15.360638585614598
bonacieux s   10.814290855075784
she wore a beaver hat with blue feathers a surtout of gray pearl velvet fastened with diamond clasps and a petticoat of blue satin embroidered with silver   14.271789453775943
but they felt the sacredness of his grief and kindly refrained from questioning him as to its cause while with instinctive delicacy they left him to indulge his sorrow alone   9.824524844865255
enter   12.37079044273974
he assured me that they were two noble steeds   11.789993789463546
he was about to marry her when one of the caprices of fate which would almost make us doubt the goodness of providence if that providence did not afterwards reveal itself by proving that all is but a means of conducting to an end one of those caprices deprived him of his mistress of the future of which he had dreamed for in his blindness he forgot he could only read the present and cast him into a dungeon   13.567952896603424
i have pledged my last jewels sold your clothes and my own to pay his servants who refused to accompany him unless i made this sacrifice   13.729767532158766
said the monk   10.035159166357358
he then took an oath of bitter vengeance over the dead body of the one and the tomb of the other   12.586236823683493
i was to take your dispatches written or verbal and return by post   13.464200467995113
i only said that death alone could check the execution of my plans   13.467758565094925
she had frequently observed the contemptuous expression with which her daughter looked upon debray an expression which seemed to imply that she understood all her mother s amorous and pecuniary relationships with the intimate secretary   13.24516039238686
for it is not life it is merely existence in prison   19.04846789023177
yes before others replied the doctor   10.122408092381214
cardinalists or frondeurs what matters it   17.897540972683455
it will not be a house i shall see but a palace   12.00614518290291
in that case let there be no more question of what s past and let aramis resume the letter from his cousin where the cardinal interrupted him   11.846576404916048
and the count desired me to tell you that he should take advantage of this visit to plead for you and for himself   14.029149748694916
on the day when foreign succor follows in the train of a king to replace him on his throne it is an avowal that he no longer possesses the help and love of his own subjects   10.941804087296934
why with his father no doubt replied danglars   12.825935618366168
whereupon the baroness signified her desire to see you   5.882947451829063
this sediment first took a blue shade then from the color of sapphire it passed to that of opal and from opal to emerald   13.994602411412068
but what signifies that   16.004291624219107
let me rise and obtain some success this very day   13.60493450315781
imponite manus and not manum place the hands not the hand   9.508723538453594
he has escaped by this means exclaimed he   10.763203451470188
you have no idea then morrel   11.781013262139433
i think so at least said the young girl hesitatingly   11.05805690404559
old men are always so selfish in their affection said madame de villefort   13.439486471174535
d artagnan was beside himself with joy   13.148984897834852
the table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope near san pierdarena a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by report   15.637887798754871
yes which catches the thief in a trap and plays a tune   4.048192560140638
i ll tell you answered the countess   8.611251363599699
now he was accustomed to walk with his fowling piece on his shoulder behind the hedges which border the roads and when he saw a catholic coming alone the protestant religion immediately prevailed in his mind   12.276494612108891
vampa then removed the stone and cucumetto came out   9.58137688671206
the count of monte cristo is always an early riser   13.216444443186235
his first care was to see what course they were taking   10.60574756547496
his resolution not to sign lasted two days after which he offered a million for some food   11.879407954428434
40116m drink it said the doctor to barrois   4.243116996216031
bazin my friend come here   10.983397762426033
mercédès although deposed from the exalted position she had occupied lost in the sphere she had now chosen like a person passing from a room splendidly lighted into utter darkness appeared like a queen fallen from her palace to a hovel and who reduced to strict necessity could neither become reconciled to the earthen vessels she was herself forced to place upon the table nor to the humble pallet which had become her bed   9.319897933889234
and the old servant departed triumphantly on his mission   13.40845355777186
was asked a second time   10.62720628712016
we do ourselves justice madame even in assuming the high position that we have   11.568736253393155
returned albert i compliment you on it   13.354737996140368
my dear monsieur de rochefort mazarin replied in a tone of raillery you think yourself still a young man   10.175746367966438
for your example has given me at the same time hope and courage   13.363456180759513
oh shall i then again become a fatalist whom fourteen years of despair and ten of hope had rendered a believer in providence   12.005467586261506
now we have not a moment to lose   10.086649384673828
cried many persons present   8.775130701242986
still my young scapegrace   14.837501057724776
the woman looked up at these words and with a glance far more expressive than any entreaties could have been pointed to her child who still continued insensible   11.34942238485783
besides as that is the exact value of the stone i brought just that sum with me   11.224542777089681
he is extremely prudent and thoughtful   8.432453243268533
most undoubtedly said planchet   14.272084607580702
and if it were not would be sure to become so thanks to the remedies applied by foolish doctors who are generally bad chemists and which will act in favor of or against the malady as you please   11.825382403756297
pistols then at eight o clock in the bois de vincennes said beauchamp quite disconcerted not knowing if he was dealing with an arrogant braggadocio or a supernatural being   5.512972159149418
among the turks   12.878635450947014
abandon my purpose at the moment of its accomplishment   16.351957986904594
two stone steps worn away by the friction of many feet led to the door which was made of three planks   8.335941689311342
lucullus dines with lucullus   8.100866393876837
you should not have allowed him to go said the duke to franz   11.203454754430247
he had recognized intelligence in the high forehead courage in the dark eye and bent brow and frankness in the thick lips that showed a set of pearly teeth   11.545214087408185
i will try to do so monseigneur replied the gascon with a noble confidence   11.00769495884581
vampa was twelve and teresa eleven   10.698034653345495
the messenger obeyed without the least hesitation but rather with alacrity and mounting the steps at a bound entered the hotel   13.15074754545875
he was wrong to leave it there but the jailer was wrong not to have looked before him   11.116303427057492
what happened to the worthy captain   15.758365198550889
at length after winding about for a minute or two mme   6.719209953139128
why about ten or eleven o clock   10.12335086134132
a young man who still adheres to my fallen fortunes passes a part of his time in a belvedere at the top of the house in hopes of being the first to announce good news to me   15.78627992555148
three months passed away then six more   14.354331400143462
d artagnan did the same with a little more concern however for the noble creatures whose merits he fully appreciated   10.299778069418005
mazarin bowed   10.02892195903146
they traversed the width of the village talking of indifferent things then as they reached the last houses go then dear friend said aramis follow your own career   10.166239103820809
question him about the fight said athos   9.699870668131464
the salon in mahogany and the furnishings were of blue velvet   14.507461737984244
general de quesnel accepted the condition and promised on his honor not to seek to discover the road they took   16.99877432555263
this is not the way that i wished to avenge myself said milady replacing the glass upon the table with an infernal smile but my faith   14.103130164134043
he clenched his fists sweat covered his face his hair like hamlet s stood on end and racked with fury he cried out silence sir   13.5308217362798
mazarin felt a shiver run through him a chill even to his heart s core   8.845748925793416
when his son had left him morrel remained an instant standing with his eyes fixed on the door   14.20657475951922
in may we commenced operations and in the course of the month gained 450 000 francs   5.4968267023176125
so much the better mordioux   11.298069492505046

yesterday it was choisy to day it is la riviere to morrow it will be some one else   13.645084104663075
four young men of the richest and noblest families of rome accompanied them with that italian freedom which has not its parallel in any other country in the world   7.6262025182795945
are you not alone   8.18720058678204
we ll gag him and tie him no matter where somewhere   13.726493915784445
if you will help me to drag myself from under my horse i hope nothing need prevent us continuing our journey   11.311636556654472
de rothschild   15.767043567868493
the devil take the madman   6.865597518912949
the bottle was brought with a promptness which showed the degree of consideration d artagnan enjoyed in the establishment   7.312559149826879
asked raoul somewhat comforted   7.2671188942329765
for france   5.8809733082431315
neither of them had returned   10.467154712635544
then one more bold than the rest ventured to pass the door and to advance on tiptoe   5.690134389394781
to think of the parisians soliloquized d artagnan offering only the other day by an edict of the parliament six hundred thousand francs to any man soever who would deliver up the cardinal to them dead or alive if alive in order to hang him   10.10078596772967
in the eyes of everybody it seemed fit for table and preserved its wholesome appearance   13.141279689130094
a furlough is needful   9.485925802198155
and wherefore   10.381770745673066
the face of this young woman was covered with a black velvet mask   11.008171291729777
the keeper spoke for a moment with an official then opened the iron gates and conducted andrea to a room on the first floor   8.91134634499725
had i been as great a friend of jonah as i am of d artagnan i should have followed him even into the inside of the whale itself   13.19646812451534
now as ever i am nothing but your servant   16.360270092040626
i won t have dantès killed i won t   9.441967767013287
aramis spoke so as to be heard by everybody   10.78411346261052
it destroyed in favor of the court the struggle commenced with parliament   9.132825818013181
to die whilst doing a good deed   10.60796324552777
they are lucky here indeed   11.223888044670932
i ve broken my man s skull cried d artagnan   5.001807010990993
four times fifteen makes sixty six thousand livres said athos   12.095799939323395
ah monseigneur cried d artagnan spare me the weight of your displeasure   8.713334011741583
who the beggar was that i killed   8.665374806442808
yes yes yes motioned the invalid   12.582246494413873
is that you dear friend   13.20204055437221
and i should therefore never think of including him in any general order   8.74107442522319
oh it will happen you may be sure said d artagnan   12.514630038489233
they are your compatriots   12.19340107282222
we bring to his widow his sword and cross of honor   10.081604167624565
why my dear mother it is necessary in order to make your advice turn to account that i should know beforehand what i have to distrust   11.55201422500937
but as no one responded to the challenge the friends turned again to the front of the theatre and affected to busy themselves with the stage   13.60262911739434
they will discover us   6.643484343437844
you speak as if you were already her husband   10.737770785421082
but that abduction had for its object the betrayal of my mistress to draw from me by torture confessions that might compromise the honor and perhaps the life of my august mistress   6.881797133421969
emmanuel sighed and summoned cocles   6.699975612280129
i do not think that for he has complained of feeling almost suffocated and asked why the venetian blinds were not opened as well as the windows   12.615043068296888
you see felton the drama has gone through all the phases i named   11.87418649584788
well mademoiselle what are you thinking about standing there like a statue   8.333475863244294
as they went from the hôtel des gardes they separated leaving the street at opposite ends one having to quit paris by the barrière de la villette and the other by the barrière montmartre to meet again beyond st   13.960516760568819
villefort perceiving the abbé passed his hand across his brow   7.6000698093885894
everything said olivain to athos has been done according to your directions   13.789060404100804

athos and aramis left paris after this coup d etat which took place on the very evening of the day in which the parisians had been beaten at charenton   12.229875011750613

an explanation at the opera   9.010037583591282
with the rapid instinct of selfishness caderousse readily perceived the solidity of this mode of reasoning   12.684900764338938
andrea shuddered   14.221565559118037
he visited his own dungeon   10.322802469713361

fortunately the palazzo bracciano which is on one side in the corso and on the other in the square of the holy apostles is hardly ten minutes walk from the hôtel de londres   11.591446628328201
his features bore no sign of that deep emotion which stops the beating of the heart and blanches the cheek   16.895621690575968
that s true said the guardsman astonished that his name had not produced more effect upon the young man   10.432820849734597
he could not foresee the consequences   10.668324720849421
it has happened and i really can not pretend to lament it   13.713161464141866
and it was here that he received grisier cooks and charles leboucher   12.284603002972737

i am quite sure that on the contrary he will choose everything as i wish   8.103674288527753
at the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage which instead of stopping this time at the end of the rue férou drove up to the green door   9.796895534470677
then he added with a smile yet more terrible than his anger it is true then   12.903978967763651
who has betrayed me   10.771920153000872
during the five or six years that he had lived in the strictest intimacy with his companions porthos and aramis they could remember having often seen him smile but had never heard him laugh   10.753288013202603
and the inseparables were constantly to be met with seeking one another from the luxembourg to the place st   18.430914794408324
each boasted the bearing and the courage of his own people   10.250772680077182

i assure you replied the old man i did not turn to that source for recreation or support   11.801448859979077
very well then said mazarin   10.953907534162306
that she owed him nothing but a little gratitude for having delivered her from the men in black who wished to carry her off and that she had promised him nothing   10.465704696116875
at length she felt his heart beat a faint breath played upon his lips a slight shudder announcing the return of life passed through the young man s frame   13.913730115143364
we are lost   17.20001452525544
what fortune   14.79156839270752

she held a book in her hand and her arm was supported by a cushion   10.25227456678606
my lord i am twenty three years of age   12.59708851802587
the night passed in perfect silence   8.942197778320653
exclaimed athos what were you saying just now about growing old   12.15887952441305
his manner became more and more lofty every instant   13.765768068088853

the notary   12.6898436366833
he persisted until at last he had not sufficient strength to rise and cast his supper out of the loophole   10.889987241640162
are you going to leave us count   10.25313809534992
and so my friends we return to paris   12.515886036426998

as for that m   7.907967209233608
the heart beat the eyes laughed and they felt that the life they were perhaps going to lose was after all a good thing   10.301621588788983
ah there   9.22860322478623
but my dear count said albert we shall abuse your kindness   10.104750021539914
have we come to any   7.5491697663760045
for from the moment i have either listened to or heard them i shall be held as an accomplice   14.18900524749918
then did you see him edmond   7.0437279404598225

unfortunately there is a proverb which says that red is either altogether good or altogether bad   6.760277824269638
he had formed an acquaintance with all the smugglers on the coast and learned all the masonic signs by which these half pirates recognize each other   3.1828222069793117
that s the man   7.055100788606661
noirtier saw him seat himself with an appearance of perfect indifference at the same time giving a side look at valentine which made her understand that she also was to remain in the room   11.580531177921262
he turned towards his wife   14.510053940284575
the bad side of human thought will always be defined by the paradox of jean jacques rousseau you remember the mandarin who is killed five hundred leagues off by raising the tip of the finger   13.544161075893008
this is not his writing   11.090338067368249
40122m have mercy on my child sir murmured villefort   13.699414284155711
stay said beauchamp surely i am not deceived   9.116534276592935
raoul motioned to the host to approach threw a crown upon the table mounted his horse and posted his letter at senlis   14.06277759758606
d artagnan as he crossed the pont neuf congratulated himself on having found planchet again for at that time an intelligent servant was essential to him   10.205016074015642
my   10.556074521326803
but instead of the darkness and the thick and mephitic atmosphere he had expected to find dantès saw a dim and bluish light which as well as the air entered not merely by the aperture he had just formed but by the interstices and crevices of the rock which were visible from without and through which he could distinguish the blue sky and the waving branches of the evergreen oaks and the tendrils of the creepers that grew from the rocks   8.456344743615759
oh sir how good you are   12.970298390312244
let me fight like a woman then   14.112099075716408
inquired madame de villefort of edward   8.925341923329619
but we do not invite people of fashion   10.681405305608608
you had dreamed that a ship had entered the harbor at le havre that this ship brought news that a payment we had looked upon as lost was going to be made   7.422315553230321
the weapon as we have already stated was plunged into the body to the hilt and as the surgeon taking it by the end drew it forth the wounded man opened his eyes and fixed them on him in a manner truly frightful   11.956334041631372
besides she felt as we feel when a storm is coming on that this issue was near and could not fail to be terrible   8.672859139281607
no but by browsing the shrubs and trees that grow out of the crevices of the rocks   7.556309328714159
officer   12.910343387692516
scarcely had dawn gilded his window curtains when he sprang out of bed and opened the windows   10.857657159862539
bazin obeyed fastened to the end of a cord the three articles designated and let them down to planchet who then went satisfied to his shed   16.56422581249963
and yet said milady with a persistence that proved she wished to see clearly to the end of the mission with which she was about to be charged if he persists   15.143380533934074
he consigned his unknown persecutors to the most horrible tortures he could imagine and found them all insufficient because after torture came death and after death if not repose at least the boon of unconsciousness   10.73801689700088
henrietta maria and mazarin   10.541047631730653
julie threw herself into the arms of the count   11.709112430315866
well now your hand young man   13.198278306995459
the captain obeyed   14.713422293854038
god who knows all knows without doubt   16.98317212985839
perhaps god will pardon you but i never   13.32299745981079
added caderousse   7.2724140864288245
ah sir she muttered ah sir and this was all   8.614124966583226
no one knows what has become of them   7.9749992719594385
said she closing the window with an expression of countenance full of affection and melancholy   10.708007869577912
you did not see   15.06766987594896
he felt a carpet under his feet a door opened perfumes surrounded him and a brilliant light dazzled his eyes   13.641381929786839
asked the father   11.856520100215446
then aloud and he has taken his ancient name of vallon   7.236547044445941
it means replied mazarin trying to smile and biting his lips in the attempt that our parts are changed and that instead of these gentlemen being my prisoners i am theirs   12.629691593790584
ah it s all over   15.313042571721667
is it not the desire of seeing a husband again from whom you have been separated for a week   9.666476812161921
de villefort and valentine at the same time   12.704423728558462
murmured valentine   10.975135763704003
they were attired as peasants of albano velletri civita castellana and sora   7.005389381038002
a bell resounded   10.391766180049588
the murderer supposing him dead let fall his head and disappeared   11.293575525067212
and he showed the hole i had made when i broke through   11.400780976867805
but you should take me there one day with you   10.677270325546726
for peppino   14.439085975425971
at this rather impertinent order peppino raised his torch to the face of danglars who hastily withdrew that he might not have his eyelashes burnt   14.802967625529684
de villefort in condemning a culprit to death   12.487002267360635
mazarin thought that some one was going to assassinate him and he drew back pushing his chair on the castors   13.248415562506269
the turnkey closed the door behind them   14.661420455597334
well my friend there is not a moment to lose   16.72922585218347
remarked danglars affecting to pity the young man from the bottom of his heart   12.906669285655473
and then it must be confessed fernand had never been hated he was only not precisely loved   10.94394991168165
we will not answer then   11.13686068330477
and at the first glance he recognized their date their country and their origin   11.533436864020466
he was dressed in a doublet and hose of a violet color with aiguillettes of the same color without any other ornaments than the customary slashes through which the shirt appeared   17.26116501255118
gentlemen said he if monsieur d artagnan will surrender his sword to me and join his word to yours i shall be satisfied with your promise to convey monsieur d artagnan to the quarters of monseigneur the cardinal   11.707445271094414
these individuals are under arrest   9.5953067842519
should i have obtained the requisite pardon for peppino the two outside windows will be hung with yellow damasks and the centre with white having a large cross in red marked on it   12.645804490075268
i am commandant of the port   11.76093362251047
she is rich a countess and yet caderousse paused   5.4425731780681375
but you will kill yourself by riding on horseback   5.71413930639139
and gondy bowed as if to leave with the rest   11.120811788859667
it is excellent advice   12.534457601998419
and the matter seems serious to you   13.864250683451667
andrea had expressed a wish to be thus addressed   10.00864288345191
the grand manner of athos had left its mark on grimaud   10.189248038039807
you know sir said the governor persisting that we are not content in such cases as this with such a simple examination   11.63709182691714
it interests me very much cried d artagnan   12.669768909208912
chance is so capricious   8.8734689146275
five or six will inevitably kill and in a way the more terrible inasmuch as poured into a glass of wine it would not in the slightest degree affect its flavor   13.426996659554316
there are few ports that i could not enter or leave with a bandage over my eyes   11.057613028407285
what milady   7.280891846268252
several times even i felt a smile on my lips   19.46555326447831
you mean to allude to the recollections perpetually revived by these three gentlemen   12.870802438016192
he seems to have a mania for diamonds said morcerf smiling and i verily believe that like potemkin he keeps his pockets filled for the sake of strewing them along the road as tom thumb did his flint stones   12.95378127527733
you will then be at my service   15.754452942823395
40046m yes   8.895227115601763
besides besides what   13.286198998606228
but the travelers were firm and he was obliged to do as they wished   11.336477770759734
no one can reproach you for anything of the kind monsieur bonacieux said the young man   9.80078407162647
why three days ago the emperor had not landed   10.725970800289518
no no you must first say if you declare yourself for the king of a day who now reigns or for his majesty the emperor   11.986278556431214
it was benedetto   15.622353550816596
and what is your reason for advising me to go alone   20.609844252230083
well if so why do you object to my doing so   7.638308896088378
the young man closed the door behind him and advanced towards the major who had risen when he heard steps approaching him   14.097274762916578
from the manner in which you walked and talked together one would have thought you were two school girls telling your secrets to each other   13.914376588498513
a smile of terrible import passed over the count s lips   11.910948514228277
then he determined to go up   12.32395373969936
your excellency we must live somehow returned the other smiling impenetrably   16.134288947070914
it was a large cabinet close and stifling with the walls furnished with arms offensive and defensive and in which there was already a fire although it was scarcely the end of the month of september   10.819974287562752
eugénie pronounced these words with so firm a tone that the color mounted to valentine s cheeks   12.947933222733552
silence said felton i hear footsteps   18.438924720236393
then all he has got to do is to endeavor to repair it   15.202270130586465
it would be necessary to prove what tribunal had imposed it on me and i could have made a public appeal to all the tribunals of the kingdom   17.519274352477925
remember i have relations who possess more millions than you have deniers   8.092006523784278
listen beauchamp   8.093434129044386
well suppose i go back to the cardinal and ask him for a passport into all the convents one can find even into the nunneries   16.875649826248072
and i have the same sincerity to show you if you wish monsieur d herblay   11.105241209865842
olivain had ready the horses of the young men and the lackeys of the count de guiche guarded carefully between them the spanish prisoner mounted on a pony which had been bought for his use   12.466578456781228
he inhaled the tones of that young voice as harmonious music   15.188005630926796
the young girl perfectly understood the look and so did villefort for his countenance became clouded and he knitted his eyebrows angrily   9.113956530462552
no do not seek any longer to discover the reason   13.52948882287111
but did you not say that my kind grandfather s precaution had neutralized the poison   14.104665102243569
teresa was sixteen and vampa seventeen   12.347897939469469
haydée   16.5980524479441
she made no effort to remove her lips from his kisses   16.270108829568667
richelieu was a gentleman our equal in birth our superior in position   13.490839485627077
bricconi   11.979433047319558
because they are looking for her where she is not to be found   18.2625554532152
this greatness of spirit in a man who was quite destitute struck even porthos   14.251340888895562
lord de winter on quitting d artagnan gave him his sister s address   11.30275797314298
you promised to bring a knife and to leave it with me after our interview   9.18762469746602
one man alone remained in his place gun in hand   12.47437119113488
this lad for he was scarcely a man simple natural eloquent with that eloquence of the heart never found when sought for   13.069731053108873
thus illumined aramis read the following epistle my dear d herblay i learned from d artagnan who has embraced me on the part of the comte de la fere and yourself that you are setting out on a journey which may perhaps last two or three months   15.258455351853229
but do you not fear that this communication may relate to your marriage   7.146463789536097
all at once the king appeared with the cardinal at one of the doors of the hall   11.474636486831825
he drank to their good health and the travelers returned his politeness   8.967255165631242
he was on villefort s premises had arrived there by scaling the wall   10.011192286852967
when this terrible chain of ideas presented itself valentine was nearly persuaded to ring the bell and call for help   7.925591492258769
nothing replied milady   10.559430490752348
yes we are severed   8.237482823147253
said a loud voice from the staircase which porthos had just mounted   15.584901311825302
at this instant in the midst of the silver circle illumined by the light of the moon the same whirlpool which had been made by the sinking men was again obvious and first were seen rising above the waves a wisp of hair then a pale face with open eyes yet nevertheless the eyes of death   10.97889059600266
and d artagnan went among those guardsmen with whom he had formed greater intimacy than with the others to invite them to enjoy with him this present of delicious anjou wine which had been sent him from villeroy   15.99668257743952
the countess stopped for a moment as if gasping for breath   11.185552456706914
no he replied only hark how he sighs   13.680348716498832
fifty thousand francs for being your father   6.652895365026262
the fever had not abated on the contrary her eyes glistened and she appeared to be suffering from violent nervous irritability   11.414793914510277
and how far back into the past do your recollections extend   15.199171946723716
their disappearance at first caused much disquietude   9.427792327235618

grimaud placed the pie before the duke who took a knife with a silver blade to raise the upper crust   13.727153070492434

i overcame every obstacle and reached the goal   12.87303190289691
the cardinal went up to him and touched his shoulder   8.599414548234499
indeed count said morrel shuddering   15.657684881080332
no my dear vampa replied the count   15.98561022028287
then casting a scrutinizing glance around the chamber the young wife returned to her chair in which she seated herself   10.32846948057195
i have come for nothing else but to tell you so   8.64265210867631

can he be seen without doing so   7.5995555348807855
her first look was at the box where she had seen the count the previous evening so that she perceived franz and albert in the place of the very person concerning whom she had expressed so strange an opinion to franz   15.996024949502335
let this house be the first repaid my son and respect this man   12.673449932873824

unlike other men who enter with ardor upon a perilous resolution and grow cold as the moment of execution approaches the duc de beaufort whose buoyant courage had become a proverb seemed to push time before him and sought most eagerly to hasten the hour of action   13.739678375480617
you are a brave young man said buckingham holding out his hand to d artagnan who pressed it respectfully   10.148577834590766

and i a plain chicken said aramis   14.495747744399102
after breakfast it was agreed that they should meet again in the evening at athos s lodging and there finish their plans   18.87302184401235
the terrible secret was to be concealed till it burst like a clap of thunder over the head of the guilty   11.261839128756286
oh curses woe death to you   17.986959067706852

the day had begun to break when athos arose and dressed himself   14.52325098533829
now said d artagnan i am going to call this soldier and talk to him   10.067521124925902
well then gentlemen said the queen since it is thus and since you are willing to devote yourselves to the service of a poor princess whom the whole world has abandoned this is what is required to be done for me   12.56209162015703
but for real love for true jealousy is there any reality except illusions and chimeras   11.231443073781593
have you any cause of complaint against me or monsieur d herblay   10.148555379316438

the baroness was also surprised and showed her astonishment by a look which would doubtless have had some effect upon her husband if he had not been intently occupied with the paper where he was looking to see the closing stock quotations   13.127474672984393

the earl of essex tis true wore a splendid ring set with diamonds given him by his royal mistress whilst i i have nothing but a simple circlet of gold with a cipher on it and a date   8.1720340970286
and if the worthy broussel were there whom you so stupidly helped arrest i should tell you to excuse yourself to him at once and kiss him on both cheeks   8.126174925637567
one only is still not in our power and braves us   10.977197578832968
albert looked at his two friends not timidly but in a way that appeared to ask their opinion of what he had just done   13.188816529020032
then they looked at one another   10.654473022875305
they then went down to the thames   17.659137630550738
will the place royale suit you   10.496846031866394
but if i can serve you in any way i shall be delighted   12.374838331557402
monte cristo remained as unmoved as if the reproach had not been addressed to him   12.143043931362289
she extended her hands to him with a smile   6.485122419991138
what can i do   15.607194029966706
which is to recover a lost and adored son   17.780096703234335

and that   9.22890598347584
where he fell   11.83738414787877
this horse is decidedly or rather has been in his youth a buttercup resumed the stranger continuing the remarks he had begun and addressing himself to his auditors at the window without paying the least attention to the exasperation of d artagnan who however placed himself between him and them   11.31728465540459
on seeing me die such a death the most inexorable will have pity on you   14.79025465148614
tell me on which point you desire information and i will tell all i know   13.006611143780294
monseigneur your eminence has ill understood my words   9.921455470299119

sir said villefort after the first salutations were over you were sent for by m   10.300576774992116
the valet re appeared almost instantly and having shaved his master assisted him to dress entirely in black   17.60251518833585
a shade of anger and vengeance passed across the usually calm brow of this gentleman   12.054577733505583
had he it before he was imprisoned   13.817552907288873
to the world s end   11.846130147281395
at that moment doubtless she was recalling all her crimes to her memory   9.735339842580919
believe me the cord is more certain than the knife   10.566168464967578
so it is agreed and if porthos makes no objection i said porthos i will do whatever you please   13.73934960471447
oh no not at all vicomte athos replied   12.6039847254543
i live the happiest life possible the real life of a pasha   15.037347466031495
why should i obtain you by violence if our love is mutual   12.692756728361688
but you are unable to oppose them you whose mind is so quick and whose will is so firm are nevertheless as weak and unequal to the contest as i am myself   11.168073113353355

aramis after a journey into lorraine disappeared all at once and ceased to write to his friends   12.387720553334649
in this state of mutual understanding they reached leghorn   3.2460600448841976
june and july were the terrible months with athos   13.950040327808338
oh selfish man   6.707120522934241
my grandfather and my grandmother the marquis and marquise de saint méran will leave me as much and m   13.908035656085277

beware young man   13.328691362541122
his majesty is certain that a letter has been written by you during the day   14.833170215949428
you are about to swear upon your honor and i upon my word and then it will be pretty evident that one of us will have lied   17.625183668126716
ah you see danglars said caderousse winking at his friend this is how it is   9.872530017843966
château renaud who has lived in russia will tell you the name of one and major cavalcanti who is an italian will tell you the name of the other   10.449382439762111
but when it was necessary to convey the prisoner from one carriage to the other the people catching sight of him whom they called their liberator uttered every imaginable cry and knotted themselves once more around the vehicle   11.05712480279573
you are master but if you take my advice you ll hold your tongue   15.426073339831781
he had again missed his man who had disappeared as if by enchantment   17.48262838550542
felton remained in the corridor   18.30782435623068
your excellency will do as you please   14.644436637642846
each guarded a door and served as a rampart to him on either side   12.827508925663349
then it is for to day   10.592062759416931
about five o clock in the evening the island was distinct and everything on it was plainly perceptible owing to that clearness of the atmosphere peculiar to the light which the rays of the sun cast at its setting   9.098531987248396
but this sudden and factitious joy soon forsook the young man and was succeeded by a still greater grief   13.2319887151849
what will you   11.518303121025205
i deliver you up to buckingham   11.729262419113887
and i have not seen him   10.115887200430851
she exclaimed throwing herself into the arms of mademoiselle d armilly her eyes sparkling with the same kind of rage which made nero wish that the roman world had but one neck that he might sever it at a single blow   7.762047141486715
they are like old jews when they are not glittering in oriental splendor   11.254388612056168
julie was at the entrance of the garden where she was attentively watching penelon who entering with zeal into his profession of gardener was very busy grafting some bengal roses   13.296234623245375
well then if like us your excellency lived at leghorn you would hear from time to time that a little merchant vessel or an english yacht that was expected at bastia at porto ferrajo or at civita vecchia has not arrived   12.305850003538238
madame replied the president bowing with profound respect allow me to ask one question   15.807035127700921
she had returned to the catalans and had despairingly cast herself on her couch   12.712477270358661
did you bring it to your master directly it was made   11.617202691381305
dantès blushed   10.824327982048054
and he was alone in achieving an enterprise like that   5.472306740220704
don t forget the signal jesus seigneur   7.519466498627022
no no said he   11.636459684066137
the family is extinct   13.324786425845058
said the coadjutor you are avaricious my good fellow   16.883937234339967
he had moreover looked upon the customs officer wounded to death and whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter or the chill of human sentiment this sight had made but slight impression upon him   8.994317959008018
you have some in the house have you not   12.511222168307023
valentine was expecting him   13.470718314670659
inquired the man with a strong italian accent   13.453899861827235
but it will be necessary for your eminence to do what the other day you declared you should have done in our place cry down with mazarin   13.535642892837014
but at length d artagnan dropped his sword which was broken in two pieces by the blow of a stick   7.956257970095077
but dantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man   15.297327764358329
i remained in my ignorance and the count of spada in his poverty   11.87192151756547
god only knows that i retire from thee without pride or hatred but not without many regrets   16.248118330895494
grimaud hesitated   15.789286629192045
you are right my lord duke answered the officer   14.006125025113004
whom are we going to attack sir   10.188330315161497
and the ridicule will fall on me   11.901089961678583
yes madame another service said athos shocked that the queen did not seem to recognize him   11.471274655443088
when the sergeant on entering the room announced that in all probability he was bringing in two mazarinists it appeared to be the unanimous opinion of the officers on guard that they ought not to pass   11.330485553183987
cried d artagnan you will get me turned off   15.899501975390512
i am sure he hasn t yet arrived   13.13020622178733
though we scarcely expected it our secret remained in our own keeping alone   13.076946399988207
then the news i brought you is of value   10.88462667843339
formerly replied bazin aramis was his name of perdition   9.626678047609493
do not do so reverend sir   11.59804638436318
what can we do   13.28528762978699
where did you study heraldry   11.039492468510169
gladly said albert   8.89763463168373
the cardinal repressed another smile   10.253326894468172
why much the same story   11.18433742406005
there was something awful in hearing the son read aloud in trembling pallor these details of his father s death which had hitherto been a mystery   13.376288920835808
i left it in the pantry because i was called away   13.235589287850775
i will take all the blame on myself if you find i have led you into an error   16.301038206085686
cried felton i can understand you now   11.936252579381474
d artagnan remember this   8.135957226027344
i will find the means myself   7.1520756964438394
certainly a speedy violent death would be a fine means of deceiving these remorseless enemies who appeared to pursue him with such incomprehensible vengeance   15.721163559654345
one moment i beg for here are the chevalier d herblay and the comte de la fere just arrived from london and they can give you as eye witnesses such details as you can convey to the queen my royal sister   9.084553253550997
it was indeed a glorious time   12.15669726605583
but where is the doctor   12.421850703157371
pardieu returned franz laughing in token of your ingratitude   3.8129056591900454
however i have turned the business over to morcerf so pray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you   16.48047768889255
teresa alone ruled by a look a word a gesture this impetuous character which yielded beneath the hand of a woman and which beneath the hand of a man might have broken but could never have been bended   12.245400079354363
come come said comminges who since d artagnan on the day of broussel s arrest had saved him from the hands of the parisians had entertained a real affection for him don t be unhappy   13.723802407899301
hasty actions are generally bad ones   14.616509146909753
repeated the doctor   12.578088482489948
it is not madame bonacieux about whom i am anxious cried d artagnan but the queen whom the king abandons whom the cardinal persecutes and who sees the heads of all her friends fall one after the other   9.054117439999942
perhaps i shall be but at present unfortunately i am not   12.95273514080697
that most sacred in the world said athos   17.279945223265333
here my lords   8.77213147793862
i never like upstarts   7.703678394090055
then with an inexpressibly sorrowful inclination of the head he quitted the count and bent his steps to the east of the city   15.806909872950092
he turned back a door partly open enabled him to see his road and to hear the voice of one in sorrow   12.146090468049513
was it the englishman who carried off 3 000 crowns from here the other day   12.692579498314053
you asked me for five hundred men did you not   11.876523363216473
i was brought here by night so devil take me if i know where i am   12.169610866445254
do you understand madame   14.817504305876328
and he raised the medallion to his lips   7.157567287764043
he put out his hand to remove the object   10.346600899469584
to athos to a man double his age   5.3277003338268845
then seeing that the room was as usual empty and only guarded by the dog he called to his wife hello carconte said he the worthy priest has not deceived us   11.506912699673387
sir said valentine at the height of her terror you say you endured tortures when you saw the deadly poison poured into my glass   11.468592641959862
oh father continued the executioner without opening his eyes as if he feared on opening them to see some frightful object it is especially when night comes on and when i have to cross a river that this terror which i have been unable to conquer comes upon me   12.126991355396694
inquired the abbé of caderousse   13.310219989762981
adieu madame replied the king s attorney as in an almost joyful manner he conducted her to the door   15.586223251727741
but mercédès did not witness his departure although she was seated at the little window of the room which had been occupied by old dantès   11.368607300448048
he is rich then   10.48211084419913
i suppose you read it in the paper in the account from yanina   8.691292340442686
he went up to him but to his extreme astonishment the stranger first addressed him   12.12775963896607
without you   13.581471921953117
i hear said aramis but i understand neither the noise nor the cry of pain   13.835603413247776
the audience m   13.007073416560115
gentlemen return your swords to their scabbards   8.793947577074267
at this moment ali entered   12.067287088358007
this island was always had been and still is completely deserted   12.21442992504514
he spoke upon all subjects except the sciences alleging in this respect the inveterate hatred he had borne to scholars from his childhood   12.311637906470686
as our house is carried on very regularly and we make out our bills every week at the end of eight days we presented our account   9.730282455331027
on the 20th of august it was known at marseilles that he had left town in the mailcoach and then it was said that the bills would go to protest at the end of the month and that morrel had gone away and left his chief clerk emmanuel and his cashier cocles to meet the creditors   10.884706312518498
i should like to see you with a brief preparing in your house   12.984774234492274
i won t be their dupe i will answer for it   12.067996248499393
let the cardinal take care of going alone to visit the comte de la fere said d artagnan   14.281890558451494
come answer frankly   10.191728355037071

eat heartily   9.746127222053245
the hotel de vendome was not less guarded than the hotel de bouillon and presented as warlike an appearance   19.67225537596929
at six in the evening the guests began to come   6.11782089870754
ah my lord tis not easy to make people say what they don t wish to let out   10.627263780632262
albert remained silent and wrapped in thought   6.916506228997837

my political opinions   17.123613444794977
here is the story monseigneur resumed the trembling host   10.791426211369096
he ran towards her   15.021212803544017
in that case commanded comminges silence that old woman   13.97259620294252
but putting his head out of the carriage eh   17.204995127027512
you could not have entertained any alarm on the subject because you are perfectly well aware that i have had for a month in my service the very best coachman in paris   13.967461652086412
you well know my lord that there always remains to us a last resource   13.671117333130343

her grief which she had hitherto tried to restrain now burst out in a violent fit of hysterical sobbing   14.598419028451428
but now it is different   12.50781184617298
i have another name madame i am called athos   8.394466851002203
she it is whom you see here   10.218900456430266
monte cristo replaced the notes in his pocket with that indescribable expression which seemed to say come reflect   9.788999344635283
we will cross the tyne reach scotland and you will be saved   10.404103238198347
this house in past years did ours a great service and has i know not for what reason always denied having rendered us this service   11.660159259860041
and as it is three months since you have been here and though distracted as you must be in your important occupations you have forgotten to pay me my rent as i say i have not tormented you a single instant i thought you would appreciate my delicacy   9.629011420496486
he placed the money in my hands at four and a half per cent nearly five years ago   9.23624057283599
exordium repeated the curate for the sake of saying something   11.411315145798456
villefort retired to his study and d avrigny left to summon the doctor of the mayoralty whose office it is to examine bodies after decease and who is expressly named the doctor of the dead   11.933924886044476
he returned blow for blow and cries of pain began to be heard in the crowd   6.274150795206686
and if it did not how wretched we should be   15.88859371945101
it will make a little change   14.596361347300633
milady however smiled in observing that she excelled the young woman by far in her high air and aristocratic bearing   15.926629188750537
but as soon as they were gone i found this broken sword blade as i was helping to raise two dead men and five or six wounded ones   11.53512493501117
no said the novice but of my devotion of a devotion to a woman i loved for whom i would have laid down my life for whom i would give it still   13.041045240497105
he did not mention a syllable of your embarrassment to me when he knows that alone and isolated as i am i seek every opportunity of making the acquaintance of my neighbors   10.63292250221065
by pulling out a bar and pushing down a door   12.498962510695804
d épinay and himself and that the marriage of valentine and franz would consequently be broken off   13.477156543003858
besides with these men s clothes will you dress here   16.394982672102433
it was the man of meung   11.431678670632948
since that period of history queens have shed tears like other women   8.408430456947725
four thousand nine hundred and ninety eight louis said peppino   15.831074080786678
do you speak to me as a magistrate or as a friend   8.887140313427661
it is so indeed   10.376851339281
oh we shall have the pleasure of waiting upon you answered la carconte with an eager attention she was not accustomed to manifest even to guests who paid for what they took   13.924597574832175
de salvieux s letter embraced renée kissed the marquise s hand and shaken that of the marquis started for paris along the aix road   10.980643575303324
i must ascertain if your insinuations are just and am going now to inquire of the count of monte cristo   12.20715770415386
we need scarcely say that all the paths of the mountain were known to vampa   11.338905722505396
the other was in a feminine hand long and crossed   11.639245860457136
nothing more than natural   13.185189323377097
he has unfortunately too much wit   15.360518140294076
let us be off gentlemen let us be off   12.53900286096384
my dear la ramee said the duke you are the only man to turn such faultless compliments   11.840667833022005
he shed the blood of strafford   11.40940738728121
it is nothing it is nothing   9.481281748436443
he entered the apartment followed by a man in a mask   14.122652645504665
these three windows were in madame de saint méran s room   5.9166300117898185
with steady gaze he awaited confidently the moment for administering the restorative   13.695497948397072
and if you continue you will be compelled to sleep here because unable to stand on your legs   13.374886907322685
but a prudent gentleman may excuse himself from not waiting on his eminence particularly when he has reason to believe he is not invited to make his compliments   15.26117547552739
madame danglars gazed on villefort stupefied to find him so almost insultingly calm   17.794103595607353
nothing is so catching as confidence   12.258683923996147
and her glance was turned towards heaven where a mysterious providence disposes all things and out of a fault nay even a vice sometimes produces a blessing   17.62112806631376
d artagnan remained alone in front of the cardinal   9.933000214141497
fire fire   10.027861519969267
from hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of persons and assassinations in the lower   9.35048708225759
one of my dearest friends   7.712824994135486
he had an excuse for not eating any more   7.988911411462439
bonacieux in morning costume standing at his threshold   12.47316237367845
do you grasp that   12.312578803776297
listen said the count and deep hatred mounted to his face as the blood would to the face of any other   7.431377967663878
but felton called to the officer of the post and drawing from his pocket the letter of which he was the bearer he said a pressing message from lord de winter   12.888011485641986
he remained on horseback feeling no inclination to dismount and sat looking at the bars at the buttressed windows and the immense walls he had hitherto only seen from the other side of the moat but by which he had for twenty years been awe struck   9.171514180320248
but you know the more hearts are worth the capture the more difficult they are to be won   9.555367588824824
i knew it from the fountain head from planchet   13.282174128643316
continued olivain in despair what would the count say if he only saw you now   12.496766680177343
the treasure chapter 19   12.606723925646467
for the sadness generally became more intense toward the fine season of the year   11.143261757355702
but you can sleep when you please monsieur   14.479167385136268
well then assume a cheerful manner as i do   14.45919465182519
all was vain   11.930560544922441
a peer of france   11.181743256152734
de morcerf begging me to attend the opera   12.076024220960768
come in cried athos   13.365643970893084
de saint méran i applied my smelling salts   8.178915097705744
danglars kept up the title of prince   9.278164948549167
then a fearful crash was heard   13.90615079918945
instead of performing your part of this contract as i performed mine you bought me from the scotch cheaply i know and that does honor to the economic talent of your government   17.386182011122315
and he placed ten gold louis in the hand of caderousse   5.879384718513894
besides you are neither of you now your own masters   10.150480419041514
do not let me lose both my companions   8.686726952635347
i will answer for him   10.018935942250065
he went gayly up to the sailors who rose as soon as they perceived him   14.032925202629741
and why was i arrested   12.738074587711559
to interminable ineffaceable infamy   10.238072686004728
as my sole heir   16.913390618631357
she was pale and fair with long curls falling in profusion over her shoulders had large blue languishing eyes rosy lips and hands of alabaster   15.555454686800212
franz was sitting on the spot where he was on the previous evening when his mysterious host had invited him to supper   11.361731289141204
cried patrick   16.690241356780422
you will deliver this letter to milady   13.977875035849117
and those of whom i speak performed great things at one time   12.862214657510714
what you scoundrel   14.986225019690284
franz said no more   16.363903701868292
but from this moment until then let us not tempt providence let us not see each other   13.611985896191689
only during the respite the absence of his rival afforded him he reflected partly on the means of deceiving mercédès as to the cause of his absence partly on plans of emigration and abduction as from time to time he sat sad and motionless on the summit of cape pharo at the spot from whence marseilles and the catalans are visible watching for the apparition of a young and handsome man who was for him also the messenger of vengeance   10.495558974326496
there are your horses   13.140822240010756
exclaimed danglars they have drawn on me for 200 000 francs   15.087792273822757
you have spurs   11.39209934617926
this was more terrible than the first   6.768694037628863
have you not happy rogue that you are have you not your duchess who can not fail to come to your aid   12.706534616478775
before leaving the convent of the carmelites henrietta had desired her daughter to attend her at the palace which she had inhabited for a long time and which she had only left because their poverty seemed to them more difficult to bear in gilded chambers   20.4131216943708
my life has been passed on the high road   12.704740634631404
it was evident that if they one day learned positively that they must not count on buckingham their courage would fail with their hope   11.56620037917097
for myself on the other hand my lord returned the governor when the first rebel should pass the threshold of my postern doors i should be obliged to kill you with my own hand since you were confided peculiarly to my care and as i am obliged to give you up dead or alive   13.358793029380001
his look alone had spoken   12.179254180066788
it is said that he is married to the queen   13.015024629329693
the queen my sister is no longer queen my child   14.024923103137112
everybody except the person who gave it to me   12.215578874635304
and he sighed deeply   15.019397824034499
grimaud rose and obeyed   14.05590105579615
beware sir replied the president you are no longer in the assembly and have only to do with individuals   10.282131423743017
and since you ask for my prisoners i bend sir to your wishes   9.633168385924431
but since i am neither king nor queen nor minister he is not my enemy and i can not accept your offer   10.414204055261049
the point aimed at by every poniard   11.48862806561082
morcerf smiled   11.024019603180731
still if athos joins us well we shall be three of us to laugh at aramis that little coxcomb with his too good luck   8.492376217113572
on the sixteenth day in particular these signs were so strong in d artagnan and his two friends that they could not remain quiet in one place and wandered about like ghosts on the road by which planchet was expected   9.212980971161862
ten minutes after we struck our top sails and scudded under bare poles   11.28762892142434
his plan is very simple   8.69400338333838
and what was his mania   11.180770516075595
but the horses were unharnessed and others put in their places without anyone claiming money from the traveller   15.649444091809595
i had better get on horseback and go and meet her   9.444083456772102
don t you see my brave felton   12.666733876453472
blond   9.659188955924433
there in the twentieth chapter of the life of pope alexander vi   12.009243023768425
cavalcanti who had remained in the drawing room with the ladies was the last to leave the banker s house   12.628003883104169
said the duke this is a bad day or rather a bad night to be out late   15.50764160369261
i have lost my appetite and my stomach feels as if it were struggling to get accustomed to something   6.0342647025571905
d avrigny himself   14.216769627917248
no one would listen or believe me because everyone thought me mad   13.189796814181694
caderousse looked so closely at it that andrea well knew that he was examining to see if all the edges were perfect   11.81695688415712
i won back your harness then your horse then my harness then my horse and then i lost again   15.353087519568616
and with the ten parts of grimaud which are not worth a ducatoon i regained the diamond   10.052239150095465
do you believe you have still a certain amount of it to expend this evening   14.938157315427972
sometimes   12.7464601898038
but without however being able to take his eyes from that ship on board of which he doubtless fancied he could distinguish the white outline of her to whom he had sacrificed his life   15.30520848198292
beauchamp the daring attempt to rob the count was the topic of conversation throughout paris for the next fortnight   10.389751662626846
and a vast number of heroes of that gallant period may be cited who would neither have won their spurs in the first place nor their battles afterward without the purse more or less furnished which their mistress fastened to the saddle bow   9.412797176553251
the idea was not that of a christian i knew   8.357129914603039
one night edmond awoke suddenly believing that he heard someone calling him   9.823082426425962
yes she said and you have still preserved this love in your heart one can only love once and did you ever see her again   6.931810930993575
consequently valentine came up to noirtier on leaving madame de saint méran who in the midst of her grief had at last yielded to fatigue and fallen into a feverish sleep   16.804318578277307
therefore let us separate   7.089256830386712
said he on perceiving aramis   14.975461135221199
20249m well you promise me if i tell all i know to relate in your turn all that i do not know   13.003203917128028
but why has he waited till now   16.892866717879127
finally milady stopped and a bitter smile passed over her lips   10.768589801371988
as to the yard you may do what you please with it   10.67915886611266
but a certain juvenile modesty restrained him   12.593918007151311
and he described to the two nobles the affair exactly as it had passed   18.057831964945365
do you know where i am leading you   11.939043005643324
this is how i transact business said danglars   15.598578309887976
i will slay you   12.654244448167912
come and converse with us for just five minutes sword in hand upon this deserted terrace   10.330440591692376
the deed if you please mr   11.282212376571435
i have his letters said she   8.021764491706067
i will go said the monk   13.221700380955527
de tréville on leaving the residence of the lieutenant criminel and the governor of fort l evêque without being able to find athos arrived at the palace   13.76603350569684
that might do if we were dealing with englishmen or germans   13.25843242348338
but in order to have known everything so well you must have been an eye witness   15.72646742071534
but do you think we shall find the count at home   12.03066672967894
coquenard wished him all sorts of prosperities   7.232723431868276
immediately and according to custom the ramparts of fort saint jean were covered with spectators   13.984468775595282
meantime you see that the lackeys saddle the horses   12.29775120914077
a prisoner repeated porthos quite dejected   9.642109643417868
laporte said the duke in a dying voice laporte do you come from her   7.955071882070373
we shall have the pleasure another time said the countess   12.76380822256544
now the successor of pere marteau had promised him a pate of pheasant instead of a pate of fowl and chambertin wine instead of macon   5.6767513605175175
while at a sign from edmond the rest of the company ranged themselves as they found it most agreeable   6.848991608952167
the young men therefore had reason to consider themselves fortunate in having the opportunity of hearing one of the best works by the composer of lucia di lammermoor supported by three of the most renowned vocalists of italy   13.948389012240387
d artagnan bowed and followed the queen   16.013336027749265
it is indeed the bagdad and bassora of the thousand and one nights   8.801143247216842
athos approached and hung over the youth in an attitude full of tender melancholy   13.960587238893192
it is well said monte cristo   18.16599872728475
as for me i consider the union with mademoiselle danglars a most suitable one   16.410866502720957
weigh your words before you speak for my eyes have already become brighter and my heart beats strongly   17.3563206638425
they found athos in profound despondency   13.47326548830651
but as soon as she perceived the other two men she fell back and they went into the chamber   16.779671094688062
what are you looking at   11.80882364657997
he sat down and monte cristo placed himself opposite to him   11.029894900094755
he told me your life was his and i have promised him that you shall live   13.114267693508486
chanleu whose fire at one time repulsed the royal regiment thought that the moment was come to pursue it   15.348856837074353
d artagnan to be preparing his exordium   14.768824984592644
again the abbé had been obliged to swallow a draught of water to calm the emotions that threatened to overpower him   15.704615185161
and do you never use your eyes which must have acquired so much finesse and certainty to divine at a glance the kind of man by whom you are confronted   11.463920094917512
anquetil   5.751272655303682
the tumult continued to increase and seemed to surround the palais royal entirely   11.307385823911812
sir replied mordaunt i have ordered the two prisoners we made this morning to be conducted to my lodging   9.58988085369595
and you killed her   11.96499287424552
and as they were loading the last musket grimaud announced that the breakfast was ready   14.398383220372391
it seems nevertheless come gentlemen come   10.310536138997891
here it is said aramis with a little look of diffidence which however was not exempt from a shade of hypocrisy vous qui pleurez un passé plein de charmes et qui trainez des jours infortunés tous vos malheurs se verront terminés quand à dieu seul vous offrirez vos larmes vous qui pleurez   12.880149889356607
asked he again   12.593371938610495
you have never heard his name   15.379940979385056
all these rooms which communicated with one another did not inspire porthos favorably   11.841230653077794
shall i give you the change my officer   12.28864366695659
when they reached the street aramis said well athos what do you think   10.235344476875818
i shall never forget it replied d artagnan   7.876509294549251
well if you know them you know that they are good and free companions   9.536766071024395
the blade was red for the blood had become rust   16.732028592262807
de boville your fears are unfortunately but too well founded and you see before you a man in despair   12.106025419595948
and now that we are acquainted superficially at least with the masters and the valets let us pass on to the dwellings occupied by each of them   9.91801266718537
he lost all together with twenty five pistoles for which he had given his word   5.038155210561212
but listen porthos though monsieur mordaunt was a man not to be despised mazarin is not less strong than he and we shall not easily succeed in drowning him   11.36050245100169
no said felton   13.392931105233123
should it not be found in the possession of father or son then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said dantès on board the pharaon   12.036122682126678
faria had just sufficient strength to restrain him   13.95236832529537
the first day he broke all the doors in with a single push of his shoulder   9.690612130525736
they arrived at amiens at midnight and alighted at the auberge of the golden lily   10.9640214406272
he has a letter of credit on me so i must see him when he requires his money   9.636492759146288
and the duke   6.597672201156102
from this moment i have done with the past and accept nothing from it not even a name because you can understand that your son can not bear the name of a man who ought to blush for it before another   17.351657501716154
unluckily as i was then in bearn on account of my father s death the letter followed me there   12.80842344825468
he would not have believed that two sentiments so opposite could dwell in the same heart and by their union constitute a passion so strange and as it were diabolical   8.580611828066335
cried d artagnan you could not have arrived in better time   15.282389394269094
but god forgive me   12.735167824434882
she perceived felton who sat with his back toward her   18.134838935284364
ah you do not know with what i am threatened   11.453917929003847
will you take it   17.537757454054674
swords then   18.257530049833523
de morcerf went out about half an hour ago   13.167769012754354
but d artagnan was so preoccupied by the mistress that he noticed absolutely nothing but her   10.598725126038547
in two seconds the young man had reached his room and burnt caderousse s letter   12.135636315520859
our blow has failed for to night   11.097851347963632
why does the boat go so fast   10.919989201843972
what do you say to it aramis   16.211240386083947
we got separated in the crowd and i could not find him again   13.735812872078455
no no cried the countess   10.564063114526693
it can not be   12.174986725299808
by a rapid movement which the gendarme s practiced eye had perceived dantès sprang forward to precipitate himself into the sea   14.624956342817717
i have pledged my word and shall feel pleasure and happiness in adhering to it   15.861799853361145
said he with slight emotion   10.983005836432532
mazarin himself who was well accustomed to the domestic outbreaks of this disturbed household was alarmed   12.400335711179222
my boy said caderousse sententiously one can talk while eating   9.11950235459457
the gascons are the scots of france   11.992551263279726
i can not believe continued felton in a voice that became more sharp and rough that your grace knows that it is to milady de winter this relates   15.927248710538864
hoarse shouts were heard from the excited mob   9.633901260378773
exclaimed caderousse   13.992496316299375
you forget that beautiful handkerchief with the coat of arms   9.33634967229345
what am i to do madame   8.949358498149701
for my father   8.736331038572974
listen to him   13.337698155855803
but observe cried d artagnan that there is a woman in the affair a woman carried off a woman who is doubtless threatened tortured perhaps and all because she is faithful to her mistress   11.77598327348566
and he sat down in the hall choosing a conspicuous place   12.903062526749004
on leaving monte cristo he walked slowly towards villefort s   15.78897775038568
next after monsieur de condé comes the duke of orleans   8.56420798626051
but delay may ruin our plan sir replied the young man   9.444776239729023
come here sir said urban an old soldier who had served under the cardinal duke in all his campaigns   12.74378974735327
bazin made a despairing sign which meant that while perhaps he approved the moral he altogether disapproved the tone in which it was uttered   14.356235420246529
this is the order he said   15.263747064877062
caderousse was like fernand enrolled in the army but being married and eight years older he was merely sent to the frontier   10.886490517745992
morrel smiled with an expression very like a grimace and then turned round to monte cristo as if to ask him to extricate him from his embarrassment   9.148107466677121
oh how charitable kind and good you are   9.621183011090077
if you received the work electronically the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund   14.233854202991187
he would only send you another formed of a magnificent sapphire or hollowed out of a gigantic ruby   9.604272087579389
well this route is impossible   11.512124179215682
all at once the horse stumbled against a ridge and then placed its foot on the sand   14.78448322425216
no louise no   18.390563557551804
no jesting upon that subject gentlemen said porthos   9.621722778087904
no but franz has   12.207527165179743
d artagnan that man of iron who seemed to be made of nerve and muscle only had struck him with admiration   9.838849899538374
well my friend fortune is inconstant as the chaplain of the regiment said   17.865642224449026
the papers said something about it did they not   11.260261598236154
he felt ill at ease and at a loss what to do   10.677933239427793
and your princely father is he rich very rich   6.922621986255036
the agent arose and having bowed to lord wilmore who returned his salutation with the stiff politeness of the english he retired   13.12023908321779
stop and let us talk   13.340236727845681
at this moment hope makes me despise their riches which seem to me contemptible   12.281072078112487
a quarrel and what for gentlemen   10.352730432361977
at the end of a week he wrote as well with this pen as with the stylus   9.666210746247836
i make no secret of it   13.825704164611619
morrel was leaning against one of these mechanically fixing his eyes on the graves   13.202193382907716
we have offered any sum but have failed   9.3694418249977
above the king there is god   9.938192997007405
for form s sake the chancellor paid a visit to the pieces of furniture named   12.082048754918382
you are going to find your servants your horses your carriage and your betrothed   12.481683238222844
what are we to do then to night   12.941467829310536
i will take the five scraps of paper that i now hold as bonds with your signature alone and here is a receipt in full for the six millions between us   11.958885158609437
they will promise everything for the sake of the money and on the road fear will prevent them from acting   9.481373050117288
she saw the deepest terror depicted in noirtier s eyes   12.170349211426455
it is for that reason i am delighted to see you continued the abbé although you have disturbed me in a most important calculation which if it succeeded would possibly change newton s system   9.657957122602548
the rue richelieu and the rue villedot were then owing to their vicinity to the ramparts less frequented than any others in that direction for the town was thinly inhabited thereabout   12.989455242860009
porthos followed the lieutenant with that profound confidence he ever had in the wisdom of his friend   9.542862757203352
d avrigny cried she in a stifled voice   12.823084487195567
i can only promise to examine into your case   12.091960731847923
in the morning the jailer brought him fresh provisions he had already devoured those of the previous day   13.899088617365695
my dear fellow i mistrust women   17.77865743213023
impossible impossible   11.890613371670113
so that you and valentine who are so attached to each other would not be separated and you would be able to pursue exactly the same course of life which you have hitherto done and thus instead of losing you will be a gainer by the change as it will secure to you two children instead of one to watch over and comfort you   11.796141127854355
how strange continued the king with some asperity   13.538970079599457
the colonel neither had nor could have any suspicion   18.745165562893064
answer then   15.271462779652392
no for he has gone again   11.001250910242124
you destroy everything   16.965121968405743
but when seeing her so lovely and her brother so pious nobody thought of asking whence they came   9.9421281606019
by degrees the wind abated vast gray clouds rolled towards the west and the blue firmament appeared studded with bright stars   10.754753119461451
noirtier who on the previous night was the old jacobin the old senator the old carbonaro laughing at the guillotine the cannon and the dagger m   4.39528859824575
i can not have deceived myself he said   14.881439468507015
look at aramis now   8.331679392028406
nevertheless rapid as the movement had been d artagnan had had time to get a glimpse of the head of an old man   12.517051672808995
coquenard distributed this dish to the young men with the moderation of a good housewife   8.610145441709912
on their part the french on seeing the four friends return at such a step uttered cries of enthusiasm   12.560861156303432
in your situation distrust those who are well provided with every formality   12.897992103449733
oh said julie pressing the purse to her heart no no i beseech you do not take it for some unhappy day you will leave us will you not   13.058940572900829
franz again interrupted himself and wiped the cold drops from his brow   7.264824313987704
jacopo seeing him fall had believed him killed and rushing towards him raised him up and then attended to him with all the kindness of a devoted comrade   14.425769271116321
no for i am only embarked in certainties replied danglars with the air of a mountebank sounding his own praises   14.326181879807015
if i had any doubts as to my misfortune these doubts had vanished in an overwhelming reality   12.979530195784607
they have closed up the grating with a board   13.625443806548338
and a bitter laugh escaped the count   10.861154463256852
d artagnan bent down to his horse s neck the young man fired and the ball severed the feathers from the hat   15.757367643116769
the daughter of m   11.954048211860535
the general fell then in a loyal duel and not in ambush as it might have been reported   8.890940506150478
they had left the ile ratonneau where the lighthouse stood on the right and were now opposite the point des catalans   11.308082082640246
what is your errand then with me sir   13.199817664986874
monsieur le comte monsieur le chevalier if ever i am king sire you have already done us more honor than simple gentlemen could ever aspire to therefore gratitude is on our side   7.344448806131345
whoever hesitates for a second perhaps allows the bait to escape which during that exact second fortune held out to him   11.975132964819368
because then i have no responsibility   14.687953476208937
very ill replied the wounded man   13.005082230272327
i maintain my original resolution   11.932633545056289
gervais on which the great cardinal had three fleurs de lis embroidered   16.229217668333128
30 in the avenue des champs élysées   15.827722953212735
i said felton i do not fear him nor will i spare him   12.666821203954743
the guards of the cardinal perceiving his youth and that he did not belong to the corps invited him to retire before they attacked   12.097592344403862
cried felton he again he always he   12.707754625401945
oh cried julie i have not lost all hope of some day kissing that hand as i now kiss the purse which he has touched   15.30725616630055
i neither ill use nor ill treat my servants by word or action   7.020105788150865
then he had eaten some without saying a word more   5.7318333356403945
but when it concerns your majesty s service then added he looking at the queen with all the grace of former days i precede the count   15.98425329153748
albert remarked this expressing his fears lest at the outset the parisian mode of life should displease the traveller in the most essential point   11.162413859196178
they are destined to produce at least ten   13.910946985460761
from you   6.801041315528595
i don t ask porthos   10.933561795628966
you know the calamity that has happened to us do you not   12.25134231302956
it was planchet who brought into play profitably the recollections of the regiment of piedmont   13.040620348339768
aramis went off at once begging athos not to remain alone within reach of d artagnan and porthos   9.139067247065185
at their ball   12.64737142864354
bonacieux whom d artagnan had pushed into the hands of the officers denying him aloud although he had promised in a whisper to save him   16.280255082270138
some wine   11.035795932933912
he thought directly of his bag and rushed from the inner room where he was sleeping   15.584534525657237
dantès you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him and you will see it will bring tears into the old soldier s eyes   15.266232080876305
porthos without reply retreated a second step   12.633278514116343
and falling back exhausted he closed his eyes   18.366598367395774
40042m the same deadly silence succeeded these words   16.866187148539066
write that name on a bit of paper lest i should forget it   12.578515503847793
this noise redoubled when d artagnan with a company of musketeers placed himself at the gates of notre dame to secure the service of the church   12.955923955068226
this made the keeper turn around and he burst into a loud laugh   8.558691737461913
give it to me said the duke   6.483748298483206
you mean to say that he betrays me   13.246199720654868
probably said monte cristo with his imperturbable tranquillity   15.789319608797907
do as you think best d artagnan   10.831137975360317
come this way gentlemen   18.58820263627153
a tear which appeared in the old man s eye expressed his thanks to the doctor   11.647681787644782
he saluted the count with the air of a man who is aware of the rank of his guest   12.240357088192548
the cardinal therefore got up perfumed himself dressed and went to the queen to tell her what had detained him   12.041268992788233
only i am not come to discuss politics but to inquire if you have anything to ask or to complain of   5.0378300865582215
my father my father   12.571841181785766
madame de bois tracy asked me for one of her friends who resides in the provinces i believe for a trustworthy maid   12.930865743262489
dantès was on the way he desired to follow and was moving towards the end he wished to achieve   11.602536063034346
in a dungeon   11.378892796538324
i know what you mean   16.469531074043694
monsieur grimaud he told us his name although he does not talk much monsieur grimaud then went down to the cellar wounded as he was   14.010962735056879
meanwhile they gave up to mazarin the handsomest room in the chateau   12.310249961013625
how have i deceived you   12.02286622590775
count said emmanuel when they were at the end of the place royale put me down at my door that my wife may not have a single moment of needless anxiety on my account or yours   6.492612013286385
and who affirmed as i said that he had received orders from his master or mistress to place the horse in my stable without informing me whence it came   11.89798610869608
but however all other feelings may be withered in a woman s nature there is always one bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart and that is the shrine of maternal love   14.379073491408064
ah said he i hear a human voice   16.211751741221494
who supplied you with the materials for making this wonderful work   13.242268390089546
when you can not do so it is indiscreet   11.296171186611355
and a little bit of a thief   12.170855074446308
they are spanish smugglers said he   15.815041964885108
i thought he was up to something   12.220053023490483
and of whom you have no more knowledge than i of the abbé busoni   12.508671825366273
and when he had discharged his two pistols what a terrible noise he made with his sword   15.670520109217845
full pardon was accorded to those who had aided in his escape   14.226779354949825
morrel i thank you in the name of my father and of mercédès   15.700927627408838
the side windows were hung with yellow damask and the centre one with white damask and a red cross   7.491711079284377
although the young man was brave as we know he was terrified at that wild countenance those terribly dilated pupils those pale cheeks and those bleeding lips   6.884126752490112
as for aramis of whom we believe we have sufficiently explained the character a character which like that of his companions we shall be able to follow in its development his lackey was called bazin   8.741073999421696
on the sunday following i did return to him   11.841109188141784
and a frightful demoniac laugh finished the sentence which was lost in a hoarse rattle   16.998462083501654
pursue your chase after him tomorrow as eagerly as you please   14.351751746229139
review your life albert   13.029759186200636
you think i shall deprive you of those three millions said danglars   20.416885035346063
my carriage is at the door madame and i must be in rome in five days   9.661019058315041
what are you eating there porthos   12.257762803552126
because he is the brother of coligny   7.839598666028308
0035m yes here i am said the young man with a promising future and a little money   11.191024608467178
thought the gascon here s a young blade who has already his love affair who doesn t at all agree with athos in his hatred to the fair sex   11.083071617473733
la ramee then proposed to send some one to pick them up but the duke remarked that it would be losing time   11.90114307112542
consequently the procureur is very active in the affair and the prefect of police very much interested   7.930532697565319
and me too monsieur said blaisois   15.989101596852336
in that case your son would be very unpleasantly situated   10.597566169613767
has mankind treated me as a brother   12.746676128359974
well you the cardinal would have given you letters of nobility   15.538163398988031
then accustomed to passive obedience he jumped down from the terrace ran toward the lane and at the end of twenty paces met d artagnan who having seen all was coming to him   14.017731343846116
no doubt his ideas were arranged in a few minutes for he began reading the letter which caused so much uneasiness in the heart of the baroness and which ran as follows madame and most faithful wife   13.680218147038143
well then be more affectionate my dear villefort said the baroness   10.159754603092574
poor fernand has been dismissed continued caderousse   12.942512160307276
chevalier take my hand   13.069450332276858
dantès would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his favor   16.03357615268663
i shall wait for you here till seven   12.10460370060267
he flew then rather than walked toward the convent of the carmes déchaussés or rather deschaux as it was called at that period a sort of building without a window surrounded by barren fields an accessory to the preaux clercs and which was generally employed as the place for the duels of men who had no time to lose   11.5101283430166
advancing a few steps toward the queen he knelt down   10.118725965386096
from the death of the late king till the young one came of age without reckoning wars and sieges seven times   7.095079076603991
at this moment la ramee after the interview we have described with the cardinal entered the room   17.904538058391196
said he to him   14.671273348154608
those who have read the memoirs of mme   12.374249758914143
it depends on the distance he may be from the city whether he gives eight hours twelve hours or a day wherein to pay their ransom   11.690754497566125
and will it be the first time you have ever been there dantès   5.381092468289161
it was only a precaution   15.857353886823491
no pardieu   13.880918440695652
adieu my charmer   11.650815556148105
and who thus advised you   14.147816325783046
they fetch a doctor who opens the dead body and collects from the entrails and stomach a quantity of arsenic in a spoon   15.013158673485425
despite the weight of two bodies the blast of the hurricane shook them in the air   9.133694268412627
what brief   7.985559095913855
i don t think they can be in need of any   9.058203244452168
ah just so said albert   9.652644852644979
how he had scaled the wall by fastening cramps in the interstices of the stones as he ascended to give him foothold   11.067384878592847
but however the mind of the young man might be absorbed in these reflections they were at once dispersed at the sight of the dark frowning ruins of the stupendous colosseum through the various openings of which the pale moonlight played and flickered like the unearthly gleam from the eyes of the wandering dead   7.54911632396858
this was not however a rope ladder but a ball of silk cord with a narrow board which was to pass between the legs the ball to unwind itself by the weight of the person who sat astride upon the board   11.112719785378168
madame said mazarin your majesty overwhelms me with flattering distinction   10.309867849909452
no sir they were carried off instantly and had not even time to tell me why   7.759881522447328
you say i say that monte cristo is an island in the midst of the mediterranean without inhabitants or garrison the resort of smugglers of all nations and pirates of every flag   12.556189937313409
athos dwelt in the rue férou within two steps of the luxembourg   9.326630102960902
caderousse scarcely yet relying on this promise put his legs out of the window and stood on the ladder   12.124311859404944
but remember at the expiration of that time no delay or subterfuge will justify you in m   8.98052004047397
you attached great importance then to this postscript my dear monsieur cavalcanti   12.441188471739135
asked morrel after he had read it   13.07200332142756
mousqueton said d artagnan you must render me a service   11.380114592403206
30223m ah yes said monte cristo smiling   8.583243663194764
lord de winter was not at home   16.08599733096724
and were these four men attached to each other true in heart really united   17.17943430200408
but some of the horses could no longer sustain this pace   12.055705659170084
but how is it that we are incurring greater risks than athos and aramis   5.6568345281662875
i am lord de winter baron sheffield   14.12497786238005
and having done so entirely on my own account be it understood i would add that i believe you too gentlemanly to refuse giving him some explanation concerning your connection with yanina   13.888163538389101
maximilian and emmanuel looked at each other   12.692852071544928
arrived at the angle of a street he pointed to a small house isolated solitary and dismal   7.875449992437804
i know you to be a man of resolution   10.55746794872858
well this time athos said d artagnan upon my word you are mad   13.550220035203703
are there any fresh instructions   13.764008159945488
along the wall sir said mazarin there will be no danger of losing yourselves   6.615732864592474
in short his whole appearance produced on the mind the impression of a corpse with living eyes and nothing could be more startling than to observe the expression of anger or joy suddenly lighting up these organs while the rest of the rigid and marble like features were utterly deprived of the power of participation   11.48967082993089
when i see her majesty embarrassed i shall conduct her to rueil make her enter the orangery and show her a certain spring which turns a box   10.040307052734729
the indictment the judges took their places in the midst of the most profound silence   16.249266113158974
but there are oubliettes   13.1388336996563
the worn out steps were old acquaintances of his   6.934094864616673
the second act passed away during one continued buzz of voices one deep whisper intimating that some great and universally interesting event had occurred   11.918810354954555
he made a step toward the muskets upon which the other three friends had fixed their eyes like men ill disposed to allow themselves to be taken   12.000051172875168
other footsteps going and coming were now heard and a moment afterwards the noise of rustling canvas reached dantès ears the bed creaked and the heavy footfall of a man who lifts a weight sounded on the floor   9.060838704011832
inform this dear friend that he may remain within that i shall go and see him immediately   12.14428089768178
evidently he did not understand his meaning   11.431433667910088
poor dear girl   16.307168017157395
if there really has been a crime we will investigate it   16.57834448187434
in execution   11.211648571001108
one day when the king had halted to fly the magpie and the four friends according to their custom instead of following the sport had stopped at a cabaret on the high road a man coming from la rochelle on horseback pulled up at the door to drink a glass of wine and darted a searching glance into the room where the four musketeers were sitting   11.37051815834904
in my opinion a withdrawal from paris is absolutely necessary after the double catastrophe of mademoiselle danglars broken contract and m   13.600696418242464
the matter being thus decided the two friends found about two hundred paces further the tavern indicated   11.545765763637759
thought porthos as he walked away it appears i am getting nearer to monsieur coquenard s strongbox at last   7.900551807058746
i told her my orders from m   11.242315150261595
during the exchange of these two words felton drew back quickly and when lord de winter entered he was several paces from the prisoner   12.400628844673392
he sank into his seat and hastily turning over the packet drew forth the fatal letter at which he glanced with an expression of terror   15.81845525954052
the gentlemen entered and remained standing but at a motion from the queen they seated themselves   5.807421411300391
but what step would you propose to me   13.634236311226035
gaetano skirted the light carefully keeping the boat in the shadow   11.126472236165284
oh yes more than once but always in vain   14.811082347370888
am i deceived   15.79165351428661
but on turning around he saw the beggar between him and the door   13.117036324634459
monsieur le prince   16.353365471013852
that gentleman your friend defended himself desperately   7.78265578966397
i will summon him hither   10.9886715439326
the fellow is not so drunk as he appears to be said danglars   10.937177036029075
at every stroke a jet of blood sprang from the wound   9.87874154066855
the other was a large square epistle resplendent with the terrible arms of his eminence the cardinal duke   6.767411271873065
said he you have just lost one woman whom you call good charming perfect   11.071990525225388
she had the less motive to resist resistance would make so much noise   8.732735810017427
and i can almost say that with my own ears i have heard the clauses of the treaty debated   9.194103940858936
all i ask is that villefort will be firm and inflexible for the future in his political principles   11.391040558441635
things take a different name and the vulgar do not follow them that is all   10.797277455948006
if it should even compromise me a little said monsieur de comminges with a smile still make your demand   13.97390383676856
tire to him   7.4568703981592215
if no obstacle occurs we will both charge together force the enemy s line and throw ourselves into the tyne which we must cross either by fording or swimming   11.094559218995386
think of it sire   13.387801940937582
and yet i may not ask for an explanation madame replied monte cristo bowing   9.329597559642107
what a dire misfortune   13.027345811820352
it was many years since d artagnan had opened his heart to any one   10.991292779338133
and how much did they possess   12.299976089088673
yes yes said la ramee the matter concerns you for you will have the honor to serve us   10.352517678223618
cried danglars grasping him by the arm or i will not answer even for your own safety   19.06820058802112
there were only chimeras and illusions   13.086848099969565
you will find yesterday s report of the minister of police   14.64334469743374
but if a large fortune produces happiness danglars is happy   13.410754463703869
it is unnecessary to state that in the eyes of the young man valentine did not suffer by the contrast   11.809921815527384
at the first cross street andrea stopped his horse and caderousse leaped out   13.500199961110617
a letter addressed to monsieur de tréville captain of the musketeers   13.409520305597857
excuse me mr   12.065734017828824
then some verses to compose which madame d aiguillon begged of me   5.783081141820263
come come said the old man be comforted my poor child   16.25705684077142
through the crevices in the granite he had seen the two young peasants talking with the carbineers and guessed the subject of their parley   7.837642289877446
i waited your orders said d artagnan crossing swords   9.365853143232133
what does he want with me   11.10042823347235
gentlemen thus d artagnan addressed the four musketeers i am ordered to exercise the greatest possible care in guarding the prisoner and since there are no locks to the carriage i shall sit beside him   9.076769715300747
i know that you belong to the cardinal but belong to me as well and i will take upon myself the making of your fortune   14.823819656742224
oh said he this is very nice weather and two leagues to go in such a storm   11.836705666083754
of her whose carriage was at the gate   14.8098120594629
i recollect   10.503980858457696
and now my dear friend said faria sole consolation of my wretched existence you whom heaven gave me somewhat late but still gave me a priceless gift and for which i am most grateful at the moment of separating from you forever i wish you all the happiness and all the prosperity you so well deserve   10.211567297113369
therefore let everyone here look upon what has passed today as if it had not happened and as though we had never thought of such a thing as a change in our original plans   13.216357536923956
he must now get his bearings   9.837052172261036
i do not understand said danglars   19.70543510779041
at a quarter to ten a valet entered   9.594293827120278
that is the name of your true executioner   12.63880704498291
four hundred   14.053997188250284
scarron turned around toward him and came to meet him in his chair   8.747207017169023
porthos and aramis looked at each other and grew pale   11.987642318695285
de villefort notwithstanding his self control was visibly affected and when monte cristo touched his hand he felt it tremble   9.360319780838832
as to the king he made no demonstration of politeness only stopping before the queen   7.396141808329594
rochefort trembled in every limb at this question   13.328010434907991
for heaven s sake beauchamp returned morcerf do not deprive me of the merit of introducing him everywhere   13.595199780490118
the same who was so shamefully assassinated in 1815   15.668621699343177
it was doubtless a miracle from heaven that notwithstanding her precautions there should be some trace some proof remaining to reveal the crime   12.131190083750042
tell the count replied franz that we will do ourselves the pleasure of calling on him   14.060324034766658
milady remained alone with her eyes fixed upon the door   13.55679341905862
the mask and beard became you very well and as to the axe i do not think it would be out of keeping even at this moment   11.929716220835521
he determined to cultivate the good will of the youth raoul and either whilst fencing with him or when out shooting to extract from his simplicity some information which would connect the athos of old times with the athos of the present   14.05737415775062
he shall be tried said the cardinal   12.752679844478426
swear to be mute   12.29734980353369
we will send my brother s servant back to béthune whom as i told you we can trust   9.863324722304391
the baroness was partially reclining on a sofa eugénie sat near her and cavalcanti was standing   19.615055007015666
yes my lord like yourself   15.035186930073547
if he only remains here a fortnight and pays for what he drinks i shall soon re establish my business   14.47539072012319
when he reappeared athos received him with the same paternal smile as that which he had often bestowed on d artagnan but a more profound tenderness for raoul was now visibly impressed upon his face   10.34419192610174
call the viscount and take the musket with you   19.341470416722625
the same orders for her as for the two sailing vessels   15.307597572684637
bah it is now nearly healed and i am sure it is not that which gives you the most pain   11.392854721790258
i have known that said the queen a long time   17.026713622433945
this time i did not content myself with looking but i took my knife out of my pocket felt that the point was sharp and sprang over the wall   12.53714132846667
we no longer know anyone madame   11.66031929281382
de boville who was standing in the waiting room and who was introduced into danglars room as soon as the count had left   14.10899161103159
then on his return give him that card and this sealed paper   13.985027716940913
in the third edmond grasped handfuls of diamonds pearls and rubies which as they fell on one another sounded like hail against glass   13.861468751257135
i am quite bewildered and it is natural that it should be so   13.837186873872454
he had received a ball in his thigh which had broken the bone   11.200794384466874
well what did he say then   11.333688009511866
he was right   9.10683279545933
the young man was overwhelmed as he read   8.38110560600257
repeated the young girl   11.554968372116786
still further his confidence in the worthy picard at one time so great diminished day by day   12.131760664374491
exclaimed athos to day love is like war the breastplate is becoming useless   22.549558454768942
we are all invited my father madame de villefort and i at least i understood it so   14.613808388872341
that child has become a man   12.668232994963619
and you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom have you not   11.288095558211637
dessessart captain of the guards as well as the others   15.430406101771183
but make haste i can not stay here all day   15.173894989790549
i will make verses said he   15.031156216491192
what has become of monseigneur athos   14.839774411063406
stronger grew the wonder of dantès who almost fancied he had to do with one gifted with supernatural powers   7.497802284942862
the young princess opened the door and raoul appeared on the threshold   15.969185905901236
but who are you then   9.148632480326071
although la rochelle was invested however certain success might appear thanks to the precautions taken and above all to the dyke which prevented the entrance of any vessel into the besieged city the blockade might last a long time yet   7.397283664649786
and whatever might be considering the violent character of milady the danger which the poor girl incurred in giving this billet to her mistress she ran back to the place royale as fast as her legs could carry her   14.066355775833104
what are you going to do my friend   13.553397533903107
the interview for which i ask is of us two alone and i very earnestly wish that it may not be interrupted   9.084716204100287
god help me   13.044098914358557
here is a bag containing five hundred pistoles in gold   12.36680983288429
and he made a gesture of polite dismissal   10.506900081549134
0071m to be sure   14.600298607511306
good thought the gascon this is a promising beginning   10.895128471070157
and i madame replied athos am looking with admiration   13.062310087575673
otherwise it may be driven back and you will be trampled to death by the horses   6.912444096387733
but before an engagement ensues we shall move your eminence to another castle belonging to our friend du vallon who has three   10.480917468368537
morrel with a mournful shake of his head the thing has assumed a more serious aspect than i expected   11.596187492185045
and we have just heard continued albert of a new deed of his and so heroic a one that although i have seen him today for the first time i request you to allow me to introduce him as my friend   16.833283724534496
so many loathsome animals inhabited the prison that their noise did not in general awake him   8.951684585891336
valentine entered at this moment and the formalities were resumed   11.884502918840363
villefort shrugged his shoulders   14.994804278674657
he resolved then to carry on the war alone and to look for no success foreign to himself but as we look for a fortunate chance   12.377337177417898
so saying haydée arose and wrapping herself in her burnouse of white cashmere embroidered with pearls and coral she hastily quitted the box at the moment when the curtain was rising upon the fourth act   13.164522334832
madame bonacieux was released   11.77058350122984
then turning toward the prisoner take away that man he said and keep him carefully in sight   11.800165076007358
there is a congestion of prisoners in the bastile who were cooped up in the time of monsieur de richelieu   12.088773883836076
the old man appeared to be listening attentively and as affectionately as his infirmities would allow to the abbé busoni who looked cold and calm as usual   10.05023054341269
whom am i to take with me   12.070392917686032
as i was on my way here a vessel was coming into port   9.288187131322028
to the questions which d artagnan put concerning her health she replied bad very bad   13.776990830857997
but i will give you a hundred crowns if the first time you go to marseilles you will seek out a young girl named mercédès at the catalans and give her two lines from me   9.163435173062778
all the papers found have been sealed up and placed on your desk   13.923080830298511
accomplishing my destiny replied rochefort falling on one knee   15.788634792901654
one or two shouts of long live the cardinal saluted his shadow   11.549948152111057
listen said the abbé extending his hand over the wounded man as if to command him to believe   11.418777028387327
i am haydée the daughter of ali tepelini pasha of yanina and of vasiliki his beloved wife   6.472481364368777
send one of your men disguised as a penitent friar and i will give it to him   11.217573290666419
surely if i am culpable and if i ask for pardon i ought to be forgiven   7.308702799626058
debray she said   12.963522905008741
ah my lord it is a great happiness that the queen who always wished you well had a fancy to send you here where there s a promenade and a tennis court good air and a good table   9.578770145033106
noirtier has even forgotten the name of his intended grandson   8.536667326991978
villefort and his wife both grew red one from shame the other from anger   7.842557804221601
your interests are concerned in your so doing   8.764767930724407
yes i understand now to find one woman you court another   10.037861742208973
not a word   11.085770656212004
but as he felt by her weight she was on the point of fainting he made haste to reassure her by protestations of devotedness   13.651937502409826
danglars say to this outburst on the part of the procureur   16.706582466631374
the young man is here said the valet de chambre in the same tone   13.805440442935474
do you disapprove of this journey my dear m   11.654018287631665
i am inclined to think so   11.07841410210434
at length the long desired sound was heard and instead of one figure as he had expected he perceived that two were approaching him   12.74020744678903
you have then a repugnance to your profession   15.359840665592547
it is useless to let the cardinal know   15.335094694395421
should you meet a doctor you will do me a favor by sending him to me   9.119988934289758
one day as i was setting off on an expedition go said she   15.282992002833357
well shall i send for some breakfast here   10.280795542333479
leave me alone said aramis impatiently   11.240054269801577
do you know villefort that you are talking in a most dreadfully revolutionary strain   7.750458765974926
only i beg monsieur not to be too prodigal of it if he wishes it to last long   16.100568502160534
then she knew that he was one of the friends of m   17.789197687800556
but sir remarked the young woman these eastern societies in the midst of which you have passed a portion of your existence are as fantastic as the tales that come from their strange land   12.625156571546269
three arcades were before them and the middle one was used as a door   13.13720308068025
the next morning he saw albert pass and repass holding an enormous bouquet which he doubtless meant to make the bearer of his amorous epistle   7.921215743904517
imagine the large and splendid corso bordered from one end to the other with lofty palaces with their balconies hung with carpets and their windows with flags   15.786051115985625
but mme   11.418504112832297
you are too bad athos   18.052268030567422
he had but to pass his word for a loan and morrel was saved   11.524639541468117
the next morning king charles i   15.902444628718024
one is that of edmond dantès lost to me long long since   7.1817701075031515
next day a hundred newspapers relate the fact with the names of the victim and the murderer   7.010893893327293
then approaching monte cristo he added especially before young m   14.708439088920565
athos made no reply   10.899843055495227
yes replied the procureur   10.557350067571395
about seven o clock in the morning they set out   11.052969241774008
after the battle of navarino when the greek government was consolidated he asked of king otho a mining grant for that district which was given him   14.705879455367228

this announcement was received in silence   11.861203590147923
it appears so replied monte cristo   12.014625278769307

said selim in a voice at once so gentle and yet so proud   10.780063347975293
athos put his arm around aramis s neck and embraced him   17.77091463517471

it is large and there will be no want of room for you all   13.538360206888333
to your eminence   12.487093644198039

the blood had mounted to the head of d artagnan and at that moment he would have drawn his sword against all the musketeers in the kingdom as willingly as he now did against athos porthos and aramis   10.69024635537855
you can not think of humiliating me by prancing along by my side on that magnificent charger   10.392765329134075
armed men shouldering muskets watched over the barricades with menacing looks   8.242671358431688
let them try to pursue him   12.111142903875606
no if it does not lighten   12.862260923297656
describe him to me then   9.14027327351104

i see the other soldier issue from the guardroom and come toward us   14.3457336472168
lord de winter adopted the same tactics as milady thinking that as his sister in law employed them they must be the best   13.054551569670858
pardon my frankness dear friend   12.622330237348326
he was stopped by athos   10.424509454200244
tis true that our position is an awkward one   16.422705292235992
decidedly man is an ungrateful and egotistical animal   12.631087512671213
she only felt the pulsation in her own fingers and withdrew her hand with a shudder   13.687152933334016
shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows and hid from the garden and court these two apartments the only rooms into which as they were on the ground floor the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate   12.496880169536158
how would you have me know   10.454465144361919
certes these fellows will all either be imprisoned or hanged thought the terrified d artagnan and i no doubt with them   12.922913739793803
as to bazin he went and lay down on a truss of straw   11.872798217595214
i heard all this from the window for i was anxious that mercédès should persuade the old man to accompany her for his footsteps over my head night and day did not leave me a moment s repose   9.873093582701468
the count appeared for an instant at his window but when they again passed he had disappeared   4.482511326651574

0057m danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his intoxication and turning towards fernand said well you understand there is no need to kill him   12.830627582642778
but i accomplish the order they have given me by forwarding to you a dozen bottles of my anjou wine with which they are much pleased   15.358512183719466
tell me the name of that generous friend said the king that i may cherish for him an eternal gratitude whether he succeeds or not   14.702205674072825
and yet bars at the windows and outside bolts at the door decided the question in favor of the prison   13.942670274372475
leave me here and go and speak to madame de villefort who is trying to attract your attention   6.595336775247164
as regards the generality of mankind it is   10.633098391517434
and he thrust his hands into his pockets   14.09865102482123
then the general advanced and making a violent effort to control his feelings i have a son said he and i ought to think of him finding myself among assassins   14.255416620438213
while mercédès glanced at the clock and made an expressive gesture to edmond   14.920591807015317
then there only remains to ascertain whether these fifty or sixty pistoles are worth the risk of four heads   15.614083906678118
alas yes   14.19066945569621
end of the project gutenberg ebook the three musketeers updated editions will replace the previous one the old editions will be renamed   9.644707259860398

stop said he   14.215703493905476
replied the cardinal   16.374041256634676
he found rita senseless in the arms of cucumetto   8.559493007182954
i approve of the deed but i must pray for the dead   12.905946459276253
unfortunately he was an honorable man   13.40207970649313
this diamond does not come from an enemy monsieur replied d artagnan it comes from the queen   13.339364154128395
if the fair peasant wishes to carry matters any further we shall find her or rather she will find us tomorrow   10.083709383815377
he felt something like a secret joy at being forever relieved of this dangerous accomplice   13.946631474275824
is it news to you   10.911788167599688
possibly said danglars   13.624472957954133
but i am not selfish and i thought it might console you all a little to have a share in the matter   14.678284647834937

a ray of light all at once broke upon the mind of the host as he was giving himself to the devil upon finding nothing   6.7168221614254815
why did not i tell you she had been stolen from me   11.03082224563163

mercédès sighed while endeavoring to smile   18.633221159265524
but how did she become so   13.182742400285832
yes replied porthos with a sigh it is amusing   12.707493426374725
aramis seized the poker and gave the signal to stop   8.941606627683425

well then monsieur bernajoux said d artagnan tranquilly i will wait for you at the door   11.59623303025609
comminges had seen rightly and mordaunt had really acted as he had related   3.891333352481718
and why do you represent providence   14.645626921127045
aramis you certainly are full of wisdom   12.261823239375833
from twelve to two o clock danglars had remained in his study unsealing his dispatches and becoming more and more sad every minute heaping figure upon figure and receiving among other visits one from major cavalcanti who as stiff and exact as ever presented himself precisely at the hour named the night before to terminate his business with the banker   13.034299543654587

none on my word   11.921144817535357
i perfectly well remember perugia sir and the hôtel des postes and the festival of which you speak said madame de villefort but in vain do i tax my memory of whose treachery i am ashamed for i really do not recall to mind that i ever had the pleasure of seeing you before   9.732312917979892
i was not deceived said he   12.059164433495788
but i can not i am starving   14.03135213114168

and grimaud whom the general distress could not induce to break the silence imposed by his master heaved sighs enough to soften the stones   14.79531502167064
the hapless dantès was doomed   8.905119304509668

it is well known how violent the king s prejudices were against the queen and how carefully these prejudices were kept up by the cardinal who in affairs of intrigue mistrusted women infinitely more than men   10.511237145604836
the three musketeers did likewise   14.850847157542017
well two words will refresh your memory   14.798053432956983
when i look at you parisians idlers on the boulevard de gand or the bois de boulogne and think of this man it seems to me we are not of the same race   11.213682467327168

friend said athos gravely remember that it is the dead alone with whom we are not likely to meet again on this earth   11.764714148774484
in consequence he took to his heels arrived breathlessly at the councillor s door and knocked violently   12.037132850341857
oh you are young while i am beginning to get old   10.420173455652204

was he the man that stabbed you   13.854320260816456
and if the cardinal asks for you what answer can we make   12.696577209738832

he stopped one moment at the door for baptistin whom he saw in the rue matignon and who was running   10.124701800092524

this major cavalcanti is an old friend of yours then   13.14690171949948

20087m ma foi said franz it would be the easiest thing in the world   10.22524948129259
it was now one o clock in the morning and the coadjutor returned home   12.137607919842464
doubtless there was a strange expression in his eyes for the jailer said come are you going mad again   9.656269446687801

then turning toward raoul go monsieur he said   14.083980056334688

the queen herself was not spared and cardinal mazarin came in for his share of ridicule   9.471798398228161
madame de villefort sighed   11.348740184592012
my child returned monte cristo you know full well that whenever we part it will be no fault or wish of mine   11.427911966056525

ah let him say now if he does not recognize me   15.590641983379886
but philosophy at half past ten at night is somewhat late   12.355772227844511
d artagnan gave up his bed to any one who wanted it making it over about a dozen times   11.947639849928896
a little sooner or a little later it isn t worth quarreling over   13.872222879848087

i will go i will go   10.54077629560319
planchet prouder than ever of his new duties deigned to explain to the two gentlemen that he was ordered to take up his position on the place royale with two hundred men forming the rear of the army of paris and to march on charenton when necessary   16.369599968881708
he has neither robbed nor killed nor murdered   9.710893653037942

the felucca is waiting for us you know   11.766649530864468
raoul stared on hearing this name and looked at the count to be quite sure that it was he whom the lieutenant thus addressed   12.359439558213067
i do not know replied dantès   13.773258929295672

oh do not say so   13.382539982599681
danglars followed his guide without opposition and had no occasion to turn around to see whether the three others were following him   13.845304133477114
but she was fascinated by the lofty airs of porthos   13.665260331775992
but now m   12.973928691714704
i wrote or studied   9.16610972557328
rochefort extended his hand to d artagnan who took it   7.985528316916532
but as you know a corsican who has sworn to avenge himself cares not for distance so his carriage fast as it went was never above half a day s journey before me who followed him on foot   11.01452499821097
d artagnan looked significantly toward athos and aramis   17.931609766477393

my son she said persons in the count s situation have many secret enemies   13.614515342952888
for he left his seat to stand up in front so that his countenance being fully revealed franz had no difficulty in recognizing him as the mysterious inhabitant of monte cristo and the very same person he had encountered the preceding evening in the ruins of the colosseum and whose voice and figure had seemed so familiar to him   16.03296000299833
it is a little worse for the journey but that s no matter   14.107875998802584
at this moment a strange noise like the unloading of a cart and followed by a cry of pain was heard beneath the window   10.788144776777978
you think then that the fire at the palace of justice was not caused by chance   10.824849377854735
my nephew is not yet king and you know laporte has told us twenty times that he himself is in need of almost everything   11.335645496467386
the coadjutor is at this moment one of the seven kings of paris and has a court   8.311450320616562
we keep him in the cellar   8.136268085544875

at the moment mention occurred of his having rendered a service to the count raoul could not help turning his glance toward the young princess and then he saw in her eyes an expression of infinite gratitude to the young man   12.237191544964896
but she knew athos   16.647160084854008
58   6.770862325625974

let it vanish as the last sparks from the blackened paper and disappear as the smoke from those silent ashes   10.80215058670048
those clothes are well cut and quite new   16.143081134964987
and having put three or four double pistoles into his pocket to answer the needs of the moment he placed the others in the ebony box inlaid with mother of pearl in which was the famous handkerchief which served him as a talisman   3.585324739483392
the count looked at mercédès as if to interrogate her but she continued to walk on in silence and he refrained from speaking   12.469601433049185
villefort sprang into the passage exclaiming the emetic   15.557361654213476
d artagnan said athos taking his hand you know i love you   13.786484188331759
and he showed him the seductive coin but did not give it him   13.845297254692792
i believe by heaven said d artagnan that i shall embrace him since he s upon our road   6.7058304610086905
for in good truth you see more clearly into my life than i do myself   9.806951860486468
no excellency no returned the steward with a sort of nervous trembling which monte cristo a connoisseur in all emotions rightly attributed to great disquietude   15.570078117084917
but we have not done with the thing yet   10.537759151461334

yes i know you are a man of a stout heart monsieur said the cardinal with a voice almost affectionate   12.322140363969321
after some discussion this was agreed to and mousqueton played the role of barber   8.044172802898014
he saw overhead a black and tempestuous sky across which the wind was driving clouds that occasionally suffered a twinkling star to appear   6.184690957042729
on the morning of the departure from the forest of frosinone he had followed carlini in the darkness and heard this oath of vengeance and like a wise man anticipated it   9.925513331870084

hold your tongue will you   7.944184999064626

de saint méran lived at marseilles so that this country house was useless to him and it was reported to be let to a young widow known only by the name of the baroness   17.538043886476075
after which if nothing new occurs i shall go and bury myself in my convent at noisy le sec   15.451027548011375
it is impossible to form any idea of it without having seen it   18.36879504918791
he thought himself in a sepulchre into which a ray of sunlight in pity scarcely penetrated   10.223994755041264
cried aramis and athos what   10.47301333055157
both these ladies had been awakened in the middle of the night and did not know what it all was about   11.587732800212663
i plainly tell you so replied aramis   7.903056119156329
said d artagnan taking her hand which without thinking of it she abandoned to him   12.898523669460111
aramis the lover of madame de chevreuse   15.776775206525123
i once possessed four dear and faithful friends besides the maiden to whom i was betrothed he said   14.685649231853196
to take the hundred pistoles d artagnan   15.338059092574415
and morrel dropped his head with disdainful incredulity   8.79079411423204
i was not aware that madame de saint méran was subject to such hallucinations   10.577512716334537
without this letter i should not have heard till to morrow perhaps after to morrow the last of all paris   11.17266679120095
it was his stranger of meung of the rue des fossoyeurs and of arras   13.769909222990357
but d artagnan was not a man to let himself be killed like that   11.395812307368834
you are gathering your crop sir   7.24575168096903
what example   12.75775867719559
what can be done with four   12.236572955654896
i will say likewise he had apprised the count by a note of your intention and the count being absent i read the note and sat up to await you   12.232717020280962
in fact we must not dissemble that the oscillation of the tall trees and the reflection of the moon in the dark underwood gave him serious uneasiness   11.202688210169981
more than this the conversation which had just taken place between mercédès and himself had awakened so many recollections in his heart that he felt it necessary to combat with them   7.097959335260466
d artagnan was standing at the door looking after porthos with a mournful gaze when the baron after walking scarcely more than twenty paces returned stood still struck his forehead with his finger and exclaimed i recollect   10.940428876778912
this time bertuccio would have uttered an exclamation had not a look from monte cristo silenced him   11.875365461967636
assassinate the duke of buckingham or cause him to be assassinated i care very little about that   13.629891436981024
what difference does that make   11.039201599493676
the mendicant had kept his word and made friquet his heir   9.22798506132669
it was even according to our present manners something like an infamous action   14.560216014063187
he is better said the host he fainted quite away   11.185907508240595
he no longer feared realities but phantoms   9.332005308512464
dantès was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of faria who having also been visited by his jailer had come to invite his fellow sufferer to share his supper   9.090260938551891
and then when d artagnan had ended he shook his head with an air that announced nothing good   13.908289017954234
i have them at hand monsieur   6.0582962597891346
i had not for a moment the idea of keeping it but i knew that at paris there was an asylum where they receive such creatures   5.7576939765655215
we must first see what the sergeant wishes us to do replied d artagnan   12.804707648186207
ugh   17.85279114280759
i tell you sir that two persons exist in you   13.643959217448124
cried d artagnan you sing charmingly dear aramis   11.577659920406807
twice you have nearly been the victim of a near relative whom you believe to be your heir because you are ignorant that before she contracted a marriage in england she was already married in france   14.975282356471256
give me those papers and leave us   7.724082063973354
here he said i am very straightforward in my dealings take your choice   7.641524697290434
it was caracalla s circus   5.37864254020484
besides one must lay out one s inheritance somehow   15.063293276330207
if you can my dear d artagnan answer for mademoiselle oh monsieur be assured that i shall be entirely devoted to the person who will give me the means of quitting paris   13.23428735750159
and in accordance with that intention a council of state was assembled and the superintendent of finance was summoned   13.907500458457813
if there is any left grumbled the jeering voice of athos   7.261018984774875
this itinerary possessed another great advantage that of leaving franz at full liberty to indulge his deep reverie upon the subject of signor pastrini s story in which his mysterious host of monte cristo was so strangely mixed up   11.209258936013565
i should make an excellent gambler if i were not too hot headed   12.396807400287681
chapter 111   13.649293631992089
are you well fed   10.417235202312114
monsieur de beaufort made the experiment a third time but by this time pistache s patience was exhausted   14.88978779256816
come no hypocrisy   11.66647523043071
that proves at least that he has wanted for nothing during your absence   13.277153985826939
if i judge for myself my lord she said the cardinal will do nothing and will even perhaps act against us   15.977888325262285
besides that is not much more odious than that a frenchman by adoption should pass over to the english   11.051602777547643
if his heart is free and he will marry haydée the daughter of ali pasha of yanina whom i have brought up with the love of a father and who has shown the love and tenderness of a daughter for me he will thus accomplish my last wish   11.484609429416452
i tell you to hope because i have a method of curing you   9.770954724895105
but i was base and for want of courage acted against my judgment   7.038254450008088
should one of them know his majesty and discover but a substitute all would be lost   15.30170502813527
for really in spite of his excellent intentions i could not thank him for what he has done   8.947545428729223
he laid a wager he would tame médéah in the space of six months   10.134050799088593
the departure for belgium a few minutes after the scene of confusion produced in the salons of m   8.359684499418469
laugh if you please i really think so   12.339393441836052
ten minutes after she pitched forward then the other way spun round and round and then good bye to the pharaon   8.315643109887962
four hundred at a pistole each four hundred pistoles   13.823970999595037
albert was constantly expatiating on their good fortune in meeting such a man   13.653139773375399
port   10.453800082301331
said faria showing to the young man a slender stick about six inches long and much resembling the size of the handle of a fine painting brush to the end of which was tied by a piece of thread one of those cartilages of which the abbé had before spoken to dantès   13.717347902312435
at length the boat touched the shore but without effort without shock as lips touch lips   8.89806396036374
if you have two coats you will give me one of them   15.250590411606144
i say you understand this because you are as conversant with my affairs as i am   14.846433904676353
in half an hour la ramee returned full of glee like most men who have eaten and more especially drank to their heart s content   8.23860265218094
he feared then to see her too often   12.301482142881577
the vessel did touch at elba where he quitted it and passed a whole day in the island   15.125521807608921
milady replied that she was too weak at present and that her only desire was to be left alone   15.180457736665268
an hour after sunset   10.726006585636227
they entered the common hall and placed themselves at table   13.540646875051593
it appears to me you make dull jokes my dear said porthos   6.243758336963149
now you understand my dear monsieur cavalcanti that it is useless for you to tell people in france that you have been separated from your son for fifteen years   13.930100288914502
i do not love her but i will avenge myself for her contempt   7.134956893116053
he is a musician   6.800627376993072
d artagnan printed as were most of the works of that period in which authors could not tell the truth without the risk of a residence more or less long in the bastille at amsterdam by pierre rouge   11.850236313677803
but that ought not to astonish you   7.711001015936345
truly from my mother leonora corsinari   17.007219546469965
he inquired what was the will of his persevering visitor   9.23189862996886
cried the count   13.707845480887258
well monsieur said bertuccio this man with this spotless reputation well   9.580929903815903
the blood mounted to his temples his eyes became dim   15.543218435933774
and when i saw them outstrip all the others and come to the winning post in such gallant style i actually clapped my hands with joy   17.349681458596212
cried olivain what are you doing   8.640150385375875
people in general he said only ask advice not to follow it   15.435294551901368
many people have been assassinated in a tumult but even criminals have rarely been insulted during trial   11.860629928722451
i have two friends who in this way never depart from me   10.429677296708752
he was drawn by four good horses at full gallop   13.405173418136583
your three friends the friends of former days   15.16700641778457
all these movements had been effected mechanically as far as he was concerned   6.94265409930078
i am even sorry that this evening i almost repulsed but there will be a conference to morrow and we shall see   10.215540968669064
we have reached it   13.657486204247125
the star of day pale but nevertheless still splendid was setting in the horizon glorifying at once the heavens and the sea with bands of fire and casting upon the towers and the old houses of the city a last ray of gold which made the windows sparkle like the reflection of a conflagration   10.099394959794804
here i am albert said   10.820905662719959
he did not even see the ocean that terrible barrier against freedom which the prisoners look upon with utter despair   12.91343445511628
the laundress looked on in astonishment but as she had been promised twenty louis she made no remark   14.294419634035473
do you know that i am growing old   15.95102252791509
the cardinal became as pale as death   15.81449183510869
instead of raising it thought he they have lowered it   13.680104598110566
through or over   9.497334386758435
you shall not pass   11.264360908236814
but still i owe this courtesy to my old friend a man who had in him material for the most noble and generous of characters   9.200301043494912
if we can not we will do without him   12.671551735302748
monte cristo could not resist this proof of affection   14.112112485386607
said athos reproachfully   7.389489080723366
as to my father you will not see him   11.915629680611056
you reconcile me d artagnan   11.650316010291235
in order to make one s way amid these turbulent and conflicting waves it was necessary to be an officer a great noble or a pretty woman   12.27549405940522
i came to tell you that i also look upon you as my enemy   12.050155344345109
and rally to the old cry of france montjoy and st   12.249268960753296
why do you doubt it   12.808380070499515
who should it be but he who watches while i sleep who labors while i amuse myself who conducts everything at home and abroad in france as in europe   14.667047183880616
now continued faria addressing dantès with an almost paternal expression now my dear fellow you know as much as i do myself   14.608621202934419
the whole journey was performed with equal rapidity   12.391060002114992
now then said maximilian leaning on the handle of his spade i would give a good deal to know how it comes about that the count of monte cristo is acquainted with m   10.717222046096186
adieu sir said the magistrate who had risen from his seat   8.198204837879496
that was the title   14.75714908803415
go and fight and you go there   14.501452583346227
after all i am not an unreasonable man   9.68233943987319
d artagnan had been there scarcely five minutes when m   13.749522576801873
and danglars sighed as m   12.434270910879377
how soft and perfumed was the air   12.104108700862426
thus then the young men made no attempt at resistance but blindly and confidingly surrendered themselves into the care and custody of their conductors   12.80738107998034
so now you are both forewarned   9.67647304260979
here laporte said buckingham these are the only tokens i ever received from her this silver casket and these two letters   11.772228507051972
at these balconies are three hundred thousand spectators romans italians strangers from all parts of the world the united aristocracy of birth wealth and genius   13.319214882686376
eagerly replied the prince will i permit   8.03640684114984
justice before everything   16.74930905357536
were you crazy rochefort   17.338987232063552
paul or of the place de grêve   10.194513141674406
write a second letter for that clever personage who lives at tours   12.845642207582241
then monsieur de beaufort who was so familiar with the interior of the palais royal though he did not know the relations existing between the queen and the cardinal pictured to himself in his prison all that dramatic excitement which would ensue when the rumor should run from the minister s cabinet to the chamber of anne of austria monsieur de beaufort has escaped   9.076233768534596
monsieur le lieutenant you have been very prompt   13.156116156355562
repeated madame danglars her staring wide open eyes expressing her alarm   12.631513829480145
you can not have failed to remark my dear friend that everyone has his particular kind of drunkenness sad or gay   10.5939102968924
athos led his guest into a dining room of moderate size the windows of which opened on one side on a garden on the other on a hot house full of magnificent flowers   12.977692648442009
cried milady must i name him again   11.284186297331251
what is the matter if you please   9.684167032969073
monsieur porthos may imagine you belong to the house and in a fit of passion might run his sword through you or blow out your brains   11.484047317121407
i believe he thrusts pins through the heads of rabbits he makes fowls eat madder and punches the spinal marrow out of dogs with whalebone   13.419437483139841
and what effect did this discourse produce   15.287583247533034
we are about to have the honor of charging you replied aramis lifting his hat with one hand and drawing his sword with the other   16.52267469208924
six years since i bought a horse in hungary remarkable for its swiftness   11.338103346580906
as for the decanter master edward had emptied that to make a pond for his ducks   8.557209640498307
did you drink some too m   9.781050981162082
noirtier being deprived of voice and motion is accustomed to convey his meaning by closing his eyes when he wishes to signify yes and to wink when he means no   10.137523597769993
yes said monte cristo you were a major   12.585291088997733
one of the two men whose mysterious meeting in the colosseum he had so unintentionally witnessed was an entire stranger to him but not so the other   8.81957901480057
then that person is a most amiable person   11.553963060700863
it came from my brother the king of spain   7.163170821764188
what appears to you to emanate from a celestial source seems to me to proceed from one far less pure   11.34376984095613
the scoundrel   14.817042620465458
i hope that you will sometimes too think of me and if at certain hours you should miss me if you should feel any slight regret at my absence i shall be overwhelmed with joy at the thought that you appreciate my affection for and my devotion to yourself and that i have been able to prove them to you whilst i had the happiness of living with you   13.227765955814377
and now do as much for the queen   11.029443666916348
would you like to see a camp of bandits in repose   11.726561814598396
but in his present condition he will promise anything and take his chance of keeping it afterwards   14.80734022002985
assassins   15.152523299565804
but on the contrary he saw nothing but eager eyes which were devouring in anticipation that sublime fowl which was the object of his contempt   10.335468720628883
how extraordinary   13.431606739405549
they have abducted her   8.321282083083556
i wish to say three words to you monsieur chevalier stammered the soubrette   15.398909705301485
but what would you have us to do here now that the king is dead   14.584792010195514
i will fulfil all your wishes my dear mother said the young man   17.89833893398836
every evening he shuts himself in there   14.607415535632402
if it be to avenge her i am ready to follow you   13.982801308365683
the soldiers whom he was nearly trampling ran away   10.0066184745111
then he would be free to make his researches not perhaps entirely at liberty for he would be doubtless watched by those who accompanied him   12.955635120010406
you promised to obey me implicitly   6.18460297847445
albert stood one moment speechless by the side of his mother s bed   13.161596930393388
besides he has grown fat and perhaps has lost his fitness for active service   13.435207961214871
excuse me my lord said the lad   8.746455109102854
it appears that these appointments are all made for eleven o clock thought d artagnan   13.641741051272291
but you are too intelligent not to know that according to a prejudice too firmly rooted to be exterminated a nobility which dates back five centuries is worth more than one that can only reckon twenty years   14.295421331027457
juxon led them away and this time the doors were left open   14.77831959964107
a daughter of henry iv   5.672989958610309
his insolent bravery his still more insolent success at a time when blows poured down like hail had borne him to the top of that difficult ladder called court favor which he had climbed four steps at a time   7.379605454080384
it was only known that on the following sunday a te deum would be sung at notre dame in honor of the victory of lens   7.587018395217964
i was rocked when an infant in the arms of old ocean and on the bosom of the beautiful amphitrite   10.983042993226878
and for fear no doubt that the sight of them might bring his master back to ideas of this world bazin had laid his hands upon sword pistols plumed hat and embroideries and laces of all kinds and sorts   13.472569826830107
good journey to him   10.581885724777042
let us shut this one up   7.039496789419274
in the meanwhile how disheartening to see the woman one loves long for those thousands of nothings which constitute a woman s happiness and be unable to give her those thousands of nothings   15.352602705237297
let us go and die with them   16.99414703396068
i think i arrived just in time to obtain your signatures or they would have been disputed with me   10.907682022679303
monseigneur will be at hand to testify that it was freely given   14.831489656448372
but on timidly opening his eyes he found himself with his nose fixed between the two shoulders of porthos that is to say exactly upon the baldric   8.282857975559367
said d artagnan pressing her hand more closely   12.094693302737372
do you regret them   15.389197297707874
in the most german and the least gascon accent possible   13.89520820523985
when their parents are sufficiently rich to pay a ransom a messenger is sent to negotiate   12.238009341249327
go and take this key with you   12.956639747518306
poor young man said monte cristo in a low voice   13.22497770545965
if we were to see you fighting i can assure you that we would make no effort to prevent you   12.775400964347874
your horse is tired already he froths at the mouth whilst mine looks as if he had only just left the stable   10.985834579951572
you see you still are king   15.317242831245345
franz was too far off to hear what they said   9.90506973027194
i know them cried milady who began to feel a chill penetrate her heart   11.825843148293206
but i will tell you a true story my lord   12.287058117847218
shadows ran as if bewildered to and fro on the vessel and mournful cries accompanied these delirious walkers   7.697694876082293
i have already had the honor of telling you i was said morrel   13.491235085201353
by the latter i mean your relatives and friends   8.77685746664109
de tréville who had appreciated him at the first glance and who bore him a real affection never ceased recommending him to the king   10.489019800721703
and we became the more intimate from there being many resemblances of character between us   17.39218015425699
he felt a slight disappointment however when he saw that this place was already taken by a compeer named mousqueton and when porthos signified to him that the state of his household though great would not support two servants and that he must enter into the service of d artagnan   10.610060511061084
and mademoiselle d armilly said the banker   9.711303929300506
the carriage which had been stopped for a minute resumed its way passed through the crowd threaded the rue st   8.489355723736741
it is even probable that i shall have to make a journey   8.76541193213386
he could not breathe   16.296553858972416
it is the blood of the unfortunate man whom you left at the inn and who died in my arms   10.365572709459958
you are difficult to please viscount   14.785756757960943
in which the plot thickens chapter xii   16.54405795274719
demanded the concierge   15.080616296806095
pray tell me what you think baron for i feel uneasy i can assure you having some considerable property in their hands   11.487840072246819
monsieur marechal you must indeed have found yourself in wondrous peril to have undertaken so strange a commission   9.42004467567345
athos would have died rather than appeal for help   12.569225154067691
the breakfast at m   12.676551743524241
it was the first time he had ever seen mademoiselle d armilly of whom he had heard much   16.226391504164663
put him to death   7.482160079010699
placed by popular confidence at the head of that movement i can appreciate better than any other its significance and its probable results   5.860054643054825
said danglars pretending to restrain caderousse who with the tenacity of drunkards leaned out of the arbor   13.690088581276953
do you intend opening the door   8.88467523737697
you have then seen something   11.940102550274332
and as he had no desire to support a polemic discussion with his friend s valet he simply moved him out of the way with one hand and with the other turned the handle of the door of number five   9.461317284091521
he listened until the sound of steps died away and then hastily displacing his bed saw by the faint light that penetrated into his cell that he had labored uselessly the previous evening in attacking the stone instead of removing the plaster that surrounded it   10.104921629032317
and to whom am i indebted for so happy a termination to my late dreadful alarm   9.882891136075521
very good very good   15.78667160805659
the domestic bowed respectfully and invited them to enter   6.087281812326911
athos smiled and opened the window   15.330090391193743
you must show me the proofs against him   8.350487888099154
plague on t my lord have you brought me here to get my horoscope out of me   7.038894626414887
shall i tell him that he can count on you   6.456028376077425
at nine o clock the president of the club presented himself   14.494861764858749
thank you a thousand times   14.31688038352162
at this moment they were hailed by a voice from the sloop and a few seconds later men servants and baggage were aboard   14.65593376062735
then from the bottom of this passage the depth of which it was impossible to measure he saw appear first the head then the shoulders and lastly the body of a man who sprang lightly into his cell   15.251134618479862
as to athos he went out without any mystery took his horse which was tied with those of his friends to the fastenings of the shutters in four words convinced the attendant of the necessity of a vanguard for their return carefully examined the priming of his pistols drew his sword and took like a forlorn hope the road to the camp   12.306203731265242
no he still persists in looking upon you as the most incomprehensible and mysterious of beings   16.816955741946053
immediately without any order being given or his place of destination indicated the coachman set off at a rapid pace and plunged into the streets of the city   5.762008581376513
he did not speak but showed the paper to dantès   12.427745928708084
she had many a time felt humiliated by the self sacrifice and disinterestedness shown by the gascon gentleman   15.570798952684282
monsieur de beaufort or another   12.653485929661738
you are corpulent your arm has no longer that movement of which the late cardinal s guards have so many proofs   11.46418122307525
the story has been told by the corsican to some priest who in his turn has repeated it   17.274462911783164
when the clock strikes a quarter after midnight collect your men   9.290075044724666
and i hope ere long to introduce you if not to my wife at least to my betrothed mademoiselle eugénie danglars   9.982771699686506
and seeing that sweet pale face those lovely eyes closed that beautiful form motionless and to all appearance lifeless the idea occurred to him for the first time that perhaps she loved him otherwise than as a daughter loves a father   15.399495174740794
and now my lord that i see how hopeless the position of the king is tell me with what you are charged on the part of my royal husband   12.41714569024696
ah gentlemen   8.310642412828852
to reach england athos lowered his voice all france covered with spies and creatures of the cardinal must be crossed   8.643990364766367
asked an officer who appeared at that moment upon the threshold of the room   5.195050988476218
absolution comes not from him who administers it but from god   13.448690322835516
the only chance for albert s safety then will arise from your emotion   8.73828995541943
yes returned the duke i must confess i sometimes think of it   13.89511745895225
de comminges went away d artagnan remaining apparently in the same attitude of humble resignation   5.985268015480357
then he rested   13.809961252124898
50157m my father i will know who my father is said the obstinate youth   12.77480962602521
you see now why i did not care to know your gentleman in the mask   11.402783936067177
exclaimed friquet   13.889165493363171
you are convinced now edmond are you not   9.045087003360376
acting by my advice my poor sister had refused to comply with the unreasonable demands of benedetto who was continually tormenting her for money as long as he believed there was a sou left in her possession   9.314870006618857
cama the pilot of the saint ferdinand went in once and he came back amazed vowing that such treasures were only to be heard of in fairy tales   13.135593276171885
there was a great deal going on that morning and many business like persons at the palais   12.747030418046133
stop a moment said the deputy as dantès took his hat and gloves   12.930469071195555
they had just prepared their beds and barricaded their door within when someone knocked at the yard shutter   15.212826998415874
but how is it that you know so much of these matters   17.032748853806527
these united considerations made albert more lively and anxious to please than he had hitherto been   9.440671239903063
on the morrow he received the last touches of mousqueton s brush for an hour and took his way toward the rue aux ours with the steps of a man who was doubly in favor with fortune   9.475981682205225
said danglars to andrea   10.198301513390636
two hours afterwards he came on deck as the boat was about to double the island of elba   12.367629827815483
anne of austria richelieu mazarin and the courtiers of the period less faithful than in the history of m   12.170484302839728
well i will remain with you   10.831585317269493
but since then everything has changed in and about me   8.588333520900672
athos was for a few moments thoughtful   9.40586936067225
now nothing of the kind has happened   10.372775041205266
and all these men who had entered enraged passed from anger to pity and blessed the royal infant in their turn   6.912282118595735
inquired danglars with an air of indulgence and good nature that made monte cristo smile acquainted as he was with the secrets of the banker s domestic life   11.486657249735615
said the old man he is so much attached to us   12.24269355709532
no sir said danglars   11.366294738830636
i say sire that the minister of police is greatly deceived or i am   11.67741866973168
there was a doubtful expression in noirtier s eyes   15.507722877226833
for three days he watered this cabbage with a distillation of arsenic   13.5040653057927
he may take me to task for some foolish trifle or other he will bring his witnesses or will insult me in some public place and i am expected to kill him for all that   8.892243584603813
from time to time a flash of lightning stretched across the heavens like a fiery serpent lighting up the clouds that rolled on in vast chaotic waves   6.5601594422880565
as well as you do gentlemen   8.720533225103845
now the following occurrences had taken place between the two contending parties   8.95669928444083
oh my god thou knowest whether i am guilty   10.83552370572977
i speak frankly to you   18.07828879876856
come and watch by the dead and all the wretched family will be grateful to you   7.671652534140206
but do not ask from me more than sisterly affection for my heart is another s   12.539050590892622
yes said monte cristo i recognized him   11.579486248964708
behold   13.815046666078302
but stepping toward the antechamber and making a sign to d artagnan with his hand as if to ask his permission to finish with others before he began with him he called three times with a louder voice at each time so that he ran through the intervening tones between the imperative accent and the angry accent   11.060866304150732
i see that you participate in a prevalent error said madame danglars   13.167342588132362
none can fly from a dungeon who can not walk   12.524872913909443
do you preach them   12.360710917677322
asked me questions about the vessel the time she left marseilles the course she had taken and what was her cargo   17.066675576995454
if the thing were to do again i would again do it   14.393047118280045
i wish i could say as much   9.48230238601231
a little town on the lys   13.79264951026965
no said she withdrawing it gently no my friend touch me not   10.599370930801253
martin giving half his cloak to a poor man   10.709709820095437
that head has never conspired murmured he but it matters not   14.284009672358764
and here madame i must add another word of explanation   14.097124111704996
now for my part i met them in the lobby after the conclusion of the piece   13.840221542049825
she had seduced and ruined my brother a priest   18.1592253983736
then without taking any thought for their future he returned to porthos and told him that his commission was completed   9.277984196904328
you are my sister in religion   8.205437591670103
cried the young woman in a manner so serious as to make d artagnan start in spite of himself   7.901369706770961
and i thank you   13.077024964858193
the prince looked at grimaud grimaud looked at the clock   10.93940524903487
lord de winter tore his hair   14.388861297497233
i assure you that as long as i live i shall never love anyone else   7.764962097655555
that will do replied the cardinal   16.128870264547807
porthos said d artagnan if you can still speak say a word my dear porthos to this good planchet   8.037829908535311
the favorite of a great lady will not be allowed to be inconvenienced for such a paltry sum as he owes you   10.06526172756132
then if you wish to take my advice said the young man coldly i would recommend you to travel   13.973999320493135
he not only extended his hand to the young man but flew to him with open arms   18.968157570679026
it was a terrible moment for the young man   13.95155611317202
upon my soul these women would puzzle the very devil to read them aright   13.362081597461
although my name or rather that of my brother would be mixed up with the affair i will risk the scandal of a public trial to make myself certain of getting rid of you   17.07647293530707
i had turned up the earth over a surface of more than twenty feet square and a depth of two feet   11.587136171486884
for him the cardinal was only an officer coming to visit a lady   15.426580667590333
nothing was certain   8.83044587617572
and d artagnan knew that while his eminence was terrible to his enemies he was strongly attached to his friends   10.490864368030234
my lord who told you that   13.479393823118054
it is indeed a sum which might be regretted even by a philosopher   9.97225215813667
albert then had fallen into the hands of the famous bandit chief in whose existence he had for so long a time refused to believe   18.20187870183039
he was convinced that lucien s visit was due to a double feeling of curiosity the larger half of which sentiment emanated from the rue de la chaussée d antin   12.370031049607896
monsieur said the cardinal you have been arrested by my orders   17.709704443189292
do not unlink or detach or remove the full project gutenberg™ license terms from this work or any files containing a part of this work or any other work associated with project gutenberg™   16.386695922949833
if they find us here we are lost   14.048870193130567
according to your idea then my brain is turned   10.524504064483356
a cold sweat burst from the brow of milady   5.301396874584608
rochefort said the cardinal you see monsieur d artagnan   12.190859173497127
the first that we have not finished breakfast   5.756043643596771
there was no address on it   15.090178597720076
this peace will require a negotiator   13.052820105164743
on the contrary returned gaetano the chief who was told you were a young frenchman invites you to sup with him   12.787028271586436
the coadjutor threw a piece of money into the hat which was on the ground   10.545323967789711
i will come count i will be sure to come said villefort eagerly   17.33272292576079
black figures are seen scattered over the long white avenues   20.256224384841616
cried a voice whose mournful accents reaching the four friends seemed to proceed from some phantom of the ocean   10.758235619878725
yes said the duke smiling and i even believe that i know that other person   14.509789229396727
his eye wandered to a long stout sword on his flank and he instinctively slipped it around within reach of his right hand   9.343333332809488
it would be impossible to describe mousqueton s astonishment when from the threshold of the door he saw the four friends approaching followed by a sergeant with a dozen men   14.98840732108702
as he spoke villefort drew the letter from his pocket and presented it to dantès   14.460941102648805
i would give a hundred thousand francs to be able to do so   14.032942549094663
it would indeed be a pity he should   14.278215715162975
50255m what   10.194359287440776
the house may be suspected   6.551716434424735
oh a letter   12.287144772115903
disguised as a coachman   13.654873982234808
said athos very anxiously   15.30406600883153
she then opened the door of her alcove and went out   10.981609820126845
when he had rung in her ears the five hundred thousand francs promised by the cardinal   10.89524013310116
having told you this begin   10.949098244253008
franz fell powerless on a chair   7.6059268056482345
but you know it and will interpret for me   15.288041655317986
could you put me in communication with your witty and agreeable friend   10.47121600037302
monseigneur replied d artagnan with an embarrassed air   5.434942578518722
the red duke   11.057520037461746
alarmed by the cries and gestures of the boatmen my horse sprang into the water   10.432422411351304
please god   8.483401222313402
at half past twelve the queen was with her women where   10.073824778918349
that s all   10.018250884709712
what did mazarin do   15.666626918146022
at the foot of the stairs valentine found barrois awaiting her   17.164245204197165
they are gone to seek a very strict convent in italy or spain   14.255739750187216
the scaffold forms part of the fête   6.779810066871598
ali looked at his master for further instructions   12.675904334438815
all attempts to disperse the groups collected in the streets or silence their exclamations were in vain   18.92690300352841
barrois looked at the old man   14.295712791072742
my dear monsieur de rochefort   10.198399302665518
a man wrapped in a cloak in the folds of which his face was hidden approached and leaned over the bed and looked   8.577093797111438
it seems that i am named la bruyere remarked d artagnan   12.138392535161257
cried the officer have they killed him   10.724427224609624
and then my dear marquis he would certainly have done everything for me that i performed for him   11.177606335978309
we must accustom ourselves to parting   15.355520157148732
and faithful to the promise he had made he rushed out of the apartment   12.809911487364046
go to bed or at least lie down in your clothes   16.213720259586736
he can not pardon her the history of the saraband   12.844090858601659
but continued the porter he would not take them   15.539183991046382
then he disappeared after throwing a farewell glance on valentine who slept with the confidence and innocence of an angel at the feet of the lord   12.447124921461098
the young man appeared on the threshold of the minister s closet in one hand holding his hat in the other the letter   12.160696828983358
why yes he is actually insolent over the matter has already offered me his patronage as if he were a grand personage and proffered me a loan of money as though he were a banker   13.457557444464179
to the judge to the judge madame   9.12981836462809
he was delighted also that the high qualities of athos appeared to promise favorably for his mission   11.69565296522889
114 frs   14.12253998916117
sir said d artagnan how can you talk like that when you are in the company of gentlemen and have such an excellent sword at your side   12.064739008948193
and both extended their hands as if to seize the king but before they could touch him with the tips of their fingers both had fallen one dead the other stunned   8.73327392046556
monsieur du vallon whom we used to call porthos   11.820776341903963
she was as well acquainted with it now as a mistress is with that of the lover of her heart   13.3174207151417
what you tell me seems very strange   16.843537970572292
and in five minutes we shall have galloped a quarter of a league   11.69523624255819
well said comminges suppose one thing   15.985841041531378
determined to put the advice of m   17.450743294423077
nay said danglars it is my fault   14.273968941504963
it inspires me with the idea that m   12.525595437720304
then he arranged all his beautiful turkish arms his fine english guns his japanese china his cups mounted in silver his artistic bronzes by feuchères or barye   10.933287504707103
i have been a sailor and your story touched me more than it would others   15.418389529614723
ali is my slave and in saving your life he was but discharging his duty to me   12.207672909430558
cried valentine in astonishment   16.016181412861968
he passed along the same corridor as before crossed one court then a second side of a building   14.534636858574356
if they resist we kill them   12.896702820384732
athos perceived this embarrassment and by way of supplying an effectual remedy called for four bottles of champagne   17.33414571395998
if he wanted valentine he closed his right eye only and if barrois the left   14.903550185455266
you are not only welcome but welcome back   14.68484750674945
one day it was the morning of the day my story begins the king louis xiv   14.48030067392822
near her was the instrument on which she had just been playing   11.577022249403509
it may be   4.708459960404008
exclaimed d artagnan draw up the blinds of his majesty s carriage   16.955122771562003
you will excite your blood and that would produce an appetite it would require a million a day to satisfy   14.282012167361254
dantès reflected as he worked on the shout of joy which with a single word he could evoke from all these men if he gave utterance to the one unchanging thought that pervaded his heart   15.856896887758863
honoré turned into the rue des bons enfants and stopped before a low door   10.910650044706214
mademoiselle de scudery was going   10.66318009394778
you are still with us i presume   11.654284055449533
the whole world my poor child has abandoned your mother   9.096061739231374
i think i shall feel better there   4.320513609753298
aramis was the next to come in and to discover athos almost insensible   14.026150376579382
and i have such fear that it should fly away from me like a dream that i pant to make a reality of it   18.681148165795395
for instance there is apoplexy that lightning stroke which strikes but does not destroy you and yet which brings everything to an end   13.390190855954025
and he likewise recollected that during the past half hour the poor woman had passed close to him without doubt carried away by the same power that had caused her disappearance   13.236186708345725
well i will tell you a secret   13.320380050681033

these baskets contained four pyramids of most splendid fruit   7.723120861311335
the insult was terrible and although unknown to the rest of the world i felt it live and fester at the bottom of my heart   14.091418370613424
how is it that we four men who have faced armies without blinking begin to tremble at the mention of a child   17.22624299268454
albert threw himself on beauchamp s neck   12.429753880387882
i made such haste that i am certain of not having been forestalled   9.222361123412789
noirtier s room he perceived two figures through the half open door   15.022325927129598
d artagnan who foreseeing such an event had kept his eye on him sprang toward him caught him in his arms and assisted him to his chamber   12.520080455615624
five minutes afterward the officer entered and the duke seemed to be immersed in the sublime combinations of chess   11.266698825222532
yes count replied villefort in a voice now scarcely human   13.407705226397326
monsieur said the steward it is fatality i am sure   10.123981671346034

mousqueton was seasick   15.029202554797319
there is doubtless some mistake easily explained   11.65773578430398
they advanced and athos who was the first to enter gazed a moment in silence on that pale and noble face framed in its long and now untidy matted hair the blue veins showing through the transparent temples his eyes seemingly swollen by tears   17.832306109246076
ideology if the count of monte cristo had been for a long time familiar with the ways of parisian society he would have appreciated better the significance of the step which m   16.724369285707276
cried his majesty s guardsman   11.420559394110043
and who is this cavalier henrietta   10.814320994715434
conduct us my lord to the wall   11.410453548705256
five corridors diverged like the rays of a star and the walls dug into niches which were arranged one above the other in the shape of coffins showed that they were at last in the catacombs   13.494987108276757
it is important that none of your crew should see me   15.678213424508566
it is probable that if gaetano had related this previous to proposing the expedition franz would have hesitated but now that they had started he thought it would be cowardly to draw back   10.412832133218378
but persisted the queen if such be your advice and you have his interest at heart send him help of men and money for i can do nothing for him   16.67988556068361
rochefort passed at a gallop   13.272158790617201
nay said she do not smile   12.204844245648905
then noticing that julie was struck with the sound of his voice tell me continued he was he not about my height perhaps a little taller with his chin imprisoned as it were in a high cravat   10.784487906881626
he is accustomed to my ways and i am particular   13.528060295899328
almost immediately the door of the carriage was opened the young man sprang lightly out and presented his hand to milady who leaned upon it and in her turn alighted with tolerable calmness   11.669898919497019
the three cavaliers continued their road on full gallop   6.861438519113804
you are doubtless acquainted with a variety of languages so as to have been able to read all these   14.322766443722266
during the whole of this conversation valentine had remained silent   8.865652439603787
never mind let us call him and to make sure that he will reply agreeably here   10.674897725490771
it is so   13.187426557036899
he s well guarded now   8.827353211597481
do you leave me   13.736261432174825
besides said athos waiting till d artagnan who went to thank monsieur de tréville had shut the door besides there is that beautiful ring which beams from the finger of our friend   10.23031299738597
but said aramis if i understand rightly we are to kill them all eh   11.629931851738448
this i ask of you in the name of the interest with which i inspire you in the name of the service you have rendered me and which i never shall forget while i have life   14.27133033673304
well here is a pate that will be ready for you with a bottle of old burgundy   14.222646111197205
athos turned around with an effort   9.467043614870896
porthos mechanically drew his dagger from the scabbard   11.29117237208828
the old man s declaration that valentine was not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the hopes of madame de villefort   10.368586384016318
she was a charming woman of twenty five or twenty six years with dark hair blue eyes and a nose slightly turned up admirable teeth and a complexion marbled with rose and opal   10.137734737261988
still then i am a prisoner said milady looking around her and bringing back her eyes with a most gracious smile to the young officer   11.396836154562202
bertuccio kept his own in his pocket and merely jingled a few pieces of money   11.310359492418277
confess   12.399350009578564
alas i would say you are welcome had not death opened the way for you into this house   15.147057042816186
peppino followed danglars   10.401599430067009
they are no longer sure   7.685018992140655
cried aramis swords   14.294826956216781
you are aware it will be war civil war furious devouring implacable   14.096930370784007
no of you   8.330571215840472
monsieur porthos what do you say to that   7.174818274422858
there is no harm in over precaution   14.27983357554342
cried planchet so you are back again in paris   13.861553958890124
how can you tell me that   10.783636250099908
the next morning as soon as he awoke danglars asked for the newspapers   15.20408865553419
sacrebleu   11.63260944522648
yes certainly i know that name   6.265162388959266
the rendezvous the place du palais cardinal   8.36300279062272
at the words i will beauchamp steadily raised his eyes to albert s countenance and then as gradually lowering them he remained thoughtful for a few moments   13.969464128646074
the chieftain of the party drew near   11.812332358896251
there was to be sure father joseph but his name was never pronounced but with a subdued voice such was the terror inspired by his gray eminence as the cardinal s familiar was called   13.984512217953885
sir the distance will be diminished said a subordinate   13.694609699420242
now at the risk of your own life you must manage to stop those horses before my door   12.993705266070215
where did i first hear it   13.623443679563726
franz d épinay started with surprise   10.978047788393148
made richelieu smile   11.019777718587601
asked buckingham as he opened the letter   11.706341020999716
shall i give you counsel good counsel the counsel of a friend   8.414076985685421
absurd   12.545047497619306
alas continued the stranger doubtless to dispel the slight cloud that covered morcerf s brow we do not act thus in italy   12.228034446015334
yes said château renaud these italians are well named and badly dressed   14.708663915108295
i shall go to the louvre and strangle mazarin   13.039304974634383
you re welcome sirs   14.27723458353238
true i forgot   13.017889276734493
he ll defend himself   9.727319021225304
aided by the remaining fragment i guessed the rest   8.018988549127304
have you so soon changed your mind added morcerf or have you only provoked my request that you may have the pleasure of seeing me humbled   15.722254846899737
but you have claimed the aid of a gentleman not the watchfulness of a spy   11.772968082305772
doctor my house is accursed   10.630071036179379
that is a spanish name i think   13.549448533811365
he might have purchased his life by speaking   14.59728757366327
i do not reject it altogether said athos   11.680358539107372
it is a poor lame post horse   11.139124553892264
and he drank off half a bottle at a draught and bit great mouthfuls of the bread and meat   14.143104767037505
i shall be obliged to give up hunting as i have given up hawking   16.652784699495804
dantès repeated he edmond dantès   9.112590352755957
the old man did not answer but looked at his master with wild staring eyes while with his cramped hand he grasped a piece of furniture to enable him to stand upright   10.779756294397737
milady had likewise the best of passports her beauty her noble appearance and the liberality with which she distributed her pistoles   14.834578387958143
you think the result of this blow has been to produce an ordinary grief and you would cure it by an ordinary remedy change of scene   14.917104602649466
forty said andrea after a moment s hesitation at the end of which he remembered that he might safely promise   13.631921612006416
madame de villefort gazed upon the face so expressive even in its stillness   9.910324462911074
we are well aware that this term milady is only properly used when followed by a family name   13.66679210093827
and if he is so unfortunate as to lose our dear athos from that very day he becomes my son   17.49300419800835
though i should like to have seen porthos on my yellow horse   17.260291391705966
that is exactly my loss   11.788862489145552
milady s secret d artagnan left the hôtel instead of going up at once to kitty s chamber as she endeavored to persuade him to do and that for two reasons the first because by this means he should escape reproaches recriminations and prayers   15.816843239225395
one doesn t hit the bull s eye every time   9.537166771682237
she had tried to assassinate her brother in law   12.627676478595973
yes sdeath   12.759595579044401
then came the royal carriage with d artagnan on one side porthos on the other   9.69498704784817
the recent events the solitary and eccentric position of the count his enormous nay almost incredible fortune should have made men cautious and have altogether prevented ladies visiting a house where there was no one of their own sex to receive them   16.218890066027043
after the cachucha he placed a magnificent ring on the stem of a bouquet and threw it to the charming danseuse who in the third act to do honor to the gift reappeared with it on her finger   15.09569582048621
or if they do follow it it is for the sake of having someone to blame for having given it   13.903821481711008
oh pray do for heaven s sake tell us all about is he a vampire or a resuscitated corpse or what   10.666718843124135
in leaving the palais royal he remembered to have observed a similar shadow   15.086250657142983
i am sir a living guaranty replied monte cristo motionless but with a threatening look   16.515342678445926
better still since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing you   9.117968583308405
immediately eight swords glittered in the rays of the setting sun and the combat began with an animosity very natural between men twice enemies   11.138187519684305
i hope these gentlemen have theirs   10.468813450055263
monsieur   11.175041985197552
inquired the stranger   14.626726807346316
ah ha said the shipowner i am not in the least surprised for she has been to me three times inquiring if there were any news of the pharaon   16.74782632860979
come dear ones said morrel rising from his seat let us go and see and heaven have pity upon us if it be false intelligence   9.759959698600078
i beseech you madame replied monte cristo not to spoil ali either by too great praise or rewards   15.10632560522003
i am willing to help rebuild your fortune but i will not be an accomplice in the ruin of others   10.745255468156351
cried the stranger to his servant without checking the speed of his horse   10.5549738153232
this evening monsieur i am detained in paris by indispensable business   11.333267902193395
he sighed and whispered a name and the head bathed in tears and pressed on the velvet cushion of the chair a head like that of a magdalen by correggio was raised and turned towards him   7.623429195211225
i have proposed to you to marry not for your sake for indeed i did not think of you in the least at the moment you admire candor and will now be satisfied i hope   8.764351178844167
is there a secret spring   11.818492002275908
aramis was astonished   14.462094338266102
that was the question   11.479624633229395
the first will be mazzolato the second decapitato   9.015067592550206
you are very fortunate to have lost believe me my dear d artagnan   9.828103883516569
inquired mordaunt   12.506705909106596
i can see it all before me this moment   9.13768759018324
then morrel came out from his hiding place with a beating heart and looked through the small opening in the gate   12.487389164932022
is it a friend a brother a simple acquaintance or an enemy   10.54802817303569
at the knock the door was immediately opened and the young man who was seated beside the countess in obedience to the italian custom instantly rose and surrendered his place to the strangers who in turn would be expected to retire upon the arrival of other visitors   6.022412728711399
well don t budge then   14.423516801192227
repeated the monk bending over him as if to tear from him the name if he would not utter it   12.392428321964523
he gave me a sign in the affirmative   14.32808701141007
are there then two parliaments   10.760555079171027
that is a settled thing a resolution registered   13.923112885207757
i can then rely on the notes he has left concerning you   12.69781716384756
he will be furious   20.941016941809707
2d february   11.988165162648324
i will therefore fight in my doublet like yourself   14.41743290014977
asked the doctor   15.175742958185552
d artagnan in particular had a perpetual buzzing in his ears which porthos explained thus a very great lady has told me that this means that somebody is talking of you somewhere   11.744044766920405
as for me said porthos now that you have reminded me of it athos i have the scene again before me as if i now were there   10.750838470844876
all sir   12.805734807312229
thence he saw the king the queen and monsieur mazarin and heard the mass as well as if he had been on duty   9.628261510263195
you don t often speak athos but when you do speak it is like st   12.713227055763031
morcerf who ran towards him with open arms was chilled as he drew near in spite of the friendly smile and simply held out his hand   12.0279500550618
look at my eyes and you will see what no looking glass has ever shown you a frank and honorable countenance   8.848919407626411
de morcerf in epirus for guilty as i knew he was i thought you had no right to punish him   10.707832212754813
the count put his head out of the window and whistled and the horses appeared to fly   11.007766810010725
you want to know how we came here   12.895084726000164
oh well we shall find some way out of it responded m   11.089651543278489
she knew that at her return from a fruitless journey it would be in vain to tell him of her imprisonment in vain to enlarge upon the sufferings she had undergone   8.502084398407131
the two men remained opposite one another morrel trembling in every limb the stranger gazing at him with an air of profound pity   7.4740639543092
are you a politician friend   10.869572256308487
hold hold hold   5.448553804239868
because i imagine you have correspondents in that country   15.266921419767698
perform your duty in camp   10.097712118620846
the count turned up his sleeves and passed into the little vestibule where the gentlemen were accustomed to wash their hands after shooting   14.492290862571707
i am a man of order sir   14.875856612795399
although d artagnan was not of a very sentimental character the mercer s pretty wife had made a real impression upon his heart   10.63342524735755
well the abbé adelmonte took a rabbit and made it eat a leaf of the cabbage   12.55547602233673
yes my lord said athos i wish to speak to the king   14.783307295175925
but it was never egotistical for the unfortunate man never alluded to his own sorrows   14.599610369994057
you are going to know me   12.850572531745152
and now come to the other side what do you see   9.657483415899174
do not speak so loud young man don t speak so loud   10.772242802243474
pray be assured of that   15.056048492838581
the count is an affable man   14.03540740118341
he consequently despatched his breakfast and his boat being ready he hastened on board and they were soon under way   11.676699054334
stammered planchet more dead than alive ah monsieur what an escape i have had   6.979915551693682
well those splendidly wild days may chance to come again   12.930752661448514
cried grimaud unconsciously   13.82331362167371
but in case i feel disposed give me some particulars of today s executions   12.191430789381744
what could i say   13.966191947559695
grimaud had tried to waken the stable boys and the stable boys had beaten him   8.768959251892603
at last with a horrible splash he darted like an arrow into the ice cold water and as he did so he uttered a shrill cry stifled in a moment by his immersion beneath the waves   9.584018336197637
you love me you   13.047570481368764
he wills that human vengeance should precede celestial justice   11.957763050098164
then he must be a wonder   13.04743504469244
but raoul   16.561841309940526
monsieur cavalcanti said andrea do you believe in fairy tales   9.520222885893459
if on my return justice has not been satisfied i will denounce you with my own mouth and arrest you with my own hands   11.807274462563367
thinking that porthos will be at last a baron and d artagnan a captain   11.152666384579458
louvieres recognized him and bowed   11.56957643906522
and he jingled his money   11.169995268603989
my strength is in my weakness   13.36277226468928
that is why i hastened to you   13.386926806813486
ask porthos   10.169800789597577
it is instinctive   10.896259167953716
and although these squibs may be for the most part traced upon the doors of barracks and the walls of cabarets they will not find the likenesses of louis xiii   10.727782204296389
my lord said d artagnan monsieur de vallon is like me he prefers service extraordinary that is to say enterprises that are considered mad and impossible   5.106625608941124
said athos to the commissary if you have no more need of me send me somewhere   14.80906232955374
i wish to see everything   7.79928402644756
the tongue the first day the hand the second and the head the third   10.361418282480662
screamed nanette   10.697059795862694
no in presence of the scaffold as i am royalty i assure you is a very small affair   13.121710001764995
has he sent no particular message for me   9.44118797585596
and in the day of my prosperity he who brings me this order and this cross shall be blessed by me and my children   10.002765382788741
madame replied d artagnan i threaten simply and solely because i am obliged to do so   13.244537421152542
and kindly add continued he that i am not a simple messenger but an envoy extraordinary   12.543237291989737
i hastened to you continued beauchamp to tell you albert that in this changing age the faults of a father can not revert upon his children   9.383916616271433
if it but lasts most capital responded porthos   8.774289973016637
d artagnan did not smile   9.617034910173922
ah caderousse said andrea how covetous you are   15.91000711727431
in order that you may not doubt the kind intention of the writer of this letter you will find enclosed an order for 2 400 francs payable in florence at signor gozzi s   11.440561663299912
to the residence of baron danglars rue de la chaussée d antin   8.062955218606639
why did her father ask for this key which she always kept and which was only taken from her in childhood as a punishment   13.721990634310346
what can i do friend   9.712373588390442
i address you because you know that although i esteem him from my heart i am a little awed by the comte de la fere   15.035386738731695
let go and clue up   14.553213117783024
my affianced husband returned   7.782209293633878
fly friends fly   6.346836022928484
i am fifty and am obliged to recollect it   13.476509599218666
over these dark and sombre chairs were thrown splendid stuffs dyed beneath persia s sun or woven by the fingers of the women of calcutta or of chandernagor   15.757529533881979
edmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend then taking up the knife he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed jaws carefully administered the appointed number of drops and anxiously awaited the result   14.507495228776138
after which he inquired if lieutenant comminges were not the commanding officer at the outpost   11.889337212275157
meanwhile an unexpected scene was passing in the room which had been so carefully locked   14.031413035684603
no upon my honor   10.291982334857165
keep the purse for your lackeys   13.05554247578128
but now be assured his alarm will be the only serious consequence   9.353753842042464
you are a brave fellow   7.414005383030263
you think so do you   15.560336874415164
has he anything remarkable about him by which one may recognize him   11.509752387646287
dantès could thus keep his eyes on marseilles   18.648829213156695
thanks my brave friend   10.4922330110053
but richelieu never came in this manner said the pertinacious boy   12.58629288569405
teresa gave him one only instead of teresa it was beppo who was on the steps of the church of san giacomo   14.479487695581199
therefore scarcely had the stranger time to pronounce his name before the count was apprised of his arrival   9.436392549856093
as you please my dear sir said the jeweller   13.77113418802834
my word as a gentleman never to say anything of you never to do anything against you   13.222677070457895
and i have noticed that what   11.132670542496287
what you don t know me   9.970183911959936
morrel had better go do you not think so grandpapa   11.174007867462423
besides germain was in the interests of the queen   14.146026558446898
the duchess held him back   11.704993897257022
cried mazarin fearing that should his prisoner ever leave his prison he would be the more exasperated against him if he thus retrenched his amusement   9.111969558223928
let us fly   9.689452343717454
when she chose   10.026145555415301
uneasiness now yielded to the most extreme dread on the part of those present   14.198519447888225
aramis pushed his back into his saddle bags and sheathed his sword   14.63322349005441
but i am not the less a giddy fool   14.229761293215514
i will ask his servant   9.980328351170137
tell me at least the means   9.798304282241709
ah my god   11.151802303634575
thought gondy   10.154984170100466
it is for something else than that i imagine muttered d artagnan shaking his head doubtfully   12.931266648744138
d artagnan drew back the bolt with precaution and both light as shadows glided through the interior door into the passage ascended the stairs as quietly as possible and entered d artagnan s chambers   10.945320186097605
milady looked at him for some time with an expression which the young man took for doubt but which however was nothing but observation or rather the wish to fascinate   13.951292693469028
such as is my supper it is yours to share if you will   18.653883747919227
and he gazed half stupefied upon the three persons before him   11.80491467958039
no it is not worth while   11.298319077415341
this loophole which gradually diminished in size as it approached the outside to an opening through which a child could not have passed was for better security furnished with three iron bars so as to quiet all apprehensions even in the mind of the most suspicious jailer as to the possibility of a prisoner s escape   13.117429361022543
it was the first rendezvous that had been granted him   15.386552884839103
said d artagnan with some degree of emotion i struck without knowing that it was you   7.49294073181199
he then said something in arabic to ali who made a sign of obedience and withdrew but not to any distance   15.499216965782512
it is the son of milady said athos to d artagnan   11.651811395340422
but why do i not   16.590796780344363
but so little it can hardly be called eating   12.323441261970133
milady reseated herself foaming   13.498939755404827
a bright spot burned in either cheek her respiration was short and difficult and her pulse beat with feverish excitement   7.000337279762229
and so although the movement of the arm the sound of the voice and the agility of the body were wanting the speaking eye sufficed for all   13.384932961236144
monte cristo turned away   15.699160671603517
villefort dropped his head and sighed   8.907133666170333
you can tell him sir answered a voice which was the voice of high command in the battle field that he sent against me the only two men capable of getting the better of four men   9.843242557423766
oh you hear that flamarens   12.294257125542167
do you say asked the gascon timidly that the comte de la fere has commissioned you to give his compliments to monsieur du vallon and myself   8.798380317872194
take some more wine my dear cavalcanti said the count pouring out for him a second glass of alicante   13.616644300909764
well then so be it   12.562624857254447
violence is the proof of weakness   15.567444509694687
he asked in a trembling voice remembering the visits he had been paying to his treasury   10.36981381667001
bonacieux expected him   14.727468139223468
i followed him this evening to the opera and concealed in a parquet box have seen all   8.96677025715314
the man was m   9.12561644545497
it is true they are almost always spent beforehand but no matter we shall still have fifty thousand francs to spend for this purpose   13.07036297736375
but my lord tell me she continued hide nothing from me what is in truth the king s position   13.700758962679926
oh it s nothing nothing   10.627039879067102
you must leave it to me and give me the entire direction of the undertaking   15.670141350041991
and that is that it is not those gentlemen who are in the greatest danger it is ourselves   15.413236068053227
cried the brigands   8.035697424406766
life is the greatest treasure and speaking candidly ours hangs by a thread   10.97680278664311
an opal colored light through which an autumnal sun shed its golden rays descended on the blue ocean   13.084908255816927
porthos wept   10.320608853835676
money never comes amiss at any time my lord   13.906626108491984
they ordered the lackeys not to unsaddle the horses and to hold themselves in readiness to set off again immediately   7.841834873548461
that man then was not that man said milady lowering her voice is my brother   12.555339135655446
they halted for the king to dine   8.799327841128557
after cromwell charles ii   10.069562603456806
lucien a great event has happened   12.119589690321968
of myself cried morcerf   10.31119958181062
he then returned with the same slow step and said go and tell the dying man that he must be patient   14.768098225269355
it is getting cold   14.603647602421239
the sergeant and his men took possession of the little garden   10.068691520244366
you no doubt observed the horses standing a few minutes since at the door   12.602401250529859
here is what you are looking for he said   12.514756667147141
he ventured to call and it seemed to him that the wind wafted back an almost inarticulate sigh   9.434842334464253
well you do not answer cardinal what do you think about it   9.849543219144362
never mind it for i see you once more said the old man   14.006327676341405
that is all i require   13.267311373891594
i must hurry you so that as she has no mother she may at least have a grandmother to bless her marriage   12.887175723281404
really sir you are delightful and i should like to spend a month at bragelonne   14.71345948306185
the second followed and descended from the plateau   11.599690294587786
he was going to throw the crawfish out also when grimaud snatched it from his hands   11.592360275501298
40150m you understand me   18.057735176962268
when he was alone he opened the door of the corridor and then that of the ante chamber   11.723881115796377
i grasped it in my hand put out the flame as quickly as i could lighted my taper in the fire itself and opened the crumpled paper with inexpressible emotion recognizing when i had done so that these characters had been traced in mysterious and sympathetic ink only appearing when exposed to the fire   16.85196903192086
yes monsieur one and twenty years ago   11.622588659774284
said morcerf more and more astonished   19.37272345829178
slight stains of blood which came from the wound inflicted upon the man who accompanied the carriage as a courier or from one of the horses dotted the road   12.959408193317753
exclaimed aramis who was not quite so indifferent to the good things of the earth as athos do you remember when we were at parpaillot the beautiful oysters that we ate   10.52407251885573
why simply from the circumstance of my having bought her one day as i was passing through the market at constantinople   11.762950279037765
de villefort pressed his hand upon his brow which at first pale had become red and burning   13.989058405608505
let us return to my ring or rather to yours   13.314976101564707
mordaunt s very lips grew white with rage   14.345006469982701
is this not more than a poor sailor like me could have hoped for   8.352954066351137
sire said villefort your majesty mistakes   9.101602480883887
the letter shall be given to himself   11.443226486916272
she gave him some slippers in which he placed his naked feet and then conducted him down the stairs   10.895338500714164
the duchess permits you to kiss her hand   11.834604849111765
that is to say excellency replied pastrini who was desirous of keeping up the dignity of the capital of the christian world in the eyes of his guest that there are no carriages to be had from sunday to tuesday evening but from now till sunday you can have fifty if you please   8.807858362278655
villefort looked at him as if he had doubted his words   13.665049695430111
i understand and foreseeing that such might be the case i took in spite of my ignorance of affairs certain precautions   13.266639874052707
and whither am i to go   11.352073135310775
i go to the louvre   8.832665460186302
this tranquillity proved one thing that d artagnan did not yet know milady   14.950649714781521
no i shall go incognito count under the name of marie michon   16.747833762722266
it is impossible it can be she said he   12.221832728025511
but she saw no one   9.315228760217884
do not dig any more said the voice   17.151667119007094
you are acquainted with the young viscount are you   11.588495533973656
the young man had found signor pastrini looking very much alarmed and this had only made him the more anxious to read albert s letter   18.453359092234155
who was then only prince of wales   8.920012123007275
you are always the same athos great and generous   15.267954889229202
they are ignorant of the consequences of the murder   16.6235223728514
he fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat and he redoubled his exertions increasing rapidly his distance from the château but exhausting his strength   10.517076728832548
you stop at the spot where he received the blow   16.050078519538445
louvieres became very pale and waited impatiently for the officer to explain himself   12.032266574057681
well said madame danglars come and undress me   12.123873511697612
you must mount your horse and proceed to the rue tiquetonne hotel de la chevrette whence you will take my horse and that of monsieur du vallon which you must saddle and equip as if for war and then you will leave paris bringing them with you to cours la reine   11.847946627723164
mercédès shuddered and fixing on her son a scrutinizing gaze you speak strangely said she to albert and you appear to have some singular prejudices   8.85100958394925
the storm broke about ten o clock   18.732101553088906
and yet you pity a man who without being bitten by one of his race has yet murdered his benefactor   9.408766377439413
he finds the cooking detestable replied porthos   13.540280347797328
for a man who like franz viewed his position in its true light it was a grave one   13.577738026357773
took an active part in the return from the island of elba   10.32604077894926
the servants who fled from the house informed me   12.685631756890864
villefort looked at monte cristo with extreme amazement   6.086222156551248
is it still only an intention your eminence   9.9491990321564
then what would you say if you knew the extent of the sacrifice i make to you   4.901221874597635
wealth does not necessarily produce happiness   7.940396723753879
here i am your excellency said peppino with an eagerness which danglars thought favorable to him   8.605926585650622
be it so said beauchamp   14.403574858009618
but without doubt that eternal enemy of our souls that lion roaring constantly around us breathed it into my mind   8.948377074458067
monte cristo stopped after having closed the gate and fastened the string to the nail and cast a look around   9.426580504605003
spies guards satellites all took me for you and the king blesses you while waiting for you to bless him   9.031786483965798
i am not a banker like m   9.495345948585484
our mission is ended and there is nothing more to detain us now but the good pleasure of the great man to whom we were sent   13.301563183165756
to the sloop said felton and row quickly   14.915913582226363
yes answered athos but his right place is in our ranks with the prince de conti de beaufort d elbeuf and de bouillon   15.371900741946355
he had given his word not to watch mme   13.561331394656115
i recommend you therefore to keep the strictest watch   5.4877664834641475
now my friends said athos finish them at a blow   10.465471071337598
it signifies to my father the count of morcerf whose christian name is fernand   16.98047175333983
by the gentleman who was here yesterday   9.82854373904937
locusta valentine was alone   10.593648205911324
recollect the seven fat and the seven lean kine   12.649630735842305
beware my dear d artagnan   15.521681534123358
the streets are full of armed men continued d artagnan   14.689508252170523
albert started on hearing these words   14.004051239854185
madame de lannoy who is devoted to your eminence as you know   17.546060170153638
however they left the castle behind   16.927720715168036
but no all was hermetically sealed   13.832678256789391
then the question was put to him who was the best jailer in all the prisons in france   11.249138898777005
do not detain those gentlemen here count she said   9.826245860822054
was mazarin to remain the favorite and minister of the queen   12.181410447083334
you know monsieur d artagnan   16.93905844929031
pushed from him violently the table at which he was sitting   15.255961416340904
gentlemen said he leave me alone with patrick and laporte ah is that you de winter   10.972064786478617
i said the cardinal and the cardinal is not even a frenchman   11.61977085292988
at last he appeared to have made himself familiar with his surroundings   8.85438861400662
my place of abode is no   14.006322982410758
this succor which came to porthos at the moment in which he was attacked in his gastronomic hopes inspired much gratitude in the musketeer toward the procurator s wife   7.072051011761504
but how is it that madame de villefort is not here   16.233702102382512
for from time to time one of those sweet smiles which were habitual to him in moments of good humor illumined the face of d artagnan   11.061376864673056
i met him on the boulevard on my way here said beauchamp   10.45225895812321
sir said anne to mazarin with an accent from which daily habits of dissimulation could not entirely chase the real expression see if we can do something for these gentlemen   15.79320998774596
to morrow evening if you like   12.503138111707301
they shook their heads   16.179967789006568
i see that you understand french   14.809059212545463
you lie said the abbé busoni with a tone of irresistible authority   8.290583022186087
it is this listen in france at this moment everything is poor and paltry   14.321463821006793
like the ancient paladins he has only undertaken this war to obtain a look from his lady love   11.095745781535124
villefort mechanically felt for the handle of the door   9.81624743931473
then turning toward porthos the devil   7.403523981049524
these recollections were dwelt upon with some pleasure by danglars and restored him to some degree of tranquillity   10.515269153717526
the abbé faria   3.621285987816499
but i too have had the idea you have and two or three times the same fancy has come over me   11.102419665362596
you must have discovered a mine or else become a stockbroker   16.8127245402925
i am safe for a few days at least   9.865118261314077
what is the meaning of that noise   12.810965774954738
namely to find a man who will not fight   12.838159653535804
that is not enough madame it is necessary that your friends should be also mine   12.993199359274191
comminges left the head of the escort and went to the queen s carriage   11.421941537446259
who formed the plan by which we left the establishment of m   15.940513514707046
rely on me to procure you the other   13.89729489781952
the next day came and passed the day after a week   8.117132221641235
grief may kill although it rarely does and never in a day never in an hour never in ten minutes   12.11405910074035
it was granted and was to take place after her morning s levee at which in accordance with his rights of birth he was entitled to be present   8.868160152477444
and in all probability i should be promoted to the honor of making sport for the children if such innocent beings could be found in an abode devoted like this to suffering and despair   9.615323472102414
each of these little tickling arrows must have pleased my father added albert with a laugh   12.647318390059265
and then perhaps on entering the convent he changed his name   15.368545841787615
when mordaunt arrived opposite the house he saw d artagnan on the threshold and the soldiers lying on the grass here and there with their arms   9.50934652714262
he is a philanthropist answered the other   16.371318632898426
a moment later madame de villefort entered the drawing room with her little edward   16.010999365213003
near blois   13.876758520949746
i had determined to make believe sup but to eat nothing   11.41152050207461
andrea turned towards them and with an impertinent smile asked have you any message for your father mademoiselle danglars for in all probability i shall return to paris   12.052921305569205
still silent valentine had promised not to wake   10.80021192362458
what do you want with me my friend   10.530418314670145
protected as he is by his high position and firmly established reputation for talent and unswerving integrity no one could oppose him   10.705775693978865
do you recollect in the arbor of the hôtel des postes at perugia seeing a man in a brown cloak whom your stepmother was questioning upon aqua tofana   16.14472567961406
perhaps said athos   17.925108688649438
oh replied danglars since we can not leave this port for the next three months let us hope that ere the expiration of that period dantès will be set at liberty   7.991038221988716
you are wisdom incarnate athos aramis replied   10.565854430017035
and he kissed the letter with passion without even vouchsafing a look at the gold which sparkled on the table   12.138053133010333
extremely well   13.620229741352762
and was the sum a large one   12.707134581174321
truly athos interrupted d artagnan i am vexed that such a man as you are should talk nonsense which schoolboys would be ashamed of   10.12683238035226
you pledge me for three millions do you not   6.4779342135323015
said he holding out his hand to the young man   15.8551706220554
dame that s a long job monsieur   10.9845163738153
how can he be the son of a great lord   16.671123372221892
he is at my house   10.66641630204697
he did   13.031511652731096
do you not know their history   8.274168868979748
i will not quit you said vasiliki   12.315518167177505
but you d artagnan what is the matter with you and what has happened to you personally   16.21890951174265
is it about sending me to the bastile   8.31238145662099
yes during the spanish war at perpignan where fernand had left her   13.21153811549626
holà bazin   11.808562224017425
how can you reconcile that with his conduct this morning   7.832331290023655
don t let us drink wine which comes from an unknown source   16.743699830076416
it is strange said aramis   13.57331931327555
but be easy   15.285183834815548
her elbows were placed upon a mean table and she leaned her head upon her two hands which were white as ivory   10.74584451820641
at this moment they heard above all the galloping and neighing of the horses winter s voice crying out sword in hand   5.871847308012103
and athos went out of the parpaillot followed by d artagnan   6.015206412053673
you will begin therefore by taking me first out of paris will you not my dear m   9.013711869019094
let his eminence do me the honor to give me a hearing   7.290438691545271
however i scold you instead of him and in his place   9.193968455291634
and you seek admittance into our ranks   14.377482296655703
i merely tell you to look into my conduct during the last four years that we have ceased to be husband and wife and see whether it has not always been consistent   12.878508760887875
here said he are dogs who bark and bite at the same time they are for the two first who shall have a longing for your diamond friend caderousse   16.699673027426922
are you not aware that this italian directs everything both indoors and out   15.579120062835273
it must have been for his hide for certes the carcass is not worth eighteen livres   17.281655388704007
well grimaud my friend have you seen anything   11.284386498054108
or as you know your way go first   17.783792412536954
50083m what is the matter   14.72800149097101
it was six o clock in the morning the dawn was just breaking and its feeble ray came into the dungeon and paled the ineffectual light of the lamp   13.53591040706186
it was one of the magnificent autumn days which make amends for a short summer   11.892399564569072
i must do something to distract my thoughts   11.208012742952294
withdraw sir said buckingham or i will call my attendant and have you placed in irons   6.555782569225308
i imagined it must be said morrel   8.603383531900914
de tréville was highly astonished to see his protégé make a sudden spring become crimson with passion and rush from the cabinet crying s blood he shall not escape me this time   10.496969769104394
a second discharge followed the first   15.86328418697185
to prepare her system to resist poison   13.102748056979491
now in 86 400 seconds very many things can be done   7.732224485338905
immediately one of the men who were waiting slipped down into the moat tied under grimaud s shoulders the end of a cord and the remaining two who held the other end drew grimaud to them   12.620742338566199
he instantly retired from a feeling of respectful delicacy   9.237194502466991
now i may hope that god will forgive me since my crime is expiated   11.69831523568668
only tell me how high up is your excavation   15.424044330964506
those who have once beheld such a spectacle know that there is nothing more solemn more striking than the raging sea rolling with its deafening roar its dark billows beneath the pale light of a wintry moon   8.858578313624657
i know him for a norman and normans are obstinate   5.367442121065707
serve us up the best supper you can and especially give us some good wine   13.408145207024688
chapter 86   9.008358500514897
there was a moment s silence during which one could have fancied the hall empty so profound was the stillness   5.519792149228614
he is at work in his library but he expects you sir replied the valet   13.362822504223391
and yet she added suppose he should refuse and that the king loses the battle   5.459464281212856
yes monseigneur said porthos it is he   18.8682306482544
on the staircase he met signor pastrini   5.9230773530782965
then he continued your pardon sire he said bowing my zeal carried me away   9.230080864758246
athos took the letter frowning but an idea that he should find something in this letter about d artagnan conquered his unwillingness to read it   14.214091634636564
why here they give you their hand they press yours in return they keep up a whispering conversation permit you to accompany them home   11.02076213479224
they mounted the king on winter s horse and winter on that of the king   9.728126637827927
well i own it   14.20253098555036
said the woman   16.394310343277766
my lord observes that there will be enough to go around   10.157514357489655
let us go the same way   11.255308990429752
de villefort resumed the king addressing the young man who motionless and breathless was listening to a conversation on which depended the destiny of a kingdom   11.198645721136108
oh i can t let you go so   7.791483602612308
de morcerf has been my friend or rather my acquaintance during the last thirty years   13.139420745222717
and he turned to the door just as the valet de chambre announced m   12.33671256417574
take some more of these cigars m   14.307067825231314
that is true said porthos and he spurred his courser on   12.640596097206334
sighed bazin   10.13831165909278
you are very lucky if you see anything such a night as this said porthos   12.42447765919585
i look around the boat expecting every moment to see that poor wretch holding between his hands the poniard plunged into his heart   12.391445136684391
all sorts of misfortunes   14.080666812700253
after the varied relations i have had the happiness to sustain towards you can it be that you know me so little as to ask such a thing   6.708536596294307
no not to you so i am going to tell you where he is   5.527777295980245
and beppo led him outside the walls   5.311708462703315
i am free replied maximilian and rich enough to support you   14.257676439104724
the major drew an armchair towards him and proceeded to seat himself   12.302622415465033
yes that is my companion s name   0.6768853186023431
people do not go out from it by the door but by the window   10.791174015960681
by a sort of instinctive impulse franz withdrew as much as possible behind his pillar   16.532942817423564
on my honor they are not poisoned   11.928777626689882
it was three o clock in the afternoon   10.213078563892147
and i replied very well you shall have it   9.215250431224266
as to the cavalier in the brown cloak it is the cardinal   9.363758455402692
said one of the two cavaliers to a servant who was lying in the outer compartment which served as a kind of ante room   10.962311507774155
our duty is fulfilled   13.626876844675593
the dim light the profound silence and the gloomy thoughts inspired by the hour and still more by her own conscience all combined to produce a sensation of fear   12.259008967245467
of intrigues and secrets of state continued d artagnan complying with the recommendation   11.50392770637741
but after all asked porthos who is milady   11.434869190778823
i wished to cry out but an icy shiver ran through my veins and stifled my voice   13.152661716161399
de villefort kept the promise he had made to madame danglars to endeavor to find out how the count of monte cristo had discovered the history of the house at auteuil   5.576547244486797
swear then said villefort joining the hands of morrel and d avrigny swear that you will spare the honor of my house and leave me to avenge my child   12.00492598123196
i tell you i am madame bonacieux   13.64678261159078
and you say interrupted monte cristo that this took place towards the year 1829 your excellency   9.074824477819561
and did you promise the queen resumed d artagnan petulantly to storm the tower of london to kill a hundred thousand soldiers to fight victoriously against the wishes of the nation and the ambition of a man and when that man is cromwell   15.917017229076023
tell the king that if he sleeps badly to night he will sleep better to morrow night   8.580701314678059
and does he suspect said mme   15.333453951834942
because the person who bears it is too highly favored by heaven to be the father of such a wretch as you   6.844362825496874
and whenever added athos we meet in battle at this word place royale   14.303349365248447
for i imagine just now that noll cromwell would not be inclined to trifle with us   13.298444325015279
meanwhile to his great regret as he said he was obliged to keep his bed   18.134477004840843
i thank you madame said he for the deference you have shown to my wishes but i think you want two of the studs and i bring them back to you   9.774229831702783
monsieur de beaufort took the pieces out of his mouth and presented them with great formality to monsieur de chavigny saying that for that evening the entertainment was ended but in three months it should be repeated when pistache would have learned a few new tricks   8.241427351218622
said valentine and she endeavored to recall to mind all the things which he would be likely to need   6.156129583503637
but he perceived that the man at the desk wrote or rather corrected lines of unequal length scanning the words on his fingers   11.521020762535034
the countess shuddered   10.839683194868602
in a word mademoiselle danglars would make a charming mistress but a wife diable   13.911176056519912
soon however his surprise vanished for he heard the murmurs of a soft harmonious voice   9.47946545530384
or else he should not have reached beaucaire   18.319547279950033
that will be a difficult matter to arrange besides i shall just be in the way of all the preparations for departure   7.34570307542467
a few words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two officers of the law   10.120324391191577
because don carlos has fled from bourges and has returned to spain   8.383699477620631
could never rid himself this horse was born in the house of your father about thirteen years ago and has remained in it ever since which ought to make you love it   7.177449296570347
the name of father is sacred in two senses   11.571138129128022
30349m m   16.32263176250491
magloire for she guessed the reproaches that awaited her there   10.766419685006392
the former found guilty of the murder of a venerable and exemplary priest named don césar torlini canon of the church of st   14.724212457825153
behind the sentinel was a staircase with twenty steps   8.70915137679614
she must repent and educate my son the sole survivor with the exception of the indestructible old man of the wreck of my house   14.526707619954653
on the contrary when one aims a blow that is the regulation way to strike   13.17515402095377
you may think my departure strange and foolish said the young man   14.256306730652547
all at once he heard his bolts drawn and made a terrified bound   7.9680124119171385
at every step you encountered dead bodies and bands of murderers who killed plundered and burned   13.232262334756358
well it will be given to someone who has done nothing to deserve it said beauchamp   16.99262660360754
that s a match you are playing with his eminence   12.415317961437543
i have just sent away the sentinel that i might remain here without anybody knowing it in order to speak to you without being overheard   8.151897124048613
at these words the murmur without became an explosion   16.245400711500622
and who is it   8.064407951195195
i will see about the continuation of it and tomorrow i hope you will be satisfied with the corrections i shall have made in consequence of your advice   12.975661398214339
edmond felt that the moment had arrived summoned up all his courage held his breath and would have been happy if at the same time he could have repressed the throbbing of his veins   13.643983792230834
they left their two nags upon the high road and ran toward the quay   15.601332113475028
of the important cities given up by henry iv   16.491243675142606
yes but listen this was not all   13.375882207694925
i thought so madame stammered the young girl   14.600260481900374
bonacieux of whom his head if not his heart was already full   12.59140583125504
let us only remember the present   16.622095798106564
at these words she opened the door of the corridor and pushed d artagnan out of the room   13.422738779842835
i heard her with my own ears   12.035116542280516
they made him get out walk along the banks of the river and then brought him to teresa and luigi who were waiting for him in the catacombs of st   14.599422495992936
to this reproach there is always one response which deludes women   14.948654038011608
i will return home instantly   11.315450062539036
chatillon made a sign with his hand and aramis was about to dismount when he received a violent shock   7.740602339150673
mousqueton made with a low whistling sound the sign of alarm well known to the lackeys in the days of their youth resumed his place at the table and made a sign to blaisois to follow his example   14.063176403971385
for the cardinal knows all and it is he who urges on the king who as yet knows nothing but will soon know everything   16.619845150523652
do you wish to destroy me   12.30341008439428
nothing had as yet occurred to shake cocles belief   12.482626103334571
that is what it is to be rich   9.015676393392411
nay do not press my hand edmond   10.68064309270034
they galloped on for two or three hours as furiously as the cavaliers on the wall   12.0886764103497
although distant as they were from the queen they could not count the studs   14.230287091520488
it is my duty to watch over your life madame and i will watch   12.838256284537323
yes said aramis i understand   9.63884634262142
murmured the executioner   15.984903040825994
then the cardinal put out the waxlight slipped it into his pocket and taking up the lantern now he said for monsieur de la fere   16.773655441548563
it was nearly three days since i had eaten or drunk anything   14.391262216440962
at midnight they arrived at the gate of a beautiful park   14.484147254059778
they have sold me they shall give me up and the eternal shame of treble treason shall fall on their heads   9.314062854178388
the city carpenters had erected scaffolds upon which the invited ladies were to be placed   15.241373752790379
unless the horses have wings to mount the ramparts and come and fetch you   5.842741205371523
and she sprang toward gondy whom assuredly at that moment she hated more than broussel with outstretched arms   5.9657640728175
he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face and just unclosed the lips   8.052601083157397
where you left me under the scaffold   16.263011496086957
one day when contrary to his custom he had admitted mercédès and the poor girl in spite of her own grief and despair endeavored to console him he said to her be assured my dear daughter he is dead   15.296423745427155
well my friend nothing now is lacking except that you should feel remorse for having killed that fellow   14.69877382092693
now victory has abandoned him   10.254554776687929
everybody looked and listened with astonishment comprehending nothing of what passed   9.464100334139143
i am still a lieutenant in the musketeers and have been so these twenty years   10.839245258068715
cried morrel almost overpowered   14.252655201648176
take care of the executioner d artagnan   12.489223167057133
no madame on the honor of a soldier on the faith of a christian   10.34860479148243
asked d artagnan jumping on one of them   5.435264487760206
at this spot so pregnant with fond and filial remembrances his heart beat almost to bursting his knees tottered under him a mist floated over his sight and had he not clung for support to one of the trees he would inevitably have fallen to the ground and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing there   7.989339406716056
and if i have sworn to revenge myself it is not on the french captain or the count of morcerf but on the fisherman fernand the husband of mercédès the catalane   8.759339320487326
the hôtel then is far away   10.25743776074812
the next moment the very planks of the scaffold creaked with the weight of an advancing procession and the eager faces of the spectators confirmed what a last hope at the bottom of his heart had prevented him till then believing   12.170203394007931
only d artagnan if you have not lost it give me the paper which fell from that man s hat upon which is written the name of the village of ah said d artagnan i comprehend   9.035765259299492
and monte cristo accompanied these words by the gift of two gold pieces which produced a torrent of thanks and blessings from the concierge   10.548266274789226
then to conceal the mass of earth and rubbish i dug up i was compelled to break through a staircase and throw the fruits of my labor into the hollow part of it   10.400616041122042
whom do i see yonder   13.667943825667933
i am sent for to sign the release of a prisoner   9.605725108100252
then they will return with a fortune of six hundred francs and waste this treasure in some city with the pride of sultans and the insolence of nabobs   7.5277574514499745
i thank you doctor said villefort with indescribable joy   10.516367808313417
he left the room and returned in five minutes with a phial   7.89894856170254
how old are you   12.76800382494087
are there not crimes for which the impalement of the turks the augers of the persians the stake and the brand of the iroquois indians are inadequate tortures and which are unpunished by society   15.079088916275321
on our account   15.852231085977284
monte cristo smiled significantly   10.21329935246408
young and beautiful   15.035564986436142
30159m yes since you have known me said morrel smiling   12.303794946432223
at length they reached the tent lit a lamp and while planchet stood at the entrance that the four friends might not be surprised d artagnan with a trembling hand broke the seal and opened the so anxiously expected letter   13.031441499732711
so long as i hoped you were working for the good of our house and for the fortune of our daughter i philosophically closed my eyes   11.424609533825638
he said he was a friend of yours asked your address and is coming to see you   11.804651579858952
answered m   9.266238989848436
de blacas pondered deeply between the confident monarch and the truthful minister   14.172488951313651
yes he is to marry mademoiselle de villefort   13.571937178763587
do you wish these proofs these attestations which i alone possess to be destroyed   11.751217565910459
the jailer continued now this was his project   14.468072738898362
the bishop looked anxiously at the man sobbing in the ingle nook   17.597043249109866
it was a dark night   17.17970546834313
i did not ask for it   13.629869295754624
i hate him so little that i should be delighted to order masses for the repose of his soul   15.691786904174826
as nine o clock sounded d artagnan was at the place royale   13.024209417368844
well now that would be a real fortune to us my friend   18.153077787551773
why should you meddle with what does not concern you   11.785672213410177
a boatman who had passed by rogliano and who had several of these animals whose tricks had greatly diverted him had doubtless suggested this idea to him   14.44890704554105
ah la ramee   11.711932598956048
but my lord think of what you re about to do and beware of going too far   13.096531459337365
it is true that she had not perhaps been scrupulously faithful to him but she had remembered him   13.553166457089016
by a fatality that very man bars my way   14.268984833011409
twelve hours delay was all that was granted that is until nine the next morning   19.887422653981535
d artagnan then thought of that cottage silent and obscure which had no doubt seen all and could tell its tale   8.34858691917208
as to their majesties they did not return to the louvre till six o clock in the morning   15.236617306857825
a murmur or rather storm of indignation burst from all parts of the assembly   7.932747531268968
it was said athos had met with great crosses in love and that a frightful treachery had forever poisoned the life of this gallant man   16.041093362706192
the troop of friends saw it gain the opposite bank   14.885282336292791
the bastion saint gervais chapter xlvii   11.18091751169988
he whispered a hope to himself that this beloved relative might be killed in the field   16.349502843881268
at the same instant a market cart which some minutes before had appeared upon the amiens road pulled up at the inn and planchet and grimaud came out of it with the saddles on their heads   13.11518880802818
at sight of this pale bleeding man the wife grasped her husband s arm   15.760462865677361
then only when he had heard the step of the horse going away he fell back on a chair saying my god i thank thee that he knows me only   11.299553972317
and as to your husband monsieur bonacieux he is not here because he was yesterday evening conducted to the bastille   8.143556940155086
the soldiers are swiss who understand only german   14.849940799871673
you can not live upon your fifteen thousand francs   12.329595978833686
she scarcely resisted   10.897425326589309
i am fearfully exhausted and debilitated by this attack   13.405294226931776
as the moving object drew nearer he would easily have perceived that it consisted of a man and horse between whom the kindest and most amiable understanding appeared to exist   16.070116794789257
as the flood proved once for all   9.560484192628985
be kind enough then madame to act more compliantly   8.881840439903957
the wretched man was sentenced to the galleys for life and i was immediately set at liberty   12.750626659299533
he died   13.338117554601089
put your two hands together   15.06081373582768
the cardinal turned and said in a loud voice rochefort   14.89686424525463
for twenty years i have tasted nothing but water   13.124789516846368
as the door was closed rochefort cast a glance toward mazarin which was answered by one equally furtive from the minister   14.80301045051801
oh heaven forbid   6.9082967290051736
if you can be satisfied with my dinner it consists of cooked tetragones and fruits   7.974398227041388
exclaimed valentine perceiving all these signs of agitation   13.183054671177857
only we conspire against the rochellais   11.905439930297987
be philosophers as i am gentlemen   16.479364873779684
obeying the queen athos read aloud the letter which we have already seen in which king charles demanded to know whether the hospitality of france would be accorded him   17.579807178403996
and what have you been doing since yesterday   10.663915523365196
this then is what you call devotion   16.804812095280717
well what next   11.704885939879597
because he may be tried for it   11.146215925155342
but wait wait   13.395161596449515
a man can easily be put out of the way there then   13.485486642615403
answered raoul you joke about a real misfortune   9.825089404873339
and the disappearance of his money   16.644186536087886
i tell you she loves another   12.239914568081646
and the four friends flew at a gallop along the road to béthune   14.595869561771075
now only am i fully convinced of being the emissary of god   10.436833468949233
with a thousand pistoles one may face everything   9.782155708085913
probably said athos   16.339911122823565
oh i never make matches my dear prince it is my settled principle   12.684431119590679
for my part monsieur i am catholic my father faithful to his principles having made my elder brother a huguenot   17.139258685301986
but they will contest the will after your death   12.6344207706757
far beyond the door the heads of those who were not able to enter could be seen all craning to their utmost height to try and see   12.310067472327432
his drawing room under the regenerating influence of a young wife and a daughter by his first marriage scarcely eighteen was still one of the well regulated paris salons where the worship of traditional customs and the observance of rigid etiquette were carefully maintained   11.662887509455928
one of them held my life in his hands and gave it to me   13.105794906174713
oh here are two flints and a piece of burnt linen   10.200695607096385
the friends slid in through this congestion of embarkation and landed in their turn   17.46781536340236
we announce he read in the same tone with which he would have read a newspaper that today the 23rd of february will be executed andrea rondolo guilty of murder on the person of the respected and venerated don césar torlini canon of the church of st   16.136623492189244
planchet went in search of the postillion who had driven her and found him   15.08806605995709
asked mademoiselle de saint méran with an air of deep interest   8.147503935641417
it is a real bed   10.741727271504715
i am in possession of all my senses sir he said   14.86248294924367
and interest was almost foreign to this commencement of love which had been the consequence of it   15.771293835402705
i had quarelled with him some time previously and had even challenged him to fight me   9.206426191637341
why diamonds and she is covered with them   9.344614961407377
it was entirely of marble with antique bas reliefs of priceless value   9.9466857224167
have you some plan in your head then   12.504046149737757
his air of perfect serenity made mazarin uneasy   14.85763263018606
pray forgive me   10.64428415238958
and that she almost wished her father might lose his fortune that she might become an artist like her friend mademoiselle louise d armilly   18.515032088024093
as he said he was ready to go to the end of the world to seek her   14.29860806722359
ay but it is for the first time madame   10.298675974445104
d artagnan pressed it with a respect mixed with gratitude   13.64067390856901
cardinal i must have the queen s papers   12.175901042196104
because i am believed to be dead and have reasons for wishing nobody to know i am living   9.638821624803485
i am looking for the person who let down the ladder   11.103791706759415
the steward of the duc de grammont   12.165895807767004
deuce take em what a popular commotion   6.081550437493218
you told me my dear valentine that you were engaged to m   12.311896185855614
0159m owing to this change the worthy shipowner became at that moment we will not say all powerful because morrel was a prudent and rather a timid man so much so that many of the most zealous partisans of bonaparte accused him of moderation but sufficiently influential to make a demand in favor of dantès   18.14076166534298
étienne said he see why mademoiselle eugénie has asked me to meet her in the drawing room and why she makes me wait so long   14.140927030594156
his presence therefore was wholly unnoticed save by the occupants of the box in which he had just seated himself   16.56076161571916
well said monte cristo it is just as i thought   14.48507901978469
athos slowly raised his pistol stretched out his arm so that the weapon almost touched milady s forehead and then in a voice the more terrible from having the supreme calmness of a fixed resolution madame said he you will this instant deliver to me the paper the cardinal signed   16.524829676717722
the sound of a light step was heard in the vestibule   12.955737563017868
yes he is making recruits and he will lend them to me   18.854522331690028
monte cristo on stepping into the house heard a sigh that was almost a deep sob   10.721490338945932
well my dear aramis you don t want three horses   13.96556454748681
thy death for my brother s   6.553898398171057
go and fetch lord de winter said felton tired of these eternal complaints   14.350295969411732
for the musketeers were known to be enemies of the cardinal and were beloved on account of the hatred they bore to his eminence   11.550846484297303
fortunately said d artagnan all this will be only necessary till after tomorrow evening for when once with the army we shall have i hope only men to dread   11.636313929976826
and have you them yet   10.948446590507633
saying these words the transteverin disappeared down the staircase while his companion muffling his features more closely than before in the folds of his mantle passed almost close to franz and descended to the arena by an outward flight of steps   16.36942497905379
and it was necessary therefore to have recourse to some profitable scheme which was a matter of great difficulty in the impoverished condition of exhausted italy   17.424886969431547
athos you are becoming mad   11.604743508471058
replied mercédès becoming paler than the sheet which covered her   8.438100440255738
count i have your word said morrel coldly   11.470302723663515
is it possible that thomson french are not looked upon as safe and solvent bankers   15.561446999124492
as certainly maximilian as i now press your hand i shall kill him before ten o clock tomorrow morning   9.835843221490062
speak then without reserve as without hatred   7.360076607906564
perhaps it is some political difference   14.03124246467251
cried aramis you set me thinking   14.010385035943195
50127m and who are you then that arrogate to yourself this tyrannical right over free and rational beings   12.613855265024796
the name is not unknown to me   9.427716854699717
he appeared to dread to lower his hands lest their veins should swell and he pinched the tips of his ears from time to time to preserve their delicate pink transparency   13.357121481556149
contrary to custom the door was open and having no occasion to ring he entered   11.413532957366176
but instead of regaining england he had abusing the position in which he had been placed declared to the queen that he would not depart without seeing her   11.52139617600307
at all events young man rely upon one who has been thirty years at court   14.375414495125789
the evening came on and with it darkness   7.947794179482724
in the evening about nine o clock at the moment he had made up his mind to go to bed he heard steps in his corridor   9.675729622177743
well i will amuse you   8.574012504200052
put the gag in grimaud   12.274348975702452
40064m albert had proceeded no farther than the door where he remained rooted to the spot being completely fascinated by the sight of such surpassing beauty beheld as it was for the first time and of which an inhabitant of more northern climes could form no adequate idea   14.985225954299935
but de winter did not call   14.175382543147578
if i should happen to be any distance from you when the carriage comes for you at dinner or supper for instance   8.95615910906084
the two friends went toward the shed   14.103785681785965
so to horse and let us knock at their door   15.048107222384335
tony is your master sleeping   11.743650688902624
suddenly the jailer entered   9.056766006146791
my son and a sacred command   8.733771757993388
will your majesty deign to excuse me   14.19454858562702
the truth my dear count   10.255125493760719
and such magnificent hair   12.428782930656618
suddenly a man sprang out of the english ranks fell upon athos twined arms of steel around him and tearing his sword from him said in his ear silence   14.421306517353024
i shall find a way   11.413905101743062
at the extremity of the wood d artagnan perceived the road that had been described to him and at the end of the road he saw the towers of an immense feudal castle   14.726397032994143
and towards whom do you bear this personal ill feeling then   8.391562964886896
he has made up his mind to take a wife from paris   11.669466854864059
d artagnan blushed up to the whites of his eyes   12.836600028665273
then we merely ask for a carriage and a pair of horses and we see the carnival in the carriage and doubtless the roman people will crown us at the capitol and proclaim us like curtius and horatius cocles the preservers of their country   13.48599880510143
kitty fearing she was ill hastened toward her and was beginning to open her dress   10.058647015460014
de tréville had spoken of her to the queen   7.3193026829846275
they all four entered the tent   12.552997620798177
that cry was of such importance as to overcome all preoccupation   12.073455674757392
she had been standing at the door to prevent his going out without seeing her until sleep which the young can not resist had overpowered her frame wearied as she was with watching   14.783109679356407
yes replied the young woman   14.59913166723877
murmured villefort wringing his hands   11.183425024257255
let your majesty dismiss m   6.671566706991026
another thing not less essential was to warn charles stuart of the attempt to be made so that he might assist his rescuers as much as possible or at least do nothing to thwart their efforts   13.762262541270848
he was excessively delighted and threw himself into his friends arms   5.840980784530476
but i sent the ring i had received from the captain to him and was instantly admitted   11.680860059465903
de tréville seized his right hand and pressed it with all his might without perceiving that athos whatever might be his self command allowed a slight murmur of pain to escape him and if possible grew paler than he was before   10.789071528704175
i believe you my lord as implicitly as if god had spoken to me said the young girl presenting her forehead to him   11.062217823369833
he was very well known to the customs officers of the coast   11.851740051760473
and this evening at eleven o clock you have heard what i said   15.792669711219846
it may perhaps come to this in time observed monte cristo   14.80836626672178
asked vampa with uneasiness   8.202950629513678
call charles he added addressing the boy who waited   13.829442654999994
the breaking of his jug was too natural an accident to excite suspicion   14.6418737598113
yes but answered la ramee trying to laugh a ladder of ropes can t be sent around a ball like a letter   15.427206177439436
the four friends appeared to be entire strangers to one another and indifferent to the precautions taken for guarding the king   12.380838453541507
the question then was how to change this probability into a certainty   12.999721850348728
you may venture to ask me anything   7.9615992770194
you don t like him my dear parthenie said scarron   13.996292523586702
but cried the young officer speak then speak   13.045372352147659
good said aramis taking a purse which bazin presented to him   18.341311706734576
they are waiting for the cardinal or rather for bernouin who comes to call them when the cardinal goes out   11.260995898420308
an unexpected incident in the affair of murder and theft at the count of monte cristo s in which he nearly fell a victim deprives us of the pleasure of seeing m   14.31078613307369
anyone but a man of exhaustless thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the steward s extraordinary repugnance for the count s projected drive without the walls   9.383791717036274
and as every prisoner is worth ten sous a day to his jailer he replied in a more subdued tone   5.567409688897963
we are both of us able to kill you and your eight men we two only   12.775083163013402
is it not some bad affair   14.067412631147878
to conspire against my honor with madame de chevreuse madame de longueville and the condés   10.91819418502481
don t let him escape   14.900299700769377
what do you say to this du vallon   10.56311852948131
art thou a minister from hell   16.731091128429085
will said the notary   6.529890682122497
i am the most wretched of men   12.648266025079087
sir said albert rising i will do myself the honor of sending my seconds to you and you will be kind enough to arrange with them the place of meeting and the weapons   15.113605111003135
have the fugitives been pursued   11.866670067795575
on that day in fact the four friends arrived punctually at the hour each from his own abode or occupation   12.485616774590596
with one wave of his hand athos made grimaud who followed the little troop understand everything and they passed on like a whirlwind d artagnan still directing them from behind with his voice   11.62026744443137
the count must feel sure that franz recognized him   11.126658634188683
i am quite resigned   11.065263455668404
30207m good he said   12.518257606394869
planchet by way of dessert would have liked to hear the conversation   7.119994179148841
his understanding weakened by such events refused to comprehend such incredible unheard of fabulous facts   6.860247164006811
a carriage waited at the door the coachman was on the box and a police officer sat beside him   12.456450373350014
aramis made a presence of believing in the reality of her opposition and was unwilling to deprive himself in his own view of the credit of her conversion   10.921476422583185
the air i breathe is the air of liberty   8.338881004251778
fernand departed with the rest bearing with him the terrible thought that while he was away his rival would perhaps return and marry mercédès   15.729517880106917
asked he of the count with as much indifference as he could assume   14.514589043960797
danglars thought it as well to comply with a good grace so he took the pen ink and paper peppino offered him wrote the draft and signed it   14.279752639509024
with your permission monsieur i wish to speak a word with my friend   13.240192805074042
finally as the hour for her interview with the count approached milady had everything about her darkened and ordered kitty to return to her own chamber and introduce de wardes whenever he presented himself   10.275543728805653
the valet instantly brought to his master a regimental hat with a wide brim   13.442862218216833
this corroboration of the lesson he had just received put the finishing stroke to the wonder and stupefaction of m   14.231210641435297
repeated a third voice   10.516864190698227
then pursued the young man eagerly   10.671938933980735
as soon as he appeared in the count of morcerf s antechamber a footman the same who at rome had brought the count s card to the two young men and announced his visit sprang into the vestibule and when he arrived at the door the illustrious traveller found his carriage awaiting him   16.708267324842353
because monsieur some mischief might happen to you   9.959355660316696
and that was too much far too much murmured villefort   12.061106340808609
50053m the two ladies pressing closely to one another and drawing the bedclothes tightly around them remained silent to this supplicating voice repugnance and fear taking possession of their minds   11.432067038681328
i dragged myself toward the bed to seek the only defense i had left my saving knife   15.253282443486121
mine also are from him   17.307784030961038
his visit was announced to the governor who on hearing that he came from the cardinal went to meet him and received him at the top of the great flight of steps outside the door   10.700444719116783
besides should any ill luck happen to two of us will it not be much better that the other two should be spared to assist those who may be apprehended   11.524185866049322
i was arrested why i know not toward the beginning of the year 1811   12.364778950858037
where you please after you have put me on shore at portsmouth   10.448281621697774
horse   14.839111465597504
fell into the sea   10.363775705314259
no your excellency replied the valet de chambre the master of the hounds came this morning to inform him that he had marked down a stag   14.807491747902683
franz looked at albert as though he had not much confidence in the suggestions of his imagination   12.106463410561968
then to justify myself i should say that you gave me the money   13.286927125204125
you know athos you never spoke much of such matters   7.252213126903096
no my life has been passed in frivolity   9.255366548967647
i do not wish to come between a father and son   9.90810396860439
franz and the count went downstairs accompanied by peppino   9.820416391684201
what makes you believe this   15.049718189555655
besides the count will be in his own house and only see them when he thinks fit to do so   7.352108235856123
haydée haydée you are young and beautiful   11.071532406322419
teach bazin prosody   7.871132653183409
thank you my friend thank you   11.637154616440325
why should we not spend the last three hours remaining to us of life like those ancient romans who when condemned by nero their emperor and heir sat down at a table covered with flowers and gently glided into death amid the perfume of heliotropes and roses   13.49617268709825
let us sit down and chat quietly as brother and sister ought to do   12.5951856798203
whence comes that cry   6.698137042136226
well then replied the major they paid me 50 000 francs down   13.877032800438524
just what you please   10.612785938750907
one as fresh as if he had come out of a bandbox the other so covered with dust that he looked as if he had but just come off a field of battle   10.347515490493715
to me sir   13.565363234793997
my lord said d artagnan it is twenty years since cardinal de richelieu made me lieutenant   8.348405698038452
in a moment he restrained himself so powerfully that the tempestuous heaving of his breast subsided as turbulent and foaming waves yield to the sun s genial influence when the cloud has passed   18.084317776857105
on this promise being given porthos who had never doubted his friend s assurance turned back with him toward the castle   14.130541737107984
there will remain then four hundred and fifty pistoles said d artagnan contentedly   9.290495723671015
speak then i beg of you   14.247666781566675
that would occasion a loss of precious time   12.922216016915053
do not seek to assist me in that which i am accomplishing   16.778113323661586
follow me replied d artagnan   13.035215401685697
so long as you are not mine valentine i shall always think i may lose you   13.61415839013598
cried d artagnan enlightened by a sudden idea my lord   13.057581716915177
porthos had forgotten that any other address was necessary   10.515558722340362
upon my honor i begin to think that heaven favors us   10.353412962324327
his dress will procure him the means of approaching the scaffold itself and he will deliver the official order to the officer who in his turn will hand it to the executioner   10.819961746675855
i am neither the abbé busoni nor lord wilmore said monte cristo   13.052450197427035
i wish to see him at once   15.851185216443422
the blinds were pulled down and they started at a gallop by the rue richelieu   13.037780335205202
then turning towards beauchamp if you have anything to attend to beauchamp do it directly   8.994504562443014
besides said aramis had they taken effect it would be still better not to compromise two excellent friends like d artagnan and porthos   12.564191647859317
blood washes out dishonor said morrel   16.55768016140331
she calculated that to cross this corner of france and return to the cardinal it would take her at least three days   6.587514108242255
said the duke for your sake i beg of you never come within the reach of my fist   13.907342675417482
oh lord yes monsieur   10.49603554060144
well i have business with the procureur   10.318859653314234
it was just in time for valentine s head swam and she staggered   16.083142271100826
but as there were all kinds of people about who were in a state of stupefaction at the unexpected arrival of the court he whispered in his friend s ear   13.225893888699323
they have cut the cord and gone off with the boat   10.953144718881552
he had accompanied his wife to the place of her confinement or else at least to the first relay   17.511764172930206
besides mother remark how vivid his eye how raven black his hair and his brow though so pale is free from wrinkles he is not only vigorous but also young   7.148400796958008
you put back the boards sweep the floor go out at the door and run as i told you   14.922823426649686
i dare say you know how to navigate should he fail us   15.477962227457326
a simple question from a friend would have irritated him   19.544365810062367
the past is another thing said athos sighing   8.476602919750345
it bleeds seemingly   9.538876854112397
monsieur athos said richelieu receive my thanks for the good guard you have kept   12.877443217161604
my friend my dear maximilian do not make a hasty resolution i entreat you   13.379145939307769
ah yes about a year after the disappearance of his son the poor old man died   9.542145161673517
i can be useful in one way only if knowledge of parisian habits of the means of rendering yourself comfortable or of the bazaars can assist you may depend upon me to find you a fitting dwelling here   13.091289884663604
you possess a quality which can never belong to mademoiselle danglars   7.20627756179049
ten minutes afterward planchet joined him at the stables of the hôtel des gardes   6.9585884714545685
why really it was all exactly as you say   8.85682009295478
monte cristo stopped and examined it attentively   15.969892070180649
the fact was that andrea at war with society ever since his youth was quite as deep as a gendarme even though he were advanced to the rank of brigadier and quite prepared for the fire he had climbed out on the roof and was crouching down against the chimney pots   10.48738145494081
the prisoners in their expressive language have named it the lions den probably because the captives possess teeth which frequently gnaw the bars and sometimes the keepers also   15.198442439973935
they who love believe easily in love   12.868202154374684
and now monsieur du verger he said shut yourself up with this man until monsieur bernouin returns to open the door   12.643754136739345
you will not reply however and these gentlemen i am sure will presently be of my opinion   8.599948797382893
the miserable villain   13.37814779480008
in case of a check mazarin made a slight movement one must foresee everything   16.865058101353327
it seems to me however said mazarin the safest method   9.992314939223792
you deceive me madame said the novice   14.857332546230417
the great are often ungrateful   14.369007075451233
would god send the same dreams to you as to me if you did not love me   13.56720012775276
i was not sure but i thought it might be so   14.522216877036715
i will wear it i swear to you as a grateful man should do   8.9920635853559
oh tomorrow tomorrow i must have some pledge from you which will prove that you think of me   5.642364793617725
in three seconds d artagnan had wounded him three times exclaiming at each thrust one for athos one for porthos   11.327445760245972
bazin felt some one pulling his sleeve   12.093582377910353
then the cambric was torn from her beautiful shoulders   15.669559571281015
she had profited by my absence and furnished with the half of the linen and having written down the day and hour at which i had deposited the child at the asylum had set off for paris and had reclaimed it   13.12865157015946
are you ill mother   16.418228313859462
to me to you to us   12.79032826173855
at the end of some seconds two sharp taps were heard inside   16.281732122915933
whether he spoke seriously or in jest since it was evident that under existing circumstances d artagnan was the only man who could relieve the queen s uneasiness bernouin went without hesitation to announce to her this strange embassy   11.994664359101757
should he find him at all   9.490443844135632
i dare not positively assert it as he has been lost for so long a time   11.9290490794297
there madame he said is monsieur gondy who hastens to obey your majesty s summons   16.203796475038306
take her six bottles of different wine cyprus sherry and malaga and a barrel of ostend oysters   14.474020185504097
morcerf it is not enough to answer yes or no to questions which concern the honor the social interest and the life of such a man as lieutenant général the count of morcerf peer of france   8.497815782691262
during the last five or six months that this weakness had been felt the worthy procurator had nearly become the slave of his wife   5.461599123939598
i remember now   9.159884743431697
but when poor silly folks like my husband there have been persuaded to tell all they know the promises and assurances of safety are quickly forgotten   12.52456021184518
as to raoul he had attended the duchess to her carriage where as she took her seat she gave him her hand to kiss   13.87409322238252
five minutes elapsed during which franz saw the shepherd going along a narrow path that led over the irregular and broken surface of the campagna   12.83612522806295
and cardinal richelieu having discovered in him great financial aptitude had introduced him with a strong recommendation to louis xiii   20.50235096263968
no no no replied the eye of the paralytic   11.456387145708904
what have we to do   8.309061008301988
why my good fellow you must be mad   8.551568024938797
i have twenty visits to make and as many letters to write   11.800244074005555
but the queen will perhaps refuse to obey   12.206385232020988
he cried what bad stabling for my horses here   6.548278706704347
this affair becomes serious   14.624396701473641
yes sir a rope ladder and tools   11.614614224580826
and a groom had gone to lens the nearest village for a doctor   13.913480054357962
and what will she do now   8.60999280372966
valentine dying as she has not only requires a priest but an avenger   12.443882961697248
these were the beggars of the court of miracles the agents of the giver of holy water in the square of saint eustache preparing barricades for the morrow   13.095562789396471
on the staircase he met the pretty soubrette who brushed gently against him as she passed and then blushing to the eyes asked his pardon for having touched him in a voice so sweet that the pardon was granted instantly   10.710732099695718
then why are you still vexed and grieved   10.72969512407969
these blunt words so terrible if taken literally were received by the other workmen with a roar of laughter   14.219398065574094
it is because they have had the axe with which criminals are executed brought and placed there on the table   9.124729861560159
then tearing himself from this abode of peace and happiness he made a sign to maximilian who followed him passively with the indifference which had been perceptible in him ever since the death of valentine had so stunned him   12.661435363051554
the king smiled patted it with his hand and jumped lightly into the saddle   9.047278199362005
no drowsiness   10.59129734779394
at this name no doubt the young man reflected a little for he went towards his groom saying this man is right   16.65434945305106
all is now explained   5.550936135440499
and you are sure the unhappy fernand did that   13.072134454315227
i should myself have recommended the match had not the noble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to it   8.753556568737284
and i understand what the count said that when you have once habituated yourself to a similar spectacle it is the only one that causes you any emotion   10.81396114988131
one is i believe from phædrus and the other from bias   10.84633647483229
asked raoul naively i thought it was derogatory   10.745729603838335
he at length muttered do you see   11.58018393355424
thou who like beings of a superior order to ourselves couldst understand the science of good and evil   11.002339795089322
will she permit it   15.160032668770057
wasn t i right to part with the horses   13.264637326038743
some persons had warned the young man of the circumstances of his future father in law who had of late sustained repeated losses   6.948302157797622
you shall die   15.889266319256242
a handsome young fellow like you does not obtain long leaves of absence from his mistress   12.757841994182979
as to d artagnan he fought purely and simply on the defensive   12.093385441143322
ah responded the woman with an expression impossible to describe   16.883909173261465
oh it is impossible you must have saved some surer more subtle and deadly poison than any other that you might escape the punishment that you deserve   14.349931736599315
and what crime has he committed   18.263178327760293
it is frank at least said morrel   15.195201447756425
he supped he went to bed   12.086470755811172
it is true that the habit of a huntress became her admirably   12.470565371003312
however this time my tranquillity or passiveness as philosophers say proceeded from another source   12.293786587265297
a cartridge box worked with gold and red and green silk   14.901761723955667
you are a faithful friend felton   10.582180355965882
what do you want with us   10.952862133797915
de la trémouille s people retreated into the hôtel the doors of which they closed just in time to prevent their enemies from entering with them   16.685599725792102
now then were a conspirator to fall into your hands he would be most welcome   10.433291851856698
emmanuel accompanied me father   13.297782299365407
who has given them to us   18.577017446202035
fifty thousand livres a mere trifle   10.326355154276609
that order does not concern me replied milady coldly since it bears another name than mine   18.81493691325057
but that on his arrival at leghorn he had come into possession of a large fortune left him by an uncle whose sole heir he was   9.936733210749363
a gallant knight can not decline a rendezvous with a lady   12.733762033739461
and what guarantee will you give me asked she if i consent to confide this message to you   9.93136663208082
murmured d artagnan crumpling his note   13.092297035898284
groslow whom d artagnan s praises had greatly pleased welcomed him with a gracious smile   9.482254022303469
i saw him yesterday   14.49632784975176
on learning of the death of the duke was that such terrible news might discourage the rochellais   10.265967324343356
so a pretty little lass my faith is that soubrette   13.40010638261326
that house is suspected tréville said the king   15.292177837888522
the barricades had been pushed as far as the palais royal   13.606542156909617
the two young men looked at morcerf as if to say are you mad or are you laughing at us   8.56863067681614
sharpen your sword baron load your pistols and give some corn to the horses for i will answer for it something lightning like will happen ere to morrow   10.732409798724726
dark very dark   11.262505383809453
are you no longer my master or have i ceased to be your slave   9.74089196137108
porthos was magnificent   11.036501086702401
they selected two exactly alike and charged the tailor to sew on each of their hats about twenty yards of ribbon and to procure them two of the long silk sashes of different colors with which the lower orders decorate themselves on fête days   12.505335394285224
oh it is very simple my good fellow   12.767252413177358
all this doubt only gave rise to a more lively desire of arriving at a certainty and he went into his friend s chamber with a fixed determination of renewing the conversation of the preceding evening   11.016239725746194
dantès examined it with intense admiration then looked around to see the instrument with which it had been shaped so correctly into form   11.244813572066146
on the contrary her own return before the appointed hour seemed greatly to astonish the servants   8.509069378745728
well said andrea let it be as you wish   11.95740162885939
and by thus watching the course of the life of others i learned what had transpired this morning in the house of peers and what was to take place this evening   6.955481662745198
that is but poor encouragement   13.588225158759101
no we were mistaken   15.136392270592236
to the soubrette she had given the heart of a duchess   13.251360063095056
they are friends of the duc de beaufort   8.111436122528572
athos filled a beaker with champagne and gave it to him   18.704653381109352
the peasant took off his hat on hearing this revered name   13.812159048128798
kitty went to her mistress and did not leave the door open   10.578269283838612
sir said he i am chief clerk of the house of thomson french of rome   12.794277656319151
these poor creatures had no bad intentions   15.348921270881018
i therefore sent them to the king s attorney   14.460856835896195
who knows what may happen or how long the attack may last   14.397731369060264
if they ask it what have i to say   10.496007084111495
it was winter s   17.954353417600878
barrois turned round and with a great effort stumbled a few steps then fell at the feet of noirtier and resting his hand on the knee of the invalid exclaimed my master my good master   8.025585981690421
follow me sir   10.119942824316153
a man has carried off your mistress a man has seduced your wife a man has dishonored your daughter   13.447797664500758
your mode of life as a smuggler said he to me one day will be the ruin of you   12.98572307463164
have they offered you money   11.95906928213608
well continued the latter since that heart is no longer with you in the bois de vincennes it is elsewhere and i must go and find it   7.830306883228566
what cried athos are you selling my horse my bajazet   14.536171764592545
oh dearest marie   11.03938718776949
i only ask a brokerage   14.696737073743314
if your friends are the more speedy you are to be saved   12.745183020279129
i ask you what can i do   13.392372125762277
the two guardsmen courteously accepted d artagnan s excuses and perceiving that the four friends desired to be alone retired   20.669820880390844
go to your rooms and try to sleep away all recollections of this evening   11.150917033485404
madame du vallon left things in much disorder   7.455971357798703
she was engaged in stilling the beatings of her heart and restraining the tears which were ready to gush forth   10.912332364879218
such men are like thunderbolts one recognizes them only when they have struck   5.850335768692187
it is you sire who have now incurred hers   14.576342470624471
de morcerf s that messrs   10.545553702740769
demanded the count   9.830886749401976
alas monsieur said she that is too bad   12.40381730180356
gentlemen exclaimed d artagnan whom reflection never abandoned gentlemen think of what you are about   5.544072391226558
it is on my conscience and compels me to speak aloud to you   6.613623478508925
the guide took them thinking them merely a few pieces of little value   11.845616244867745
i shall be proud to present you and rochefort walked on   15.986918812745506
there shall not be one a minute longer than you please said dantès who had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though his brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest operations   12.066985725917187
we have therefore taken away monsieur le cardinal to my friend s chateau and there we have come to an understanding   11.697332182574558
now as the debate between these two nobles might last a long time each becoming naturally more firm in his own opinion m   10.673740179469588
like those unfortunate persons endowed with a fatal gift she brought misfortune upon everything she touched   12.451471823238812
there was no more to do in the room so the poisoner retired stealthily as though fearing to hear the sound of her own footsteps   13.464850845346383
de villefort s promise   10.221082631889354
i am older than your eminence although i possess not your wisdom   18.032209820934774
if it be so replied the magistrate rely upon every reparation being made   13.802066507615876
they descended and advanced towards the clump of trees and morrel soon recognized the other gentleman as doctor d avrigny   12.02439303436759
give your orders   6.2969402955423766
but whether abstinence had quickened his faculties or whether the noise was really louder than usual edmond raised his head and listened   13.736489745843123
it had glided down it tearing the robe and had penetrated slantingly between the flesh and the ribs   18.37439630106881
one of us would suffice   11.32414464540294
jealousy indicates affection   9.287461597657778
on the left in a sort of valley he perceived a circular excavation   12.065908574534358
sir he said turning to athos was it not in compassion to my timidity that you told me that this lady was the duchess de chevreuse and is she not the queen   17.554139325841238
it was the honor of m   14.650093696679988
go to the count of monte cristo avenue des champs élysées on the 26th of may at seven o clock in the evening and demand of him your father   11.655250862138729
at this movement mordaunt turned around recognized them and uttered an exclamation of savage delight   13.81086898503117
the tunic soon disappeared under a long cassock as did his hair under a priest s wig   10.641311216443935
no where i can confess   11.769865951436906
valentine with her woman s instinct guessed that morrel would be monte cristo s second and from the young man s well known courage and his great affection for the count she feared that he would not content himself with the passive part assigned to him   12.62562878798309
yes replied caderousse little albert   13.043685561714904
the king quitted his tent and found his horse ready waiting for him   10.767761794339043
he is very gracious thought the queen   14.678904039998383
who would sometimes take one of his courtiers to a window and say monsieur so and so let us weary ourselves together   14.996107151571842
cried the stupefied musketeer   16.451603114662834
the count was in his study and was reading with an angry look something which bertuccio had brought in haste   9.4520687681437
it would have been easier to me merely to have thanked you for preserving my life and not to have uttered a word of all this   10.942174915518905
30 avenue des champs élysées   10.985500590111817
but i leave your majesty to judge what five armed men could possibly be going to do in such a deserted place as the neighborhood of the convent des carmes   10.970909904147705
be easy my dear edmond we are near the conclusion   9.772968286104916
as he stooped down to drink he saw that his hair had become entirely white   10.961668277772615
and three days hence however well the secret might be guarded it would be known i say that we were to fight and our combat would be prevented   10.096724405264506
asked felton whose looks became excited   11.8517409307971
we know all about that   16.39796762699338
continued aramis   17.654077334199584
pyramus and thisbe chapter 52   11.252028450572237
it is not to be called amiability it is her duty   7.512619634576797
the duke wore the uniform of the musketeers of m   11.062648819541312
he also spoke of it to monsieur de chavigny who promised that he would not oppose it in any way that is if he approved of the person proposed   9.090765627583547
he thought of the fair greek he had seen in the count s box at the argentina and valle theatres   5.179737707711009
you do not know that every day of those fourteen years i renewed the vow of vengeance which i had made the first day   10.486819339057437
have you observed said he to them what a blood red color the moon has to night   15.63766654785465
but promise me if you should not be killed tonight that you will go tomorrow   7.765453432481833
said the officer laughing this is the way you receive an old friend   13.427554213006564
be assured we shall not   12.199617564239334
it must have been charming indeed   14.423775479921112
he was a catalan   12.136577179248247
good to eat   13.233827522775403
the count by any opening from the bedroom or by concealing himself in the dressing room would be able to defend his property himself   10.533870830065375
we are not children   11.827911593202609
and yet they were the same murmured monte cristo only now it is broad daylight instead of night   17.932034910963118
but dantès who had his own projects would not agree for a longer time than three months   8.523429225488652
in case i should be killed said de guiche   7.104944596530189
yes but beer   13.341049189236545
the two rooms looked on to the street a fact which signor pastrini commented upon as an inappreciable advantage   16.111175161395828
yes no doubt   11.458788599124134
mazarin gazed once more at a countenance full of intelligence the play of which had been nevertheless subdued by age and experience   11.801120030277028
brutes   11.556721302831171
oh unfortunate creature   11.888178402442664
mazarin came within three steps of d artagnan and pushed a spring in the wall   10.00535744527668
i waited at the door   13.730598767774886
look at this lady raoul she is an historic personage   20.123510392635296
all at once she heard a tap at her window and by the help of a flash of lightning she saw the face of a man appear behind the bars   11.682912499692705
certainly and more than once regretted them   16.511539183173802
the sight of marks renewed edmond fondest hopes   9.891060532212386
the will as soon as barrois had left the room noirtier looked at valentine with a malicious expression that said many things   13.742531751793924
it was decided that planchet should set out the next day at eight o clock in the morning in order as he had said that he might during the night learn the letter by heart   10.053711722062577
mazarin arose walked some moments thoughtful but not dejected   11.543025901426606
and this evening if you please or tomorrow at the latest we will meet   7.677224994325666
let me embrace him i am in a hurry to see him again   11.633205046588817
what is proposed to me would be in fact almost an abdication and an abdication requires reflection   10.594241886732219
these two gentlemen shall decide between us   7.448849377627166
scarcely had he turned the corner of the rue de la juiverie when the boy rushed after him like a bloodhound on full scent   13.239389773880058
it is twenty years since i saw them and yet whenever i have seen the king in danger i have thought of them   10.991981770430899
there now m   9.930860431174263
he is in paris just now   9.91286514217678
that would bring about a discovery which would inevitably lead to our being separated   11.212505868646115
if you do not return how does it concern you   12.274413413970857
he started on seeing the cavalier with the curate   14.912066172294573
and who is that other person   12.94967594769522
that his style of writing is very good   10.585210753588306
people are found every day in the seine having thrown themselves in or having been drowned from not knowing how to swim   10.07187066056304
andrea that the season of your youth was rather a stormy one   12.884402717054305
once out at sea let him come   12.229896756378311
and has visited with me that is in   9.276794111885419
the album   6.959898881783396
if the king persists in remaining in england will you send him succor   12.472779876019795
and he arose   13.919827581973129
perhaps it was the christian exhortations of the abbé perhaps his kind charity perhaps his persuasive words which had restored the courage of noirtier for ever since he had conversed with the priest his violent despair had yielded to a calm resignation which surprised all who knew his excessive affection for valentine   10.246946945134159
there was a third person with them whom i knew perfectly well and who had in all probability made their acquaintance   11.271212812479503
they obeyed   13.16619802812548
blue frock coat buttoned up to the chin   14.287117810032221
said mazarin with admirable suavity could i but find such men   10.29403873655892
it was seven o clock in the evening when the marshal arrived at the appointed place   10.02779762020214
i can never forgive myself   14.026992315637665
go on i am curious to know two things   7.4408582957874225
within reach of her hand they placed a small table upon which stood a bottle of orangeade her usual beverage and a glass   9.475429776093616
those men must be poets   10.86289965844484
the betrothed had retired as we said with haughty air disdainful lip and the demeanor of an outraged queen followed by her companion who was paler and more disturbed than herself   10.606724474815096
danglars door just at the same time that villefort s landau after having deposited him and his wife at the faubourg saint honoré stopped to leave the baroness at her own house   13.381095528264678
while he turned this over in his mind planchet did his best to make up for lost time at table   16.65079781918628
listen continued the abbé   13.427417067365031
yes replied the abbé it is very affecting   10.3479337170477
and the two gentlemen were for an instant locked in each other s arms   20.01783036902831
he is going with me   8.638247710927327
dantès had not been deceived he had reached the first of the two islands which was in fact tiboulen   12.325165021285242
i wished to live said athos   9.35030123254781
it may easily be seen he has been accustomed to live well   13.284267648260593
i shall keep it aramis and even though i had no need of it i still should keep it   15.098482532573154
toward paris sir   13.400590662979948
had the unhappy man on whom she lavished her assiduities been previously acquainted with her so sudden an alteration might well have excited suspicion in his mind or at least have greatly astonished him   14.224361115059828
but on your account i will add some eggs and that is a serious infraction of the rule for eggs are meat since they engender chickens   15.859994226120158
and who has seen this fleur de lis   13.904055781753723
your valise is then empty   14.924996226823765
and as the emperor had created the kingdom of rome for his infant son i presume that he has realized the dream of machiavelli and cæsar borgia which was to make italy a united kingdom   13.331531418391968
we must proceed in an orderly manner   15.024302577471579
i was never in them   11.963331331486422
50121m no i do not replied monte cristo without even knowing of what or to whom he was speaking so much was he occupied in watching morrel who was holding his breath with emotion   8.96444371394189
he came last clothed in his splendid robes and holding in his hand the carbine which your emperor presented him   8.918135032787022
he went into his sleeping room and fastened the door inside   12.083491305314693
at the look of displeasure added to the angry tone in which the count spoke ali turned pale and held down his head   12.827353554353586
why you see plainly enough we are going to the bastion   12.823730486248031
this anxiety became so great that it even extended to aramis and porthos   12.330412518965712
as edmond passed the door on the fourth floor he paused to inquire whether caderousse the tailor still dwelt there   9.241130784373418
i am uneasy about blaisois said athos   13.484933596448265
but what does this note contain   14.167596662429059
is monsieur your brother   7.634742637309973
the young man heard these words and bent so forward over the rock that one might have supposed he was about to precipitate himself from it   11.181693361973918
ah he has a palace   11.49222703329436
now whenever the king halted the musketeers halted   10.55350404331669
then he took away his mother s portrait with its oaken frame leaving the gilt frame from which he took it black and empty   8.8973430029563
mercédès looked at the count in a way which expressed at the same time her astonishment her admiration and her gratitude   17.57646079018351
thou seest simpleton said d artagnan to his servant that they wished no harm to us   12.867315650811747
valentine looked around her   14.584612742290123
the two friends mounted as did their servants   8.546282886625587
la ramee drew near to grimaud who spoke to him in a low voice   12.14958301284121
there were too many unpleasant possibilities associated with the catalans and eight days after the wedding they left marseilles   16.8711685374929
you can easily resume it when you leave paris   16.69896074769994
d artagnan was at the height of joy   9.811996623653151
he was naked with the exception of cloth drawers at the left side of which hung a large knife in a sheath and he bore on his right shoulder a heavy iron sledge hammer   9.364293340866201
and it is but just to say that queen elizabeth was not his niece   19.66095208745694
i luckily found a small opening which afforded me a view of the apartment and what was passing within   11.310380483169725
and the queen   16.5250880557925
to crown his happiness monsieur de chavigny had started on a journey that morning and in his absence la ramee was deputy governor of the chateau   9.78288552839587
at the barriere des sergents the procession was obliged to stop   15.834985323148084
and shall we arrive there   16.23117971529171
answered charles sadly i have but three one of twenty years who has never forgotten me and two of a week s standing whom i shall never forget   13.525627458279478
is it not true   4.498100270365793
the pope heaped attentions upon rospigliosi and spada conferred upon them the insignia of the cardinalate and induced them to arrange their affairs and take up their residence at rome   13.707347364372762
he purposed only to do all that he could to increase the glory of his name   6.692803465740405
but he laughed as the english do at the end of his teeth   12.405571144701913
and so he remained silent   12.859461249959281
can this be another vengeance of that woman   14.888560681777967
for the barricades   15.18585510745466
some of that at the bottom near the laths   11.571545717707222
madame replied monte cristo gravely and gazing earnestly on the two liquid pearls that trickled down julie s cheeks had lord wilmore seen what i now see he would become attached to life for the tears you shed would reconcile him to mankind   12.727452385685135
i have been there mother said friquet but i saw things happen of which master broussel ought to be warned and so with monsieur bazin s permission you know mother monsieur bazin the verger i came to speak to monsieur broussel   8.118143231628366
dantès trained in discipline knew that nothing would be more absurd than to question subordinates who were forbidden to reply   11.81886828331665
there is no knight errant to come and seek a quarrel with me on account of the fair lady i detain a prisoner   10.852679256733731
a woman whom i don t know but who is called milady   14.15220712230959
the duc de chatillon commanded the centre   12.936231828256114
if he wished to walk through the town his boots seemed too highly polished   17.04046331701457
half an hour after the entrance of the king fresh acclamations were heard   10.151098971609743
when he had finished with the orange tree he began at the cactus   11.900376359980061
i do not remember what he did but i have inquired and i have been told all about it   10.705298903642491
but he could not resist five armed men and was forced to yield   13.979333140077989
you will take your place in the coupé to châlons   18.14962365994321
stammered the unhappy woman completely overwhelmed   12.849122582908818
the traveller slowly raised it and fired in the air   3.572882165584712
i command you not to stir attempt nothing not to let your countenance betray a thought and i will send you tidings   11.107087831332272
oh said porthos death is nothing it isn t death that can disquiet us since we don t know what it is   11.695241603058022
he saw mercédès enter the diligence and he also saw albert withdraw   7.461463342010498
my good friend said franz turning to him while albert continued to point his glass at every box in the theatre you seem determined not to approve   10.34351277505654
are you too proud to accept it young gentleman   12.151407381163605
well then after this first visit has been made we shall count on you   12.539788333711728
then no more of felton   8.406256505613714
mademoiselle herself packed all the medicines which were sent to m   11.091947542028905
he cried in his turn   13.544884696059892
then offer him double that sum   10.52989993805807
afoot my lord   7.603419123591202
said porthos it is always that   21.83104154121684
and so soon too   9.505271954540586
but said porthos with great wisdom that was impossible for they would have killed the captain and the sailors   14.34171059941373
there are at this day roman families perishing of hunger though possessed of nearly a million in diamonds and jewels handed down by entail and which they can not touch   13.38397548939206
let no trace of emotion be visible on your countenance bear your grief as the cloud bears within it ruin and death a fatal secret known only when the storm bursts   8.495452399164252
it is then true that the sin of the father shall fall on the children to the third and fourth generation   10.791310195903943
nevertheless one thing afforded him inward consolation   9.787985018899356
valentine opened it and drew out a bundle of papers   12.092896568016267
mazarin pretended to laugh   12.607155096369407
he found him clothed in a magnificent dress covered with splendid embroidery admiring himself before a glass   15.93273053856317
it is a rich study for you who as i learn have seen as many lands as are delineated on this map   13.569268546284507
he is also known to the abbé busoni a sicilian priest of high repute in the east where he has done much good   10.525661596830298
after having well beaten him he forbade him to leave his service without his permission   15.321068937736847
and the more he thought the more entire was his conviction that the person who wore the mantle was no other than his former host and entertainer sinbad the sailor   11.89435253950985
dark complexion   12.690379062733586
a million in gold remains   18.517485404713838
one would think one was in the cave of ali baba   15.437988711347026
spada set out about two o clock to san pierdarena   5.300357285144167
noirtier and the elder d épinay well understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had produced   8.878838020354792
madame de villefort had placed herself in the shadow behind a velvet curtain and as she constantly bent over her child it was difficult to read the expression of her face   14.955752036481822
one may soon see that you re a soldier   13.256817254840634
but after all it is but a menace   15.427635264196056
you know how imperfectly the women of the mezzo cito are educated in italy   12.368205648125484
madame de saint méran chapter 73   12.472628343134323
whilst this terrible scene was passing at lord de winter s athos seated near his window his elbow on the table and his head supported on his hand was listening intently to raoul s account of the adventures he met with on his journey and the details of the battle   15.605780270817835
years of suffering in my opinion count double and i have suffered for twenty years   7.715882113764472
the company of m   14.848035716381645
no longer could edmond look into those wide open eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of death   12.489759244259629
by men of heart i mean men of courage   9.665409147430406
i mean that all these cries all these complaints these curses produce nothing but storms and flashes and that is all   11.253397781219522
bertuccio was awaiting this arrival with impatience mingled with uneasiness   9.940378749562006
he found the door of his passage open sprang up the stairs and knocked softly in a manner agreed upon between him and his lackey   10.455648816046093
the host armed himself with a spit and rushed into the chamber occupied by the two friends   17.48706813465744
d artagnan stood for an instant mute pensive and motionless   16.516656834283975
mercédès might have been a queen sir if the crown were to be placed on the heads of the loveliest and most intelligent   13.503397343754616
with a post chaise and valet de chambre   8.976784548409995
when everything was ready the gallows hung in the middle of the room the loop made and when the duke had cast a glance upon the plate of crawfish in order to select the finest specimen among them he looked around for his piece of glass   14.189790610660001
the windows on the ground floor according to a custom in provincial villages were barred so that they strongly resembled the windows of a prison   9.894751658846493
as thirsty as a scotchman   16.29512088303065
yes monsieur you are right said the host   10.74730473700007
he only added that on his return from great britain he had brought back four magnificent horses one for himself and one for each of his companions   10.494754683159087
at the first swallow it appeared to me not to have the same taste as in the morning   12.108968208235297
he fetched from an old secretaire a sheet of white paper and pen and ink   10.894503486929285
he showed the more respect to this queen deprived of every mark of pomp and stripped of followers as he felt some self reproach for his own want of heart and his avarice   7.583552705774685
the anjou wine chapter xliii   14.590336342167639
villefort became pale   10.385534926503492
he went to him   14.638294480101393
milady will then turn you out of doors and you know she is not the woman to limit her vengeance   9.86081815612586
it has arrived at the hôtel des princes rue de richelieu   8.325405740259852
well said danglars did you see him   12.550081259323523

had she one redeeming trait   13.392980725068075
but to return to our subject   12.245918865870106
yes said dantès   10.35833469662644
all those who surrounded the vizier or who knew me at his court are either dead or gone away i know not where   11.55515461350142
what was the second   12.947431262316012

i madame i   13.929928776407495
give all the information in your power   14.546050489252028
the countenance of the person who had addressed her remained so completely in the shade that though franz tried his utmost he could not distinguish a single feature   12.537516903525066
and i assure you   12.0154355355161
faith no thank heaven   10.992412710175463
to my grandfather s room   16.55753192960649
madame bonacieux presented her cheek to him   11.240200846092467
but for pity s sake spare my life my honor   8.487599425433848
in a moment they were at the canebière   10.357044972411833
twenty francs are not to be despised   17.383864586206883
two men whom you will find at the door on going out will serve you as escort   11.293421754707461
this is the second time that monsieur d artagnan has been in england   11.693546809646158
at dawn twelve leagues had been passed without drawing rein   16.304602250341983
extremely   15.684752520191697
and uttering a fearful cry barrois fell back as if he had been struck by lightning   6.6027152387150325
from their dress covered with dust and from a certain easy manner by means of which a man accustomed to travel is always recognizable the two friends excited the attention of a few promenaders   14.490767931043854
i demand then that the examination shall take place as soon as possible and i will furnish the house with all necessary information   18.25440532198462
if you worry me by repeating the same thing i will not bring you any more to eat   14.632476221198154
whilst mordaunt was making his way to cromwell s tent d artagnan and porthos had brought their prisoners to the house which had been assigned to them as their dwelling at newcastle   8.741105185731287
the will was never wanting   12.467667187168374
she was still exceedingly handsome   14.296914419011648
who is that man   13.061915807819997
i was about to propose so doing answered de bragelonne   7.004080952642761
i do not reproach you monsieur said d artagnan   12.647143996568373
from the moment they are suspected by your majesty said tréville the musketeers are guilty   14.313096510700131
cried lord de winter   14.331601088392521
it was then a part he was playing   16.15379889480593
an association in which every one takes his share   18.268343607475536
de monte cristo and m   10.989439214435816
but hold out your glass   9.655464602525832
you might as well go and ride in the forest of bondy   15.878344297486802
noirtier would not say that the only rest he needed was to see his child but wished her good night for grief and fatigue had made her appear quite ill   8.860256946500503
at these words he retired   12.563716875753162
he grew pale and red alternately   12.200226167741489
the old man made him understand with his eyes that he could not answer   13.484886226860132
do you think then that any harm can have happened to him   9.479108411713648
a man of the count s temperament could not long indulge in that melancholy which can exist in common minds but which destroys superior ones   13.035616426935603
the opinion of those who seemed to be best informed was that he was fed and lodged in some royal castle at the expense of his generous eminence   13.386228434357504
correcting himself immediately he said excuse me sir   10.493725512166527
what man is that   9.839961360984258
they both live in the rue des ursulines   16.499671619390586
repeated the abbé   10.349408071966412
and certainly his handsome features lit up as they then were with more than usual fire and animation seemed formed to excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful and intelligent lover   11.283804506075738
or if she be a woman of any consideration they lock her up for life   15.049137697897525
i am of d artagnan s opinion   10.734764553739328
but believe me that man has other projects   9.747702480216969
morrel can you intend it in my house under my very eyes   13.513679752162897
the example of robert bruce will absolve you sire   11.670371586627425
morrel suffered an exclamation of horror and surprise to escape him   4.145470252253821
so it is   17.943802951096497
as you see his shutter is closed and you can see no light shine through the chinks of the shutters   13.402855719550127
do you not know that this is a young man whom the count is introducing   14.415466666028085
so much the worse for you since i shall be obliged to kill you   8.769538821095207
he held some papers in his hand   11.45679238174018
were our object money only he said we should be rich directly   12.456243052451898
how would you like to have it   17.67932961852193
but extraordinary to relate the father did not say thank you my child nor did the daughter smile at her father   5.034165430550379
if she seduced your brother you said she seduced him did you not   14.656331175023206
have you seen my mother   9.825917107949218
he pressed his hand upon the heart but it no longer beat the child was dead   14.478393305504547
the abbé s eyes glistened   13.05717378837661
the flaming globe descended afresh and i was completely alone   12.666609266972284
your lordship does me much honor said the host and i thank you sincerely for your kind wish   8.205129885815413
she was beautiful but her beauty was of too marked and decided a character to please a fastidious taste   10.451461349406348
d artagnan opened the letter and read these words a person who takes more interest in you than she is willing to confess wishes to know on what day it will suit you to walk in the forest   8.79514894963531
we have always some difficulty in believing such things my pretty dear were it only from self love   10.892749634394393
ah said the doctor is it you   13.797231278564116
as for the numerous servants more numerous that evening than usual for their number was augmented by cooks and butlers from the café de paris venting on their employers their anger at what they termed the insult to which they had been subjected they collected in groups in the hall in the kitchens or in their rooms thinking very little of their duty which was thus naturally interrupted   4.379586339840337
the count of monte cristo told you to write to yanina   15.46256978452977
retire valentine said she   9.335807073481988
it is by his courage please observe by his courage alone that a gentleman can make his way nowadays   14.633294653543777
for in truth he only drank to combat this sadness which wine however as we have said rendered still darker   9.96985613767799
beauchamp pulled out his watch   10.102895714620377
you are married then   9.39332784435396
the count of morcerf was no favorite with his colleagues   12.284950106458464
on your knees count   8.504216309132849
on horseback   11.033707100317532
grumbled porthos   13.729633692117224
do you think i ever sleep then   14.550519170433535
why what can be the use of mixing a woman up in the affair   10.328787053219651
asked one of the attendants   14.926758607476906
said cromwell arresting him for a moment as he arose   11.225886812036856
cried morrel when i left her dying   8.028127559609878
porthos pressed his friend s hand and said to him yes sir all is fair in war stratagem as well as force   11.766735292819222
what do you mean blockhead   22.123453345861527
noirtier wishes to see you tonight he said in an undertone   10.915372231224813
only donna estafania   9.51190880473812
what connection can the new world have with the bottles which are on the commode and the wardrobe   14.377197846629157
albert passed his hand through his hair and curled his moustache then having satisfied himself as to his personal appearance followed the count into the room the latter having previously resumed his hat and gloves   10.67206897771189
at least you should tell me what i should have to do in london replied bonacieux who remembered a little too late that rochefort had desired him to endeavor to obtain his wife s secrets   16.386250822051846
very good said the queen   18.682420049947687
have they spared me   8.806004498770044
but it was without wishing to do so i swear   12.139966881645904
the groom in obedience to his orders tapped at the window of the porter s lodge saying pray does not the count of monte cristo live here   17.41899707352837
his wings were broken and he seemed to sink into a bottomless abyss whence he awoke bathed in perspiration and nearly as much overcome as if he had really fallen   12.40128052087792
we shall both get into trouble   14.885569830893255
d artagnan s bearing became still more imposing   10.826506440391356
well but my poor bazin reflect a little   9.64448252101675
if i thought one of you knew that the young gentleman was the friend of his excellency i would blow his brains out with my own hand   11.75663202035189
that was the remembrance of her husband the comte de la fère whom she had believed dead or at least expatriated and whom she found again in athos the best friend of d artagnan   11.234888309703377
i said all that a man in such a state could say   8.210458870159538
sit down there said villefort giving up his place to morrel and write what i dictate   8.956435975857229
the gascon uttered a furious imprecation which was answered by a wild laugh on the other side of the iron panel   7.840120675047122
he held the plate in his hand for an hour at a time and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat of tainted fish of black and mouldy bread   12.91464678413562
you must not be angry with me for that monsieur broussel   11.012177390804297
yes monsieur yes   9.692203469466403
madame de saintot has hastened to him with broth   13.683360919528766
in that boat sat three men unquestionably brave whose courage no man would have dared dispute   8.567591415141674
she has feared or guessed something   6.496698229551697
i shall do whatever they do at paris madame if i have the good fortune to find someone who will initiate me into the prevalent ideas of amusement   16.575566548146348
but as there is none remain where you are finish your bottles your game and your letter   14.299177263461562
morcerf s courage had revived when he found himself alive after this horrible blow   13.002747566839128
oh don t worry about me sir mocker said danglars   13.359901053101288
and immediately beauchamp appeared   10.805126872946541
i think it does indeed   14.653256003988677
six would have suspended his respiration and caused syncope more serious than that in which he was   5.19739464990251
oh certainly   15.411733425362858
i forgot that my songs are out of place in this castle   8.725095643549274
answered the abbé man is but man after all and you are about the best specimen of the genus i have ever known   8.587933553186213
we even have as you may have heard introduced a barrel of powder under one of the angles which in blowing up made a very pretty breach   12.1322980262265
he therefore looked forward to six o clock with as much impatience as the duke himself   12.147843638132509
he returned to his room and after depositing the ring in a casket filled with brilliants of every sort for the cardinal was a connoisseur in precious stones he called to bernouin to undress him regardless of the noises of gun fire that though it was now near midnight continued to resound through paris   5.363593598485895
i remember it said athos   5.807038770746282
the counsels of his friend joined to the cries of his own heart made him determine now his pride was saved and his vengeance satisfied not to see milady again   12.266929966007076
the count said a word in arabic to ali and the horses went on at great speed   10.460883711203923
do you know this gentleman   13.540834296383066
but i claim tonight and will devote it if you will allow me to talk over some serious matters with my wife   11.58793230850708
he had therefore purchased a vault which was quickly occupied by members of his family   9.548228634476907
mordaunt drew a handkerchief from his pocket and tying a knot at each corner the signal agreed upon waved it in the air and the man came up to him   7.457165545452577
immediately replied d artagnan   19.159534404130902
delirium he repeated   6.501624266823834
and who yet every day rob travellers at the gates of rome   15.948385195158258
and what method of surveillance do you employ   13.65485812446278
where is valentine sir   7.335748903030344
coquenard saw him swallowing this wine undiluted and sighed deeply   14.493959320479433
i was expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in my absence and to convince me he emptied his purse on the table   12.976394690573489
oh yes i shall certainly die of it   11.807837600745668
the greatest possible gayety prevailed at court   11.396625003744697
then the neighbors heard frightful shrieks   11.66500880686841
his sight was dimmed his legs sank under him and he would have fallen had not florentin supported him   12.542707852642929
he jumped from his horse threw the bridle on his servant s arms and joined them   7.2625382113106145
monte cristo shook it coldly according to his invariable practice   12.608386314856375
as porthos had foreseen the cavalcade produced a good effect   10.601688006256616
28 said the count fixing his eyes on the steward to whom he gave this order   13.327777148178706
could you not procure us a few of those nice little rabbits and some of those delicious partridges of which you used to make fricassees at the hotel   13.423460305765445
nay further have you never endeavored to recall the time place and circumstances of your former intercourse and failing in this attempt have almost believed that your spirits must have held converse with each other in some state of being anterior to the present and that you are only now occupied in a reminiscence of the past   14.225526327682143
she is at the louvre as you know   15.380942917719764
i see my lord i am to be taken back to the bastile   14.010782269809154
that comes of wearing diamonds my master said athos disdainfully   13.295742003058255
the dead are everywhere said morrel   9.218996234360132
a bolt grated and danglars was a prisoner   5.764429381540015
can you content yourself with the small fortune which we shall possess for the future   13.310671316445319
monte cristo raised his eyes from the paper and bowed   13.491851796644637
yes you saw him the day i had the honor of receiving you   8.683842615698518
my lord have you any commands   7.735968332319888
that your lordship was about to treat with the court   11.619425808613865
but there was not depth enough of water for it to touch land   11.318462728961105
it was a gilt table supported on lions claws   11.259306790992735
i take as much interest in the pursuit of some whim as you do m   9.931725545594684
milady replied to this question by another question   9.343815191057406
if i had had the honor of seeing you for the third or fourth time count instead of only for the second said madame de villefort   11.018845893312557
he has five or six rings as testimonials from eastern monarchs of his services   13.82684328593786
i have written a letter today   12.664462967844944
furthermore d artagnan went with them leaving porthos at play with groslow   6.1098852998244215
the drink deadened eye of athos flashed out but only for a moment   7.400339179384433
i was induced to marry her about three years ago although she had but very little dowry because monsieur laporte the queen s cloak bearer is her godfather and befriends her   17.12895093324575
the maid approached planchet whom she took for lubin and holding out a little billet to him said for your master   15.57445378306494
30165m noirtier s look was furious   8.733039223274666
on on   14.583981156986159
from a distance dantès recognized the rig and handling of la jeune amélie and dragging himself with affected difficulty towards the landing place he met his companions with an assurance that although considerably better than when they quitted him he still suffered acutely from his late accident   9.898512736528769
may i be hanged said danglars glancing at the bandit s dinner through the crevices of the door may i be hanged if i can understand how people can eat such filth   6.697930805437035
in reality when you have once devoted your life to your enterprises you are no longer the equal of other men or rather other men are no longer your equals and whosoever has taken this resolution feels his strength and resources doubled   15.107009846302955
so proceed   18.813802196012126
30213m no   9.33539926591038
it may easily be understood therefore that the conversation during the whole of dinner turned upon the two checks that his eminence s guardsmen had received   12.294338832554374
juxon turned to those present and begged them to leave him and his assistant alone with the king   6.958369008611015
but he did not blanch   10.252309823642728
worse than that she was faithless and had married one of the persecutors of her betrothed   13.806023070089886
he sprang to the door and shook it violently but it was bolted on the other side   9.88524902359751
when he had gained the angle of the street he turned   10.872159516821938
d artagnan vigorously seized his prisoner s hand saying eh   9.420876684112196
and as to this book added she pointing to the manual with her finger but without touching it as if she must be contaminated by it you may carry it back and make use of it yourself for doubtless you are doubly the accomplice of lord de winter the accomplice in his persecutions the accomplice in his heresies   11.944990389765215
the poor child appeared herself to require the doctor she had recommended to her aged relative   6.308387567021554
then in addition to these concealed or public secret or open wars there were robbers mendicants huguenots wolves and scoundrels who made war upon everybody   7.186174599148524
my uncle replied mordaunt with his harsh and bantering tone you are mistaken   7.488377297901832
however sire if i might advise your majesty will interrogate the person of whom i spoke to you and i will urge your majesty to do him this honor   19.544526237455777
and then it was i presume said monte cristo that you came to me as the bearer of a letter from the abbé busoni   10.5176345573301
the young man raised the arm which fell back by its own weight perfectly inanimate and helpless   11.516962891464887
because england had need of me to take the tyrant and now the tyrant is taken   14.777381776237448
i know a clever person at tours aramis stopped on seeing athos smile   11.102086520202052
porthos and aramis who held their drawn swords in their hands returned them to their scabbards   13.912541284476683
sir said madame danglars you can feel for my emotion can you not   9.494643541767951
besides continued he in so changed a tone that no one would have supposed it was the same person speaking besides who says that it will begin again   10.457426288999107
and you think that your wife has returned to the louvre   13.911444806862148
may i have the use of your skiff   12.474774222350407
you are welcome monsieur said milady in a voice whose singular sweetness contrasted with the symptoms of ill humor which d artagnan had just remarked   14.983096582919103
that is the least honor that i can render to your excellency   15.089794319295548
recall le plessis bellievre villequier and d erlac said the prince recall all the troops that are on this side of the lys   16.56826797394529
but with a sailor the last requests of his superior are commands   11.727623353599117
but at all events i have two and if you like i will throw with you for one of them   6.712761567543087
he entered the hotel and ascended the front steps and addressing a footman who waited there in a grand livery asked if the duchess de chevreuse was visible and if she could receive the comte de la fere   10.948244063763102
and he listened toward the quarter indicated by d artagnan   12.928034799655546
monsieur replied dantès proudly it was only to summon assistance for you   10.87815417201492
what advantage should i have over you if knowing your secret i were to tell you mine   12.361081366751817
aramis conducted them to the foot of the stairs and then immediately came up again to d artagnan whose senses were still in a state of confusion   14.748529004930969
said athos to the man in english   7.75646322342646
advice   12.324727450715292
returned the old man in a hoarse voice   11.28380141134848
we shall meet again in better days   12.81250882816346
but internally he was deeply wounded and his self love immensely piqued to think that albert de morcerf the most admired and most sought after of any young person of his day should thus be passed over and merely have his labor for his pains   11.66630509460228
three things were especially urged upon the officers who were to see that the soldiers observed them scrupulously the first that the different corps should so march that cavalry and infantry should be on the same line and that each body should protect its gaps   14.506724843297388
how do you know it   11.318889154307577
you have decidedly some genius at your control   11.431060393988966
the young men sprang up and seized their muskets   15.568359011714392
your servants will be seduced with gold and death will be offered to you disguised in every shape   12.518777607211105
you ask what i have against you   14.232448484965735
but when you have the honor of associating with ordinary men and the pleasure of leaving politics for a moment try to find your affectionate heart which you leave with your stick when you go to the chamber   10.580355894150939
what matter said monte cristo if he has rendered the state services which merit this distinction   11.006606308872998
i ask but one said the king   12.07882462019857
it is twelve and tired of waiting he must have gone on   12.278609686318239
cried the executioner   15.321682759764757
two guards received bonacieux in their arms from the officer who supported him   5.123543124231734
go on then   10.608615560722335
the man came straight toward him   10.95831166641976
said albert evidently surprised at such a question from his companion   8.219632880655201
but knowing that all was ready for flight i thought you might have made your escape   10.79396250259595
indeed said château renaud it seems quite miraculous to make a new house out of an old one   13.041305531487978
it is always with friends that one fights   14.109048089876513
it is a frightful story count said albert terrified at the paleness of haydée s countenance and i reproach myself now for having been so cruel and thoughtless in my request   10.088596509335014
i forgive you   13.073810514010034
really my dear gérard you are but a child   10.660760122090348
now he added rising in the stirrups and looking about him which i wonder is the lightning   9.860510459909314
he feels that every man owes a tribute to his country   12.757486572530311
milady answered by a glance which said is that all   8.152555605590312
at the same moment that is at nine o clock in the morning albert de morcerf dressed in a black coat buttoned up to his chin might have been seen walking with a quick and agitated step in the direction of monte cristo s house in the champs élysées   13.814137770984
i am in a hurry to begin   15.20754103663768
my mother thought me dead   13.402331355733066
already the sound of their oars might be heard as they returned to the yacht   10.820638117677449
athos extended his arm toward him pointing him out to his companions   11.257077415613823
it is really true said m   12.847556898718148
really count you have a delightful way of setting people at their ease   14.055903051691692
said the general shrugging his shoulders   7.539597499211282
faith sir said raoul smiling although his pallor betrayed the excitement consequent on a first affair you are in a great hurry to pay your debts and have not been long under any obligation to me   12.29890853970603
danglars began to look suspiciously at morcerf when someone came and whispered a few words to him   7.086477880377356
i only wish to say two or three words to your master who gave me a commission to execute about a fortnight ago   14.115392336907659
i am twenty one years old or rather i shall be in a few days as i was born the night of the 27th of september 1817   13.6756548269125
valentine held down her head   13.739358511265728
did you go into these houses with her   9.783479673077492
they began dinner and spada was only able to inquire of his nephew if he had received his message   7.2869445535805655
coldly asked morrel   8.376259141153728
i would have given 10 000 i would have given 20 000   12.586521139036492
let us sit down   11.097228305267828
de la trémouille already prejudiced by his esquire whose relative as we already know bernajoux was replied that it was neither for m   15.174135962779019
conclude then sir answered de chatillon with as much hauteur as aramis   12.20705771808153
there are about two hundred in paris and three thousand in france   11.910200302218035
she cast her eyes again over the note to peruse it a second time and saw there was a postscript   16.75695405792245
adieu my friend adieu   11.623049577284952
i have given you proof of that it seems to me   8.753560598223395
so be it   8.663727507566339
all the pious ideas that had been so long forgotten returned   12.05826213882661
yes i share your hopes   10.8096241247821
he pushed on toward him but before he could reach it the shadow had disappeared into an alley into which grimaud deemed it scarcely prudent to pursue it   14.85690848620718
my brother said she as she placed his knapsack on his shoulders be careful of yourself for if you are killed i shall be alone in the world   13.299975610496604
it would be just the same today no doubt for since yesterday evening they have had plenty of time to send for a doctor   9.329661523561498
you are too noble not to understand me and you understand me so well that you already yield dear maximilian   13.92486856380055
but gaetano did i thought   16.176144982912856
and i should have been married in an hour and tomorrow i intended to start for paris had i not been arrested on this charge which you as well as i now see to be unjust   12.951234831843552
i have only just left him   10.353206618444935
yes of course mouston   16.217906234883383
do you find any dazzling sensation before the eyes   11.344691691977875
oh work work my passion my joy my delight it is for thee to alleviate my sorrows   12.446876695612884
it is my fault madame said raoul   6.269167009537398
have you bachelor s apartments there   7.689687835021131
we must see what it is said grimaud   12.264557056168469
handsome certainly replied albert but not to my taste which i confess inclines to something softer gentler and more feminine   18.98439420897914
leave me to pray   12.018733508327234
then whispering to selim she asked what were her master s orders   13.088022297069092
a quiet conscience does not occasion such paleness in the cheeks and such fever in the hands of a man   14.404132642365743
from his windows he saw all the visitors who were caught   13.89037331378404
perfectly sure   13.261561270307842
as to the servant he had as we have said been with his master for five and twenty years therefore he knew all his habits and it was seldom that noirtier found it necessary to ask for anything so prompt was he in administering to all the necessities of the invalid   9.328922274475921
set out for naples the hague or st   9.87215130103519
the english who require above everything good living in order to be good soldiers only eating salt meat and bad biscuit had many invalids in their camp   15.750144636462352
demanded morrel   12.128478734207224
it ill accords with the expression of your countenance and i am sure it does not spring from your heart   12.061883178861065
this is not a corsican maquis but an english garden   9.225275709994625
i adore her   10.571827839353041
but the bastille   11.039296915597198
i shall be happy to meet you again sir   8.89808434098019
the young woman drew back filled with surprise and terror   8.607265691808404
he cried the usurper in france   11.968532796790997
de villefort i intend sending him away tomorrow for he eats so enormously to make up for the fast imposed upon him by his terror in that house   9.106434044656822
because your palate his not yet been attuned to the sublimity of the substances it flavors   13.254676599565293
his eminence had something to communicate to her majesty something secret and private a mission that could be confided only to a sure man and so has sent me to saint germain   14.472213292664009
in short at the moment in which she has just obtained from richelieu a carte blanche by the means of which she is about to take vengeance on her enemy this precious paper is torn from her hands and it is d artagnan who holds her prisoner and is about to send her to some filthy botany bay some infamous tyburn of the indian ocean   14.395708452657445
one look was sufficient to tell her that her grandfather was suffering and that there was much on his mind which he was wishing to communicate to her   10.906784843397766
see i have not slept said villefort showing his undisturbed bed   15.490343925681712
it is true that when a man possesses a young and pretty wife he has no need to seek happiness elsewhere   10.44306534882788
the eyes of milady darted such flashes that although he was a man and armed before an unarmed woman he felt the chill of fear glide through his whole frame   9.374204337624272
if they send an army out against us we will give battle and the survivor as d artagnan says will carry the letter   9.358680558609233
and in those times when other opportunities for investment were wanting such accumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare   11.855427414580086
it was necessary to reach m   6.889547914404965
at the first glance and by the joy which was painted on his countenance the worthy captain plainly perceived that something new was on foot   11.919029627526601
villefort returned and d avrigny met him in the passage   8.848673956559296
de brezé who was all astonishment at finding that this young man had the audacity to enter before the king in such attire   11.51607573213408
then you must not pay us   10.788936758838336
at the same moment mordaunt for it was he leveled his pistol at winter   10.330683473117412
go on i beg of you   15.970839446623348
repeated the curate who about as strong as d artagnan with respect to latin carefully watched the jesuit in order to keep step with him and repeated his words like an echo   15.683814741234414
and before we had time to draw our swords two of our party were dead and athos grievously wounded was very little better   14.855633940778366
had i been so unhappy as not to believe in him until now said monte cristo i must believe on seeing you   10.248776660360386
three or four days to return to paris   13.790313459971
to be a great chemist in the east one must direct chance   13.990646103453756
heaven preserve him   10.725959390866738
what art thou then   15.87177363630773
20041m that was not enough for those latitudes said the englishman   10.17579233675882
it appeared likewise that mme   8.641465262185534
can all this force be summoned on my account   9.833728584394219
it is this madame that you should appear to have reflected and publicly acknowledge an error which constitutes the extra strength of a strong government   17.722396281759703
is your time then expired since i find you in a fair way to return there   9.519098301776967
there only remained in the closet of the wounded duke laporte and patrick   13.135137392536109
grimaud showed his master his forefinger bent   9.603432616713306
certainly i excuse you said monte cristo graciously and pocket them   12.445053500176712
monte cristo leaned against a tree and with that scrutinizing glance which was so rarely deceived looked up and down the avenue examined the passers by and carefully looked down the neighboring streets to see that no one was concealed   12.72215551739701
the second was to serve as the sleeping room for the servants the third under the prow of the ship was under the temporary cabin in which mordaunt was concealed   9.776056104864569
malta   15.630126801608586
are you still resolved to accompany me   10.868495588252333
that was not the appointed hour   11.400404466077966
and where are you going   9.386265460023903
a brow a little receding as is proper for poets enthusiasts and soldiers was scarcely shaded by short thin hair which like the beard which covered the lower part of his face was of a beautiful deep chestnut color   9.872172957242418
what do you wish gentlemen   12.793411353862249
raoul bowed took the letter went hastily down the mountain leaped on his horse and set out at a gallop   11.39764894768192
and i sire said m   11.102206705948454
no human creature beside could hear or see anything that took place within our dwelling   4.266070282827814
is he living   10.168145208710477
what was the aim of that visit   8.19613007257784
in a week remember you will no longer be performing your manoeuvres for practice but on a field of battle   17.141779055583555
there is something true in what you say said the count with that smile which made him so handsome   16.447752967300204
you are not thinking of mademoiselle danglars i hope   12.562799661916092
but that father was dead   12.307466562324807
was he young or old   9.695923801115292
this was a great matter in the way of honor but very little in the way of wealth   14.047555587128798
yes the rolling of a carriage   11.899491807025633
so that political discussions have not altogether been uninteresting to me   13.062245575667246
in the lucern patch chapter 58   3.9385829458041304
this fresh impertinence reached the ears of the cardinal and alarmed him greatly   13.772019436381607
then you think you will some day leave it   13.869709061997836
we will not expose your eminence to the chances of war   9.570107420795864
i feel if this continues said mme   9.887197204351093
vainglorious as he was porthos could not afford to have a baldric wholly of gold but had at least half   9.723370078330344
hermine looked at the banker with supreme disdain   15.672382712694452
a sentinel struck the rings of his carbine against his left hand   10.270546645944764
he now determined not to begin the game with d artagnan till he knew completely all his adversary s cards   13.877120798573277
adieu athos i am going to raise an army   13.353161566678509
you are jesting   8.691963429495395
there we are sure of obtaining gondolas if we can not have carriages   8.1155120561283
a good journey to ye they cried allowing it to pass   9.664024225969554
to the world and to his servants danglars assumed the character of the good natured man and the indulgent father   11.461858931379181
asked patrick   11.713346008346257
the carriage was put in motion as slowly as a funeral car   13.109674004751758
my papers thank god no my papers are all in capital order because i have none   6.999433502164097
i don t like comments   14.378413019541856
but she asked he in an undertone   11.822718522749078
ten days passed away thus   16.410359817072596
felton entered milady s apartment   13.098688621142074
and her voice was lost in the great voice of nature which also seemed to groan with despair   10.948089238795468
yes true replied madame de villefort somewhat uneasily i remember now   9.890063048996709
my mistress above all repeated he mechanically   11.549802351678833
and in such haste was he to warm himself that he went straight to a house set out with all the attributes of a suburban tavern and knocked at the door   4.323668714925234
their return was cheerful   11.339168115559838
and who has abandoned you is that it   15.142282623127478
i will make myself acquainted with his intentions and will submit to them   15.312988262684998
they advanced to the plain   7.588650776710335
i heard the name of rochefort   4.98232788390668
in truth the lieutenant s horse stumbled and fell on his knees   13.169606747732178
and what was comminges saying to you in reply my good guitant   12.758329700061337
gondy remained firm and the abuse of the day seemed to glide over his head as the sarcasms of the evening before had done   13.358190094264376
rochefort all is not lost   11.463681150819056
still further in buckingham s lodging which he had been forced to abandon more precipitately than he expected papers were found which confirmed this alliance and which as the cardinal asserts in his memoirs strongly compromised mme   13.001633472800904
and now madame try to make your peace with god for you are judged by men   16.231529231629402
this recital was for him the occasion of veritable triumph   15.313434827867123
well one day when she was hunting with her husband continued athos in a low voice and speaking very quickly she fell from her horse and fainted   12.195105451772353
you know he is almost dumb   7.758816252913568
we examined the grotto all over but we never could find the slightest trace of any opening   11.932642011830062
you are deceived madame said felton blushing   14.694422125223582
and if you deceive us well it will be the worse for you   15.726065819572064
d artagnan s countenance took an expression of the deepest compassion   16.196826021468123
beauchamp turned to look at some paintings   12.756904027143895
said d artagnan mousqueton has not caught these bottles with his lasso   13.901521965094432
exclaimed the commissary   9.843480595346453
did barrois make your lemonade   14.609571409469382
why you must have lost your senses   9.730403084004706
you see it is not my fault   7.132259328385182
it will be a nice little throat cutting   13.756110922145306
grimaud prepared to comply with this request when the officer made a sign as if he had something to say   15.121572951562388
is there any signal for the general rally   12.376012517973429
good bye   15.108049307262826
but when i went out he followed and quickly came up with me   13.63831193389349
but you will hear about him for la ramee is here and awaits the commands of your eminence   10.744898480377817
you possess the right of pardon   11.725110802779154
it is a woman s voice cried aramis   13.43975223337716
i think on the contrary that it is a charming night replied the countess and those who are here will complain of but one thing that of its too rapid flight   10.386908567749137
desire the french attendants not to weary her with questions but merely to pay their respectful duty and retire   15.705104614329962
i was afraid i had made a mistake in the chamber and that i had found my way into the apartment of some churchman   12.504996648418565
the king raised himself buckled on his belt and passing his handkerchief over his moist forehead said well what is to be done   14.17780111732699
why he was not altogether forsaken continued caderousse for mercédès the catalan and monsieur morrel were very kind to him   16.124846709619252
with beauchamp   12.638697293142947
the valet ran directly   10.624928320687182
they both looked searchingly at the young man who misunderstood the meaning of that inquisition   13.656058250126156
bonacieux was repeating word for word a sentence which he had heard from the comte de rochefort   12.450093366771778
said cavalcanti who was quite confounded at the metallic sound of these golden words   13.080739829422654
i promised you a letter for the director of the academy   17.33321096328951
involuntarily his languid eyes closed and still through his eyelashes a well known form seemed to move amid the obscurity with which he thought himself enveloped   11.568750986414305
well for my part said athos i found aramis s spanish wine so good that i sent on a hamper of sixty bottles of it in the wagon with the lackeys   7.768186730160496
yes skirmishers   11.408760509732712
monte cristo approached the window and saw maximilian and emmanuel alight   14.21191170782882
madame said albert allow me to present to you m   10.565245003648755
the devil gentlemen   9.39302825894978
one thing i was sorry for   16.190839480964847
mutton every day   6.425404204069692
i will be silent but you must endure your captivity quietly   13.51864791758506
the count placed himself between caderousse and the window thus cutting off from the thief his only chance of retreat   10.563428513338469
the woman especially was hideous   12.601583957660434
you will accompany monsieur le vicomte till grimaud rejoins you   10.205729335610133
excuse me sirs this is not a servant but a friend   12.001184569433484
his eyebrows were arched beneath a brow furrowed with thought   13.500316732248956
and monte cristo made a sign with his hand to the notary which said i have no further need of you   12.215370628205076
to you he was only a foreigner and you were not obliged to love him   9.381489140824945
poor lad   13.29989072824548
asked dantès eagerly   8.84242084299596
ah he exclaimed here is my answer   9.21156223139021
the light had almost disappeared from the former   11.839703572004815
poor kitty became as pale as death   16.630752441206706
these few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his sincerity   9.875621854417513
no half confidence or you understand   11.204466649289031
it was situated in the via dei banchi near st   6.9796259603490025

half a million said he magnificent   15.666714754489153
why said porthos that was very good of him it seems to me   9.983412015705417

he decided therefore not only to fetch the order but the two thousand pistoles at which he estimated the prisoners   9.737971416269628
he didn t predict the future he knew the past often a more dangerous thing   14.98434224710429
for upon my honor it is true that the musketeers make but a miserable figure at court   10.79781206418747
good she exclaimed approaching the table she has taken part of her draught   12.30736812675707

around this shrubbery two alleys like two arms extended right and left and formed a carriage drive from the iron gates to a double portico on every step of which stood a porcelain vase filled with flowers   13.93955706295498
here father here   12.365282894780632
he was occupied in anticipations of the coming scene between himself and the baroness whose frowning brow like that of olympic jove predicted a storm   14.385353928555713
and these judges i warn you will soon send you to an executioner who will make both your shoulders alike   11.758532160669551
said the count in the same tone in which he would have given an order to his servant   13.59243438611027
but d artagnan remained impassible   15.323881415739256
and then having found nothing returned   9.557893927914682
i am wholly a stranger to paris it is a city i have never yet seen   9.579760276087077
i forgot that i was hercules and you only the pale omphale   11.59094824351657
in the morning when they entered milady s chamber they had brought her breakfast   8.847105642288184

twenty guard the walls of the park twenty the road from rueil to saint germain twenty are dispersed in the woods   14.77102696008565
suddenly another idea took possession of his mind so used to misfortune that it was scarcely capable of hope the idea that the noise was made by workmen the governor had ordered to repair the neighboring dungeon   9.397077749400493
that is to say to search the queen herself   12.336071176987641

said d artagnan what does my lord think of that reply   13.709141671231324
the carriage was upset the horses carried off stifled mangled by the crowd   12.130268316170385
i have been here since the morning   12.413629323130454
we on our side do the same   8.543042588183205
but since i tell you cried danglars that with these three million do you expect to recover your position sir without touching those three million   13.328608336932549
completely so   17.25537703637427
yes i admit it   5.754762779297614
bazin my friend said aramis you don t seem to be aware that i can see you in that mirror and you forget that once for all i have forbidden all signs of approbation or disapprobation   19.536141698014063
what had become of him he cared not to inquire   13.59384637334246
mademoiselle danglars fortune will be great no doubt especially if the telegraph should not make any more mistakes   9.815948954421007
he then said it is time to start   12.228947727439474
there was a moment of cold silence during which everyone was affected according to his nature   10.437442628898353
the agitated figures apparently wild with terror consisted of groslow who at the hour fixed by mordaunt had collected his men and the sailors   12.592805832727628
only think what the poor fellow may even now be suffering   13.62571445145124
ja   12.603180283920718

the executioner in short   17.854936133596475
you are right father   14.172234337517322
fernand let fall his head like a defeated man heaved a sigh that was like a groan and then suddenly looking her full in the face with clenched teeth and expanded nostrils said but if he is dead if he is dead i shall die too   18.341159440181087
did your excellency desire to see me   10.557822931320926

monsieur i love men of your kidney   13.01283337260242
beyond that hedge that garden and that cottage a dark mist enveloped with its folds that immensity where paris slept a vast void from which glittered a few luminous points the funeral stars of that hell   11.122514042514835
observed debray   13.206696517041333
this man is scarcely five   11.660575127093399
mercédès raised her head and uttered a cry of terror on beholding a man before her   12.041506763018077
as soon as i have done i will knock on one of the panes of glass   14.55294637216731
go to selim   16.322825783368533
i should be obliged besides my steward to keep a clerk and a boy   13.292476934419213
replied d avrigny in a voice terrible in its solemn calmness   8.483805181563827
welcome among us your excellency he said to him   15.72835980350779
the man whose house you have just left   11.857906410953639
a letter which was sent to your abode in your absence and which was given to me for you   12.568620287524567
a good animal whose paces suit me   12.690136957055628
my dear friend cried the lieutenant if you say a word i will blow out your brains   12.557386850159086
somebody said to me you are monsieur d artagnan   16.91795630029076
said d artagnan to himself can this be the seigneur du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds   14.710899158270514
the host recognized him   11.269743693501454
you have had a proof of that in what you have just related to me   12.817506944625316
then that it might not be known i had done so i filled up the hole threw the spade over the wall and rushed through the door which i double locked carrying off the key   10.236869649115441
i felt instinctively that someone approached me   9.989645361040903
no i would rather die   15.200189150894905
mordaunt followed bernouin who led him through the adjacent chamber and left him with a doorkeeper showing him the way out   13.443021926341938
then rushing hastily out of the apartment he ran upstairs expecting to find his father in his study but he rapped there in vain   12.231578415236156
tell me how tréville you know how i delight in accounts of war and fighting   12.180642128624461
lastly he had taken albert to normandy when he knew the final blow was near   9.515314731502299
he is my master and i am his slave   7.540002467394565
there happened then that which you know and of which your precipitate departure added the host with an acuteness that did not escape d artagnan appeared to authorize the issue   17.226859670364266
go my young sirs said the sick man and may you both be blessed for your piety   12.52134819739586
mazarin wished to approach her   12.250999943974337
all replied mordaunt   9.873579923250123
to these registers there are added notes relative to the prisoners   12.300422489963028
i know you too well to suppose you would allow such a thing to pass you   11.252072404992303
i have seen you and invited you without any ceremony when you instantly answered that it would be impossible for you to accept as you were going to tréport   8.927492243527617
she is indeed daring   14.154222397419206
i would rather die on straw than hoard up a thousand a year by being governor of the bastile   11.318439615953542
cavalcanti with your daughter   9.169415555915002
i was about to say to these gentlemen added he that i forbid my musketeers to expose their lives needlessly   18.113662924219057
i understand said athos smiling midnight   8.445463443702799
ali obeyed leaving the abbé alone with caderousse who had not yet revived   14.210151235206226
you are in a hurry captain   9.17189990215234
raoul obeyed   10.56087052133842
everything was as athos had foreseen   13.123001625630138
cried milady struggling   13.842050007862715
an inveterate bonapartist   7.245218963369248
was his second thought   9.14898351514727
but i pray you go away from that plane tree   17.6056177619395
he is all powerful even with the king   13.668226608498092
and as this vengeance appeared to him to have a certain sweetness in it he could not make up his mind to renounce it   7.536720836924432
at this cry from the soul of the frightened cardinal anne became alarmed in her turn and would have recalled comminges   17.90615377178818
and those gendarmes behaved shamefully   12.380865760497413
that is forbidden it seems to me   10.894366023233465
i will but go and return sire   12.195208375340972
walk to the barrier there take a cab that you may not be too late   9.759052452385752
answered porthos behold other players appear   8.787341789726266
why said dantès if in two or three days you hail any fishing boat desire them to come here to me   13.998829152910316

her lover   12.017231313254086
didn t you hear me tell you monsieur d artagnan that i don t know where he is   7.748943116825015
asked caderousse   14.798682369097726
yes said she it is madame danglars and her daughter who have come to call on us   16.53782734317883

when the hour appointed for the audience arrived athos was obliged to stay until the queen who was waited upon by a new deputation from paris had consulted with her minister as to the propriety and manner of receiving them   7.9591371448152435
will you not even say you will see me again   13.42886012244048
danglars gave 16 000 francs for his horses   12.873633044669477
that is he   12.410613595467623
no take a more stylish horse phoebus or superbe   11.415675898007427
really you pain me   13.206678001522453
i do not recollect it said haydée   12.603066210034383
monte cristo inclined himself without answering but the gesture might pass for assent   10.007476479080648
that his orders are not respected like those of our former bugbear the deceased cardinal whose portrait as you see hangs yonder for whatever may be thought of him it must be allowed that richelieu was great   7.464186544978943
i am a friend of the count s   11.142498473373461
morrel uttered these words with an energy which made the count shudder   18.42648815292398
bonacieux opening a cupboard and taking from it the very bag which a half hour before her husband had caressed so affectionately take this bag   15.119543870033233
athos was right   14.769802966250918
be satisfied replied bonacieux   15.30578128775128
coquenard had met porthos and seen what a superb appearance he made upon his handsome spanish genet she would not have regretted the bleeding she had inflicted upon the strongbox of her husband   9.778364618963655
and he who pours out vengeance runs the risk of tasting a bitter draught   10.052539704518166
he rubbed his eyes doubting if he really saw before him athos and aramis   14.712522959922385
the chances of war said athos are many but be assured we shall take no improper advantage of them   8.250814934939282

luigi wore the very picturesque garb of the roman peasant at holiday time   13.403698886817892
madame danglars in whom the events we have related had caused deep anxiety had hesitated about going to madame de morcerf s when during the morning her carriage happened to meet that of villefort   15.052112932712797
my first husband   10.16276130188956
cried morrel turning pale what is it   10.425048569599427
but you began a sentence sir and did not finish   14.372456151317149
athos a prisoner   11.369681999807558
alas replied the weeping girl i am obliged to own that my stepmother s aversion to me arises from a very natural source her overweening love for her own child my brother edward   10.57503407364197
yours affectionate de tréville well this leave of absence and that letter mean that you must follow me athos   11.283298509858007
uniform cross knee breeches   9.058857362972217
but valentine poor girl how will she bear so much sorrow   11.559222798232504
we are not generally very severe with the austrians   11.233873676648642
with such an expression of extreme terror that mousqueton started alarmed and blaisois was near fainting from fright   11.32480742243105
shouted athos with all the power of his lungs   16.788233346205907
and i will endeavor to give you no cause to regret your old master   10.70738110888811
madame danglars is ill said villefort   8.908657124487927
yes which made fools laugh which caused the minister to have a sleepless night which has caused the minister s secretaries to blacken several sheets of paper but which has cost me 700 000 francs   14.8632462005279
20045m and he glanced towards the clerk of thomson french who had remained motionless in the corner during this scene in which he had taken no part except the few words we have mentioned   7.039578363688594
no it is useless   13.074787348478596
but who then is andrea cavalcanti   12.702453387031557
sir you will perhaps think that i am in a great hurry to leave you when i have only just arrived but have you only two days of leave raoul   11.95686761671437
hope is so sweet a comforter   7.67753845227543
how many covers   15.090086806897162
he strictly followed the instructions he had received   12.137140192392653
i shall become worthy of her gratitude   15.498719223395131
for the moment she wished nothing better   10.23176665796583
he began gathering the grape leaves which screened the sun from the grapes and won the heart of the gardener   12.206144186853463
the marshal thought this barrier not so well fortified as the others and determined to break through it   11.208492639933674
suddenly about nine o clock in the evening edmond heard a hollow sound in the wall against which he was lying   16.714204742334637
you had the fortitude to regain the house assisted by your nurse   9.045146658001014
impossible said madame de villefort   13.578000034827033
he can not make me forget what i shall have lost   8.160564606165401
safe and sound as true as my name s jack butler   13.18287332430771
ah but the valise i want cried porthos is a well filled one my dear   10.878063737256781
said he to the host   9.899141479096901
no i did not say of poison but we can prove what was the state of the body   7.950934129895094
said athos in so stifled a voice that d artagnan scarcely heard him   13.535620294462266
oh my god my god i thank thee   10.362024976780846
he is very young   15.01805188419127
madame replied planchet respectfully i am called dulaurier at your service   15.43481730043928
the bourbons left him quietly enough at the catalans but napoleon returned a special levy was made and fernand was compelled to join   15.082273150771632
that was what he could not know   15.88230016656205
these young fellows can none of them drink said athos looking at him with pity and yet this is one of the best   11.874861713512246
our former life has it still no attractions for you   10.078955037879357
i acted well as a man but you have acted better than man   14.662939276852816
i am on my own ground and have an undoubted right to place a ladder against the wall and to look over when i please without having any apprehensions of being taken off by the police as a suspicious character   14.225169004595593
danglars raving threw himself on the goat skin   16.515435417192396
she signed a patent   10.094089744798476
they thought he slipped as at first and the witnesses seeing he did not move approached and endeavored to raise him but the one who passed his arm around the body found it was moistened with blood   9.69265135515549
a globe of fire appeared above the glazed opening of the ceiling casting a strong light into my chamber   13.561510099895933
at five o clock precisely the count arrived before the house at auteuil followed by ali   9.62347150372024
all the way and in proportion as the corridors became more deserted d artagnan wished to stop the young woman seize her and gaze upon her were it only for a minute   13.553872442010709
could you not perceive by our appearance that we were people of quality and not coiners say   8.808582775791855
look said he to the procureur whose heart beat so loudly that it might almost be heard here is in this cup some syrup of violets and this decanter contains the remainder of the lemonade of which m   18.42125422070839
it would be difficult to describe the state of stupor in which villefort left the palais   9.573496284050734
there was a sudden gleam of joy in the officer s eyes which vanished immediately for he knew nothing of mazarin s purpose   8.80925799524939
gondy continued his way and went as far as the tour de nesle   9.404581915913967
oh sir she stammered i beseech you do not believe appearances   13.582210662434225
50093m you are mistaken sir exclaimed morrel raising himself on one knee his heart pierced by a more acute pang than any he had yet felt you are mistaken   10.194058458338699
he murmured and fell with his face to the ground   17.017101565494603
i have replied d artagnan   12.567970685644639
something like a smile was perceptible on madame de villefort s countenance   9.366556502787427
now then to play another master stroke by which i shall gain the heart of both husband and wife delightful   16.895425263767024
in that case i am lost said d artagnan   9.969034768137556
that will be frequently i assure you for i have found something extremely agreeable in your conversation   17.527860334995296
there is no gainsaying the fact that a very unfavorable construction would have been put upon the circumstance if the two women had gone without escort while the addition of a third in the person of her mother s admitted lover enabled mademoiselle danglars to defy malice and ill nature   12.746992875696312
you start for paris   19.62306975843787
his servant   13.028472965842578
be it so then replied athos sorrowfully   14.591309619493419
i have heard of these things every day during the last eight years and i can not understand them yet   16.09359559541554
this was said in excellent tuscan and with that soft roman accent which makes the language of dante as sonorous as that of homer   11.540014908212806
morrel shook his head sorrowfully   14.748926095321064
as for the ladies it is needless to say that while they coveted the millions they thought they did not need them for themselves as they were beautiful enough without them   9.524969838021152
i don t think so   18.6997674502945
the next day they indeed left accompanied only by baptistin   9.772569012122553
monsieur bonacieux said the commissary looking at the accused as if his little eyes had the faculty of reading to the very depths of hearts you have a wife   19.20801417370665
i will neither open my mouth nor draw my sword between this and calais   8.44793746166789
ah danglars   10.016828193902139
she is spending the day with the wife of the worthy gentleman who is receiving us   11.70407321514374
why did you not bring him close to the gate so that i could talk to him and pat him   8.501044860699084
i do not therefore wish either to kill you or to be killed myself without a cause   8.376863662009525
de bassompierre had been talked of twenty years before and that was not saying a little   14.687307692590773
to give your majesty s reply to those who await it   13.40697503353459
in brief how much remains   16.00119721245524
franz was prudent and wished to learn all he possibly could concerning his host   11.970171548268121
for i was among those who seized him in the garden at amiens into which monsieur putange the queen s equerry introduced me   12.321314050961343
we are going to execute your wishes   9.102283213328832
take my advice then and let no one into our confidence   12.286930056686955
at the end of yonder corridor is a door of which i have the key it leads into the park   9.035008774855347
said the baroness smiling   13.129885237044133
well replied the traveller who seemed used to this difference between the servility of a man of the cities and the pride of the mountaineer if you refuse wages you will perhaps accept a gift   12.954424891371586
peppino stopped before a rock overhung by thick hedges   12.23409980289354
the result of the experiment left no doubt whatever on the mind   14.290669383000072
sit down and i will read it again   10.911940376178695
and as in pronouncing the last words lord de winter placed his hand upon the arm of his sister this start did not escape him   6.938088369338746
there was a great press of people in m   12.891808695285084
and the most finished coquette could not have formed a wish but on casting her eyes about the apartment she would have found that wish accomplished   8.21729371757125
let us take a turn around the town and imbibe a little fog   13.069373299011282
i will appeal to any of these gentlemen could i leave my guest in the hands of a hideous bandit as you term him   5.92529045466677
grimaud nodded assent   12.394331387468752
you who have faith and hope oh do not follow my example   3.7490193232141014
bonacieux and was as we have said close to her he saw on the ground a fine cambric handkerchief which he picked up as was his habit and at the corner of which he recognized the same cipher he had seen on the handkerchief which had nearly caused him and aramis to cut each other s throat   15.850234333214972
and what is more and she held out her hand to him i restore my love   13.664181370132786
mademoiselle danglars is too rich for me replied morcerf and that frightens me   8.491003677011827
a cavalier charged with an important mission had come an hour before your arrival seeking hospitality at the very moment that the curé summoned to the bedside of a dying person left not only his house but the village for the entire night   10.438119110464076
but remorse is not thus banished   12.454676510868435
nor did a tear fall from his eyes after it was over   12.882991714617159
the château d if the commissary of police as he traversed the antechamber made a sign to two gendarmes who placed themselves one on dantès right and the other on his left   13.329367788293526
on your honor   14.344980614301427
mercédès lives sir and she remembers for she alone recognized you when she saw you and even before she saw you by your voice edmond by the simple sound of your voice   6.052154958408589
it might be thought that milady timid as women are in general would have interposed in this commencement of mutual provocations in order to prevent the quarrel from going too far   6.03672523931497
yet he did not leave a foot of this granite wall as impenetrable as futurity without strict scrutiny   8.869800399966694
i put this creditor off till tomorrow and i intend leaving today to escape that tomorrow which would be rather too unpleasant for me to endure   8.802990484093225
a gentleman has but his word and i have given you mine   15.473215328000183
but it was my husband who would not hear of lending   13.959428876445665

bonacieux at home chapter xviii   8.133934623193495
the sea was calm and with a fresh breeze from the south east they sailed beneath a bright blue sky in which god also lighted up in turn his beacon lights each of which is a world   13.287575527805059
you accept it do you not   11.76419294371496
farewell gentlemen said the count unceremoniously   5.775016042147251
i hope he does not bring our breakfast with him   15.262023133787384
monsieur said athos placing his hand on d artagnan s shoulder monsieur is the chevalier d artagnan of whom you have often heard me speak raoul   7.56811144375839
however raoul must be diverted from this fancy   8.713930620082607
let whoever likes talk of the king and the cardinal and how he likes   11.413085730809108
this is a fruitful soil and i feel certain that the seed sown will not be cast on barren ground   12.893040668093704
we are always in a hurry to be happy m   11.85185875572507
morrel was conducted along a dark passage which led to a little door opening on the garden soon found the spot where he had entered with the assistance of the shrubs gained the top of the wall and by his ladder was in an instant in the clover field where his cabriolet was still waiting for him   12.101335507136746
i said there were no fixed habitations on it but i said also that it served sometimes as a harbor for smugglers   8.115262212619697
but i feel very deeply that this fish which i go and sell and with the produce of which i buy the flax i spin i feel very keenly fernand that this is charity   6.105162151952924
the abbé sank upon edmond s bed while edmond himself remained standing   10.061042322466458
gentlemen he said the wood that i am carting is his   15.346742720795254
all is ready for to morrow evening   6.497092969352181
then he went to bed and almost immediately fell into that deep sleep which is sure to visit men of twenty years of age even when they are torn with remorse   10.151559485016268
you are gentleman enough not to listen standing   11.656665763969043
come d artagnan don t let us play a sidelong game   9.855600482824013
danglars uttered a cry and fell prostrate   12.87726867938343
porthos saw nothing in all this but a love meeting given by a lady to a cavalier or by a cavalier to a lady which had been disturbed by the presence of d artagnan and his yellow horse   10.358264480604044
and you understand heraldry   7.9667584267796245
those that have been crowned with full success have been long meditated upon and carefully arranged   11.454037466690297
upon gaining this advantage d artagnan was near uttering a cry of surprise   15.167390843087691
monsieur i replied it is not for myself that i entreat your interference i should grieve for him or avenge him but my poor brother had a wife and were anything to happen to me the poor creature would perish from want for my brother s pay alone kept her   14.471610754555481
athos sprang over the hedge and went up to the window which was without shutters but had the half curtains closely drawn   12.001012772443666
and the more he thought the firmer grew his opinion on the subject   11.787963664903117
you know that is never refused among neighbors   14.262136575816013
nor do i wish to be there replied the young man rising   9.14781400674011
morrel comes to aid me   10.593103719122528
and do you think asked groslow that stuart will ever escape while i am on guard   12.893150043547664
the door was closed and the carriage proceeded   12.362834187518562
the eyes of porthos were furtively cast upon this lady and then roved about at large over the nave   9.651747015293292
oh said andrea philosophically determined to watch his companion narrowly does not life pass in waiting   9.617853154189667
they saw him in the distance climbing the rock in order to look down upon the boat as it passed   17.39428327320059
as he passed the hôtel des gardes he took a glance into the stables   7.758237348825705
at the noise i raised myself up on one hand   5.1948224182296
it appears to me that if my boots need a sponge your stockings and shoes stand in equal need of a brush   11.46196752874812
where will it take me   8.790102516163474
all this time the soldiers were calling out stop   15.9401895969423
notwithstanding a slight resistance on the part of monte cristo whose lips turned pale but who preserved his ceremonious smile andrea seized the count s hand pressed it jumped into his phaeton and disappeared   13.75999957874135
we avoid imprisonment and we play the part of heroes   5.72421612001294
then we shall have to wait two hours for the gentleman and three for the diplomatist   11.480562795569545
one moment my lord whispered athos and he said something in a low voice   7.074522218996336
why how could you make such a mistake such an old stager   12.529403617874138
and to make porthos contented there was wanting what   10.870340283536839
gray blue eyes more gray than blue   18.370669195024785
i never believe in anything i have not seen and as i never have seen apparitions i don t believe in them   12.655574419816606
but what ails you father   13.711949335196731
to undermine the ground for fifty feet to devote three years to a labor which if successful would conduct you to a precipice overhanging the sea to plunge into the waves from the height of fifty sixty perhaps a hundred feet at the risk of being dashed to pieces against the rocks should you have been fortunate enough to have escaped the fire of the sentinels   13.00377014485227
yes it was about stop a minute yes it was about a woman   6.992762377120397

retorted la carconte   12.87572544414445
the light was so faint in the room that albert did not perceive the pallor that spread itself over the count s visage or the nervous heaving of his chest and shoulders   12.684805216192137
let us return with renewed strength to the battle field and i promise you 500 000 soldiers another marengo and a second austerlitz   15.82696233894831

precisely so madame   11.359885725451598
there were heavy maned lion skins from atlas striped tiger skins from bengal   13.441714823316913
pardon   13.294745583116898
i was then almost assured that the inheritance had neither profited the borgias nor the family but had remained unpossessed like the treasures of the arabian nights which slept in the bosom of the earth under the eyes of the genie   16.911896942377332
madame morrel sent her daughter to bed and half an hour after julie had retired she rose took off her shoes and went stealthily along the passage to see through the keyhole what her husband was doing   3.467904795353805
if when you arrive at cours la reine you find no one you must go on to saint germain   9.400196603941863
he had dark sparkling and deep set eyes hooked nose and teeth white as those of a carnivorous animal   11.284632325239562
read again said the old man   16.305298698793013
coquenard therefore entered the office from the house at the same moment her guest entered from the stairs and the appearance of the worthy lady relieved him from an awkward embarrassment   12.676191236066922
he therefore allowed valentine to go into the garden sent away barrois and after having seated himself at his father s right hand while madame de villefort placed herself on the left he addressed him thus i trust you will not be displeased sir that valentine has not come with us or that i dismissed barrois for our conference will be one which could not with propriety be carried on in the presence of either   8.857399869868473
it is arranged capitally   11.423289452132181
yes indicated noirtier with an expression the more terrible from all his faculties being centred in his glance   14.99581641628738
really porthos you are a gifted individual   10.268415922696914
your mission is not accomplished   12.702050620743927
he supposes there is in the neighborhood of the house he has bought a mineral spring equal to those at bagnères luchon and cauterets   5.843946117913216
he consequently proposed to take a crossroad which lay between that of lens and that of bethune   12.704152519712899
exclaimed morrel i do not deceive myself that young man who is waving his hat that youth in the uniform of a lieutenant is albert de morcerf   11.137311736384824
i myself came to paris with four crowns in my purse and would have fought with anyone who dared to tell me i was not in a condition to purchase the louvre   11.126976702859166
cocles opened the gate and baptistin springing from the box inquired whether monsieur and madame herbault and monsieur maximilian morrel would see his excellency the count of monte cristo   13.285751093745288
he is simply a gentleman of great genius who has fallen into disgrace with the cardinal through having written certain verses against him   14.495893387430991
he began to think he had to do with madmen   11.282116663514612
about midway a body was lying quite across the stairs   1.9685427090733185
he made himself a count so that he is not one at all   10.487337360934166
i am here almost miraculously and can scarcely hope for so good an opportunity to occur again   8.418659341184775
i was obliged to pick it up in order not to compromise him and the lady he loves   15.618906322582546
i have done all in my power to oppose it   11.07401221811173
denis or in the fair of st   9.23815955135342
the duke as he spoke kissed his hand spurred his horse into a gallop and disappeared followed by his troop who were soon lost in distance and darkness   9.350518082426394
was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage with mercédès   11.926448178650023
before this day closes if m   19.309224357119433

caderousse started and turned pale   11.597860714648075
and again long live the parliament   7.5724216220474405
anne reclining in a large easy chair her head supported by her hand her elbow resting on a table was looking at her son who was turning over the leaves of a large book filled with pictures   12.01737537492111
athos set the lackeys to work first because since these men had been in the service of himself and his friends he had discovered in each of them different and essential qualities   15.922481912875078
then the count threw the bridle of his horse into the hands of a peasant remounted the steps went into the cathedral there to kneel down in the darkest corner and pray   11.298932479299507
bring it to me or rather no no   10.278275258572638
no madame replied raoul   11.64749932122701
you see said athos   15.065790889066381
de tréville in allusion to the gifts he pretended that d artagnan had received from the duke of buckingham   13.991569119376676
but no he saw that i was unhappy he understood that i could be of no use to him and therefore paid no attention to me whatever   12.392597309878484
the box confirmed my statement the linen proved that the infant belonged to wealthy parents the blood with which i was covered might have proceeded from the child as well as from anyone else   9.233845802178472
as to that you must leave it to me   8.503629691958558
noirtier the unwelcome meal that sustains his pitiful existence   13.158082357064556
yes i can easily comprehend that   4.749478144460692
you will supply the want of the evening papers   11.083304973820848
porthos bit his lips because he saw not the wherewithal to dine   13.893520998444622
what the count said was true the most curious spectacle in life is that of death   7.974183465982826
monsieur replied bertuccio it leads to the garden   14.079677520123306
he was immediately recognized as one of them   10.557743221420381
from time to time to irritate him by affected disdain by a contemptuous word   13.541318278582695
cried porthos clapping his hands and nodding his head   14.721576293815705
replied danglars   13.022342572715466
repair your crimes toward her   13.889390597001958
said monte cristo with a slight cough which in moments of extreme emotion helped him to disguise a blush or his pallor or the intense interest with which he listened   12.998287199756774
i do not know what m   15.197728565531577
anxiety carried him on further   11.946109208108934
but let your profits end here   6.008657955491049
this feeling was so strong that at the moment when edmond was about to begin his labor he stopped laid down his pickaxe seized his gun mounted to the summit of the highest rock and from thence gazed round in every direction   12.154103546079284
the latter to make a short cut had appeared on a sluice   14.456542145235693
lord de winter had announced her embarkation for the twenty third and it was now the morning of the twenty second   14.548852542537396
your turn my lord said athos   13.141763940619033
and now my dear franz let us talk of something else   10.513429063200519
the uniform of the king s musketeers carries a certain respect with it and even if that were not the case i would engage with four of my men to put to flight a hundred of these clowns   12.409887582855571
at all events should you be wounded write to me that very instant or get some one at once to write to me   12.881802116373121
it is five hundred feet from here in advance said d artagnan   15.364987735147398
why the devil do you rouse me at this hour   7.2720860391152495
in the meantime d artagnan was defiling with his company   7.867813599730568
i wish to inform you my lord replied groslow with an irish accent feigned of course that if you are looking for captain rogers you will not find him   7.173290018250243
the friend of my greatest foes   8.942764891327965
till then   10.762802041128953
not very much said d artagnan   18.663741224102807
doubtless the musketeer knew him for his hair stood up on his head   11.409234248470877
as he came near the hotel franz saw a man in the middle of the street   13.162624411153697
read for yourself and judge   13.6664187670366
nothing betokened that the man knew anything of what had occurred   11.350542605671071
that is possible go   15.323566483315943
he was a man of uncommonly sound sense   4.034019529487248
and more especially a notorious coward   13.418547485757898
noirtier for whom france was a vast chess board from which pawns rooks knights and queens were to disappear so that the king was checkmated m   12.772404219383944
cried mordaunt springing off his horse   14.919296513341504
at last a nightingale lost in a thicket of shrubs in the midst of its most melodious cadences had fluted low and lower into stillness and fallen asleep   15.633840708155253
look behind this wall said de comminges knocking against the wall   10.680740466354921
i stumbled over some object   5.678072351634736
very possibly i may not go answered franz   11.862554328913907
said my father to some people who were holding a paper inscribed with characters of gold   15.039863388158732
thank you said the cardinal biting his lips with anger   14.768142227581333
did it belong to m   14.595563391880287
in french en avant   9.920273060625341
ay that will do at armentières   10.985112843597005
danglars be there   12.121580261349996
oh misery cried franz the only hope which sustained me and enabled me to read to the end was that of knowing at least the name of him who killed my father   15.67727612296777
your holiness said the curate here is the person of whom i had the honor to speak to you   10.0672494170986
and when i have signed he said what is to be my guarantee   11.228239549982105
it was still more impossible to remain in the department of the oise one of the most open and strictly guarded in france   12.664822981898547
that makes no difference said aramis coloring   18.0036682989692
but devil take him   11.064862941961783
cromwell placed his hand on a hidden handle and opened a door so well concealed by the tapestry that the most practiced eye could not have discovered it   15.60638645314668
morrel had to pay within half an hour 287 500 francs   14.661604002687744
do you say resumed d artagnan that you suspect that impertinent gentleman   12.195987061620304
your pardon madame i know all that   10.136665882661957
these words made a favorable impression on behalf of the accused   9.667603767999989
faria smiled   13.145897382298752
danglars bowed assentingly   9.031649256792655
at this exclamation the man on horseback turned slowly and with a lofty air and the two travelers could see displayed in all their brilliancy the large eyes the vermilion visage and the eloquent smile of mousqueton   6.395763230823762
the morning air has made me hungry   14.655827453027054
we have no time to lose   13.58937028563563
who is this groslow   10.03994254684744
his eyes were full of melancholy and from their depths occasionally sparkled gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred   9.472729314199562
the queen touched with her lips the white smooth brow the royal child presented to her with a gravity which already partook of etiquette   8.643194912765969
he had picked up every crumb that had been left from his former meals and was beginning to eat the matting which covered the floor of his cell   11.054801048528917
count said he you have offered us places in your carriage and at your windows in the rospoli palace   14.30309717646133
meanwhile carried away as we are by our narrative we must leave our three friends to themselves and follow the duke of buckingham and his guide through the labyrinths of the louvre   16.15903183653176
an instant after the countess resumed you came to inquire after my health   18.377065093191728
if your income is lessened i shall be obliged to make you a canon of notre dame   13.017081014392822
come come fernand said caderousse hold up your head and answer us   15.83382449707698
but at any rate you know where he is monsieur d artagnan   12.244695124895898
cried the two musketeers   13.683826403094113
this was the departure of fernand of fernand whose crime she did not know and whom she regarded as her brother   12.126564871632691
you do not like dantès   7.62327372122084
yes that first and other things afterward   15.595684806460039
these symptoms to a less alarming extent were the same which had preceded the death of barrois   14.691944637759644
then if he persists notwithstanding all this as that is as i have said the limit of my mission i shall have nothing to do but to pray god to work a miracle for the salvation of france   16.234617216425367
by my troth yes   11.34841497166423
the air seems darkened with the falling confetti and flying flowers   12.781295375057086
resounded from all parts and was death to mazarin s ears   10.722746144646559
the fêtes are veritable pleasure days to the italians   19.959345719646503
ah your excellency i am overwhelmed with delight   15.077442080621614
i do not know him viscount   21.96107904856179
what is past is past   15.665285176791027
it was the first time he had ever met a similar client   2.5726751056682904
well my lord my friend has three magnificent estates that of vallon at corbeil   13.609505799601006
the sight of what is going on is necessary to young men who always want to see the world traverse their horizon even if that horizon is only a public thoroughfare   12.095688703762034
he was going toward the door when mazarin stopped him   13.96017725840519
lover and husband ah madame said d artagnan entering by the door which the young woman opened for him allow me to tell you that you have a bad sort of a husband   9.977695675805197
wooden points that they stick in between your legs till your bones stick out   10.927003981886164
my sleep then must have lasted twenty four hours   13.170603907933708
danglars nodded to signify that he was satisfied   11.43999103746038
the latter recollected the terrible caution of monte cristo   10.726074670520811
it is the first time then that you ever went to that house   3.0338099263925855
continued milady   11.199627212451604
but first barricade the first door well   10.782162295885655
the host instantly made him a sign to follow went out with him by a door which opened into a yard led him to the stable where a saddled horse awaited him and asked him if he stood in need of anything else   13.73591335923448
the general tore the handkerchief from his eyes   15.345622458636184
justice has its formalities   9.91716645281227
de tréville s note in the other   16.10748856159563
the company was then heard departing   14.111993603700324
he traversed the island after having followed the traces which the footsteps of the giant have left and re embarked for marciana   15.873100331790752
but you will come and call on my mother before tomorrow   9.386983006962225
but will no one remain in the house my lord   14.28939264650432
villefort merited punishment for what he had done to you and perhaps to others   13.366133103356773
i will efface that blot on my father s character   15.966475120894428
from the abbé busoni   11.520677399501176
i mean active service   12.462727099790468
let us go and see your beggar sir and if he is such as you describe him you are right it will be you who have discovered the true treasure   10.841225344271836
if only they close the guardhouse door   16.30107774542173
on the top of the wall sentinels went and came with a frightened air   7.596188305387203
and i made some others also which i hope i may fulfil in due season   10.165274400910286
here is a creature that loves me   9.48045727764615
and without losing a minute thinking he saw an opening he thrust his right in and forced mordaunt to parry a counter en quarte so fine that the point of the weapon might have turned within a wedding ring   12.843944472540038
instead of lights at every window as is customary on days of ceremony he saw only a gray mass which was veiled also by a cloud which at that moment obscured the moon s feeble light   19.063515062660453
ah you have heard of the landing of the emperor   14.868620820130438
it is no nonsense   10.364021229039327
take a cigar   14.674266414295985
athos pale but resolute   8.106271597478035
i do not reproach you athos for what you have done   17.764444105494103
there is certainly some magic underneath   11.524727545280863
do you think of dying my lord   10.61220954881732
cried grimaud whose face was covered with sweat at the bare idea of the evil results such a revelation might cause   11.275089794070661
morrel had thought of danglars who was now immensely rich and had lain under great obligations to morrel in former days since to him it was owing that danglars entered the service of the spanish banker with whom he had laid the foundations of his vast wealth   15.035142608222321
franz and albert looked inquiringly at each other then at the gorgeous furnishings of the apartment   11.555945376708484
we can chat better in doors and there is no coachman to overhear our conversation   11.349199602686785
it is he who forsook us   10.721966822760821
he can not acknowledge me openly it appears but he does it through m   13.509067743868103
i gave one to the sultan who mounted it in his sabre   5.289416134418065
a ray of joy passed across m   10.248531402457827
said the other turning on his heels and surveying the young man with as much astonishment as contempt   14.90118546077903
the guards of the cardinal   13.569049783835128
these grand lords on the other side of the alps frequently marry into plain families   11.917165033442508
twice for my majordomo   9.493705559130616
he was an equal sufferer with yourself during the reign of terror and had well nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father perished   13.230438101451533
i bought said he the business of my predecessor on the strength of his assurance that he supplied the castle   12.746381602989656
a day or two of rest will set me up and i hope i shall find among the rocks certain herbs most excellent for bruises   16.035843454868704
now continued he addressing planchet you have eight days to get an interview with lord de winter   6.73357916404419
i too could dine where i like   10.501051175365573
ah yes indeed said monte cristo with a sigh   11.054796064466043
eagerly asked madame de chevreuse   9.394520794461886
the host quitted the room in agitation and as for his wife she had fled at the sound of her husband s cries   18.068134457031128
see the prince is pluming himself said one of the thieves   11.443376757888107
in the second place because he rather deserved the odium which he had incurred   12.644129677182628
he proceeded nevertheless and came opposite to an iron gate ornamented in the taste of the period   13.41458277301968
she directed her course towards the faubourg saint germain went down the rue mazarine and stopped at the passage du pont neuf   7.984365386505306
monsieur said madame de chevreuse i believe you are a sorcerer   16.06693429728104
i could make of that subject two volumes the size of this continued the jesuit   9.010679748209053
d artagnan remained all day in his quarters assigning as a reason to himself that the weather was bad   9.976471112275764
let us go to the parpaillot then for here the walls are like sheets of paper   5.767528476175827
terror seemed to have deprived them even of the power of uttering a cry   10.531624534602091
the third to let the enemy fire first   12.106370016096461
where do you keep the poison you generally use madame   7.096216571997897
he had just strength enough to place the scent bag at the bottom of the silver casket and to let the knife fall into it making a sign to laporte that he was no longer able to speak   8.477570950935139
the famous secretaire is in the dressing room   5.30826417109075
you see cardinal replied the queen that your enemies are mine   12.102730424490872
unknown you say is the man who rendered you this service unknown to you   10.226991928611605
well asked he when franz had finished what do you think of that   13.280931444262254
that is to say he fought for the independence of the greeks and hence arises the calumny   11.233774590610109

then putting his face to the lowered blinds he said i wish you joy my lord   14.9053959100623
monsieur le marechal said the queen after a moment s reflection go and find the coadjutor and bring him to me   10.015834972045068

and some even came to a contrary decision   13.920569054370512
d artagnan you restore me to life   15.271113680380012
while his eminence was seeking for me in paris i would take without sound of drum or trumpet the road to picardy and would go and make some inquiries concerning my three companions   15.910532684844553
yes and he said he would do his best to please your highness   13.275394757896303
this enemy was milady   17.44348130583912
i am repulsed on all sides   14.284194597977034
that is my answer   10.09909583313673
and the king laughed facetiously   13.07842845727411
i was in the power of a man whom i not only detested but despised of a man capable of anything and who had already given me a fatal proof of what he was able to do   16.97915157297792
and it was to prevent the renewal of old feuds that m   9.172784489708281

but if you love me as much as you say replied d artagnan do you not entertain a little fear on my account   12.553183363787534
the count was silent but continued to gaze around him   8.647840352045657
he admitted without annoyance the continued superiority of athos over himself devoid as he was of that jealousy which might have saddened a less generous disposition   18.15567719433774
mark well what i say   11.340260194798311
the order of battle on the morrow was to be that of the positions taken in the evening   12.357523418224089

for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere medley of words until misfortune comes and the unhappy sufferer first understands the meaning of the sublime language in which he invokes the pity of heaven   15.707460935656254
the poor girl originally possessed much more than that   11.214066829329727
oh sir i beg your pardon   4.261040141438329
but as a man of honor should answer another tell me fairly shall you pay these with the same punctuality   10.595968550304141
let us set out again at full gallop   9.040886331139637
and besides said beauchamp with a collar above his cravat an open coat and white waistcoat   13.363922728128736
mordaunt made several strokes more and raising his arm in sign of distress above the waves pity pity on me gentlemen in heaven s name   16.563764432144186
danglars assures me that his fortune is majestic that is his word   9.269612166682494

noirtier had so much astonished everyone that the position of madame de villefort left alone with the notary and the witnesses became every moment more embarrassing   13.483700469383837
noirtier s joy continued   12.089047470059741

the old man listened attentively making a sign only that it was all so   9.696677484129314
d artagnan donned the robe as quickly as he could mistaking one sleeve for the other so greatly was he still agitated   13.572966592076252
d artagnan seeing athos rise did likewise took his arm and went out   14.558358523311071
it is a shame to leave him to be educated by our enemies who will give him evil counsel   6.378816151573604
yes i see   13.012229027689484
rest yourself mother he said   9.925953349456112
and he comes from marseilles   6.852977579196406

ah interrupted morcerf laughing beauchamp beauchamp keep that for the corsaire or the charivari but spare my future father in law before me   10.940281105235854
he again struck his pickaxe into the earth and encountered the same resistance but not the same sound   13.559346122400555
inquired athos in a tremulous voice   9.47562631969323

this new tenant who as we have said was an italian was called il signor giacomo busoni   14.399304896518393

the nasturtiums and other plants which his father had delighted to train before his window had all disappeared from the upper part of the house   10.92064825683989
de tréville who detected him at once   20.802135098175505
how the devil do they venture so near the hotel de bouillon   13.613686951313017
and i deny it said tréville   11.920110159974687
alas would i could weep like you   12.961078576230625
he has faith in his friends   12.258420946851531

well said the count turning towards franz it seems to me that this is a very likely story   17.489251981093457
he told how he had a rendezvous with a young woman before that pavilion and how not seeing her come he had climbed the linden tree and by the light of the lamp had seen the disorder of the chamber   14.516783710451826
meanwhile the miner underneath was heard working away incessantly when suddenly an unexpected noise resounded in the passage   12.235568814063825
since none but the dead pass freely from this dungeon let me take the place of the dead   15.547169542962031

said franz interrupting himself   11.257630138905778
tell me truly whether you are in earnest or if this project of visiting paris is merely one of the chimerical and uncertain air castles of which we make so many in the course of our lives but which like a house built on the sand is liable to be blown over by the first puff of wind   13.802817054605363
on the exclamation of the doctor and the cry of the father the servants all fled with muttered imprecations   11.497860848828205
villefort burst it open with a violent blow   9.832375339321043

now that they are guilty of a conspiracy against england will your honor give me all four of them   11.20851007830166

ah my young friend added the curate groaning do not regret the devil i implore you   8.722114143315165
then in a lower and more gentle voice he added   14.553810319166782
i am replied the latter gravely   15.143063012627689
we could scarcely have requested your mother to take a sword and fight us   8.56173974982843
and he sat down and began to cast up the accounts of his party whose money he managed   10.424173657355738
and this can best be effected by employing the most inflexible agents to put down every attempt at conspiracy tis the best and surest means of preventing mischief   6.773261610091641
go ahead my friend said athos   10.579629196815436
but i know you to be a man of honor   12.158020335790887
and he withdrew to seat himself upon his goat skin which reminded him of the smell of the brandy   10.969768521827362
but perhaps you are not so dangerously wounded as you think said raoul   13.714934876781806
the baron had had a plank nailed over the grating   13.748313233614546
d artagnan equally moved pressed him also closely to him whilst tears stood in his eyes   11.393952177779122
it may still be possible to overtake the prisoner   15.082163407716461
the count would do as i do replied raoul urging his horse vigorously forward   12.97101798007027
i have still twenty pistoles sir   13.874020972312183
a thousand fiery darts are piercing my brain   14.143842283075315
could you not spare me the increase of torture which your visits cause me   13.730272934171008
the president looked at his auditors   11.439158515598244
no no you are deceived she is a queen   16.567038747535157
besides we are in a situation to overlook ceremony   14.6857204413295
of course they will do so as honorable gentlemen and the best proof i can furnish is this so saying he threw his hat on the ground pushed back his chair to the wall and bowed to mordaunt with true french grace   10.99042052503895
and he remained again motionless and thoughtful   10.126364014841505
oh fear nothing madame   9.879906310362177
felton made a slight bow and directed his steps toward the door   11.979675105090363
he wished to show albert the colosseum by moonlight as he had shown him saint peter s by daylight   14.741187891837644
the garden was long and narrow   9.104929011690082
what do you mean by a struggle   8.896989865531129
the frenchman had been so impatient to reach the house of thomson french that he would not wait for the horses to be harnessed but left word for the carriage to overtake him on the road or to wait for him at the bankers door   5.510577922341662
de tréville in the same tone that a party of procureurs commissaries and men of the police very estimable people but very inveterate as it appears against the uniform have taken upon themselves to arrest in a house to lead away through the open street and throw into fort l evêque all upon an order which they have refused to show me one of my or rather your musketeers sire of irreproachable conduct of an almost illustrious reputation and whom your majesty knows favorably monsieur athos   10.321462267234969
i have no motive for defending monsieur   12.44071266514941
and at his return you will send him to me   10.601883465334799
athos who was of as high birth as the emperor and who inherits one estate which gives him the title of comte what is he to do with all those dignities the comte de la fere comte de bragelonne   12.899007075675245
monsieur de beaufort placed it horizontally at the height of one foot   10.697454162885673
i told you villefort was ambitious and to attain this ambition villefort would sacrifice everything even his father   10.366884783738568
d artagnan drew himself up with a proud air which plainly said i ask alms of no man   10.28285052844394
yes that s the thing my lord   14.143684528390589
danglars by the unexpected appearance of the brigade of soldiers and by the disclosure which had followed the mansion was deserted with as much rapidity as if a case of plague or of cholera morbus had broken out among the guests   11.961479074520444
la ramee took his hand and laughed aloud   16.21921101903923
d artagnan struck the barrels with his hand and having ascertained that he spoke the truth pushed his lantern greatly to the captain s alarm into the interstices between the barrels and finding that there was nothing concealed in them come along he said   13.980464057486822
why you have just said a man of high distinction   17.243530692196998
chapter 4   15.704397640192248
because madame it was necessary to prove to your majesty one thing of which you doubted that is that we still possess amongst us some valor and are worthy of some consideration at your hands   14.420486505742428
she was talking with great animation with the stranger   10.171074203470084
bertuccio obeyed and despatched a courier to pontoise to say the travelling carriage would arrive at six o clock   11.12185546725809
perhaps there is still time to save us   10.84286310909607
villefort wiped the perspiration from his forehead   13.268042419929277
and at the first alarm we can leave france   11.532086028565528
and the count took a bottle from his pocket containing a red liquid of which he poured a few drops into the glass   10.5078419759423
no i would join the escort   8.107209083904
olivain pretended to have heard nothing and entered the tent   11.356434408792506
you scoundrel   13.583257280532509
i content myself with saying command monseigneur   9.228086003163977
to this cavalcanti replied by saying that for some time past his son had lived independently of him that he had his own horses and carriages and that not having come together it would not be difficult for them to leave separately   17.228839569767462
otherwise you would know that since we left paris monsieur le cardinal has returned thither five or six times   3.435731911107391
go sire not that you incur any risk for your adversary is powerful enough to show you mercy but because it would be humiliating for a grandson of saint louis to owe his life to the man of arcola marengo austerlitz   16.37774947832023
it is magnificent continued beauchamp to be able to exercise so much self control   9.601706971184827
albert was drawing on the satin pantaloon over his black trousers and varnished boots   11.230128619211973
one of these two men said he must certainly be at noisy or be coming there this evening for i have seen his servant   9.864258834471872
thirty thousand crowns in alms is not given as you have done for the last six months out of pure christian charity   11.866719643704053
bazin scratched at the door and as aramis had no longer any reason to exclude him he bade him come in   16.051185644353247
it is i said d artagnan in a subdued voice i the comte de wardes   12.3252191890351
if grimaud was slow in speaking we know that he was quick to act   11.93291739996426
i began to fear that he would not come   6.195743678277653
the sum was collected in a minute   11.522528077662253
and therefore marie came seeking hospitality from the guest of the good abbé and not from the good abbé himself   12.183624424436827
what story can i invent   10.447557431023553
mousqueton remained glued to the door awaiting the explanation of this strange occurrence   10.922656647444258
no one could be seen or heard   15.031364695983642
i like men of head and heart   11.177528882358246
who dares to answer for another man when the wisest when those most after god s own heart hesitate to answer for themselves and who ranges himself on the side of the strongest and the most fortunate to crush the weakest and the most unfortunate   8.110608279448691
de saint méran s house   11.221189304285115
but who knows what has become of them   8.955100749500222
some highlanders were listlessly keeping watch   8.345682217041833
he went toward the door and opened it hastily   14.407889549428265
under cover of the mea culpa striking her breast so vigorously that everybody even the lady with the red cushion turned round toward her   15.082781415231835
well out of the five or six millions which form your real capital you have just lost nearly two millions which must of course in the same degree diminish your credit and fictitious fortune   15.260123459905614
then he entered the empty dungeon closed the entrance and slipped into the sack which had contained the dead body   11.926377098042826
my dear love pray do not say any more about them and i promise you another pair exactly like them in appearance only more quiet and steady   12.244382252186147
she looked up and uttered an exclamation of joy   11.793971437302897
sometimes killed but sure in that case to be both wept and avenged   13.763539583856357
cried d artagnan taking the man for a thief and seizing his sword   11.837351445162511
well just as you like my prince   12.028552130890233
the wife of athos chapter xxviii   6.492922142916538
well said milady for you i will wait   18.468374955878943
the stronger reason why it should be sold replied athos   15.611209360209049
you have an answer ready for everything replied the queen and she took from her bureau a document which she filled up and signed   10.119731884277144
he will do wonders then   7.405786793616723
i desire to go to thirsk   16.211405227522768
the orientals are stronger than we are in cases of conscience and very prudently have no hell that is the point   13.89715150133202
where she was known as la belle provençale   11.149439202192191
albert expected to have something new this time to show to the traveller but to his great surprise the latter without seeking for the signatures many of which indeed were only initials named instantly the author of every picture in such a manner that it was easy to see that each name was not only known to him but that each style associated with it had been appreciated and studied by him   13.23993998674477
it was high time for her to make her appearance at the gate for maximilian had long awaited her coming   10.519836520507777
he criticised everybody humorously   11.760880477423804
the young man obeyed mounted on the table and divining the wishes of his companion placed his back securely against the wall and held out both hands   15.664293707100704
well we must wait   14.031560476814574
the storm still continued   8.200614420935825
but what the devil   13.169261488640165
it was only a momentary glance but it seemed to the countess to have lasted for a century so much was expressed in that one look   12.224555359994337
they knew d artagnan and knew that he did nothing without a purpose   19.022493079205233
it is their business to judge and they shall judge   7.215182058471822
he looked round him a second time several members of the club were whispering and getting their arms from under their cloaks   9.249186302374792
allow me then to pass on since it is not with me you have anything to do   18.695734615346712
what king   11.025739213284343
i thought she loved me well enough to wait for me and even to remain faithful to my memory   13.868738217557697
there had been no stipulation in her favor   10.883847114009924
be one or the other but not both replied porthos   8.945899890228324
and popular proverbs contain sometimes a wonderful amount of truth   13.900493381774018
tell him i will come when i leave my dear grandmamma she replied feeling with true delicacy that the person to whom she could be of the most service just then was madame de saint méran   14.788190386918927
with the entrance of m   9.701105302687417
fortunately lord de winter is rich   12.561389942779833
ah said caderousse you would not like me to risk taking cold   11.028514861412088
he now arose his head bowed beneath the weight of grief and shaking his damp dishevelled hair he who had never felt compassion for anyone determined to seek his father that he might have someone to whom he could relate his misfortunes someone by whose side he might weep   12.725719723412034
i called the valet i stopped the postilion i spoke to m   15.082582391429664
it appeared to the young man that the guards on seeing him depart chuckled among themselves   14.8026251107854
the cardinal has touched me with his hand   12.783781940070819
albert too was ill at ease   7.267849619190649
this was a great affront to the king s army and a great inconvenience to the cardinal who had no longer it is true to embroil louis xiii   12.122447790400921
nothing more is wanting than to arrest the count as a vagabond on the pretext of his being too rich   11.895141093520827
but a fresh allusion soon brought back the conversation to his eminence and then the laughter recovered its loudness and the light was not withheld from any of his actions   11.430841448336107
villefort s only answer was a stifled groan   11.96977297820986
madame cried the cardinal seizing hold of anne and drawing her back madame what are you about   8.598040772181642
he called porthos to look at it   12.500398674742618
the middle one   13.237174757414268
he heard her ascend the little staircase which led both to madame de villefort s apartments and to hers   11.403593893799105
the obscurity was broken only now and then by the still darker lines of the roofs of houses   12.707346173226087
after finishing that calculation i had a minute s hope   12.965531316291425
hem replied d artagnan   14.3207882691684
what became of you   13.373864331609779
if i m not mistaken here s bazin   11.808350655801544
as luigi spoke thus he left her   15.305966567810412
i am young and strong   13.975385287750845
he is an old friend of mine who has plundered me pretty well already and in the hope of making more out of me he will take a less price than the one i offer you   12.753963409761356
oh said madame de villefort smiling are you courageous enough to sit down upon the very seat perhaps upon which the crime was committed   13.907751825174659
the dinner chapter 64   8.393614568730142
vampa when this man is satisfied let him be free   9.261774352074735
porthos sighed for the fifth time d artagnan had counted his sighs   8.94047592474949
noirtier is quite evident to me and i can quite easily connect the train of ideas passing in his mind   10.967605269260044
honor to man this masterpiece of nature this king of the creation   12.612438947956617
the next day kitty went to see the young man again and related to him all that had passed on the preceding evening   11.163395923572
a little better sir   9.747836788546817
dear child   12.177654396385686
then at least turn the gem inside you silly fellow   8.74288611808106
and all these skins were strewn in profusion one on the other so that it seemed like walking over the most mossy turf or reclining on the most luxurious bed   13.301899750156748
i shall faint again   10.760959955249685
laporte said the queen it is time for his majesty to go to bed   10.682405966253707
once in service i shall be rich once in m   11.590361672383233
in his youth d artagnan had often headed the bourgeoisie against the military but he was cured of all those hot headed propensities   13.32219502160478
replied the young man   8.71617541366101
they don t yet know sir on account of the swelling   13.547522930515168
when the cardinal was out of hearing and sight that grimaud kept bad watch   14.934996098273652
and yet without the man the king would have been rescued   14.974829950921352
but i doubt if it be his real name   10.492963716628722
the count advanced accompanied by maximilian and emmanuel   20.241074756730953
he was stout had a short thick neck   11.419624693030652
ah i knew her   14.993482698238935
oh said milady raising herself i defy you to find any tribunal which pronounced that infamous sentence against me   12.353374633474212
as soon as the bridal party came in sight of la réserve m   13.76995593007235
when at the shout in the name of the king an officer ran up and seeing the uniforms ill treated he sprang into the scuffle sword in hand and brought unexpected help to the guards   15.427458166773272
while the count picked up the paper he put spurs to his horse which leaped in astonishment at such an unusual stimulus and shot away with the rapidity of an arrow   15.948065064705348
i always have one ready day and night   14.677385611239803
the queen s eyes followed the retreating figures and when the last had closed the door she turned away   12.679159860441171
did he allude to his hope of being captain   10.31535510607275
up sire   13.66145508860171
but his majesty has judges and these judges will decide   12.148187900435273
no i don t want your help watch the cardinal   7.808277116679917
and finally that the coadjutor would be made cardinal   11.743924378389119
my dear athos we are enveloped in a network of spies   12.38277268788431
d artagnan returned and again attacked him   10.06541231773433
gentlemen said the queen laughing pray take up your abode in the chateau   9.690223358311751
you shall relate them to me my child   14.424145552068078
the superior met her   16.42707870564363
the messenger uttered a cry of joy and clapped his hands   7.84717490491064
i hoped in silence   10.87339897537909
upon my word said she it is very droll and that mad marie michon fared better than she expected   12.215955019588801
shall you be present in the reception room   16.71710841007978
the other day a banker s clerk brought him fifty thousand francs in a portfolio about the size of your plate   7.899672282169434
do you think he is worth a hundred pistoles   11.823137078078002
he pushed through the crowd approached athos still insensible and as all this noise and commotion inconvenienced him greatly he required as the first and most urgent thing that the musketeer should be carried into an adjoining chamber   6.103425352047892
god he murmured not knowing what he said god god   18.839753314112116
there still remained planchet s horse   15.180504538229394
have you seen the cardinal   9.682063566839272
he turned towards the fortress and looked at both sea and land   10.789601725685552
and when did you arrive here   14.071156702094306
cried he briskly   14.291618021609494
my friend exclaimed monte cristo in a tone of exquisite sweetness   15.527894156124876
oh your great work on the monarchy of italy   9.820653656951889
the lovely venetian is it not   13.987568031347006
caderousse looked at the young man as if to get at the truth from the bottom of his heart   10.62961275970041
a physician a physician m   11.997037811183722
i shall no longer attempt my life   15.201780114923013
is that all you want   11.422671278166566
it does replied the abbé   9.91760945319733
but really my dear count we are talking as much of women as they do of us   15.188653159345325
suppose mine had had the glanders or the farcy   6.931013308552231
on the landing they were no longer fighting but amused themselves with stories about women and in the antechamber with stories about the court   11.317096182087766
he s now a citizen of paris   5.634651706255181
athos merely glanced at it   19.18610472220886
in what can i have offended her i who ever since i have known her have lived at her feet like a slave   14.584098818086407
she was the exact duplicate of the other pharaon and loaded as that had been with cochineal and indigo   12.600725834893456
do you see   7.927988426752911
franz was about to ring for signor pastrini when that worthy presented himself   9.721466934411826
no monsieur be satisfied   16.8016742392334
milady became as pale as the sheets in which she was lying and mistress as she was of herself could not help uttering a cry seizing the hand of the novice and devouring her with looks   15.390715856461966
and in five minutes they stopped before the count s door   13.944039881231825
you are thus deprived of seeing a man guillotined   16.530926240769595
oh he has been taken to fenestrelles to pignerol or to the sainte marguérite islands   10.009655554963011
the queen bent over him and kissed his brow   13.105969565397714
and i shall satisfy myself with referring such of my readers as appreciate the pictures of the period to its pages   11.444308451349464
when the buzzing murmur of the antechamber to which the summons which had been made had doubtless furnished fresh food had recommenced   10.460469083622554
we have not thought about it yet madame answered d artagnan with that gascon effrontery which had in him the appearance of naivete   13.979282716449536
i searched ransacked counted calculated a thousand and a thousand times the income and expenditure of the family for three hundred years   7.784515210702236
the sportsman instantly changed his direction and ran quickly towards them   6.014944663282901
sire resumed tréville as i told you monsieur d artagnan is little more than a boy   18.9794066615001
is it possible said monte cristo to himself that i can have met with a man that has no ambition   14.678090214434278
ah see there now   4.940034410116988
he soon saw that the vessel with the wind dead ahead was tacking between the château d if and the tower of planier   12.883334749339264
that he had never spoken to the one or the other   12.901007233996728
go on while i endeavor to recall circumstances   12.011383869861522
and to all these questions the captain replied without difficulty and without hesitation   16.376316037214536
the duke saw that he had not controlled himself as he ought but at that moment as if he had listened at the door and comprehended the urgent need of diverting la ramee s ideas grimaud entered and made a sign to la ramee that he had something to say to him   8.857250320210927
and now said morrel leave me alone and endeavor to keep your mother and sister away   13.851421021630065
they played and i won   13.10520863082599
but you first came to breakfast did you not   10.507225891024433
but it is not the less true that that letter and planchet retired shaking his head with an air of doubt which the liberality of d artagnan had not entirely effaced   12.308050683912027
draw out one of the feet that support the bed   11.426547810371805
if you prefer any other place said athos in his persuasive voice choose for yourselves   14.581075586931263
i had him put into a leaden coffin and i am preceding him by a few days   8.913523380369906
i desire to know if the confession of charles stuart is at an end   12.179647158567978
certainly my lord   11.36712125120623
that he has there met de beaufort de bouillon the coadjutor and d elbeuf and that not one of them had any desire to arrest him   14.831721211121083
and i also said aramis   7.154945486521433
ah i know the way you get good sweetened rum over there   15.4323352746346
i was really happy   12.84883972039518
he arrived in time   12.868512563196314
a second smile almost imperceptible stole over the rosy lips of the pretty young woman   11.585195510083615
the scotch my brothers   10.4809631437731
and so at last old dantès was left all to himself and i only saw from time to time strangers go up to him and come down again with some bundle they tried to hide   11.5835024266138
and how so if you please   8.024984630239334
indeed my dear d artagnan i don t know how you manage but you are always full of ideas   11.098006213805926
and he gave his arm to his old comrade whose eyes were full of tears nor could grimaud tell whether the tears were caused by wounds or by the pleasure of seeing him again   16.070843273688695
my throat is closing up   9.58159872123869
bernouin seeing that his master did not return and hearing the stroke of midnight had made an examination of the orangery   13.329753701609707
but should he come and find that young man with your daughter he might be displeased   17.49708156247732
and the procureur breathed more freely than he had done for some time   11.737950475030784
chapter iv   5.782691912272374
there s one just arrived and she handed the letter to d artagnan   11.379388128720334
they did you not see what they did   13.328133375788012
there was a moment s silence during which the noise of the banker s pen was alone heard while monte cristo examined the gilt mouldings on the ceiling   13.578245179955804
robert macaire is the hero of two favorite melodramas chien de montargis and chien d aubry and the name is applied to bold criminals as a term of derision   11.607212809304615
he told me that he was anxious to restore you to the position which you had lost and that he would seek your father until he found him   8.61701768521944
does it belong to the smaller or to the larger of the two   12.976614526261963
he saw d artagnan and porthos enter with internal pleasure yet showed no joy in his countenance   12.753573101767651
because fernand and danglars being both parvenus both having become noble both rich are about equal in worth excepting that there have been certain things mentioned of him that were never said of me   12.653750475524074
you said let us die here   10.080594213278761
this belief was changed into certainty when franz saw the bouquet conspicuous by a circle of white camellias in the hand of a charming harlequin dressed in rose colored satin   11.490839293434373
diffident in allowing the sarcastic aramis to perceive how strong were his paternal feelings   10.57837031346935
but alas i have heard it said that hearts inflamed by obstacles to their desire grew cold in time of security   9.655834979715461
so to night mordaunt go to greenwich and ask for the captain of the felucca lightning   15.02341075604113
well everything was finished as you know   12.535133944444384
and i will send you back to your mass book master abbé   16.14744764856301
on him on him always on him   8.087011938908741
by your father s tomb   11.677878593801822
a prisoner you will not recover your liberty through me   9.608279092161991
i depend upon you to escort me home   12.724430119053517
yet jacopo reached him first   17.343085790822624
but there s his comrade   10.403411987616
the minister bowed his head and while a deep color overspread his cheeks he stammered out by the telegraph sire   11.57783033272839
it was julie who uneasy herself had anticipated her mother   9.615266363704716
i must die   15.681821597411751
declare to belong to him alo   11.25530654540103
good day monsieur dulaurier replied d artagnan   12.58440407312618
but instantly hisses and yells stifled them remorselessly   11.486740088586876
upon my word said dantès you make me shudder   9.207173941056709
he put his head out and asked the postilion how long it would be before they reached the next town   14.922321793994469
owing to him   12.26665198169084
i then wrote to the cardinal   10.520275307392534
my intention said mazarin is not that you go with a great following   9.988172837722278
it was not without foundation that a report of the king s intention to leave paris by night had been circulated   15.264691250075074
enter sir said he   11.626991959707476
d artagnan going to a distance to discover aramis   9.484447880778987
whom do you call that wretch   11.666540197203348
a fearful day when to day we find our friends   15.710733412089901
it however became necessary for one of them to break it first and as d artagnan appeared determined to leave that honor to his companion aramis said you see that i am returned to my fundamental ideas   10.127202352910794
we will hasten on to the inn   12.876581456123882
it was past a question now that faria was not a lunatic and the way in which he had achieved the discovery which had given rise to the suspicion of his madness increased edmond s admiration of him   12.323650260455047
this is what the god in whom on your death bed you refuse to believe has done for you he gave you health strength regular employment even friends a life in fact which a man might enjoy with a calm conscience   12.753390652131298
raoul then approached them as athos had directed him to do   12.157672592813016
i faith said rochefort there s no great difference i think between a dead man and one who has been buried alive   14.10978518301513
because we have very important matters to communicate to one another and it was impossible to talk five minutes in that inn without being annoyed by all those importunate fellows who keep coming in saluting you and addressing you   13.089362849730087
villefort opened a large register then went to a table from the table turned to his registers and then turning to morrel are you quite sure you are not mistaken monsieur   12.776524892283975
and if he has taken off his mask i shall be able to see   13.25084148936381
for la rochelle   15.340306419174212
and let us speak it to the praise of m   7.212596981402852
the four horsemen looked round them with astonishment for they sought vainly in their minds to know who this other person could be   14.68765915823938
chapter 20   12.588343847709664
no i have given up poetry except now and then to write a drinking song some gay sonnet or some innocent epigram   12.527014268933717
there is nothing to do but to send monsieur mazarin to the most distant frontier and to take care that he does not return even by that nor any other entrance into france   8.294206411192
and this very day we will write the letters said aramis   11.734883609156183
those bearing plumed hats and gold swords were stopped and made to cry long live broussel   10.295789094309049
how were you to blame in that affair   13.742983511170628
haydée smiled sorrowfully and shook her head   16.82540462319359
athos became thoughtful   11.298742810168246
the two friends turned down the first street they came to   6.576358387417056
the queen made a curtsy less from etiquette than because her knees were sinking under her   14.275900271305343
will you sell him to me for that sum   13.237964104214528
boy see if the mule belonging to the monk is still in the stable   9.722099177795545
and you what will you do   11.012936832797898
he had a glimpse of objects as through a fog   12.748233864587364
you are puzzled by what you see here but one word will explain everything   13.428765355350535
you allow me to give you this title   12.839558457138919
poor brute accustomed to be covered up and to have a stove in the stable the arabian finds himself unable to bear ten degrees of cold in arabia   12.663133130294458
he placed his hand on his dagger and stopped   6.762071550171888
she listened at eugénie s door and hearing no sound tried to enter but the bolts were in place   14.471186609219687
another proof that he was a native of the universal country was apparent in the fact of his knowing no other italian words than the terms used in music and which like the goddam of figaro served all possible linguistic requirements   8.320859486507203
is it madame de morcerf who has displeased you   14.25660180716438
it is true you called her thus   15.347247742272174
one may be a jailer or a keeper and at the same time a good father and husband   10.040162650281884
you will find it in the water you drink from the spring in the fruit you pluck from the tree   11.43224079315616
but in spite of that and of his being king s attorney he is a man like ourselves and i fancy not a bad sort of one   16.564211915642154
the king sighed deeply   14.65094443187245
a tall pale clerk his face shaded by a forest of virgin hair opened the door and bowed with the air of a man forced at once to respect in another lofty stature which indicated strength the military dress which indicated rank and a ruddy countenance which indicated familiarity with good living   14.804377407063594
but athos   6.82256332754956
i can not help doubting answered danglars with his stupid smile   12.562791335939874
yesterday her fever amounted to delirium   13.370123746109883
this confirmed milady in her opinion that the abbess was rather royalist than cardinalist   10.275127060631942
but what was their surprise after passing saint denis to hear that at saint germain people were singing and laughing and leading generally cheerful lives   3.8689851479393234
the coadjutor   13.443412671241077
like her sister the queen she had been accustomed to pleasing perfumes and fine linen   14.277783854032396
personally i do not know you   8.22272093185698
i sprang toward the table i seized a knife i placed it to my breast   10.796399515897118
if he still lives by all you hold most sacred do not abandon him   11.451372629238971
you do not understand   15.390076716918822
the fact is we do not lodge travellers indeed our tavern is so near the town that nobody would think of stopping here   16.745947900136457
the sounds drew nearer   14.100094425795103
say when shall it be   10.985436439506962
and in what part of auteuil do you reside   13.256783166768656
he could not speak   17.268049749054306
his friends who anxiously awaited him saw him returned with joy   8.981033617162568
i can not help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him that trick you were planning yesterday   10.538564408013507
it was not possible as he knew well to confine for the whole of his life the grandson of henry iv   14.265642347151157
was i not your second   9.444836590172523
then give me water cried danglars endeavoring to parry the blow   14.087022276256253
monsieur athos do me then the honor to accompany me   8.835652280194525
and more i repeat it with joy with triumph i have always found some proof of human perversity or error   10.529657185492797
you must perceive that in my quality of a husband this concerns me   7.336810345982778
it would have been one language more   7.562873684474779
then sire may i present him   6.6383919127939555
although the key was in the door the coadjutor knocked   12.835885427292292
athos and aramis looked at one another and smiled   14.98618880303033
tis well danglars tis well   13.473066276779194
it was evident that he had not slept   10.867815902136758
you shall not call said felton throwing himself between the duke and the bell placed on a stand encrusted with silver   7.650525934782381
this was a man whose face the concierge himself had never seen for in the winter his chin was buried in one of the large red handkerchiefs worn by gentlemen s coachmen on a cold night and in the summer he made a point of always blowing his nose just as he approached the door   4.366025936405199
yes sir answered raoul   11.279393836872021
they began to comprehend   17.334193611626112
the register of my child s birth   6.735236702220923
the safety of the horseman you know depends almost always upon the goodness of his horse   13.165721509014077
thou liest subtile one said d artagnan to himself   12.406330603899011
merely his daughter   17.21119162956711
undid the order of the saint esprit which he wore to honor the two frenchmen who were with him and passed it around winter s neck who received on his knees this striking proof of his sovereign s confidence and friendship   16.825672122584223
if you hear anything of monsieur voiture be so kind as to send me word to morrow   18.81855283174942
the love i have for you is very different from the love i had for my father   13.791393257455134
since i was a faithful servant my lord to cardinal richelieu during his life it stands to reason that now after his death i should serve you well in defiance of the whole world   10.766763232936773
villefort rose and ran towards his mother in law for it was she   15.940891823545929
germain i believe and they had appointed to meet at the carmes deschaux when they were disturbed by de jussac cahusac bicarat and two other guardsmen who certainly did not go there in such a numerous company without some ill intention against the edicts   17.75320659866518
this probability afforded him his first consolation   12.7530050242127
luigi vampa himself searched   6.183182797871959
the young men then rose and bowing to the count quitted the room   10.830053113919229
40092m no thank you i am thinking of other things besides breakfast just now   11.436223236398643
bourges is the capital of charles vii   12.239160643681357
we might be interrupted in the most interesting part of my story which would be a pity   13.453084806941456
the travelers had chosen crossroads in the hope that they might meet with less interruption   12.762086904706116
d artagnan had just passed the rue cassette and already perceived the door of his friend s house shaded by a mass of sycamores and clematis which formed a vast arch opposite the front of it when he perceived something like a shadow issuing from the rue servandoni   14.146071217585789
my plans require secrecy and would be jeopardized by a too extravagant equipment   16.861508408672584
after having exhausted the ideal they found they must talk of the actual   11.702830773915176
because you do not love me madame   10.876356436089266
as soon as the earnest money was paid d artagnan took possession of his lodging and passed the remainder of the day in sewing onto his doublet and hose some ornamental braiding which his mother had taken off an almost new doublet of the elder m   14.609176036603923
be as quick as possible i must be on the road in a quarter of an hour   9.057924118470648
they are contained in this box which you will not open until you are on the other side of the channel   6.7134894665509535
and he held the bonds towards danglars who seized them like a vulture extending its claws to withhold the food that is being wrested from its grasp   9.31565164694609
i fear i shall be forced to suspend payment   8.129042085017748
on intrigues from intriguers   17.32061517365744
here s one your honor how the devil hast thou two horses   13.283505616807988
while the third an old sailor at once the pilot and captain looked on with that egotistical pity men feel for a misfortune that they have escaped yesterday and which may overtake them tomorrow   8.06511969414577
it was for him that you obtained pardon   17.236325299732673
is this all   12.947658057615449
oh succor him   9.85738553240617
all the artillery was ready to move and started off at a moment s notice   8.514204814208194
there will be no necessity for me to make a note of these particulars for there before my eyes beneath my feet all around me i have the plan sketched with all the living reality of truth   11.435155242047292
barrois acknowledged no master but noirtier and never allowed his desires in any way to be contradicted   14.307750715152984
she was like people who dream they are pursued and who in vain try to walk   9.639783731291658
i leave it to monsieur d artagnan to name them my lord   14.643566304177645
it was evident that he had attempted to regain his bed but had not had sufficient strength to do so   16.005748754309153
the queen remained for a short time to receive the compliments of the city dignitaries and to reply to the salutations of the ladies   16.048573931516444
porthos pretended to be confused   10.775186211079706
monte cristo saw him advance towards him without making a single step   10.746963344775622
the harlequin had reassumed her peasant s costume and as she passed she raised her mask   12.895030710127797
my very self dear friend   13.706077737190402
my fingers were caught between two stones that of the wall and that of my ring and the skin was broken   10.796872627281468
you don t know him   10.232553362313485
the time for wine came   18.325774517215148
apropos said d artagnan loud enough for the servant to hear him are you satisfied with olivain   11.408680159473478
a signed statement noirtier was prepared to receive them dressed in black and installed in his armchair   10.012480312897624
then wretched creature then you tempted god a third time   14.124784276755209
i say that it was you who gave me the wine   4.349144556152888
it was easy to see that olivain had not been taught in the school of the planchets and the grimauds   12.075558610945476
she cried never   8.750464847550164
danglars has left suspiciously   13.357357414137025
the coadjutor glanced rapidly behind and saw that he was followed by another man   6.12666972472498
you would be no longer a lost child found but you would be looked upon as an upstart who had sprung up like a mushroom in the night   15.972810347568004
but is this all you have to say to me   15.223109627552713
but now we are alone although it is immaterial to me where are we going   9.775507062413801
otherwise you see although i am sure that general oliver cromwell can intend them no harm it would have a bad appearance   14.671464373056956
what do you intend to do   8.018820512745027
then the trampling of horses and the clashing of steel were heard   11.50485068256225
d artagnan ground his teeth   13.817122559820929
you have received a regular letter of advice   11.45580096812521
coquenard who knew that a simple minded procurator was a very rare variety in the species smiled a little and colored a great deal   9.255792594255803
this plan succeeded   11.933164155135461
half an hour had passed when the carriage stopped suddenly   10.896561428362208
besides liberty of conscience is established in france   14.267422284595144
let us return to your apartment   8.600653757089077
well returned mazarin we will satisfy you   9.163589547424811
and though i do not much rely upon his promise i wish to be punctual   18.367827528271853
we are going to fetch our brevets said d artagnan and when we come back master mazarin will sign them   8.493916262061912
i was going to say there s no longer a queen   6.854472427109757
for she deserves not even the shadow of the misfortune which has this day fallen on her and providence is not willing that the innocent should suffer for the guilty   8.81902165484784
thus the future father and son in law stepped into the same carriage and morrel seeing them pass became uneasy   12.84392578365987
the executioner raised himself on his elbow and gazed with a frightened air at the monk who became livid   9.739523512020408
well in a quarter of an hour he shall be with you   12.03458945228088
i mean said albert drawing near and without apparently noticing cavalcanti who stood with his back towards the fireplace i mean to propose a meeting in some retired corner where no one will interrupt us for ten minutes   10.32285542951104
danglars appeared delighted with you was he not   11.215615945232878
try and find a seat there is one by that geranium which is the only thing in the room to remind me that there are other leaves in the world besides leaves of paper   8.464438897580118
franz gave him albert s letter   15.39497235797625
oh the great man   5.2295005248997555
edmond turned away his head with a sigh   16.52498659081088
porthos bowed as if in assent   15.073907766071326
still the expression of her eyes seemed to inquire if your intentions are pure why are you here   17.534739722861648
it had been d artagnan s practice ever since the riots to sleep in the same room as porthos and on this eventful morning he was still there sleeping and dreaming that a yellow cloud had overspread the sky and was raining gold pieces into his hat which he held out till it was overflowing with pistoles   18.48716894776277
but i require a strong mind to smile on my last moments   7.6643131842263434
well i vow i felt exactly the same sensation at sight of that man when he said why do you ask me that   10.846556826402667
in the bastile   11.365155452534115
i have lighted it   11.259967561762592
his orders were executed and the following evening he received these details the abbé who was in paris only for a month inhabited a small two storied house behind saint sulpice   13.027443987876056
as soon as ever the king comes of age he will issue his commands himself and tis far pleasanter to obey the grandson of henry iv   10.009863370027798
and regaining his entresol he overwhelmed the coachman with every projectile he could lay hands on   11.62170059114848
the concert must be a delightful one   14.276052915323882
the damp had rendered it friable and dantès was able to break it off in small morsels it is true but at the end of half an hour he had scraped off a handful   9.580533021541093
the italian opera is in london   12.739851073848806
porthos looked very melancholy   12.227677323871164
he was taken at compiègne and all is over   17.64205341143218
athos perceiving that she knew him pushed the window with his knee and hand   14.334365918624334
nautilus   10.974519695562236
but d artagnan kept it free from her grasp and presenting the point sometimes at her eyes sometimes at her breast compelled her to glide behind the bedstead while he aimed at making his retreat by the door which led to kitty s apartment   10.112789503316325
it was evident that his neighbor distrusted him   18.349165580219314
we must let the king know immediately   14.81344924010633
the comte de wardes was announced and d artagnan was introduced   11.862380419935999
monte cristo approached and dropped on his purple lips three or four drops of the contents of the phial   12.125471933755174
every one was full of curiosity as to who that unknown executioner could be who presented himself so opportunely to assure to the people the promised spectacle when the people believed it had been postponed until the following day   13.20386826844259
phantoms are visible to those only who ought to see them   11.720194839045728
took an active part in the return from elba   13.821398528981632
betrayed   18.94918270230511
they tacked and kept offshore   13.278336220871793
on your side a solemn oath to remain neutral with respect to me   8.823298715801743
ah you are awake madame he said   15.627002223071493
eh gentlemen let us reckon upon accidents   13.10600527848639
sometimes said he in my voyages when i was a man and commanded other men i have seen the heavens overcast the sea rage and foam the storm arise and like a monstrous bird beating the two horizons with its wings   10.629721005707408
and all this because he had trusted to villefort s promise   4.836184709414622
and you must have had a very confiding nature as well as a good heart not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair   14.7504540085004
the deuce it is   13.798008776678786
we are going according to all probability to la rochelle and once gone she will follow you to the end of the world athos if she recognizes you   11.694708493272792
the mendicant sighed and threw down the bag   11.564671294425434
however at length he decided leaped out of the window into a cluster of heliotropes and daisies and ran to his mother his forehead streaming with perspiration   14.449200548881908
mercédès extended her hand to the count   14.498798474960632
i know all that i wish to know   11.92922066839709
ali returned a sign in the negative   14.961188156757188
why i have as much money as i want   10.502194448085898
hôtel of the guards company of dessessart   12.341616233740684
from châlons to lyons you will go on by the steamboat   8.999815185155692
come let us hear you   17.066849997686827
as he thus reflected he felt the sensation we have described and which had hitherto been unknown to him arise in his bosom and fill him with vague apprehensions   9.892037619501714
a man of his disposition never kills himself for he constantly hopes   8.39235367702449
but excuse me sir for talking of our domestic misfortunes   11.63099850124722
galloping through the bushes   17.40770083552613
i can get you out of paris and leave you beyond the barriere and can return for her   13.822919264441468
a few steps in advance of the gate of saint honore they met a third troop   9.435267609698567
are you coming morrel   10.966739195562408
although i was without mistrust a vague fear seized me and i tried to struggle against sleepiness   13.279131273072089
here i am take my hand and jump into our boat   10.202874093821439
chapter 55   5.86004242908585
then my lord then what   15.578234983114015
hello lovely damsel   13.356945262242023
when you like raoul   12.911857987668405
it is sometimes essential to government to cause a man s disappearance without leaving any traces so that no written forms or documents may defeat their wishes   13.936975706131424
never had the struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now and if it was not a sublime it was at least a curious spectacle   9.608836534363082
then emmanuel   6.277018655436443
he was not the less intoxicated with joy electrified by love   8.209624787316773
i am a friend   12.161575941889291
dentro la testa replied the same voice with the same menacing accent   13.922521231585474
that your eminence will go at once to the queen   15.370058826473073
franz protested he could not defer his pursuit till the following day for many reasons   16.289080803914217
and yet the murder if you choose to call it so would be simply a measure of self preservation   8.142914669768523
de monte cristo saved your life   11.441916992406927
dream of vengeance that evening milady gave orders that when m   10.667697504191452
there goes one   13.590239615215708
you shall have a notary as you absolutely wish for one sir said villefort   12.192186418200993
because after nightfall you are not safe fifty yards from the gates   11.87698957486694
such as were rich gave in addition a part of their money   17.027794377601
passionately   14.838109971260414
madame said d artagnan i have only done what every gentleman would have done in my place   19.441099046140806
one day to rest there   20.120017548606484
we shall see said the inspector   10.28353556627629
you have known me long enough continued albert biting his lips convulsively for he saw that beauchamp s anger was beginning to rise you have been my friend and therefore sufficiently intimate with me to be aware that i am likely to maintain my resolution on this point   6.462676646771916
cried the prisoner laughing violently and by master jacques chrysostom la ramee the king s commissioner   15.506743076842387
you look at my room my four straw chairs my images three francs each   11.667154985199375
cried de gondy   9.534392624757384
and eugénie with her usual precision opened a printed paper and read m   10.028810715281487
he gained the place appointed and as no signal had been given him by which to announce his presence he waited   13.390737241580547
said the other bearer sitting on the edge of the hand barrow   11.20605230881387
well i sought you for the single purpose of offering you a chance to kill monsieur de marsillac whenever you please prince though he is   13.49940142524559
i have paid you five hundred of them   8.28433240492656
certainly sir replied the viscount   13.73462655945203
cried d artagnan unable in spite of the gravity of the occasion to help laughing   7.945604303448915
i must conscientiously perform my duty   6.808632235184569
two other men descended after danglars forming the rearguard and pushing danglars whenever he happened to stop they came by a gentle declivity to the intersection of two corridors   10.270197722386163
no it can not be   7.5503763945487465
this light announced the reappearance of her jailers   11.095494486955902
franz could even feel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the carriage   9.935677790783368
this exclamation which corresponded to the count s own thought rather than to what albert was saying surprised everybody and especially morrel who looked at monte cristo with wonder   10.99859197332906
he had passed the night standing and without sleep   11.759295629451382
and how did he treat you   18.510555713874204
madame danglars then concluded that the young girl had been overcome with the terrible excitement of the evening and had gone to bed and to sleep   6.820904462213226
for if you knew my name perhaps you would not be so pressing   11.974484781625865
andrea looked steadily at monte cristo and disappeared in the second drawing room   12.544198723594778
at the same instant aramis placed his sword point on the breast of his fallen enemy and forced him to ask for mercy   14.628082007120629
speak said charles attempting to look across the hedge of guards which surrounded him   7.9760015495199745
shall i wait for you   12.897288432060765
i am sure of it said athos   13.70297662399248
and perhaps i may in my own person be able to prove to you how completely you are in error   13.231718789860059
so that said monte cristo you have lost nearly 1 700 000 francs this month   11.960655129203312
but said the officer i thought you were in his service and that it was he who sent you to general cromwell   12.730803721862625
it was perhaps some plot against you   12.155446888947814
but she that is another thing   17.09766369137937
i am an assassin then and not an officer of justice   13.040472898722083
oh the miserable wretches   18.017454599226262
and when i am in bitter anguish of spirit do not tell me that i ought to be gay   15.049093284318392
though you lose sight hearing consciousness fear nothing   12.560049051111848
a significant silence followed these words and as the general did not reply close the doors said the president to the door keeper   10.228433125655137
juxon replied with a sign which meant that he knew no more than aramis about it   12.911757964539806
she indeed reminded one of diana as château renaud observed but her bearing was more haughty and resolute   15.191889144542195
well you must become a diplomatist   10.621007604896235
tis something to have met de chatillon in a duel   14.343569605932116
are you satisfied   12.101849720110765
upon my word that is true said porthos   13.16231576673436
the jailer shrugged his shoulders and left the chamber   16.638918592843158
40156m the abbé busoni   19.52058828386937
the coward who feared death rejoiced at perpetual disgrace   10.967462542171383
he hastily tore off the cover opened the journal with nervous precipitation passed contemptuously over the paris jottings and arriving at the miscellaneous intelligence stopped with a malicious smile at a paragraph headed we hear from yanina   14.554735659450635
you know of my engagement to louise   13.14785226335265
an hour after they stepped into their calash both dressed in feminine attire   7.334604971597939
as to the rest m   4.579907610804671
what excessive nonsense you talk maximilian   9.241251824664317
i renew the affair   11.551754737163632
and lord de winter retired swearing which at that period was a very knightly habit   13.215844517829442
thanks   8.849294504028755
while all the proceedings relative to the dissolution of the marriage contract were being carried on at the house of m   17.370647144534967
for though i hear your words i declare i do not understand them   9.405149375243514
we were once four valiant knights four hearts fondly united   7.680276268309342
the poor devil would eat nothing from fear   15.675476741646595
get me that proof and i will send him to the bastille   13.536945098593101
for on my conscience they are a race of men i admire greatly   11.084627810853169
they are fed on thyme only your hares   12.322343780282775
you have come then at last   14.935478168025382
a man who holds a sword in his hand and sees a mortal enemy within reach of that sword and does not fight is a coward   9.201777837210397
so many unexpected things happened to her all at once that for the first time she was at a loss   15.590338841351812
curiosity that is a terrible word   10.458509910619068
you touch them come in contact with them speak to them and they reply to you   7.53817397352106
but on what day will this ball take place   9.745662217951907
bazin was stupefied at the sight of the gold and forgot that he came to announce d artagnan who curious to know who the mendicant could be came to aramis on leaving athos   10.872768390239214
there could be no doubt she owed this information to the cardinal   6.27819963616377
you told me to hope and i almost did so   5.570486119890803
a man of fifty can not long bear malice with a wife of twenty three   7.376918574961448
he is admirably adapted to revive one s spirits because he never interrogates and in my opinion those who ask no questions are the best comforters   5.769854604586159
he was dead   10.44768286083043
with the count of morcerf answered monte cristo   12.54189443151957
on the king s service   9.803973646950986
which is undergoing great fatigue and anxiety my dear duke when we have a telegraph which transmits messages in three or four hours and that without getting in the least out of breath   13.279958948090508
asked villefort becoming still more pale   8.730834716383768
bonacieux opened her eyes under the kisses of d artagnan   3.861011825562178
was this prepared in your presence   15.337825091914983
for when turned from the eyes of athos he encountered those of aramis   8.924773695570465
yes he has a wife who through everything has behaved like an angel   11.175182761846202
thus they would behold the colosseum without finding their impressions dulled by first looking on the capitol the forum the arch of septimus severus the temple of antoninus and faustina and the via sacra   12.560377111741351
just as you were complaining of being tired and obliged to walk   12.159917399315264
but where is your wicker flask monsieur mousqueton   6.5724993387918245
i like said he to feel a hand like this when its owner relies on the goodness of his cause   13.66107501417872
d artagnan fancied quite naturally according to his custom that he must be the object of their conversation and listened   13.119667943265904
cedant arma togæ said villefort with a bow   11.904744767103766
you do not know that he destines me to a disgrace which all the punishments of the world can not equal in horror   13.692007208974829
you would do as much mr   12.673727228867346
i felt pain   13.730272577176612
oh father do not look in that way at me   10.747680270380584
the police of marseilles will be on the alert by land whilst the governor pursues me by sea   12.677394761839492
we will disguise ourselves as monster pulchinellos or shepherds of the landes and we shall have complete success   6.991750944096199
oh for pity s sake   10.808119735940203
the musketeers few in number not being able in the midst of this crowd to make their horses wheel around began to give way   8.120249573699505
help help   11.561723075009654
cried d artagnan recognizing the handwriting   12.17062794498121
danglars meditated an escape   10.223741592651573
besides we are conversing in italian   12.666649110041496
you will tell him my lord resumed the queen despairingly that i can do nothing   14.383831468262507
an imperceptible smile of triumph was expressed on the lips of the procureur   9.459774191817324
my dear planchet said d artagnan sighing we are unfortunately no longer in those times in which princes would care to assassinate me   16.00418817510882
i will take a turn in the garden   13.46507755919744
chapter 40   11.592120996796707
peppino placed himself beside ali and they set off at a rapid pace   12.36923462556503
i will answer for him count   10.804260297164216
and not a man to instruct them   11.302317775700729
cried the prince   11.010970106058936
well well said rochefort here is a chance which may pair off with the other   8.157928347020679
and the doctor added that if another death occurred in a similar way he must appeal to justice   8.327165030011315
hold out your hand and swear   12.057697298593242
you meddle with politics do you and still more with cardinalist politics   11.743395597223316
to men who had risked their lives for him and besides had done him a great service   11.179090454832318
if de wardes had at that moment been under his hand he would have killed him   13.256366698849742
i don t know how to write reverend sir   14.748788160766892
planchet in fact had bedded and fed his horses and then coming back under the window had repeated two or three times the signal agreed upon   11.66229265984577
cried a tall man with an enormous mustache and a long rapier bravo fair paulet it is high time to put little voiture in his right place   11.912672897142185
at this point grimaud stopped and was preparing to make a hole with his gimlet when he found a spigot   12.560336701592853
the usher returned and made a sign to d artagnan to follow him   11.418548096990435
40078m my father answered with a loud laugh which was more frightful than even threats would have been and he had not ceased when two reports of a pistol were heard   12.323954031668537
for that reason i wished to keep you near me   11.426651350763052
horticulture seemed however to have been abandoned in the deserted kitchen garden   12.589209844574315
we shall meet again in a happier time   13.618422275927974
the people are hurrying on the soldiers under arms and among the spectators i see d artagnan   12.330862159654478
she will soon get over these things   17.336387621775984
said lucien   12.923555368980047
it was about one of those purchases that interest women a purchase by which much might have been gained   9.09163221577856
but i did nothing of the sort i suffered him and his band to depart   11.450191139433613
i think so answered albert in a firm tone   13.47077242668523
monsieur said athos letting him go you are not polite   15.55076245557044
he buried his brow in his hands and thought of the world so beautiful when one is about to leave it   11.022091183796144
this man was myself   15.618815440698508
oh mademoiselle mademoiselle   13.86343452377841
your stairs are so polished it is like walking on glass   11.52405468077015
what would you have me do   11.482181987832956
athos you have done wrong   15.811716058938835
the cavalcade trotted on more sharply   8.04482958474646
if a repast were on foot athos presided over it better than any other placing every guest exactly in the rank which his ancestors had earned for him or that he had made for himself   5.380595217927852
morrel shuddered and looked at the man who spoke with more assurance than he had hitherto shown   9.269694341227954
you have just seen him resolve to keep it when he has everything to lose and surely there is more reason for his doing so where he has everything to gain   11.86281847819306
i don t maintain the contrary said d artagnan   15.211653861391632
murmured he and that noirtier is the father of villefort i am lost   15.668765200509704
ah monsieur returned albert i would never forgive you this mistake if you had seen another picture beside this   14.194043826122718
that same night the general was to go over to the english   11.385294669347825
you have no enemy here there is no one but fernand my brother who will grasp your hand as a devoted friend   12.984000111225903
and after pouring some into a glass and slowly swallowing its contents the abbé resuming his usual placidity of manner said as he placed his empty glass on the table where did we leave off   11.543387746599509
and having meantime embraced his ward he passed him into the robust arms of porthos who lifted him up from the ground and held him a moment suspended near the noble heart of the formidable giant   13.142593075448021
what i am about to ask will not compromise you in any degree   12.81923962766751
his relations with the former court of which he always spoke with dignity and respect made him respected by the new one and he knew so many things that not only was he always carefully considered but sometimes consulted   11.681451101854146
danglars recollects having seen him   11.719598912486287
upon our lackey s horses pardieu   14.299217356940543
i ve remarked that your puritans revel in that color   13.75256626875838
aramis called bazin and after having ordered him to join them at athos s residence said let us go then at the same time taking his cloak sword and three pistols opening uselessly two or three drawers to see if he could not find stray coin   17.555014974202116
chapter xii   8.891412185950486
i will do it with all my heart said comminges   7.729738449969769
come come d artagnan said athos do not affect to be strong minded   11.272361735151769
he has broken his ribs said the commander in a low voice   16.37783766156212
eugénie closed her eyes   10.718073108660924
our companions will be riding horses dogs to hunt with and a fishing boat   13.049769051333442
at that time i was not concerned in the adventure in the course of which you have so successfully estopped me   10.793767797196734
dantès did not comprehend the jest but his hair stood erect on his head   16.37575560637227
this was done instantly   13.447913242857483
in a week i shall have left this country where so many persons who merit the vengeance of heaven lived happily while my father perished of hunger and grief   13.654254873219129
by all means be as wise as nestor and as prudent as ulysses   12.945732436078893
her face as she looked at athos had taken on an expression that can not be described   14.091564635856093
isn t that what you would have me shout   15.662603157590407
perhaps we may one day be united   12.432420942144036
oh is it you dear friends   7.997464516578273
i informed them at the hotel that i had the honor of passing the night here duke said franz and desired them to come and inform me of his return   13.839646150401913
he was leaning on the shoulder of his favorite selim and he drove us all before him as a shepherd would his straggling flock   12.905056834240517
d artagnan perceived him one day walking toward the church of st   10.026071807720589
it is indispensable my lord   9.538714798828181
so that at the end of two or three days they have in their power almost all the habitués of the establishment   16.484036933413613
has anyone been speaking to you against me   13.165972165940394
this will has already constituted haydée heiress of the rest of my fortune consisting of lands funds in england austria and holland furniture in my different palaces and houses and which without the twenty millions and the legacies to my servants may still amount to sixty millions   16.588461041261194
athos never had concerns which all his friends did not know   11.655711126010019
and we shall understand each other i hope   14.15752232721341
the prince dismounted ordered one of his aids and raoul to follow his example and directed the others to await his orders keeping themselves meanwhile on the alert   9.325430077134417
not a step forward or you re dead men   13.056261632912763
but he had been unable to send to albert the following particulars as the events had transpired after the messenger s departure   12.559862476810832
and you say that you dug your way a distance of fifty feet to get here   12.571474691450513
friends are shadows   7.3246202463043835
i dreaded to become mad and forgetful   12.621618323622563
replied the old man   8.826856134183949
let us go directly   8.432683905441504
upon a look from the procurator accompanied by a smile from mme   7.846918078199755
well his love is half real half fanciful   11.301339057343837
tréville smiled   10.252591278483031
ah if i were but twenty years old   17.45707177915279
who rang   12.270004270688286
as ten o clock was striking d artagnan left m   12.61619127468282
no mercédès said monte cristo no   13.945075654561801
but harrison paid not the least attention to him and entering the king s room followed by his companion charles stuart said he an order has come to conduct you to london without stopping day or night   10.63794441803324
de villefort said the king come in   11.704935051923334
and then when he saw the light plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the château d if and heard the distant report he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one whose coming and going like that of kings was accompanied with salutes of artillery   10.357832170998703
they had one and all deserted the accursed house   10.009421012293862
d artagnan overcoming his repugnance to mordaunt walked with him upon the deck and invented a hundred stories to make him talk   9.504976157582144
noirtier s eye still retained its inanimate expression   13.483229140805653
you are astonished i see   9.599369602141637
i am sir said the king much agitated   7.528361593802809
yes said the count you are right it is miraculous   14.490325611155711
but their wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which dantès handled the helm   16.51063121523049
tell him that certain parties are grateful for the warning he has given   10.459187687446505
he had spent every farthing that had been allowed for his journey as a reward for the majestic and solemn manner in which he had maintained his assumed character of father   16.871383838878558
may i depend on it   8.28289093113281
i can not hope to be very fluent but i certainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes   6.609766727252129
he therefore informed m   11.608008332313224
said the gentleman   19.183222680838245
why about fifteen or eighteen days ago   11.327875501680849
sixty   10.504397334674445
silence purveyor of gossip do not spread that report   4.203257720251205
the duty will be tolerably long and not very amusing i know   13.403279628578368
face long and brown   15.160281598152782
well monsieur de busigny i will bet you said athos that my three companions messieurs porthos aramis and d artagnan and myself will go and breakfast in the bastion st   12.300564530670313
and you stopped there   12.953009972299741
that has naturally led me to love no one so much the better now you have my profession of faith   14.773540474577896
he threw himself on his knees   9.297040949103828
madame danglars fell into a long seat placed near the chimney   12.153548205391337
haydée my slave thinks me a greek   6.243536981671778
the sight of this officer recalled villefort from the third heaven to earth   13.639298934972839
or rather by instinct   6.751128059456331
how unfortunate i am   11.278819862126765
you say you were on the point of being made captain of the pharaon   14.292361269883513
oh i am done with considering   11.290055942399045
i felt myself fall to the ground my mother had fainted   9.164425231955061
but as he did not think of giving this order till five hours after the event that is to say till two o clock in the afternoon two vessels had already left the port the one bearing as we know milady who already anticipating the event was further confirmed in that belief by seeing the black flag flying at the masthead of the admiral s ship   12.374885918609165
cried he pressing his lips to those of the prisoner   15.674455220889511
the company went on speaking of the poet voiture   13.758860531830182
i have had ten or twelve sailors under me and if you question them they will tell you that they love and respect me not as a father for i am too young but as an elder brother   8.536022735250727
woman is weak monsieur cardinal said the king   11.637782860264883
he heard hasty steps the creaking of a door people going and coming and some minutes afterwards a turnkey entered saying here is the brazier lighted   14.201100836088724
his eyes swam like those of a man suddenly dazzled   14.176085890764748
well perhaps you are right said athos   11.615202783814711
and a desire of vengeance disordered the features of milady which however immediately recovered the calm and benevolent expression which this woman of a hundred faces had for a moment allowed them to lose   13.314526077033118
andrea was gone   10.575567888918558
do you know what that warning was   15.599931605955176
where was she built   10.594780949015961
haydée replied monte cristo   9.452333249973256
13 oh yes   9.404923196403084
we shall search for some madame and i think we can find a little and if your majesty approves we will seek for some together   8.641289264660836
fight on all occasions   12.116708555350112
had dantès found nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale   11.694901552227746
i admit that would reassure me greatly   10.716859869943686
mousqueton at the head of them wiped his eyes   6.877494697073697
accustomed as franz was to the italian phraseology his first impulse was to look round him but these words were addressed to him   16.632493375813933
villefort seized the letter and hastily broke the seal   10.252590523041139
well my friend i bring you the means of becoming rich powerful and free to do whatever you wish   9.495813224671066
on the receipt of the count of monte cristo   19.96572991934819
a bed without curtains four armchairs and a couch covered with yellow utrecht velvet composed with a prie dieu all its furniture   8.458848478369957
the great man has called me his friend   13.960269024834393
as porthos and aramis were undressing him in the hope of finding his wound not mortal a large purse dropped from his clothes   13.143194023819746
danglars left last night   16.250645346195867
besides on pressing occasions in extreme difficulties d artagnan would become the preserver of his friends   16.94096789541718
the elder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation like that of all who have experienced many trials contained many useful and important hints as well as sound information   13.052707851216617
but you must really permit me to congratulate you on the ease and unconcern with which you resigned yourself to your fate and the perfect indifference you manifested as to the turn events might take   11.132563284408533
edmond related to me everything until the moment when he was arrested in a small cabaret close to marseilles   14.246369483662033
i heard no other noise but the beating of my own heart   10.428051694742045
true the young man had warmly and energetically thanked the count on the previous evening   16.04047745710412
he entered portsmouth about eight o clock in the morning   11.601826284867432
what do i see in it   12.991561216322882
at seven o clock in the morning he arose and called planchet who at the second summons opened the door his countenance not yet quite freed from the anxiety of the preceding night   10.950038078502264
condé himself whilst fighting for him lost no opportunity of ridiculing of humbling him   17.15445002024248
we were in the palace of yanina   13.653573722852736
it was indeed peppino who was preparing to mount guard as comfortably as possible by seating himself opposite to the door and placing between his legs an earthen pan containing chick peas stewed with bacon   13.371464553023845
sir said planchet when he saw d artagnan on the summit of the ladder this way is easy for monsieur aramis and even for you   11.633697837991473
no my daughter is not guilty   11.469128294759773
the nobles and ladies of their majesties suites were to dress two by two in chambers prepared for the purpose   12.770289609804273
all four besides immediately broke off their conversation   9.030677262404206
cried aramis do you see count   12.826802803576193
the next morning when d artagnan entered aramis s chamber he found him at the window   12.41896592886643
this evening the margin of possible delay expires   8.552587424942796
said d artagnan affecting surprise   13.928591246038959
cried d artagnan is the poor fellow worse then   8.392101900550486
to all of which her husband would calmly return an unvarying reply in these philosophic words hush la carconte   18.237758735399982
do not disturb yourself do not disturb yourself   2.016831416818116
very well take blaisois with whom i know not what to do since i already have grimaud   18.742414942182844
a fallen prince   12.524375985536949
what do you fear vasiliki   12.869284925666523
i love her   11.077063259665197
every blow he aimed was sure and his pistol finished the deed annihilated the wounded wretch who tried to rise again   10.80732249119854
yes said the man who could scarcely believe in such magnanimity but is it not to have me hanged   9.530390522649984
bravo planchet you are a lad of your word and if ever you leave your master i will promise you a place in my service   5.188078820605089
you must stand in need of repose   14.908720230259451
i hear a horse s steps   12.692166457539917
well replied athos i am not far from approving the idea of monsieur porthos   6.327807182396234
sell the crown diamonds   8.59178024326351
the pharaon has gone down then   13.974744197798685
the cardinal was lavish to his underlings   15.449294381622357
they might have remained much longer lost in one another without anyone noticing their abstraction   12.194785474537928
take them and if you need money for your expedition sell them fearlessly my lord   10.997507099704173
once in london we shall be hard to find without considering continued athos throwing a glance at aramis the chances that may come to us on the way   13.96681674194668
on reaching la storta the point from whence rome is first visible the traveller evinced none of the enthusiastic curiosity which usually leads strangers to stand up and endeavor to catch sight of the dome of saint peter s which may be seen long before any other object is distinguishable   14.060308071225666
meantime the three friends were standing motionless before the awful sight which d artagnan in raising the shutters had disclosed to them through the narrow opening of the window   10.059909201503581
yes my child   10.084488572723432
athos sprang up but after an instant of motionless silence he said to the astonishment of his friends monsieur mordaunt a duel between us is impossible   14.401750715762628
here is the order he gave me and the cross i took from his hand   13.164430535559994
not to reply would be a blot on my name and my honor   14.06880519135222
athos smiled when he saw their bare swords   14.331326065225864
or the mysterious benefactress said athos   6.3248926948537285
that s a different thing   8.991313963904268
and you another order for i see you have a blue ribbon at your button hole   9.605533114772653
he filled two glasses and by a sign invited d artagnan to drink   15.886497601124415
to you as the king s attorney i denounce mademoiselle de villefort do your duty   14.598682177228604
a crowd of masks flowed in from all sides emerging from the doors descending from the windows   19.006698266014027
maximilian was obliged to let him pass but he followed him   11.706113579502293
i am come to talk to you about a thousand things   14.435640537478369
they shall not have the king   4.1752523218897215
shouted forth one of the party stationed in the balcony on the lookout   9.999549946402604
but do you see to what you are exposing yourself   18.56402346754703
he s heavy though for an old and thin man said one as he raised the head   8.437259839496726
whether i am in my senses or not answered franz that is the way i feel   8.447445023796872
the young man fled while she was still threatening him with an impotent gesture   11.422995602467193
said andrea do you want anything more   16.69721949339688
the old man was attired in a suit of glistening watered silk trimmed with steel buttons beautifully cut and polished   8.728563877430059
did he mention my name   10.448920660309735
and then followed a dream of passion like that promised by the prophet to the elect   13.100739758408947
stop there madame for this can not last   10.873815956369672
but jest as he might he gained nothing   10.916275079319734
but he repented of it   12.392620837720557
i do what i please m   7.091758104959208
it is one of the best houses in europe said danglars carelessly throwing down the receipt on his desk   11.181352914948894
but he was not sufficiently broken into the fashions of the gay world to know how to extricate himself gallantly from a false position like that of a man who begins to mingle with people he is scarcely acquainted with and in a conversation that does not concern him   14.862840496063939
you heard what the count just said and also my reply   15.569471562281956
bonacieux saw that he hesitated   10.387474462621933
she would have seduced a saint   12.071459927204247
have you come to sup with me   13.649424075023282
milady smiled and d artagnan felt that he could damn himself for that smile   11.51309115378584
planchet followed the movements of his master as if he had been his shadow and was soon trotting by his side   13.670407968346073
at two o clock the tennis balls began according to grimaud s directions to take the direction of the moat much to the joy of la ramee who marked fifteen whenever the duke sent a ball into the moat   16.56090129045996
the drawing room was lighted up they went in there   9.838698817569174
the count went to his secrétaire opened it and pulling out a drawer filled with gold said to franz i hope you will not offend me by applying to anyone but myself   12.691595621431333
and the prisoner he continued aloud was he ever heard of afterwards   11.588354486116751
i recollect now said the officer in a jeering tone   7.815938712949315
now let me tell you some news   10.714607288217227
because it is for victors to make conditions and you are not yet victors gentlemen   12.11163708171895
that pale face and flaming glance appeared to villefort like a frightful apparition   7.897640847263837
nevertheless day dawned without darkness having brought any accident   10.486315486361882
it was only to fight as an amateur   8.404003565761315
our house transacts business to the amount of a million a year from which we derive an income of 40 000 francs   8.965583943099649
i am going home   8.70184990482211
and bring your bottle of smelling salts with you   9.361894555881904
debray mechanically stopped and looked at the baroness whose face became covered with blushes   15.156973132970366
it is only a question of how much shall be charged for them   11.274638210961562
you are then some secret implacable and mortal enemy   16.695342074135002
the mere sound of it filled them with terror   10.200354349025357
mercédès opened the door of the study and had disappeared before he had recovered from the painful and profound reverie into which his thwarted vengeance had plunged him   17.509793274570885
you will find a horse in the stables quite as good as this   18.62372767266161
that is to say that the fault lay with my people and that i was ready to offer you my excuses   9.838895593391808
but when the saddle and arms for grimaud were purchased athos had not a sou left of his hundred and fifty pistoles   10.557076787585173
these were hours of recreation for me as i never saw anything in the dismal cavern but the gloomy countenances of the slaves and selim s fiery lance   15.828164278772867
yes it is an extraordinary story said beauchamp   5.675544410909264
was he to be carried back by the wind which had blown him there   6.128066995230725
monsieur d herblay she added turning toward aramis will you be my servant once more this evening   17.453430877782537
somebody there received your packet and gave you a letter in place of it i think   7.877070311991914
if it were so answered athos we should not be taken there by lord de winter for he would come in for his share   12.272882086707845
this idea imparted new energy and in three days he had succeeded with the utmost precaution in removing the cement and exposing the stone work   14.858659793574205
the spit turned the stove roared the pretty madeleine wept   10.096969663233917
nothing of the kind sir replied danglars if such had been the case i only should have been to blame inasmuch as i was aware of all these things when i made the engagement   11.68994663040523
i am afraid he has turned out ill she added   10.599293556251759
madame de morcerf had lived there since leaving her house   16.89272335312113
she did not know what might take place during this night which approached so menacingly for large masses of cloud rolled over the face of the sky and distant lightning announced a storm   9.54987584219161
or perhaps you guessed that he was here   10.344477639026657
you are a jewel of a man mr   12.938246313366305
bonacieux was at his door   8.905872651184986
should the ransom be refused the prisoner is irrevocably lost   11.211047595385919
milady s supper was brought in and she was found deeply engaged in saying her prayers aloud prayers which she had learned of an old servant of her second husband a most austere puritan   8.868577687874492
would you like such a post   13.471749048743243
i care no more about him than an empty bottle   11.177033284128406
oh yes i do indeed repent   14.714305945011457
milady opened the letter with eagerness equal to kitty s in bringing it   12.2594477397847
i shall go and die by his side   10.743906146970229
there only then remained porthos and bicarat   14.425573200580992
and now absolve me for i am dying   13.786285975657112
i will return tomorrow said bertuccio   8.831926725038263
besides said the abbé god is merciful to all as he has been to you   5.124876441242801
d artagnan looked much disconcerted   7.417045432463874
from lyons to avignon still by steamboat   10.376084503010292
besides i expect to lead your highness into places where you will have to walk   15.441236347787003
you may conclude your interrupted galop so that you will owe no ill will to signor luigi who has indeed throughout this whole affair acted like a gentleman   13.222460313571212
for the present i will confine myself if perfectly agreeable to you to introducing you to the baroness danglars excuse my impatience my dear count but a client like you is almost like a member of the family   12.32065401140397
straw work   9.870560625777486
asked a deep solemn voice which caused danglars hair to stand on end   14.864107786742505
it is so windy that your hat can easily appear to have blown off   17.043648601168236
de morcerf entered at the last stroke   17.519708056645445
who goes   12.132882460812086
i understand what you say   11.705755744370421
sir interposed blaisois i warn you that i can only swim in rivers   14.037806208802337
one can always find a tree and a cord   10.942199684266653
who is it   11.402583307452677
god has sustained me in my struggle with my enemies and has given me this reward   10.004093807243668
they traveled together side by side with sad eyes and heads lowered   11.999416937800122
and in three months time said albert you will be at my house   12.460869605973945
yes once   11.697284848529334
very little at least   18.383892991554802
de tréville judged that he had not to deal with a fool and changing the conversation came straight to the point   11.00766238230235
and as to the four or five volunteers monsieur has but to make his intentions known and the men will not be wanting   13.718174081095647
do you see any great advantage in adhering to this party   9.486973670831372
olivain obeyed and continued on his way whilst raoul remained sitting with his elbow leaning on the table from time to time gently shaking the flowers from his head which fell upon him like snow and gazing vaguely on the charming landscape spread out before him dotted over with green fields and groups of trees   14.68513101312966
villefort drew back a few steps and clasping his hands exclaimed with real amazement and sympathy dead   6.846282168538783
set out immediately for paris and demand of the count of monte cristo avenue des champs élysées no   12.38074895456193
if you had taken what madame de villefort has poured into your glass valentine valentine you would have been doomed   9.487308497372158
there is neither happiness nor misery in the world   15.780871789028875
haydée was standing pale motionless looking at the count with an expression of fearful amazement   10.538774770692115
this said monte cristo is less correct than your philosophy it is only faith   13.925128165837156
she was free now to give way to her transports without being observed   14.958482348853163
when i returned she was married   13.540942798109832
nothing i laugh at raoul   14.579659474164744
athos raised his eyes and his finger toward heaven   12.400219196723024
one day when he was seven years old he came to the curate of palestrina and asked to be taught to read   14.52052068960161
all i ask is permission to remain abed   11.763240722588609
see i have sold my watch for 100 francs and the guard and seals for 300   18.333113957158254
he will play me some dog s trick or other and that immediately said tréville   9.623268172419815
that poor child said madame de villefort when valentine was gone she makes me very uneasy and i should not be astonished if she had some serious illness   13.026718459196193
andrea i think you have managed this affair rather skilfully   16.594280401334224
the angel was a demon   13.673333667495465
all the corps rivaled one another in audacity and gaiety   12.877985538754885
a prude who told you every night as she undressed you that it was a sin to love a priest just as if one were a priest because one happens to be a cardinal   15.499620847066453
but after all as i have given you proofs my dear cousin i am not unskilled in such affairs and i will take charge of the commission   12.04191473513329
do not lie my angel said d artagnan smiling   13.82038762662777
at a hundred paces from the gates of calais d artagnan s horse gave out and could not by any means be made to get up again the blood flowing from his eyes and his nose   11.57713807873829
i beg you to do so   14.44228294645081
ma foi said monte cristo   16.729629061110256
all the rest of the furniture indicated that the dweller in this house occupied himself with the study of natural science   15.399665840064252
and moreover in taking such a step we should appear to be doubtful of ourselves   14.342240362735353
in the morning at nine o clock in the day at one o clock and in the evening at eight   16.013729340248297
the countenance of old dantès brightened   12.654097064431777
and when jacopo inquired of him what is the use of teaching all these things to a poor sailor like me   11.972533033533624
it seems to me said danglars in his coarse tone ill concealed by a forced smile that you have already got horses enough   10.39495484137401
title the three musketeers author alexandre dumas release date march 1 1998 ebook 1257 most recently updated june 28 2023 language english start of the project gutenberg ebook the three musketeers the three musketeers by alexandre dumas père first volume of the d artagnan series contents author s preface chapter i   9.908344274262618
i have known persons he continued for he thought he might avail himself of the opportunity of speaking of d artagnan who by their sagacity and address have deceived the penetration of cardinal richelieu   8.327588498395947
i see my lord i shall be obliged to fetch a second grimaud   13.45017731020446
he only waits for one thing to determine him to resume his cassock which hangs behind his uniform said another musketeer   9.944591540046337
milady felt that she stood in need of all her strength   15.019785635856568
sir i surrender said louvieres presenting his unloaded musket to the officer   12.843484665264265
franz continued it was as we said the fifth of february   14.810018534540733
but if she has good taste oh said monte cristo my fondness may blind me but i assure you i consider morcerf a charming young man who will render your daughter happy and will sooner or later attain a certain amount of distinction and his father s position is good   12.729140689453812
i want to see it   8.912690183596178
mercédès i must revenge myself for i suffered fourteen years fourteen years i wept i cursed   7.3684493505269515
how much does he spend yearly   13.87427520958774
our wine   12.141420255828294
well said she   15.702782740327669
a long silence followed   11.398278704697788
i inevitably look for better times   10.117023650123608
which instead of producing the death intended caused life to circulate in your veins   11.716325291699457
why every day in the trenches we go cheerfully to expose ourselves to worse than that for a bullet may break a leg and i am convinced a surgeon would give us more pain in cutting off a thigh than an executioner in cutting off a head   9.845800247492253
but you know guitant we poor ministers often want men with other qualities besides courage   11.85419505872898
said the musketeer as pale as a sheet   16.662588459373335
will you deign to accept it as coming from a friend   10.785045295984787
how much do you require for my ransom   7.4502411341386665
it was my nom de guerre when monsieur d artagnan two other gallant friends and myself performed some feats of arms at the siege of la rochelle under the deceased cardinal and monsieur de bassompierre   11.110935112180279
i felt for it found it twisted it up together and putting it into the expiring flame set light to it   11.538946031392499
and do you believe that if i knew i would relate to you all its trials and all its adventures as would a dramatist or a novel writer   13.955252270193636
all right since you will have it so   16.150995609419574
yes madame m   11.594872910332777
the writing was in reality charming and the orthography irreproachable   9.828748980480132
said d avrigny with surprise   8.498388570229144
once with the army you may be killed at your good pleasure   16.92575199795959
that is to say replied villefort with hesitation that human nature being weak every man according to your creed has committed faults   12.44657264044929
is that possible   15.357617390075703
my lord said la ramee if you will take a bit of good advice don t put that off till you are old   12.756615374439347
cried luigi and teresa at the same moment   8.254524784195638
and to complete the whole haydée was in the very springtide and fulness of youthful charms she had not yet numbered more than nineteen or twenty summers   9.162660259394034
you know the word must   7.662823758376298
their tears will deprive me of the courage to die   14.130232715339284
the countess de winter chapter xxii   6.686529872691912
the coadjutor gave me sixty men   13.079718013103623
as long as they were within the circle of the camp the four friends did not exchange one word   9.581692852800895
has anyone an interest in preventing your arrival there   11.053758188502382
should we not do better in the grottos   12.307782854429027
you have assassinated a woman then   9.41855223236916
a freezing politeness a strict fidelity to government principles a profound contempt for theories and theorists a deep seated hatred of ideality these were the elements of private and public life displayed by m   12.814200164023939
milady sprang toward him   8.479480591296145
de villefort whom i shall endeavor to interest in edmond s favor   11.22737368014859
i do not say there is any truth in what i am going to tell you but it is at least a ray of light in a dark night   11.360945363653688
but these tears disappeared almost instantaneously for doubtless god had sent some angel to collect them far more precious were they in his eyes than the richest pearls of guzerat and ophir   17.88895611479819
well said caderousse why what a lie he told   9.070921990425983
the count shuddered at the tones of a voice which penetrated the inmost recesses of his heart   11.437526882988385
every one grows childish in prison but the character of monsieur de beaufort was particularly disposed to become so   10.494357290392527
i take charge of everything   11.450987650624342
but as no one else can attest the truth of this accusation i attest it myself   13.920913105767909
i have been most anxious to see you that i might repeat orally the thanks writing can so ill express   7.567726330445216
in order to see the queen said aramis we must first see the cardinal   7.2740795894148045
yes for the mother s sake his poor mother   8.241952391203055
two remained with the men in black who rummaged every place and took all the papers   12.640399441992166
and to complete his resemblance with the fantastic heroes of the english poet the count seemed to have the power of fascination   9.582543348820177
i am glad to see you pay attention to the usages of the world   18.690686166804618
coquenard did not carry his genealogical investigations any further   5.272243440361358
in that case you monsieur le coadjuteur who have such power over them and are at the same time friendly to us said the queen ironically will quiet them by bestowing your blessing upon them   9.222675580622564
a poor officer without fortune without protection without a future unless the eye of my queen which i have sought so long rests on me for a moment   12.956185158826326
alas do you not know   8.254378069791986
cried d artagnan and the citizen at the same time each having recognized his man   8.98580738753476
then said he you are ready to pay the official visits which are absolutely indispensable   8.100949460791245
that is you know a diversion which the duc d orleans made quite the fashion   11.295555883630197
we are going again it appears to have our hides pierced in all sorts of ways   12.143703027648218
i ought rather to say what i know   13.59809444052864
they passed through the gate like apparitions without the guards thinking of detaining them and reached the open country   12.488859521994819
well never mind answered caderousse pouring out a glass of wine for fernand and filling his own for the eighth or ninth time while danglars had merely sipped his   13.132968006394167
i do not think so my lord said bernouin   18.520208322654184
it might for the cabin door was open and stay   13.747999314173944
so soon as she was left alone with the woman whom the baron had summoned to her assistance she opened her eyes   14.22530347329123
well where the devil are you going now   9.478395495347115
ten other carriages followed containing the ladies of honor the officers of the royal household and the court   11.221972906582783
you carry your goodness so far as even to present him to me yourself   11.61301941828963
no but we shall make use of them said d artagnan   15.161540330670848
madame de villefort at this really did turn pale and was very nearly angry with this household plague who answered to the name of edward   8.370752921132201
we are on the very eve of it   17.65130882039027
why your writing exactly resembles that of the accusation   16.13504469684567
and why were you so affected at that story or rather fable which the count related   8.527268611049518
well gentlemen the reason people die so multitudinously i like the word at m   11.00677451456873
you would love me then if you were not queen   7.923272859343751
i told you so said d artagnan checking him with his hand   11.824318436615219
look and judge for yourself   12.507910343519015
well well we all say that fifty francs will be enough for us at present and that we will wait for the rest   12.724860904352672
he is better pleased with rewards given to the benefactors of man than to his destroyers   13.835035351951664
my father abandons me from utter indifference while my stepmother detests me with a hatred so much the more terrible because it is veiled beneath a continual smile   15.543312738799692
i am suffering i can not see   16.654634862887853
go up the first flight and knock at number one   12.73508142283097
god grant you as much   13.76705813354835
asked aramis laughing   11.51211179938845
those idiots   7.571951574717078
courage madame   9.846494853214828
at this moment a monstrous battering was heard   8.667587770046186
villefort forced a laugh   12.208294699162675
athos made two visits in paris   9.716339219291202
that emetic villefort see if it is coming   7.866112662517112
the prince turned and seemed to cover the young man with a single glance   10.634288760506147
move on then   9.260805878177727
he was not ignorant that such a beast was worth at least twenty livres   8.786941277146946
is mazarin dead   8.376402613055632
i will allow no one to annoy you   9.369529310977347
cried buckingham raising his voice so as to attract the notice of his people without absolutely shouting   9.845107204435829
dantès shuddered   11.475483879562645
athos fenced with as much calmness and method as if he had been practicing in a fencing school   14.759986683048382
four hundred and seventy five livres said d artagnan who reckoned like archimedes   13.046104782477265
the three friends looked on panting and astonished   11.317273202204998
and madame de villefort found on their return that the count of monte cristo who had come to visit them in their absence had been ushered into the drawing room and was still awaiting them there   7.247006218417375
besides kitty will tell nothing   14.825637174654844
absolutely nothing   9.159690185788048
and you did not fire on him   16.8995464257807
but ere he had gone many steps he heard the man loudly calling him to stop   5.860452373111897
franz looked up they were opposite the rospoli palace   9.003042772988355
every one has yielded   12.00660925312145
i have spoken to you indiscreetly about danglars   15.497108337952488
yes repeated the count   12.004142163299296
nothing makes time pass more quickly or more shortens a journey than a thought which absorbs in itself all the faculties of the organization of him who thinks   15.688365423294705
in my country the ladies do without chambermaids   11.534613856376268
and yet instead of the silence and the solemnity demanded by the occasion laughter and jests arose from the crowd   10.187531477155844
the minister quailed before this outburst of sarcasm   15.756444465665837
that will serve us for a relay said athos   9.4900027579677
but scarcely had he departed when he turned and clasped porthos in his arms with an expression not to be doubted   10.853204966869557
his eminence then orders me said the lady   11.347620872428802
the king looked at the cardinal as if to interrogate him   14.356665673928115
but he will never have the king   9.06496925605288
he began his day by breakfasting substantially a bad beginning when one wants to employ the head but an excellent precaution when one wants to work the body   8.602729310599448
is it not so father   11.019970840432856
murmured the poor mercer now indeed i am lost   14.964901752777067
the poor lad s strength was almost exhausted   13.69021823770901
d artagnan and porthos went on meantime to paris   12.166579319307703
they are quite new and have not yet been used   10.041829891094709
let us choose a place of rendezvous continued athos and in a last interview arrange our mutual position and the conduct we are to maintain toward each other   8.83701684435708
she doubted not there was an intrigue between this lady and porthos   9.414325703563954
if we were to go together to luigi vampa i am sure he would not refuse you albert s freedom   17.839887205601833
you talk of flying mazarin shrugged his shoulders and taking the queen s hand led her to the window   8.378136222655543
to no one on my honor   10.998640858347953
his little gray eyes shone like carbuncles and appeared with his grinning mouth to be the only part of his face in which life survived   11.201199598531398
the rock half open afforded a passage to the young man who disappeared like the evil spirits in the fairy tales   16.235123333564523
20177m the strife had fairly begun and the recollection of what they had seen half an hour before was gradually effaced from the young men s minds so much were they occupied by the gay and glittering procession they now beheld   18.894349617822037
they know that i am intimate with you that you are in fact   15.812977107177327
but i have already told you what that damned magician predicted   18.87074074009664
madame have pity on me exclaimed de winter   9.598513722134491
well then that green preserve is nothing less than the ambrosia which hebe served at the table of jupiter   19.56696062269692
milady showed her the cardinal s order   12.373838751833363
but he did not succeed and became too intoxicated to fetch any more drink and yet not so intoxicated as to forget what had happened   10.529779684694851
it was he who saved the life of your step mother and her son   15.845412076478084
this strange event aroused great wonder and curiosity in the neighborhood of the allées de meilhan and a multitude of theories were afloat none of which was anywhere near the truth   10.428701586058263
cried the brigadier   17.478916512772486
she raised her head with an effort   11.904752747887864
the great pompey lost that of pharsalia   16.748753921688884
the tall man alone inhabited this house   5.892410437278955
and what am i to pay with brute   13.72912558756432
do you pretend that all this has been unobserved at the minister s   7.720485673415308
why to converse with him of course   7.769774134908821
is it broken off   11.010844103898883
god beholds your devotion and my martyrdom and believe me both will have their reward   8.681857150294341
i always said you were a fine fellow and it is a blessing when good fortune happens to such as you   15.525357521459313
save your skin   7.628852036194653
where do you keep your wine   13.636540222510243
athos sipped the last bottle of his spanish wine   13.639417250151844
that is the way in which these things are to be accounted for   12.784063985407192
he opened the conversation about rain and fine weather   8.97887929740477
my dear friend of what consequence is it if she kills me   12.753344205079234
cried milady with vehemence so that the baron might believe she was addressing heaven and that felton might understand she was addressing him   13.778772609040196
can you recollect all that   15.337286273324196
ah those orientals   14.086229155433953
and from my knowledge of you i believe you will so take it away from us   12.503613689294829
it was evening   11.045254374671597
nevertheless she still waited patiently till the hour for dinner   11.493391436836587
silence said monte cristo   10.849611810600278
i will not attempt to argue with you but i blame you   12.686983560541991
depraved as a girl adulterous as a wife an unnatural sister homicide poisoner execrated by all who knew her by every nation that had been visited by her she died accursed by heaven and earth   16.290876411521765
that s a capital arrangement   16.49602129948444
the accident was set down to the account of robbers who had stopped the chaise in the wood   9.476062660248328
yes sir answered the sergeant uncovering   13.406342421573026
the silence however could not last forever   9.061886065468087
that monsieur coligny would be killed in a duel with the duc de guise   5.867491672406645
to accompany the doctor to the door added morrel   9.80674041609768
so near as that   9.823301873448443
on entering the hotel d artagnan saw a man sitting in a corner by the fire   13.691341044748043
meanwhile oblige me by a sight of one of these tavolettas   7.733522320869583
no athos no you are mistaken said d artagnan   13.559150550271681
tis not for me a private individual to disunite a queen from her kingdom   15.385770247156199
if my musketeers are guilty sire the guilty shall be placed in your majesty s hands who will dispose of them at your good pleasure   11.986813922480533
without accident   13.956863042564772
and if it be necessary that like lucretia i should sign my accusation with my blood i will sign it   9.632623739882616
d artagnan regained the trench and threw the corpse beside the wounded man who was as pale as death   12.53970863133301
gentlemen he said our presence here is the best proof of former friendship   12.45437958894501
if we are we will talk of our affairs just the same   9.248336996308451
yet i have no other observation to make for what you say is correct which is more than can be said for all philosophy   15.790644624164502
au revoir albert   11.933286417426508
but i told him i was only mate and that she belonged to the firm of morrel son   15.82771652834421
i do not think so   7.534431815533301
well conceal me somewhere   11.834843155832292
she must live that my infamy may diminish hers   14.717917006312073
try therefore either to carry me to some place where i may see a priest or take the trouble to send one to me here   13.083409652789621
this child has caused me to recover what i had lost   15.296961135241368
we are not yet at our destination observed the prudent d artagnan   12.175232038225436
danglars looked radiant with joy   13.924210324792586
well said the prisoner when the door was shut i am not so far advanced as i believed   12.907968679595173
just as they were beginning in the english fashion to leave the spoons in their cups the door again opened and danglars entered visibly agitated   10.847970057964929
and i think you will be satisfied on that head   9.675410853761075
eleven o clock had struck   11.627575056231201
we have only lived up to the present time because we believed each other dead and because a remembrance is less oppressive than a living creature though a remembrance is sometimes devouring   13.032616848335149
albert had himself presided at the arrangement or rather the symmetrical derangement which after coffee the guests at a breakfast of modern days love to contemplate through the vapor that escapes from their mouths and ascends in long and fanciful wreaths to the ceiling   9.40276154867352
danglars seeing that if he continued the conversation in the same tone in which he had begun it the whole thing might turn out to his own disadvantage turned to morcerf and said count you must doubtless be surprised at my reserve and i assure you it costs me much to act in such a manner towards you   14.381430642061767
and the royal carriage drove on followed by the other coaches and about fifty horsemen   12.160751202597245
say one word to them and all will be ended peace succeed war joy tears and happiness to misfortune   12.54861281809913
read i command you for i am resolved that everything shall be finished to night and never will i recur to this subject again   16.333800172742926
what a proposition   9.096258334504359
villefort she exclaimed in her softest and most captivating manner   9.383100443500396
he walked slowly down the rue de la roquette   12.605681486351608
from general oliver cromwell said the new comer   11.50591993018521
i hope not madame replied de winter thoughtfully   5.585140359306284
de villefort i beseech your indulgence for him   17.97434533995191
to the smaller   12.953925074895224
an unexpected occurrence forces me to ask my wife to have a little conversation with me   11.972140935145434
i will look at it again   14.714043550546071
the cardinal exaggerated as i perceive   19.460993545787204
ali bring me some water   15.603266874181442
grumbled the cardinal   8.170519461242545
what must i do to attain such sublimity   8.84466980155511
well will you try and overtake him   13.479634503263362
do the same   9.786011794951808
we may say that he is not equal to his mother when we put foot in france if we are not poisoned or killed before then   14.267876065237848
she ran to the table emptied into mme   14.06435347415986
anne of austria returned to her oratory furious   12.315844360578394
if i am killed well then mother you can also die and there will be an end of our misfortunes   17.02771055140181
and you are disposed to serve the cause of the people   8.132397548499227
and the cards i ordered to be engraved as soon as you knew the number of the house   11.806117853522741
go said valentine whatever happens i promise you not to fear   11.204746039689553
it is he then   12.440375381957685
that having a house to purchase you purchase it exactly at auteuil and that purchasing it at auteuil this house should be no   10.47773670456514
there we may learn that as credit sinks the body becomes a corpse and this is what must happen very soon to the banker who is proud to own so good a logician as you for his daughter   11.104237165079892
danglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that overwhelmed dantès   12.148812538310631
ah i m ready to do what you will cried porthos   9.958125057487322
said d artagnan i see that although we have had the honor of traveling in your company you do not know us   11.600920971092227
he had on his estates the rights of high and low tribunals   11.218684118661765
tis not good to be about just here without a light   15.875248629251411
say rather crime   11.04568895826959
we must speculate upon the faults of people and not upon their virtues   10.672122616723422
and you were deceived my dear sir replied aramis coldly very little sensible to the reparation   10.688954132281802
the two notaries looked at each other in mute astonishment and inquiry as to what were the real intentions of the testator   14.789697321841665
the strangers were indeed no other than the count and haydée   12.639314962555602
now do you understand   15.977321786689961
sirs accept my thanks for your politeness said the young man retreating   11.566088571511337
but keep it and we shall be quits   12.194633904067661
under the cuirass the hump will not be seen   10.279831096491549
the duke was obliged to make as many efforts to awake as he had done to go to sleep   14.414306436020107
but the daring of these four fencers appeared to him the strongest he had ever heard of even in gascony   6.85863237812358
de tréville being there to claim them   13.18748974521493
one day he had the imprudence to recall himself to the memory of the cardinal   13.477795961542942
we have not sought to scandalize   6.3475277969127015
deeply engaged with a sort of inward contemplation valentine had ceased for a moment to join in the conversation   13.672672614388974
monsieur bertuccio meanwhile the count had arrived at his house   10.621369711197646
well said aramis what think you about these two enemies whom it requires besides comminges s troop ten good soldiers to confront   12.495028034101647
no replied d artagnan piqued and thanks to my eyes i can see what other people can not see   8.624785664135114
reunited   14.56579258474019
we will therefore leave the two friends who had nothing important to say to each other and follow aramis   8.084423163624322
with women perhaps   7.583035763564813
come now said the duke give some particulars of the plan for our escape   13.524085489856958
apoplexy is a rare disease among fowls i believe but very common among men   10.165093527041428
it was not you who introduced me into the world and had me invited to a certain dinner at auteuil which i fancy i am eating at this moment in company with the most distinguished people in paris amongst the rest with a certain procureur whose acquaintance i did very wrong not to cultivate for he would have been very useful to me just now   13.810879553087332
on the contrary replied the count did you not hear her declare that we were friends   14.256775595216736
oh my dear viscount do talk reason   13.477913388735665
are you displeased with me   12.874823931264455
chapter vii   10.184525789528742
and follow me wherever i go   12.655149421544072
but the king took advantage of the privilege he had of leaving his lady to advance eagerly toward the queen   7.479038072661485
athos cast a glance at his feet hands and hair those three marks of race   11.936467669993618
grimaud is it thou   9.328783671134275
it was a sensation in which pleasure and pain were strangely mingled   10.710302930348979
therefore in spite of all my protestations if it be as i suspect my cunning gossip will assure me that he holds his eminence in horror   12.489302408573318
they positively refused   13.18395774592346
bonacieux became as pale as death and grinned a ghastly smile   10.609020612232046
we shall meet again shall we not monsieur   8.280118393178762
your case is not an ordinary one   8.137482563311455
the carriage started at a measured pace without betraying by the slightest sign that it contained people in a hurry   16.41940437185114
what i think of is that we have crossed swords as enemies   13.153874359733434
i know no one but myself who is acquainted with the noble art of venery   7.028526357980027
why did he detain her   12.419711031369433
i will answer for that   13.336075401291001
the only thing i could not conquer was a strange trembling in my knees   13.859700288581722
everything is relative my dear young friend from the king who stands in the way of his successor to the employee who keeps his rival out of a place   9.428651840747383
is then all that i have heard really true   14.471920989851073
come and i will explain to you   9.407326295301907
this is what i shall do   10.396173488817826
i will tell you all replied anne   7.784902429912915
at what hour did he leave your hôtel   7.9456722567085425
that however does not hinder me from being entirely devoted to his service as i am to that of your majesty   13.036832136834418
there are special reports on every prisoner   12.089977302540092
the ass   12.664137772856266
at first the king answered that he would not go   10.876895052023414
but although the jeweler had been mentioned first it was the secretary who first made his appearance   10.953239008598151
with that word great things are done   14.735691514113054
you believe and still you are an accomplice of that child of belial who is called lord de winter   10.697584922806305
that will amuse you   11.207897264313598
egad didn t you hear   12.468122368017442
each stroke of the oar seemed to awaken a new throng of ideas which sprang up with the flying spray of the sea   5.5139241974714
and who told you this fine story sire   12.562815345976475
the deliverance of the cardinal perhaps   16.681270289607177
he bestowed the same attention upon the cambric front of a shirt which had considerably changed in color since his entrance into the prison and he polished his varnished boots with the corner of a handkerchief embroidered with initials surmounted by a coronet   11.031643426361205
we have promised and we will keep our promise   8.902564806106547
absorbed all the smaller stars of his court in his own vast radiance   6.372448864203745
as you please sir said caderousse who anxious not to lose the present opportunity of finding a customer for one of the few bottles of cahors still remaining in his possession hastily raised a trap door in the floor of the apartment they were in which served both as parlor and kitchen   12.112030400769724
d artagnan was profuse in gallant speeches and protestations of devotion   14.916716232054604
caderousse wrote the address   10.358556515817039
dantès did not answer   10.427446244334952
i had no hope of getting off so easily   11.869462070547526
d artagnan shrugged his shoulders and they proceeded   11.248149771698694
this was the plan which had appealed to him to afford the best chance of his security   8.339628059649943
drawing his sword and preparing to attack the new foe   14.912355837495214
yet like providence it has remained invisible to my eyes although present to my heart   7.069903130418021
what will that cost you my dear monsieur mordaunt   10.284202878448152
and you what are you doing here   13.082910817394175
cried dantès in a paroxysm of delight   9.775397098843069
d artagnan felt he had allowed himself to be carried away and that he had committed an error   8.266866726596835
i should like to have seen the count take something in my house if only an ice   10.663476026515927
he had his musketeers therefore as louis xiii   11.980230602014704
but instead of breaking it he might have used it to still more advantage   12.777947270944244
said the host aside   3.933862159623118
louis made a gesture of indescribable anger and alarm and then drew himself up as if this sudden blow had struck him at the same moment in heart and countenance   7.465455966378087
there is the prince de condé the hero of rocroy   9.723963254141237
but you know him m   12.751482220468192
certainly directly the curtain falls on the stage   15.101634786512683
what you are ignorant of lord de winter s designs upon me   10.147823701525315
cried d artagnan more moved than he had been for a long time don t despair my friend if you have not received any letters from the count we have received one   12.497538442823728
a magnificent peach was hanging against an adjoining wall ripened by the same artificial heat   11.0358886606587
no in truth you are no visionary my dear friend and now i think of it you yes i faith you re right those delicate yet firm set lips those eyes which seem always at the command of the intellect and never of the heart   12.626899218845182
but excellency said pastrini still striving to gain his point   8.556436624917255
god is speaking to your heart and your heart speaks to you   11.702636332108533
projectiles continued to hail down from the windows and some shots were heard the echo of which though they were probably fired in the air made all hearts vibrate   14.536051586415951
0349m to get your secret without paying for it you blockhead   10.021513094500667
why didst thou take it   10.933978066597534
if the king was still irritated against them they would depart without being seen   16.854140355283217
some place it on mount ararat others between the rivers tigris and euphrates   14.698692778222945
ah your excellency murmured the pilot you should not have done so   7.680037795101148
in that case it would be quite another thing   12.099205168570565
they were heartrending   14.446714742363834
look at the writing and find if you can any blemish in the language or orthography   7.0563214983633005
follow the culprit s steps   10.427502347283566
said albert in a low tone to monte cristo   7.690883910547947
my lord let us come to terms   12.048159368107306
milady uttered a cry of joy   8.457963604561176
interrupted porthos one of whose faults was a great looseness of tongue   9.56460716521802
generous girl   10.989217602034678
yes if you have nothing more to say to me   10.052858941701514
where are you taking me   13.83486125191344
look at my hat and cloak   12.569084958065995
but i shall not be allowed to go   8.778301368558537
done for twenty replied groslow   7.721668780718495
you assert a great deal said mazarin   6.482612135897337
and i consider it impious to attempt that which the almighty evidently does not approve   8.371600826697076
at one of the extremities of the camp near an immense tent in which the scottish officers were holding a kind of council presided over by lord leven their commander a man attired as a cavalier lay sleeping on the turf his right hand extended over his sword   9.538211778978862
a moment s silence ensued and then in a full sonorous voice the king exclaimed remember   11.538753656019033
the porter got up as eugénie expected and even advanced some steps to recognize the person who was going out but seeing a young man striking his boot impatiently with his riding whip he opened it immediately   11.199824832189751
i understand replied fernand you can endure your own wretchedness patiently but you are afraid to share mine   15.399870734945889
you will remember those two vows will you not   15.376953427536627
only as they went out aramis placed his hand upon the arm of d artagnan and looking at him earnestly you have not spoken of this lady   7.548266261308353
her secret had each time been repressed when she was about to reveal it by the sad conviction that it would be useless to do so   11.439656483407777
but believe me when i say that imperative necessity has imposed the painful task upon me   12.045979307645299
villefort started madame de villefort let her son slip from her knees valentine rose pale and dumb as a statue   8.23907175047183
i spurred on and found myself in the enemy s ranks   12.359297920382826
the third proceeded to barricade the doors and windows then returned and the three united in stifling the cries of terror incited by the sight of these preparations and then dragged assunta feet foremost towards the brazier expecting to wring from her an avowal of where her supposed treasure was secreted   15.534281175696158
well then he deputes me to give you this   14.525052632952619
and this very morning the surgeon declared that if monsieur porthos did not pay him he should look to me as it was i who had sent for him   14.643126748386388
simpleton   10.77074300645649
and the more respectable your fist is porthos the less attractive it is   13.574434989453227
i fire first   13.129665526707608
queen elizabeth and catherine ii   9.4583643210993
not to arouse suspicions gentlemen said he go your way and i will go mine and this evening at nine o clock we will assemble again at the gate saint denis   11.793432076538524
the day came at length and was almost as feverish as the night had been but it brought reason to the aid of imagination and dantès was then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in his brain   20.071396425519147
but our gascon cadet was as may have been observed of a provident and almost avaricious character and with that explain the contradiction so vain as almost to rival porthos   12.508828321240951
and hostilities with la rochelle had commenced two or three days before about a fort which the duc d angoulême had caused to be constructed near the city   10.050010106766115
bonacieux was acquainted with all the turnings and windings of this part of the louvre appropriated for the people of the household   11.283159613508488
there was therefore nothing for them to do but to follow the prudent advice of monsieur d arminges and beat a retreat   5.699158036500949
on his return home the coadjutor was informed that a young man had come in after his departure and was waiting for him   10.504507582650023
you promised me take my arm madame said the stranger and let us continue our way   10.628966452169065
why this is the way of it said the minister with the gravest air in the world napoleon lately had a review and as two or three of his old veterans expressed a desire to return to france he gave them their dismissal and exhorted them to serve the good king   13.41963961163807
the cardinal however contemptible might be the triumph gained over so vulgar a being as bonacieux did not the less enjoy it for an instant   12.310296529323717
come come dearest valentine confess that what i say is true lest i be tempted to call you unjust   14.027204621832913
he bounded like a chamois cocking his carbine as he went and in a moment reached the summit of a hill opposite to that on which he had perceived the traveller   11.398801247429594
d artagnan however gathered from his equivocal replies that the road to the right was the one he ought to take and on that uncertain information he resumed his journey   18.867155693863502
but it must be also said that the very name of milady paralyzed him   6.411237859906373
i encircled the castle   9.402352919998378
well you gave him the two hundred francs i had left for him   10.135722910216339
beware of what you do   13.763053812048234
that is with a bow and our debts of honor paid   13.830824164336873
let that day come sooner or later your excellency will find me what i have found you in this my heavy trouble   13.403343377265799
and now take this   13.631377082497034
tell me for the hundredth time that you refuse my love which had your mother s sanction   10.241919465576423
now a barber would only be surprised if a man gifted with such advantages should consent voluntarily to deprive himself of them   10.58369175818122
the eight oars fell at once into the sea making but a single sound giving but a single stroke and the boat seemed to fly over the surface of the water   17.561162126526735
thank you count thank you said the young man evidently embarrassed how to begin the conversation   10.212812422076016
debray s name is mixed up in this affair   9.33151106812164
for the sake of being a count   14.86469976002449
on the contrary i do   14.517412711037506
and he has no children with all these titles   16.797668914622307
for in three years madame i have only seen you four times the first which i have described to you   13.209403292858166
the horses went like the wind and in a few minutes they were at the gates of london   4.8883156810251664
how should i know who they are   9.964713159527387
oh dear yes sir   10.71357448481255
i had but to write to the duchesse but i won t repeat her name for i am incapable of compromising a woman   9.238074825981197
he was an italian and therefore superstitious   12.260036003925645
at this the delight of the mother was almost frantic   9.81146260197584
mercédès smiled sadly   3.6505268376077655
he was informed of it by a letter written to him by the abductor himself   12.075398883352007
you are right athos said d artagnan   8.183381311495658
but he did not come   16.4316327458248
he merely repeated his phrase i will go and he went   9.775696776949273
yes no   9.788958561492015
i could see nothing but a gray beard under the fringe of the mask   16.206911827498462
after giving some directions to ali who stood in the lobby the count took albert s arm   5.256354384807809
my friend aramis paused   15.333730112576152
he reflected for a second and then descended the stairs   15.842645824999396
cried the young man   13.41228160375589
and i reply to you sir that this abuse of power this exile under a fictitious name are infamous   10.855877553902614
there isn t a morsel of bread in the house   11.915285444738663
but soon a ray of light which penetrated through the chamber together with the warm and perfumed air which reached him from the same aperture the conversation of two of three ladies in language at once respectful and refined and the word majesty several times repeated indicated clearly that he was in a closet attached to the queen s apartment   16.638190471764485
the next day the prisoner s room was full of pictures and mottoes   8.732528600321949
but i soon found out that he was betraying me   15.018121264826025
in order that his wounds might be examined he was undressed and his clothes were thrown into a corner where the police picked them up with the exception of the waistcoat which they overlooked   8.34078764435079
bonacieux recovered her senses   10.027909732788306
it was a temporary indisposition   7.129169883286515
then the carbineers scoured the country in different directions but in vain   10.203589496410622
i never saw one with such a hide in my life   10.444349283683273
on the contrary albert turned frightfully pale   9.858796168921732
madame danglars rose from her seat pale and cold   15.238456792233428
de saint méran s   16.48966149681507
did you ever remark that   9.996337523866513
well it is just for that reason that we have called you my good m   14.856987650044854
what has the count done   12.057507202509157
but porthos urged the commands of duty and the procurator s wife was obliged to give place to the king   12.690967483927594
of ali pasha and the beautiful vasiliki   15.840706814006614
he was a most lovely child with large blue eyes of that deep color that harmonizes so well with the blond complexion   10.821354181093021
no i have not asked you that said aramis with his subtle manner   14.495476320119755
if mercédès in short no longer resembles her former self in her features you will see that her heart is still the same   10.741616093467616
franz took the letter and read tuesday evening at seven o clock descend from your carriage opposite the via dei pontefici and follow the roman peasant who snatches your torch from you   12.860771487408705
nature subdued must yield in the combat the dream must succeed to reality and then the dream reigns supreme then the dream becomes life and life becomes the dream   10.542480004522027
but first said morrel allow me sir to tell you who i am how much i love mademoiselle valentine and what are my designs respecting her   10.49900127445996
dantès wanted but little of being utterly mad   5.107011526395839
monsieur and madame de saint méran died as soon   14.327229843101478
that would carry you to the end of the world   13.883642523370835
how is it sir that you are acquainted with this man   15.468554231032389
bring six of them   16.91343060701077
and she resolved to make that very evening some attempts to ascertain the nature of the ground she had to work upon by studying the characters of the men to whose guardianship she was committed   10.425973043169748
that the thing was impossible seeing that you were not at home as he could see   12.68603011631112
paris is a horrible place in summer   9.288134674952705
my mother experienced the same sensations for i felt her tremble   8.955401496738798
cucumetto had violated thy daughter said the bandit   10.672632951257649
porthos lived in an apartment large in size and of very sumptuous appearance in the rue du vieux colombier   11.513960023913327
the guests now all took leave of athos excepting the old duc de barbe who as an old friend of the family of la valliere went to see little louise and offered to take her to blois in his carriage   15.231097934030783
she had not long to wait   12.828442046262284
but d artagnan well suspected that that which was deferred was not relinquished   14.894786328838045
planchet grimaud mousqueton and bazin set off at full speed   13.380146170275477
true said noirtier looking carelessly around him true if this person were not on his guard as he is   13.722846402263475
his head with piercing eyes a straight nose a chin cut like that of brutus had altogether an indefinable character of grandeur and grace   8.158000083012208
i countenance nothing that is marvellous m   13.309802222748592
de monte cristo arrived   8.23960941511713
i used not to do so but i really feel now almost obliged to have faith in them   9.840830504302357
that s true said athos and he rang the bell   8.375160584250246
replied grimaud   11.089837817727453
it was necessary to find some neutral ground on which an exchange could be made and then to try and land these goods on the coast of france   14.845175264383885
but in fifteen days as you know or as you do not know this fatal campaign is to open   15.275023781135562
i acknowledge it affected me and indeed all the committee also said beauchamp   8.371873092618191
at the expiration of ten minutes felton came   13.790121050618092
if the lemonade be pure and inoffensive the syrup will retain its color   11.32417384783174
probably you have some correspondent in greece   9.728372115057882
no false modesty   8.65902069003593
thus a new a stronger and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the realization of their hopes   18.47058597423109
shot my dear boy   7.825432922971853
and while he smiled as he attempted to regard the affair as a joke he felt his temples get moist with perspiration   8.270135027396307
he gained just twelve hours by this engagement   13.013402291516044
an excellent one said valentine   19.876469253081197
what s the dream   11.643629831965209
you dear mamma   6.124920311562374
ask planchet   11.894728360176853
that is his fault   13.106016459443518
true true   10.49333353978886
there was nothing else left for franz to do but to take up his hat open the door of the box and offer the countess his arm   15.052775016313717
it is god himself who sent us here   11.054801105876779
de tréville requested athos whatever might happen to be observant of his duty to the king but particularly to the queen begging him to convey his desires to his comrades   11.826685532583976
an awful sadness enveloped the heart of charles   9.729463905697681
then saluting the king and the cardinal the queen resumed her way to the chamber in which she had dressed and where she was to take off her costume   7.520988512819184
reflect athos   15.657673506005926
monsieur we think of what we can and not of what we will   8.480599800740327
in prison he had suffered his beard to grow   13.936632296478244
on my honor in one single throw   15.397442826854732
said the jeweller   6.705869414235069
and grandpapa   12.050578443986918
there he said throwing a louis down   11.740028007899653
it neither increased nor decreased my income   5.5876710331227715
oh when i said i was alone said milady hoping to make the novice talk by talking of herself it is not for want of friends in high places   12.919892159362995
i would place each of these heroes on his right pedestal that of robespierre on his scaffold in the place louis quinze   10.662600749067433
it is written in the good book said monte cristo that the sins of the fathers shall fall upon their children to the third and fourth generation   14.57353219674254
alas it is unhappily but too true   18.33699568725049
it is you tréville   11.94841656970967
that idiot bazin had the folly to make himself verger as you know and therefore can not leave notre dame   10.680514241542607
in eight days the campaign would open and he would be compelled to leave paris   12.884367963915945
50117m these last consisted of all the young people whom valentine s death had struck like a thunderbolt and who notwithstanding the raw chilliness of the season could not refrain from paying a last tribute to the memory of the beautiful chaste and adorable girl thus cut off in the flower of her youth   12.956315953680903
when he opened his eyes dantès found himself on the deck of the tartan   8.193491626035588
and when a man like him comes to another recalls to him his plighted word and this man fails to redeem the pledge he has at least a right to exact from him a good reason for so doing   11.611938601892255
no said monte cristo folding the five notes most decidedly not   11.949852695873117
and as a commencement they were to sup together   17.58397288424972
i used to learn all these feat by heart yonder down at pierrefonds and i have done all that he did except breaking a cord by the corrugation of my temples   13.617972494786065
the king is surrounded by an army which is conducting him to london   9.475506132850164
de winter turned and followed the direction of aramis s finger   15.091260270138328
i tell you that the dose has been double the poison changed and that this time it has succeeded   11.567435006375524
i shall be one someday   8.180364452607114
yes this self of whom i thought so much of whom i was so proud who had appeared so worthless in the dungeons of the château d if and whom i had succeeded in making so great will be but a lump of clay tomorrow   12.546182416046841
two well trained servingmen were in attendance on the company   12.02068761952724
i do not understand you sir said the baroness trying to disguise the agitation of her voice and the flush of her face   11.283731447227488
ah monsieur le chevalier said planchet bowing   12.15734913960785
the clouds which m   11.513596071389685
sir we don t keep any was the reply of the people who opened the doors   16.697142974078734
they had grown together like two trees whose roots are mingled whose branches intertwined and whose intermingled perfume rises to the heavens   9.88361560117401
i will answer for everything   8.471595565510345
but how did it happen that such a great princess became a slave   14.466919372257184
what was the matter with you baron   12.04111892079131
cried the baroness shivering with anger and impatience   8.14929980867823
and we are going to his house   16.334002727864817
the coast owing to the gascon s stratagem was clear   12.170717138606275
thin pale with light blue eyes and tawny flaxen hair   13.246000827959223
the count smiled   10.259154249081888
what will you do with him madame   13.581803174251224
50191m the carriage stopped at the door of the house   8.824907803041222
there were two means of gaining his object to search him on the spot or to carry him away making a buckler of his body and search him in the trench   14.283654370536093
at ten steps from the place where they halted was a young man in black who seemed waiting for some one and who from the moment he saw them enter the town never took his eyes off them   15.070016729479072
oh i remember said d artagnan   8.513492807018672
am i mistaken then   14.689172236753944
la ramee adored his wife and children whom now he could only catch a glimpse of from the top of the wall when in order to please him they used to walk on the opposite side of the moat   11.967747458036301
well well monsieur de villequier mazarin interposed i shall make it my care the king hears of your loyalty   16.90354650174638
cried caderousse rising and drawing up in a heap the gold and notes scattered over the table and which he covered with his two hands   9.66195741373297
replied villefort looking at his father with astonishment you really do seem very well informed   12.801310101190271
0259m yes sir   13.777127518628758
but notwithstanding his earnest wish he was delayed by the dissensions which broke out between mm   14.884179860592177
sire buckingham has been in paris five days and only left this morning   12.921643549124726
well if you die said she bequeath your fortune to others for if you die i shall require nothing   15.97410259243932
you have indeed repaid me munificently for my services   9.269879209476136
the second is that you will not tell her that your father ever served hers   13.26031041525279
he accepted the offer without enthusiasm and without regret as one of those conventions of society which every gentleman looks upon as a duty   11.818039096361492
it is not my intention here to enter into an analysis of this curious work   13.367697177196929
raoul conquered the very natural feeling of timidity he experienced and approaching the prince my lord he said will you permit me to hazard a few words on that subject which will perhaps relieve you of your uncertainty   10.136893825735257
and i frequently make use of it with all possible prudence though be it observed he added with a smile of intelligence   14.986896828928781
he also morrel like you considered himself the unhappiest of men   13.255266642270662
my pride is to see the accused pale agitated and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire of my eloquence   14.369228163320159
coquenard and bade him farewell   16.79978239162343
our athos who was as virtuous as scipio   11.475467825101077
follow him said athos   11.20369199782748
i believed it later   10.557748413415219
my dear host and you signora said albert in italian excuse my apparent stupidity   9.3603239817149
the baroness approached leaning on madame de villefort s arm   12.94680218391379
he thought several times of the project the count had of visiting paris   13.46066901091902
with repressed smile come in baron and tell the duke all you know the latest news of m   9.354609617701854
his lieutenant   15.30106224204739
and others went to the police office to inquire if he had taken out a passport   16.731347432337294
but the queen is sacred and if anyone speaks of her let it be respectfully   7.6192242918642386
and by the rapid glance that the young man s eyes shot forth villefort saw how much energy lay hid beneath this mildness   11.078353862275986
d artagnan saw from the expression of the queen s face that she was about to issue some violent command   12.029989539963882
but i fear that you will be much disappointed accustomed as you are to picturesque events and fantastic horizons   10.359714420078621
mazarin perceiving by the paleness and agitation of the messenger that he had something of importance to say made a sign that d artagnan and porthos should give place   13.772691112230651
i should say you could   15.936859780501726
this tension lessens the accuracy of the aim   12.618383240723158
in the meantime please to sit down monsieur and i will fetch you some refreshment   10.45199223268716
to nobody in the world   12.383315298030661
and the self satisfied gascon was convinced that sooner or later she could not fail to respond   11.453759666853296
get out of the carriage if you can and make another draw up   11.915035123213235
certainly said danglars in the most natural tone in the world   15.083774136046017
then we must fly   16.10215154010413
lord de winter and the three musketeers looked at one another inquiringly   13.357567314543846
i depend upon your word   4.698210177416177
doctor pray recall your words   8.327099801063138
the boat glided along the ferry rope under the shadow of a pale cloud which hung over the water at that moment   10.095428983011363
shall i give these papers to m   7.803126308140624
it was you who had madame bonacieux carried off   7.399377894892093
soon the two gentlemen stopped also   10.912354148303779
the mendicant uttered these words in a tone of such humility such earnest repentance that gondy placed his hand upon him and gave him his benediction with all the unction of which he was capable   11.514539279339719
what is your pleasure   6.044114485337133
is it more serious than going to m   14.808421470768131
oh doctor what a dreadful word is that   17.21476783876814
she therefore confined herself to a prudent middle course   12.154971475765505
and in order to avoid fruitless toil he sounded all the other walls with his pickaxe struck the earth with the butt of his gun and finding nothing that appeared suspicious returned to that part of the wall whence issued the consoling sound he had before heard   13.631394218635894
the englishman turned down his shirt collar and showed a scar whose redness proved it to be a recent one   7.3602704706983255
she has near her a certain laporte   9.294608403001966
from you i have nothing to conceal   17.131431984065316
and i really don t know what prevents me from exterminating you all   21.805171155463114
ah if i knew   10.518543246420862
as for me i am sure of it said the duke   10.927109144377715
but you said i think that i had nothing else to do   9.930107501485132
death is about to return to the tomb the phantom to retire in darkness   10.506825811851595
i wish my lord would make me one promise   12.751444630557245
i claim then the right to choose my opponent   13.90885787815777
yes he said there have been some who have suffered more than i have but then they must have been martyrs at least   12.224772593886554
by this arrangement d artagnan could nudge porthos with his knee and make signs with his eyes to athos and aramis   7.998553923077351
he is quite aware that there are two gentlemen who greatly aided the escape of monsieur de beaufort and he has instigated an active search for them i can answer for it   8.142129169852625
then during the day tell rosa that when i leave the opera i will sup with her as she wishes   7.230719868468974
you have sent for me sir said athos to m   18.119435833977672
eight days had been occupied in preparations at the hôtel de ville for this important evening   15.549544637015513
the old man s eyes passed rapidly from villefort and his wife and rested on valentine with a look of unutterable fondness   14.494602343707417
have they not heard that of their colonel   13.150714349075873
and that father is well caderousse it is monte cristo   9.146814173037013
fix your own hour for tomorrow and my cashier shall call on you with a check for eighty thousand francs   9.173000983585323
very good replied albert   12.731755544485862
monsieur du vallon that worthy gentleman for with the exception of yourself monsieur d artagnan there s not a man in france that i esteem and love so much as him then my lord replied d artagnan pointing to the purse which mazarin still held if you love and esteem him so much you understand me   5.585371718850762
monsieur de busigny said athos will you be so kind as to set your watch with mine or permit me to regulate mine by yours   7.0921874988591105
so far so good laughed athos   10.97619350513871
milady passed her two arms round felton s neck and let herself slip out of the window   13.461323661409029
i ask your excellencies pardon but this is quite a french demand   7.563610053560643
still one place where the grass was thin attracted my attention   10.151003257674507
the president stopped the coach   15.126049642335293
everything goes on smoothly so certainly dear friend i shall not meddle in politics   14.116245554120336
he cast himself on his knees seized the hand and touched it respectfully with his lips   11.00356680192493
is included in this sum   10.510277940704626
if algiers were good for nothing but to furnish the means of carrying so admirable an idea into practice it would be an acquisition well worthy of struggling to obtain   10.400906835992272
repudiated by her husband said athos   10.21689851740856
he could not recognize himself   19.374983492783944
cried bonacieux follow you at this hour   13.197713619906347
my dear viscount how have you discovered that i did not like m   2.409679655435525
nevertheless said athos in your absence well in my absence haven t i put in my place grimaud and the scotchman   14.074262617984843
and there is nothing i would not do to prove to monsieur that i am attached to him   14.20400989510523
but one gets out of prison said caderousse who with what sense was left him listened eagerly to the conversation and when one gets out and one s name is edmond dantès one seeks revenge what matters that   15.717667011204151
in the midst of the disasters that befell the house cocles was the only one unmoved   11.416994859409336
cried porthos here   9.007458591829142
really returned the count relate it to me for it begins to interest me   14.045179135866988
ah sir you have given me confidence   10.571056020419734
for instance having tried every other remedy to restore movement and speech to m   8.680835437126792
very well said albert extending his hand   6.426046113528557
danglars i ask you only how your engagement stands   7.238323189555509
do you recollect that ball count where you produced such an effect   10.00505949293765
the arguments and his audacity perfectly stupefied me   10.361115425751745
i was shouting down with mazarin   9.447304094052763
this yacht had been built by order of an englishman who having heard that the genoese excelled all other builders along the shores of the mediterranean in the construction of fast sailing vessels was desirous of possessing a specimen of their skill   16.25244023470882
sir said the cardinal you have heard me   8.094725000396927
the servant returned with a message to say that though the duchess had not the honor of knowing monsieur de la fere she would receive him   12.261613379204928
i have never accomplished anything alone said d artagnan shaking his head   14.470890109702811
he then with noiseless haste took out the horse that he had ridden on the previous evening saddled and bridled it himself and led the animal into the alley to the right of the kitchen garden opened a side door which conducted him to a bridle road shut it after him and d artagnan saw him pass by like a dart bending as he went beneath the pendent flowery branches of maple and acacia   11.213858092749597
beneath these windows a wooden balcony extended the entire length of the house   15.660213669686016
it was the kiosk to which we were going   15.233452670773472
and i who have answered for him to the queen i who have promised my poor mistress ah my god my god   8.383979471378815
during the six weeks that athos and aramis had been absent from france the parisians finding themselves one morning without either queen or king were greatly annoyed at being thus deserted and the absence of mazarin a thing so long desired did not compensate for that of the two august fugitives   7.634739141443467
six hours after he left pierrefonds he was at saint germain   13.463855905295535
what do you think of the count   17.343900019364742
the duke meant to say affection   12.491789633007846
villefort s brow darkened more and more his white lips and clenched teeth filled dantès with apprehension   17.773548646858313
really have you had a vision of the seven fat kine and the seven lean kine   12.137532097353693
what you count   12.169584299718458
then he turned again to the clock counting time now not by minutes but by seconds   15.276815723612577
asked the beadle   12.818840388692662
noirtier looked at the dictionary   10.824591460513759
threats   11.161197986804224
she treats her children ill but she always welcomes strangers   10.615761101896904
de comminges and desire him to shut himself up with his men in the guardhouse and in the stables   6.925038173783214
and is it possible that this frightful combination of crimes has been invented by a woman   14.159631778871976
try aramis to keep near the king   5.277689093153645
one believes readily what he wishes to believe   12.906777730296673
the beauty alone remained   4.235053862732549
porthos nodded in sign of agreement   10.103964302147613
i take them then said the lieutenant   17.16269195315879
mazarin thinking that it would be the means of increasing the zeal of his two defenders if he procured them personal thanks from the queen motioned them to follow him   18.19186662494529
there are men somewhere about but that s of no consequence to us said d artagnan   7.012272693316764
he could read no other expression on their features   13.61519010842041
have you any one to depend on for assistance   12.690580909962947
that seems to me as hazardous as uncertain and convinces me that my scheme is far better than yours   13.942955512572766
but he had no sooner landed than he heard a noise of horses galloping upon the paved road   13.980077808880097
the curtain was drawn and yet the image of his father was so vivid to his mind that he addressed the closed window as though it had been open and as if through the opening he had beheld the menacing old man   11.290839055066296
paris for two hours past had been dark and seemed a desert   18.561918019362643
a coffer of which he had so often heard and which the hands a little wrinkled it is true but still not without elegance of the procurator s wife were about to open to his admiring looks   13.108094870371923
come said monte cristo touching his shoulder with his finger are you a man again maximilian   9.875273874791898
de tréville who could not fail to think the manner in which d artagnan had left him a little cavalier   9.304089426648293
the contract shall not be signed   19.647581427883146
have you my dear aramis thought sometimes of those happy happy happy days of youth we passed laughing drinking and fighting each other for play   13.097444635021553
here is de winter coming said athos   10.511169399590027
since he could not be a bayard he would become a raphael or a michael angelo   10.360905252172154
said mercédès blushing as rapidly as she had turned pale and again becoming paler than ever   11.61501476801629
the young man cast himself on his knees leaning his head against the old man s bed   13.118420052030396
well that s all very sensible athos said d artagnan   13.159347149983333
exclaimed porthos looking at the gascon with the most profound admiration   14.833713422011256
what a cold wind   14.425695541771603
he went to desire you to come to the palace   13.409237108795354
but not for me who have grown pale over them by many nights study and have reconstructed every phrase completed every thought   12.578065375312148
that happened which m   14.639533823593327
we don t want either rope ladders or gag pears now   10.55602333890384
cried felton in a high state of excitement   10.743633690965492
it is 40 000 francs which i now owe you said monte cristo   9.082249360180707
has such and such a perfume done anything for me   16.551655901106855
philosophy can not be taught   8.93503746729934
look at your brother monarch charles i   13.299681575783959
i believe then that it is not on account of any intrigues of her own that my wife has been arrested but because of those of a lady much greater than herself   10.546560612126875
i take pleasure in saying that you have served me faithfully bertuccio   11.537775167350379
alas sire it is but too true   9.135653301506776
but since monseigneur permits me to speak freely d artagnan paused   10.416623772970524
is there any drinkable wine in your tavern   16.297939299789462
you are active vigorous and you have arms   12.28924809986438
morcerf alone knew not why such profound attention was given to an orator who was not always listened to with so much complacency   8.33957831712261
peace be to him   7.9421942473825125
that s not needed   12.98469379718647
noirtier continued to look at the same object but suddenly his glance was transferred from the wife to the husband and villefort himself had to submit to the searching investigation of eyes which while changing their direction and even their language had lost none of their menacing expression   5.530458243652619
and it was a fierce one   14.029260242909043
at last the heavy machine which was called a chariot in those days came out rumbling against the gates and de winter still on horseback bent again to the door to converse with her majesty   10.294057111556526
de tréville loved incense as well as a king or even a cardinal   11.25385608830965
from the notary m   10.079981324902157
poor fellow what is it   9.50500148103879
free without my aid   12.155572294617505
oh what larks   7.219653268616903
would you like to have a physician called   7.962612494622157
when the grave was formed the father embraced her first and then the lover   10.153191549748215
morrel sighed deeply and passed his hand over his forehead which was covered with perspiration   5.425714245673433
after making the tour of the garden a second time the count re entered his carriage while bertuccio who perceived the thoughtful expression of his master s features took his seat beside the driver without uttering a word   11.366485959281166
four strokes of the oar brought them to land   11.642705283736781
said athos turning on d artagnan a searching look   12.794591152933586
exclaimed d artagnan to the two friends you may well wish ill to mazarin   8.884283720769243
now that i am a captain in the royal musketeers i must make an appearance   10.376591648673474
he is advancing as rapidly as his own eagles   12.630631752700218
but to you at least m   13.848147027282405
they have been all hired this fortnight and there are none left but those absolutely requisite for posting   8.151926243063492
still i will go   8.848051722572094
asked mazarin trembling   13.876707514761128
the musketeer signified by a nod that these commands should be obeyed to the letter and d artagnan went out followed by bernouin   12.394579492977456
so now i have told my secret   13.241912963973938
when i am your wife   10.80791366081787
in brief i regained your harness and then mine   12.285327644533194
a sailor was rubbing his limbs with a woollen cloth   13.707437422227386
you are sure there is nobody there   13.979268900982843
the young man s eyes were red and he seemed dejected   10.469520549108331
milady was then able to judge of the effect she had produced   13.130170051145182
when felton had seen her recover with the veil of chastity those treasures of love which were only concealed from him to make him desire them the more ardently he said ah now   9.329271866906657
bread   14.370081418261254
queen destined as you are to endure every sorrow on this earth hear the result of our unhappy mission   9.892619791990072
ah yes he said i know them   9.879223015627552
and the chronicles of the time aver that her confidence was justified   10.227787487037705
valentine found her grandmother in bed   14.044978867255882
this way light us downstairs bernouin   14.301485150104346
i am waiting my lord till you tell me of what exploits you speak   5.002994589075489
this second attack was much more violent than the first and he had slipped from the couch to the ground where he was writhing in agony   8.419519044173148
at last the king appeared with the queen in a gilded chariot   14.251540601044287
young man said he to d artagnan a suggestion   12.918488958430006
my good friend said the man in the cloak excuse me for saying that you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant act   14.373328431030895
well let my god save me or let me perish for my god   9.354459513649868
for all that was done for our service   9.768062403236565
to surround the scaffold with twenty of my best men who at a signal from me will rush forward directly peppino is brought for execution and by the assistance of their stilettos drive back the guard and carry off the prisoner   14.641173745190738
the dinner can not have had time to get cold   11.572452957969537
had a real liking for tréville a royal liking a self interested liking it is true but still a liking   9.217922977458793
but before they could meet the vessel again changed her course   18.096514339396467
where can i sleep   12.901769661680913
if he be innocent of course he will be set at liberty   6.354155918820921
and hang me if i can guess where you took your notions of the other world from   6.788513845756301
mercédès was much changed within the last few days   11.333434390739603
the marquis rang a servant entered   14.90947282562271
it is something to be well received   13.953724830455831
and every day the cardinal under some pretext deferred fixing it   9.300607780341547
my dear athos you view things on the dark side methinks   10.799986132315356
never mind that   7.940626569368715
a year after madame   8.64624651478994
what means this   8.728556368711368
the latter made a sign and when the carriages had drawn close together said you are going to madame de morcerf s are you not   13.342343414999604
as he touched the ground he opened his eyes   10.398838860145991
you believe and yet you deliver me up to him who fills and defiles the world with his heresies and debaucheries to that infamous sardanapalus whom the blind call the duke of buckingham and whom believers name antichrist   14.452863685857151
gondy smiled the queen s color rose and mazarin grew even paler   10.674472169498928
did you ever see mercédès again   11.832678439046703
you must dress yourself raoul said athos i am going to present you to some one   10.392983429483573
bonacieux the respectable martyr of the political and amorous intrigues which entangled themselves so nicely together at this gallant and chivalric period   13.5510716334404
but she has become queen of paris ad interim and since she could not venture at once to establish herself in the palais royal or the tuileries she is installed at the hotel de ville where she is on the point of giving an heir or an heiress to that dear duke   10.957970199175682
d épinay will be frightened at this pecuniary loss   11.394398869554394
the two women looked at this person whose presence they had entirely forgotten and retired   15.336131270531215
i was born in no   8.02039014836358
however my mother had still some hope   14.686746277970116
may i hope sir said madame de villefort that your intentions accord with my request   10.12507663981566
i am not your uncle i know you not   10.63186927300719
what monk   10.708222754122676
do i not ali   7.002345834535189
you are of so superior a mind nothing escapes you   14.966411793524886
everything was conducted in the usual manner   9.294400102519546
the boat shot out of the harbor like a bird and the next morning franz disembarked at porto ferrajo   15.572252653267391
i have begged entreated implored   8.710814811367975
this is the way you keep your word as a sailor   15.620799669462592
ma foi i can hardly tell but i was alluding to those who wrote the letter   12.38384105317527
our purveyor   10.484841188102997
these two hundred thousand francs were the dowry of my daughter who was to be married in a fortnight and these two hundred thousand francs were payable half on the 15th of this month and the other half on the 15th of next month   14.86174057653395
sometimes as hamlet says foul deeds will rise though all the earth o erwhelm them to men s eyes   15.859460302614188
then i must wait here or in the neighborhood   14.682688801028661

peace with the landlord in addition to athos s old horse cost six pistoles   10.134281268070911
and he threw himself into the arms of athos   12.118285944540373
luigi took her arm beneath his own and led her to the door of the grotto   13.368768294147667
why you see he did not expect to see dantès return so suddenly he thought he was dead perhaps   10.283336734212094
oh feel for me who could offer millions to that poor woman but who return her only the piece of black bread forgotten under my poor roof since the day i was torn from her i loved   9.21736158469258
besides it does not seem very dangerous   19.3286108900119
you reject this means of information then   12.574142992419919
not in the least i beg you to believe   12.823023386010764
the count was asked what time he required to prepare his defence   12.562151731034957
he was a little proud perhaps for a man who like myself has risen from nothing   12.687882984393006
i m above that   12.446122178017783
the young officer bowed with easy and elegant politeness   15.07818535583096
these attempts did not prevent the cardinal to whom his most inveterate detractors have never denied personal bravery from making nocturnal excursions sometimes to communicate to the duc d angoulême important orders sometimes to confer with the king and sometimes to have an interview with a messenger whom he did not wish to see at home   8.501334768051173
a man in a mask   12.546743170009636
do you know saint mandrier   8.957358074633682
but such is man we always want something more than we already have   7.3781636794638334
the breakfast for these gentlemen is ready said the host   12.521384472703897
your protector had seen with pain this marriage of his elder brother with a portionless girl   9.55274475474194
and he had that lofty contempt for the populace which army officers usually profess   11.623483368612789
answered d artagnan i wish you joy of it   18.064061488657046
franz drew his handkerchief from his pocket and presented it to the man who had spoken to him   11.729547459941104
what is there we can do for you   19.63006219716305
you are free he said through me   9.708686351844651
d artagnan turned in the direction pointed to by athos and perceived aramis   12.51070819985452
said buckingham feebly streaming with blood and suppressing his agony to speak of her he loved what has she written to me   9.211895262912877
the sitting is adjourned gentlemen said the president   15.587885604935732
she must have confessed everything a woman is so weak   11.354564637507956
athos had passed through all the examinations we have seen bonacieux undergo   16.055605907782752
a woman who had been a reigning beauty a year before he was born could not be the subject of any scheme for him   6.902748095035706
ah said milady with a sigh if she loves she is not altogether wretched   10.213172695198278
cried the pit in chorus   13.01098896647635
and rochefort went away with one of those diabolical smiles which used formerly to make d artagnan shudder but d artagnan could now see it without alarm and smiling in his turn with an expression of melancholy which the recollections called up by that smile could perhaps alone give to his countenance he said go demon do what thou wilt   9.773440649108379
then said he write to yanina   9.48563391128381
aramis muttered to himself we shall hear nothing but the usual commonplace things   10.164569271447126
who would ever have thought it   12.409255444738426
yes said morrel smiling it was the 5th of september the anniversary of the day on which my father was miraculously preserved   19.26732561158061
there were landscapes by dupré with their long reeds and tall trees their lowing oxen and marvellous skies   8.781251432339841
the second visit was a long one and when he returned the kid was roasted and the repast ready   7.421172093676828
the result was that when the new comer left the hotel with the cicerone a man detached himself from the rest of the idlers and without having been seen by the traveller and appearing to excite no attention from the guide followed the stranger with as much skill as a parisian police agent would have used   9.224427608677734
the man who had the appearance of being a butcher descended a little steep and isolated street looking on to the river with two of his friends   7.265018887567684
but don t trouble yourself whence they come think only that one of the three is your property   12.24754230642884
and now for a broussel good god   9.495368178967679
but i can never escape said d artagnan with such enemies   12.729678079208085
said milady with a smile that belonged only to herself   14.314177233261674
the fact is i have found my father   9.152057438423043
they were the same statues rich in form in attraction and poesy with eyes of fascination smiles of love and bright and flowing hair   8.164333256068222
in prison sire   8.892138194515223
oh queen   11.592166067331657
the count followed her with his eyes   9.853799646498054
they said a quarter of an hour   12.25283888089189
to whom does this island belong   12.152295698352837
then the shots were repeated without regularity but always aimed with the same accuracy   4.833717156109358
penelon penelon   11.581874871528402
the villa of san felice took fire in the rooms adjoining the very apartment of the lovely carmela   12.564275574055614
herself   9.995236829617838
is it come yet   13.50887721747772
if you take one step farther d artagnan said he we shall cross swords together   8.618399148323807
felton barred his passage   10.05955610931596
said mercédès   13.923652032511216
i and a brother banker have obtained a grant of a railway the only industrial enterprise which in these days promises to make good the fabulous prospects that law once held out to the eternally deluded parisians in the fantastic mississippi scheme   4.008542597998403
am i allowed to repeat it   11.554761906442721
i he said   10.036986230311381
but it took me some time to bring up all the because you always think you have on your shoulders your beadle s robe and spend all your time reading your breviary   13.203591273890888
at what age did you leave greece signora   14.630081505366803
but monsieur said the count of morcerf for a man of your merit italy is not a country and france opens her arms to receive you   15.262619924474421
and since m   10.838232014677669
the lions den chapter 108   12.580747787838984
volume two 20009m 20011m 20019m chapter 28   11.805256516749731
d artagnan and porthos obeyed   13.702774050371996
it was now his turn to look about him   11.161125523395533
but you will not stop to have your wound dressed   15.077321624982158
he did not then think of the carnival for in spite of his condescension and touching kindness one can not incline one s self without awe before the venerable and noble old man called gregory xvi   14.70000028246594
the lower rooms were entirely filled with kourchid s troops   19.59686146183897
your majesty is bored   14.485938857268872
supposing that after having eaten the leather they eat the soles i can not see much that is left unless they eat one another   4.4590745816864
those costumes he said are of more worth than most of those which you will see on the backs of the queen s courtiers   12.963774198454823
really said albert i do not know   12.847679147998432
never mind we shall see   9.722522550225294
and then monsieur de chatillon will not come to the place royale to look for you   11.232256438259526
i have already enjoyed that treat when breakfasting with you said morcerf   9.580181930380853
after finishing this letter raoul felt more composed   11.867898421953583
count said the duchess upon my word you frighten me   9.439834337115059
no sir he is dead   9.450568697201161
and approaching the carriage he examined the arms on the panels and the livery of the coachman on his box   11.623941869069942
you can not understand the position we are in   12.99401517881265
on his part aramis wrote a long letter   12.847584138415382
and who is the man   13.070508951263747
but said albert breaking in upon his discourse never mind the past   15.781696691945992
after which his majesty grumbling entered his apartment   15.290584913050173
oh no no not yet he cried   8.837622464510748
he leaped towards a dressing room near his bedroom and in less than a moment tearing off his cravat his coat and waistcoat he put on a sailor s jacket and hat from beneath which rolled his long black hair   8.321926867357227
come you shall take charge of the money i of the jewel box   11.767947632764036
but you have already tendered them and fully discharged your debt if indeed there existed one and i feel almost mortified to find you still reverting to the subject   8.623888428690748
let us put our swords into our left hands and shake hands with the right even in the very lust and music of the hottest carnage   7.712357067273464
they entered the roadstead   16.364323534019384
he took pity on these poor animals and went to a corner of the stable where he saw a little straw but in doing so he struck his foot against a human body which uttered a cry and arose on its knees rubbing its eyes   6.156352625187992
when d artagnan had finished he said hum   13.010836123779267
meanwhile the prince took de guiche aside and asked him how the prisoner had been taken and who this young man was   13.77998184311523
that i should renew my promise of remaining tranquil   11.906489454369742
it was acting as a supernumerary that was so tedious   14.616454352054332
indeed the jailer antoine told me one connected with this very dungeon   10.494291243655278
bonacieux darting at her the most loving glance that he could possibly concentrate upon her charming little person   9.6073824896897
that you possess a certain letter from madame de chevreuse found in his grace s lodging which singularly compromises not only her who wrote it but her in whose name it was written   12.798430304628795
he gave his address to the driver and springing in threw himself on the seat and gave loose to dreams of ambition   7.035189803192751
if you do escape remember that the poor abbé whom all the world called mad was not so   9.434613124377643
the breeze had been so light all night they had made but little progress   16.128699855035844
let it pass   12.444846862195517
and therein consisted the infamy replied milady   14.094161316162316
d avrigny himself arrived bringing the night draught prepared for the young girl and then m   19.123047495743364
but it seemed that morrel expected something something had occasioned the noise and something must follow   11.999494633597765
in fact porthos could be heard snoring through the partition   10.787852915971293
weak and tottering footsteps resounded across the chamber above me and the next instant a dull heavy weight seemed to fall powerless on the staircase   11.618748642717962
but my real treasure is not that my dear friend which awaits me beneath the sombre rocks of monte cristo it is your presence our living together five or six hours a day in spite of our jailers   7.423690096719228
yes monsieur replied d artagnan   13.598925676635613
the son of a shipowner   11.993805049253783
you know my opinion of my mother count   17.169582912136537
de monte cristo you must demand an explanation   12.696702084513273
cried jussac for the third time   14.997609652310862
he had discovered those to whose death he had devoted his life   11.291766312826146
give me your hand and let us go to the minister   9.851681290428075
well well said monte cristo quietly i see you wish to quarrel with me   11.387481137554003
danglars i believe he is the son of the old shipowner   14.270053229674183
then when de winter rose to take leave listen my lord said the queen   10.738292599384442
here it is eleven o clock   7.898647192329285
madame de villefort remained immersed in thought   9.790939460668348
emmanuel hesitated a moment but his desire to make julie decide immediately made him reply   8.381306436892746
remember that   9.131104677807755
i shall be on the king s left and as i am the chief person threatened remain at the coach door to the left   12.666755376815802
or rather at what he said   12.699924047289008
de château renaud has also the honor of his acquaintance   14.267915881979999
villefort pushed or rather forced the door open   1.4296816355294606
yes giulio she said proud and happy   14.011605043383817
you do not answer madame   9.737128502227506
milady started with joy   14.793826402064614
i went and threw myself on the bed without parting with the emancipating knife which i concealed under my pillow   11.1718193081159
said morcerf laughing   10.628146786754023
know then what manner of woman it was for whom to day you call me to account   15.365223009865423
monsieur cardinal is indeed a privileged man   8.981860931364569
my poor eugénie you must conceal your passion for the fine arts   12.144611987925378
then i shall enjoy as much happiness as this world can possibly confer   9.585720837997492
by the queen s almoner to whom i am very intimately allied said aramis coloring   11.274058178031963
second porthos stretched his upon the grass with a wound through his thigh as the englishman without making any further resistance then surrendered his sword porthos took him up in his arms and bore him to his carriage   12.668535667401283
and this conviction restored his strength   11.306428909498427
i must first tell you that monsieur de rochefort is planchet hesitated   12.09703976207738
such felicity seems above all price as a thing impossible and unattainable   9.196812880514985
these two ingredients are mixed in equal proportions and formed into pills   9.439407823342343
in short said porthos when all my expenses are paid i shall have at most thirty crowns left   17.270945273189813
amuse yourself well   11.351565289395332
felton surveyed her for an instant with his usual impassiveness   10.273028692930762
eh who knows   13.483162475156373
do i know m   15.498324123297937
approach then said the messenger or i will come nearer to you if you prefer it   6.151093628898158
it appeared then to d artagnan that m   12.954212550227007
he soon however returned his whole face beaming with delight   10.291229749160703
that great man who was so revered by d artagnan the elder served as an object of ridicule to the musketeers of tréville who cracked their jokes upon his bandy legs and his crooked back   11.27928458001219
the english turkish japanese hindu laws are as familiar to me as the french laws and thus i was right when i said to you that relatively you know that everything is relative sir that relatively to what i have done you have very little to do   14.32768429558944
the queen had several times already told her son that he ought to go to bed and several times louis had coaxingly insisted on staying where he was   11.48751783091225
answer frankly   13.955045243926346
here we are said monte cristo   10.030582299865381
you are laughing at him caderousse   10.323195315391938
i alone suspected that it was the waistcoat of the murdered man   10.177267544488858
but it was so placed on the desk that he could not see to whom it was addressed   13.489785465640148
yes i do sir   8.596997018077134
without your aid continued he repeating the count s words i should have been a dead man thrice dead   14.313540816506338
the king came out first from his room   7.813643825296127
yes but to morrow morning to morrow we shall be at boulogne   16.19812407490361
have you lost your heart   9.035267411724734
but really it is a useless precaution   6.896196483185394
provided sir the particulars you wish for do not interfere with my scruples or my conscience   7.031952533522212
when you return to this mundane sphere from your visionary world you would seem to leave a neapolitan spring for a lapland winter to quit paradise for earth heaven for hell   12.016020791015766
nineteen returned dantès   6.7613204272839305
ma foi i beg your pardon but as i have but one son and it is the first time i have ever thought of marrying him i am still serving my apprenticeship you know   10.556756362828962
and indeed so convinced is he of this that he entreated me should i find your majesty disposed to act in this way to do all i could to induce you to change your resolution   10.873611994938292
but he was strangely deceived and his error was not of long duration   12.79350040450245
really monsieur you say strange things said aramis   12.218857904609123
but the moment is come to keep your word   11.816994920297725
morcerf then with that delighted philosophy which believes that nothing is impossible to a full purse or well lined pocketbook supped went to bed slept soundly and dreamed he was racing all over rome at carnival time in a coach with six horses   15.250691206442227
we must look about us   10.717272698726024
if that is really so how came you in the bastille   10.596258509921103
how do you think these garments fit me   15.839473914317972
this cried the voice the tone of which was at once polished and jeering this is nothing but a butchery of horses and not a combat between men   13.145327069745543
the valet went out as silently as he had entered and appeared in a few minutes bringing the dress demanded   7.982451107040384
now madame said debray delivering up his accounts in the methodical manner of a stockbroker there are still 80 000 francs the interest of this money in my hands   13.819772314534317
will your majesty permit me to give orders in your name throughout this business   9.940483041841016
it is more time than i require   15.305067613937755
that s unworthy   10.378124952380551
but at least we shall not have to reproach ourselves with anything   22.72416941350641
you must have received a false report or you have gone mad   13.585070776166424
the journey soon became interesting from its rapidity of which morcerf had formed no previous idea   9.869021233186743
you know about that   15.495192260815571
then he bowed a second time and retired   12.803313574311332
therefore continued valentine looking playfully at maximilian no more inconsiderate actions no more rash projects   4.965054261248485
as mademoiselle de scudery remarks   13.586635299200289
laporte detained in england as everyone else had been by the orders of charles i   8.339943055475633
as it was a time of war between the catholics and the huguenots and as he saw the catholics exterminate the huguenots and the huguenots exterminate the catholics all in the name of religion he adopted a mixed belief which permitted him to be sometimes catholic sometimes a huguenot   9.555237379570475
i tell you the queen does not love me   11.328268684661515
ah this one is not like the other and his madness is less affecting than this one s display of reason   12.44617569990743
you who know rome better than he does   9.88111247144304
i had but one wish   12.319258387246867
discontent had long pervaded the lower ranks of society in france   13.825589767783795
he pretended to know of an immense treasure and offered vast sums to the government if they would liberate him   12.508589267518618
i am not to blame for having tried every means to compress it said planchet   8.180253260260784
supposing for instance and do not be angry at what i am going to say well   11.815256902244064
so the matter ended for the abbé faria   3.994717120343241
and should any one of them chance to forfeit his post by this resistance to combine to indemnify him for his loss   10.165880568800477
there placed between two rivers on the borders of scotland but still on english soil the tents of a little army extended   7.385898063817493
the young man gazed at him as if he would have read the secret of his heart   13.037423630181706
hi   13.902461512101658
there are powers above his which do not depend upon a man or the issue of an event   3.789712510976507
they passed into the eating room a large dark room situated opposite the kitchen   9.956965039116309
next he went to the quai de feraille to have a new blade put to his sword and then returned toward the louvre inquiring of the first musketeer he met for the situation of the hôtel of m   16.767926415553852
the more he strove against this unhallowed passion the more his senses yielded to its thrall and at length weary of a struggle that taxed his very soul he gave way and sank back breathless and exhausted beneath the kisses of these marble goddesses and the enchantment of his marvellous dream   9.854942335408976
before i go said mordaunt i have some questions and a favor to ask you sir   12.538815531081864
mousqueton also attracted attention   11.403607191272068
but melancholy interrupted master edward snatching the feathers out of the tail of a splendid paroquet that was screaming on its gilded perch in order to make a plume for his hat   8.488434145341532
i am added the king taking a handful of gold from la chesnaye and putting it into the hand of d artagnan   11.295712868419615
you see plainly he is not dead   7.959299930973539
we are coming nearer to it now   14.655511958023226
i have not that honor monseigneur replied the latter his eyes dazzled by the brilliant style in which d artagnan traveled   15.495813659211116
and now gentlemen he continued turning towards m   14.608822857642686
suddenly planchet entered bringing two letters for d artagnan   11.919874042317474
well he found us on his road and will not be baron this time   11.270119998165791
my fifty recruits from the chevalier d humieres who are destined to enter the light cavalry and who have only received as yet for their equipment their white cloaks   17.117679126972867
i always said that d artagnan had the longest head of the four said athos who having uttered his opinion to which d artagnan replied with a bow immediately resumed his accustomed silence   11.519832342271844
she was lost in reverie and the reverie of crime is remorse   13.252364244897333
then give me a letter to him and tell him to sell out without an instant s delay perhaps even now i shall arrive too late   12.201754803954882
cried d artagnan i will be there ten minutes before twelve   13.22710715107908
cried the people with one voice   18.314153557328847
his voice went to my heart observed julie   12.964114576876675
i have the honor to inquire from your majesty what you desire monsieur d herblay and myself to do in your service   11.592690756042623
in that case monseigneur do you believe the cardinal will be so kind as to tell me what has become of my wife   14.036304649304032
milady reclining in an armchair near the chimney beautiful pale and resigned looked like a holy virgin awaiting martyrdom   13.20479906227227
ma foi no returned albert   14.925925382249005
it belongs to one of our companions who is overtaking us   10.32780394837719
come let us see what you know   12.307799057612804
now you must agree that these are indubitable symptoms of insanity   10.166478980192418
the sultan the liberty of a woman replied the count   11.55007328897161
israel is dead but he is avenged   13.046061426936742
a bad joke of the husband s substituted the other   15.46156891262825
bonacieux from the convent of the carmelites of béthune   11.404002567611702
6 guillotine   7.871046619796196
with 200 francs   10.050433853225114
mazarin being thus placed beyond the pale of the protection of the law preparations on both sides were commenced by the queen to attack paris by the citizens to defend it   16.62566225090508
your address at paris   14.384914389800972
it must be done   13.809197236640541
we understand each other perfectly then   13.178790124829815
you shall be my body guard   13.950034737931315
never monseigneur   14.091436060341188
by degrees everyone awoke   10.230000964857076
and in a separate group might be distinguished m   9.191462827500594
he shall assume a disguise and place himself in front of the convent   12.453091817571421
milady thought she recognized this shadow in the gloom   10.165002543116508
but now listen to this   13.06433896177057
the poor fowl was thin and covered with one of those thick bristly skins through which the teeth can not penetrate with all their efforts   11.631050736053297
madame de villefort appeared more and more thoughtful   12.782910222332495
d artagnan who had just dismounted then saw outlined against the wall the enormous stomach of mousqueton whose down drawn mouth emitted sounds of distress   17.28006174332794
but my dear fellow if that some one recognizes us if that some one cries out we are lost   12.738471301112076
i have a letter to give you from the count   8.972021633553416
the story of ganymede maximilian is not a fable but an allegory   13.092312331421496
the hôtel de la trémouille   13.854560725482166
well what is to be done   14.997803263867132
who brought it into this room then   8.319300677321984
in ugliness in so far as a man can resemble a woman   11.151796222159378
the valet announced the vicomte albert de morcerf   10.145969459426517
and yet so powerful is majesty amongst us this man has not even the honor of a tomb at the feet of him in whose service his life was worn away   16.781187041560216
you have rapiers here of every form and to suit the most exacting taste   11.958072193457994
i suppose you know he has an order for unlimited credit on the baron s banking establishment   11.01453975788923
steps approach i go adieu   11.557344903015334
we want money for our return to paris   11.361606634618134
i am fond of grass and shade said monte cristo   11.586194856135911
and at that moment he could safely promise to do so for he felt as though it were not enough to love him merely as a friend or even as a father he worshiped him as a god   12.067462325893962
but for the honor of the king of the queen   13.624416121402454
for at present i can not say that i have seen anything extraordinary   12.093445872014131
he wished to speak but his tongue refused to move   11.066927718543784
indeed my dear friend said m   11.561040360451544
in a couple of hours he returned   12.116590000345145
d artagnan perceived the force of this reasoning and was silent   8.70837433559927
it seems said d artagnan that whilst i thought i was coming to noisy i have entered without suspecting it into the kingdom of mysteries   12.230492735232643
milady assumed her smile of a resigned victim and shook her head   9.672116930926522
it was a name that too often resounded in her majesty s ears and too often vibrated in her heart for anne of austria not to recognize it   12.932290208202309
you will kill yourself cried planchet   14.773113483992539
the minister receives two hundred petitions every day and does not read three   8.961421596654368
the memory of richelieu annihilates me   5.658422527873226
hearing these words the two shadows blockaded the road and by the light of the stars might be seen the shining of their arms   11.546399423713861
you have forgotten then   10.891440656656993
by your misfortune   18.86367248043591
cried felton with terror forgetting to withdraw his hands from the hands of the prisoner to kill yourself   16.76690742421828
grimaud however did not even smile   14.903127014517729
the four seamen who composed the crew obeyed while the pilot looked on   14.104787182311885
i will have three fleur de lis embroidered on it in gold and will give it to your company as a standard   9.099570581112026
and which i discovered in the pocket book of the messenger   8.659624495303932
and who confounded unknown lost in the crowd gathered at one of the doors looked on at this scene comprehensible only to four persons the king the queen his eminence and himself   14.899321764281623
it is you who have told me that you had a secret to confide in me   7.303540262258053
but in losing you i lose my life   11.680284885946056
the road was long but the horses upon which d artagnan and planchet rode had been refreshed in the well supplied stables of the lord of bracieux   13.24300752210943
d artagnan became more and more astonished   10.716771296231215
mordaunt felt that he had no time to lose and he lost none   11.916832851533712
her ladies that is to say madame de bregy mademoiselle de beaumont madame de motteville and socratine her sister so called on account of her sense had just brought into her dressing room the remains of the dinner on which according to her usual custom she supped   11.20801602882463
i am sorry if you die that you should die with sentiments of hatred toward me   9.997325644560147
i was like you and had a king in keeping   14.423588071780788
there said he demand thy child of carlini   12.64212373555465
you may be above others but above you there is god   14.990618016926451
i hope the accident has been of no consequence   8.116504822305302
come said he to himself be a man   14.455600282344308
for as the gladiator said to the emperor when he entered the arena he who is about to die salutes you   9.56200815508642
they might have been said to fall on the shield of minerva which some philosophers assert protected sometimes the breast of sappho   13.03062995441395
it is much more convenient at paris when anything can not be done you pay double and it is done directly   12.735852954789411
no no it is useless stammered m   11.274534271533867
but not until two o clock said d artagnan with the same calmness   7.082316523956455
what were you doing at the moment you were arrested   10.563389272795774
then her brow darkened   10.603124365077512
and who had a lackey named grimaud   11.22540958933743
port he said extending his hand in the direction of the first compartment examined by d artagnan and himself   15.218379281038743
my way is the way of all gentlemen and i know only one way answered athos haughtily   12.958214031005232
gentlemen he said turning to those who were near him can any one of you speak spanish and serve me as interpreter   9.972545933421056
certainly certainly cried franz   11.799100405441054
for two days no one knew what had become of her and everything remained in suspense   12.867796091251773
oh how extraordinary   12.27580382485318
i pardon you said he for the poisoning of my brother and the assassination of his grace lord buckingham   13.671494487810122
really count if ever i thought that i had a friend in the ranks of the royal army it was you   17.33988203069807
i do not think so although inclination might lead her to do so but we shall take your eminence to paris and the parisians will defend us   12.61285376705797
a woman who poisoned her second husband and who attempted both to poison and assassinate me   10.802052412764722
the latter put his hand to his sword and said with the smile of a man who for thirty years has jested with death would you assassinate me sir   16.103651051466713
morrel then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the new favor which he designed to bestow on him   11.770040511154559
over the doors were painted sketches of shepherds and shepherdesses after the style and manner of boucher   14.718866655625348
in that earnest look might be read a deep reproach as well as a terrible menace   9.255814590522139
grimaud seemed to him an antinous   15.101130677046037
at last d artagnan having got up too close stepped back to prepare a fourth thrust but the moment when after a fine quick feint he was attacking as sharply as lightning the wall seemed to give way mordaunt disappeared through the opening and d artagnan s blade caught between the panels shivered like a sword of glass   18.343511054048342
since the 28th of february 1815   9.443341739808211
there is a providence   14.601717583959266
charles who is my prisoner may still have friends but i have none   8.03325159025879
then they did not watch over this man   13.440080449800167
i am convinced that these gentlemen return your kind wishes and will be delighted to kill you also   11.627477517884618
the sound was heard by the people about ali who instantly opened the box door   14.420777666007586
i took them home with me with the permission of the guardian and devoured them   12.707065155399588
so much the worse sir said anne of austria   13.579640064162492
he was not used to see monte cristo give vent to such bursts of enthusiasm   9.763410077021451
tis the appointment monsieur de tréville held you ask of me   10.772392264160546
now then margotin cried he speaking to the dog will you be quiet   13.350612236667935
and what is a fronde   9.456772353014586
his head fell on his shoulder his legs bent beneath him and his movements were apparently automatic and unconscious   15.52349826623703
i stand in need of being taught and consoled   12.101338049814101
where have you been   12.379805291009353
said a voice that seemed to come from beneath the earth and deadened by the distance sounded hollow and sepulchral in the young man s ears   14.443842031626982
aramis is mildness and grace personified   7.9973071876615105
ah he exclaimed that woman became criminal only from associating with me   17.82941534088612
monsieur continued the countess advancing with the majesty of a queen i owe to you the life of my son and for this i bless you   11.355353976801585
see he exclaimed there remains still some of the magic draught   13.026698681724472
well monsieur do you know who this great lady is   12.48075206717049
well my captain said porthos quite beside himself the truth is that we were six against six   7.443866991650605
why thus it is replied dantès   7.145239136482147
but to her great surprise d artagnan remained perfectly calm and instead of being angry he laughed and said to porthos yes i understand the air of la rue tiquetonne is not like that of pierrefonds   15.042146958859506
raoul angry and at the same time uneasy ran after him and seized him by the arm   8.363856805843376
imagine a man who has transacted business with me for i don t know how long to the amount of 800 000 or 900 000 francs during the year   14.269861510957293
i will even venture to say that i am certain m   6.57936049739686
the mob had already assembled when the confession terminated   17.684365815309157
but do not let us lose time   14.70302617345015
aramis then joined athos and d artagnan who were consulting together   8.764393156152433
villefort answered nothing he simply raised his head which had been cast down before and looked at the doctor with amazement   13.330284488985601
i shall return immediately   12.588507900577635
she took me away without speaking   13.500068273121773
when the emperor returned he wrote implored threatened and so energetically that on the second restoration he was persecuted as a bonapartist   11.98430620457967
0099m go on sir said he   16.928293759102353
good morning lucien good morning said albert   10.645446700847359
all savage natures appreciate a desperate deed   14.373788018150574
but he forbade that anything should be given to her except what he ordered   11.383197331788764
cried blaisois he is lost   9.205041414594458
athos stopped   11.101204259005346
were you ever in the habit of writing in the evening what had transpired in the morning   13.023495451118222
it is a rock   13.489539587200504
come calm yourself and reckon them up m   7.865479604065737
but i confess i always thought you jested   17.295430623938316
i would rather have lost a thousand pistoles than have lost it   11.298839215607012
dantès seized the handles and strove to lift the coffer   9.992047853289083
i will take two poniards and give one to parry   11.699594539239929
the exclamations the insults addressed to benedetto who remained perfectly unconcerned the energetic gestures the movement of the gendarmes the sneers of the scum of the crowd always sure to rise to the surface in case of any disturbance all this lasted five minutes before the door keepers and magistrates were able to restore silence   12.297489075156864
he is well behaved   14.073222307617563
but at the same time rely on our royal gratitude   13.290416936712408
i can t see   9.1925794267311
bowing under the weight of twenty four years reminiscences he thought not of albert of beauchamp of château renaud or of any of that group   9.166103817047258
yes my lord pentecost   9.205224522002656
de villefort are both coming to this dinner   14.08359812198575
on the contrary you will give me great pleasure   14.860868741584445
impostor repeated villefort   12.397055734744894
on reaching the gate the captain of the post advanced at the head of a dozen men holding a lantern in his hand   14.720231205347694
d artagnan said aramis in a reproachful tone how could you believe that we had made a disturbance   13.832951520943595
his words were re echoed by the whole party with vociferous cheers   11.81055278034566
they will be the very men for it   8.88016806015558
7 dr   6.338899617395696
yes i promised you   10.364628993240204
what horror   12.392037002885399
i arose   13.281455030774028
you want a pretext do you not   17.394737222449216
i am sorry to say i must do so madame i only came to remind you of your promise for saturday   12.37764006945812
but tell me what   10.47522674621917
and throwing the match on the ground he trampled on it and extinguished it   12.287689328890343
scaffold executioners victims all had disappeared   12.041312520215268
his voice had become rough and hoarse   14.007703258101536
they came with their usual promptness and the coadjutor spent with them a part of the night   14.223002003613963
you no more deceive me with that false calmness than i impose upon you with my frivolous solicitude   12.045585358991179
do you think the count of monte cristo had ever been in france before he made this visit to paris   14.238284873545556
and if they come back fire   14.780483533998261
well i was a million in advance with him and now my fine jacopo manfredi suspends payment   15.763329702279599
an instant later the jingling of spurs was heard upon the stairs steps drew near the door opened and a man appeared   14.349252368927718
i let him place the box in the hole he had made then while he stamped with his feet to remove all traces of his occupation i rushed on him and plunged my knife into his breast exclaiming i am giovanni bertuccio   9.441461977065936
why he left marseilles and was taken on the recommendation of m   12.38249065219527
on perceiving the count he rose quickly   12.36251582932529
thank you said andrea   11.08683723096372
he wished to enter it as a conqueror   17.93567463635643
lord de winter came toward five o clock in the evening   13.941572937230575
so beautiful   14.88983367600874
why edmond dantès and myself were intimate friends   11.613403505240932
but the gentle voice which usually has such power over me fails to convince me today   15.839690345821225
take this letter said d artagnan   13.158272225920012
then seeing that none of their replies could throw any light on the subject porthos called the host and asked for dice   11.95253499736695
for ten years i dreamed each night the same dream   11.830990730216941
50233m i am entirely yours count   13.535555321348308
but she always laughed at me   7.295717138668964
but the rock was too heavy and too firmly wedged to be moved by anyone man were he hercules himself   14.268934028440079
in the smuggling line   12.099658427119959
but he had seven or eight years before this period sold his establishment to a tailor at marseilles who having almost ruined himself in his old trade wished to make his fortune in another   12.608350503943338
on my life   13.333976516428567
you can write it yourself   10.135243538472409
you really have some distrust then   14.976286284383505
monsieur monsieur   10.080669123389805
which has happened to you   14.891653314711178
how attentively he looked at you   11.546660789622912
three months afterwards a woman travelled from rogliano to paris to fetch me and having claimed me as her son carried me away   16.302823138501555
it is indeed the same said he   14.446233070330404
yes said athos doubtless you would commit great follies   13.013534104081879

the man he sacrificed to his ambition that innocent victim immolated on the altar of his father s faults appeared to him pale and threatening leading his affianced bride by the hand and bringing with him remorse not such as the ancients figured furious and terrible but that slow and consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up to the very moment of death   17.223952699431365

it seems that his experiments have very considerably advanced the cause of science doubtless   13.266820691007926

the order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a man of war   8.539981275776187
then the king who without our suspecting it had overheard our conversation interrupted us by saying villefort observe that the king did not pronounce the word noirtier but on the contrary placed considerable emphasis on that of villefort villefort said his majesty is a young man of great judgment and discretion who will be sure to make a figure in his profession   13.08651401037142
then an idea crossed my mind which was confirmed when i saw the procureur lift from under his mantle a box two feet long and six or eight inches deep   10.330623451192045
do you think he died a natural death   13.165998141337024

they continued at their best speed for two hours although the horses were so fatigued that it was to be feared they would soon refuse service   10.87985085517051
but i will endeavor a little to illustrate my meaning   12.318329823648378

and i will adhere to it   13.933335804544118
but it has none   12.427920485359984
that will account to you for the unreserved manner which you observed between me and eugénie as in speaking of the man whom i could not love my thoughts involuntarily reverted to him on whom my affections were fixed   8.461405929316825

but are you seriously wounded   10.85712923237401
the expression of terror which for the moment had overspread the features of the young man had now disappeared   8.814501381952576
did you recognize him   11.922567555933242
but now to die would be indeed to give way to the sarcasm of destiny   8.740929475193767
he threatened you   16.20519383620404
i am ready to accompany you sir said maximilian   14.994616303531174
what design can i have   11.490727012554023

because going hence as emissaries to cromwell we became partisans of king charles   14.797609261590491
her eyes followed the motion of the door as it closed behind lord de winter and felton and the moment she was alone a fresh fit of despair seized her   16.32388320108704
in the meantime we will have a merry night   15.145724068934001
the catacombs of saint sebastian chapter 38   7.891945506078141

and he and his companion resumed their walk toward the convent   7.833756882265824
for three days ago i posted from marseilles to paris with all possible speed half desperate at the enforced delay   8.205553690791145
therefore do not make yourself uneasy on your brother s account   12.925195352922511

not only in the same hotel but on the same floor   16.292759290575766
planchet went and presented himself as a lackey out of a place who was in search of a situation   11.172556241416524
it is madame danglars   10.64277273977535
and now once more adieu said morrel   15.392415554293757
i say i believe such is the case i do not affirm it   9.564321375322415
but on the contrary and it is i who say it see enemies in all directions   12.20970958744303
and i do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be more fervent than mine   14.459367288616622
and you answered me that the cold and sluggish habits of the north did not present the same aptitude as the rich and energetic temperaments of the natives of the south   14.360806177281173
you will lose the preference and that will be your fault   16.653742209251067
but did you see the queen   11.738759209999955
the king trembled with joy and the cardinal with vexation   16.608489256728628
come down   6.5308541763306485
i felt my strength fail and this time it was not my sleep that enabled the coward to prevail but my swoon   14.529515834511916
a few minutes later they were on board but the embarkation of the horses was a longer matter than that of the men and it was eight o clock before they raised anchor   7.414407344263697
let us suppose one thing replied the duke let us suppose for instance that my maitre d hotel noirmont has purchased the shop of pere marteau well   9.803393565364694
the life of a man was to him of far less value than a numeral especially when by taking it away he could increase the sum total of his own desires   11.200346650538268
at these words bertuccio turned pale   10.216393815613507
d artagnan was then in her power   12.828907309347153
that was to follow her   11.90639440680304
but i have always observed that poisoners were cowards   10.293724400390678
go on go on replied d artagnan laughing heartily   14.205488534676128
the penknife   13.303094019208402
i suppose that you think it necessary that i should disturb the repose of these illustrious lords to say gentlemen your servant mousqueton is thirsty   12.694281388133309
the picture seems to have a malign influence for my mother rarely comes here without looking at it and still more rarely does she look at it without weeping   10.137509100095933
d artagnan bowed and went out   13.987877727631552
tender hearts   11.8757811869272
at bourges   6.5050160472900345
by no means my dear porthos   10.55453907362336
at the slightest sound he rose and hastened to the door convinced they were about to liberate him but the sound died away and dantès sank again into his seat   13.640486512053515
but you said replied madame danglars he would require it as a proof   13.262795893954626
for there are two distinct sorts of ideas those that proceed from the head and those that emanate from the heart   11.250273269379285
felton s orders were for the rest executed with a silent rapidity that gave a good idea of the way in which he maintained discipline   9.945042781553255
a glance was exchanged between athos and aramis   8.796077619144004
have you made inquiry   14.849877279804819
take advantage of all and live happily and long   13.804736741457715
anne ascended the steps side of the bed and softly kissed the placid forehead of her son   12.511527883528869
said the swiss who notwithstanding the admirable collection of oaths possessed by the german language had acquired a habit of swearing in french   16.109829642344934
instead of the costume of our fathers which you despise i will wear a varnished hat a striped shirt and a blue jacket with an anchor on the buttons   14.560031924474053
what is your name my brave fellow   14.024318312099576
oh sometimes severity is quite necessary replied madame de villefort with all a mother s real firmness   14.312928054089225
if one of them comes to my side asked porthos must i kill him   11.605457067827976
it appears to me that we have an account to settle with him and that it is not our custom to leave a place without paying our debts of this kind at least   12.970706375505141
the thing is impossible   11.691518146931271
you could do no such thing fernand   13.921848096621426
do i wish to know that he gives advice   5.721366731913289
i must find them within three days   11.625795120289654
now let us return to the first   6.435265997493493
but this dinner was not intended for you alone porthos   17.455485018553695
molière or beaumarchais would reply to you madame that it was precisely because i was not that i had cured my patients   16.464709067299957
said d artagnan but only his lantern   9.60943956599638
edmond you have a very handsome mistress   14.256003377102758
the poor women felt instinctively that they required all their strength to support the blow that impended   14.708524604061417
i can tell you nothing more at present   13.406745220164664
aramis went to cromwell s desk tore off three bits of paper of equal size wrote on the first his own name and on the others those of his two companions and presented them open to mordaunt who by a movement of his head indicated that he left the matter entirely to aramis   15.749540163211146
it was time two hours after he was delirious   13.705266827024866
and why when everyone else was allowed to be ransomed might he not also be   12.859374932571965
the more so that the ship was sinking under us and seemed to say get along save yourselves   10.937022830107221
but what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me   9.357043699963201
and milady went to bed and fell asleep with a smile upon her lips   14.389507243070625
and we shall see then who can speak the loudest   12.178813819645626
ravishingly   6.991463904955685
oh yes especially beautiful   11.614746345482917
have you neglected to obtain information on that point   12.910987794708523
whether she kill herself or not what matter provided dantès is not captain   3.007319297404896
now said the owner to his wife and daughter leave me   10.857214164403066
you hear m   8.698818666369053
charles perceived it and took his hand   10.966301209174535
you are looking for my daughter   15.548957905240382
the eye of the old man was riveted upon a spot which villefort could scarcely distinguish   12.40970167769656
i have no will unless it be the will never to decide   13.176184889793563
then though yourself a servant you have other servants to wait upon you take care of your clothes and see that your linen is duly prepared for you   18.138264004845997
he was an honest man said d artagnan   8.838347472895606
a quarter of an hour afterward porthos appeared at the end of the rue férou on a very handsome genet   9.61487104681402
immediately the door opened and the superior entered   11.872245596210007
0323m like other dwellers in the south he was a man of sober habits and moderate desires but fond of external show vain and addicted to display   8.557146998999261
the reader may ask how came planchet here   13.827916478779583
i have caused you to be named lieutenant   12.774473325663106
azure seven merlets or placed bender said he   13.000089494027351
wherefore did you not apply then madame to the first person you saw from us   13.09583241236929
but this mattered little to him now rita had been his   5.634525510184272
messieurs musketeers i will not have this haunting of bad places this quarreling in the streets this swordplay at the crossways   12.922385946747392
your friend s lackey was leading him   14.205815395430442
0197m chapter 16   15.36545986488253
you forget that my enemies may arrive at any minute   14.462991161541122
the secret is said athos that i saw milady last night   19.77373773454545
cried he laughing i quite despair of my poor michon   13.850027932871242
it is eight thousand that we want to complete our outfits toward which it is true we have already the saddles   15.47300027529934
this horse made my visitors ashamed of theirs and i don t like to humiliate people   16.224013917449597
now we have found everything except money it would be stupid to be killed   12.904510150308642
madame de villefort unconscious of the passions that exhausted their fire over her head at that moment held her son s ball and was making signs to him to reclaim it with a kiss   8.637722942012811
he was thirty three when he escaped   5.779215883433514
your having sent for me is another proof of your affection   10.115090534701405
this guide was our friend peppino who dashed into the thicket of high weeds through a path which none but lizards or polecats could have imagined to be an open road   16.083334224774067
let us manage it better   11.185008963409434
i looked upon myself as another judith   9.443824750269904
i was promised he should die with me   11.250068072465165
aramis looked first at porthos and then at d artagnan without speaking but the latter understood his meaningful look   11.737985583612224
like virgil s wounded hero he carried the arrow in his wound and arrived at the salon villefort uttered a sigh that was almost a sob and sank into a chair   8.837406246286704
raised to the height of twenty feet so as to be on a level with the window it had two lower stories   8.88044240052346
we must extricate ourselves from this position   15.040698934039046
how very astonishing   15.398229054369818
i practiced this exercise and as nature has endowed me with some faculties at this day i can throw the lasso with any man in the world   11.555398285805394
it would take too long to tell you besides you will hear it all directly and the least word dropped here might ruin all   9.125349275151176
well if he does not come it will be because he has been delayed that s all   14.499334496652901
resumed aramis i have little fancy for the sea by day still less at night   8.912423679411113
this space passed mme   13.86260821244246
the count of morcerf s adventure exasperates the young man   11.59748469740521
there as in every spot where monte cristo stopped if but for two days luxury abounded and life went on with the utmost ease   11.879372789982426
i have corrected the vices that i had   9.07753749853362
600 000 700 000 800 000 900 000   7.573843186753103
and so long as they sold their fish they were able to buy twine for new nets   8.540499490778648
my father thirsts for revenge as much as you do yet even he conjures you as i do to keep this secret   14.710943550902666
what weapons   10.30462068081867
it is the same man whom i rescued from the hands of the banditti at rome   12.418402244077654
noirtier you intend leaving your fortune to your grandson edward de villefort   12.25482843204339
there was above all one room continued monte cristo very plain in appearance hung with red damask which i know not why appeared to me quite dramatic   16.410696764856205
d artagnan needs to be alone to weep and to sleep   7.769599805211765
aramis pleaded as his excuse a commentary upon the eighteenth chapter of st   8.582293648089369
and as he had said in business he had correspondents and not friends   16.562324554196284
however amidst all the prisoner s efforts to elude a systematic examination raoul had recognized his natural accent   12.267184486268617
one of these ladies the fair one uttered those terrible shrieks which resounded through the house while the other rushing to the bell rope rang with all her strength   12.77232749634578
a spent ball   11.76185929928556
franz took his hat and went away in haste   16.1280404097114
you come to your conclusions quickly   11.258674256668243
sir said he up to this time and it is now more than four and twenty years since i received the direction of this house from my father who had himself conducted it for five and thirty years never has anything bearing the signature of morrel son been dishonored   11.283859966301655
it is quite wonderful mr   13.683290496362709
and who is with madame   7.908516913896048
it was nearly ten o clock   13.991298968938448
i thought i was right in believing that cavalcanti to be a stingy fellow   14.700027025786776
a droll way of showing your affliction   8.383293267191721
a mortal enemy   12.07778546115082
but through the door she fancied she saw the luminous eye of the count that eye which lived in her memory and the recollection overwhelmed her with so much shame that she asked herself whether any amount of gratitude could ever repay his adventurous and devoted friendship   14.153968427953709
father said benedetto i am asked for proofs do you wish me to give them   15.832151903478266
a sacerdotal officer   11.947407571173265
on the contrary i think it will answer my purpose   7.995494384584051
make inquiries and if it be true oh yes if it be true cried the young man he shall pay me all i have suffered   15.145362917593435
morrel was preparing to fulfil his commission   17.910805032843804
but with the rapidity of thought d artagnan seized athos by the waist and followed by porthos with aramis leaped down from the benches rushed into the passages and flying down the staircase were lost in the crowd without while the muskets within were pointed on some three thousand spectators whose piteous cries and noisy alarm stopped the impulse already given to bloodshed   10.71880138411967
porthos chapter xxvi   10.65787853145091

the poor fool is cured of his folly and delivered from his captivity   14.885688758932808
madame said he   8.899848024542704
he acquiesced therefore and chose the hundred pistoles which the englishman paid down on the spot   13.224421866334051

in fact after taking a few drops of wine and a piece of bread charles weary of waiting for death had suddenly decided to go to meet it and had given the signal for movement   11.856586451867672
at villars cotterets he wrote to the cardinal my lord i have already one man to offer to your eminence and he is well worth twenty men   13.158029581842891
grimaud made a sign that he was going away   10.08327026854218
here i am back again and we are going to be happy   6.496141723325758

at times there passed before me clouds which pressed my brow which veiled my eyes   16.46792149083894
porthos went and leaned against the side of a pillar   9.634785048410555
the cavalier in the gilt cuirass fell upon aramis and struck a blow that aramis parried with his wonted skill   12.227975707068348
i don t know whether i ever told you that when i was at college i was rather rather strong in greek   10.261347131287264

well then pursued madame g with considerable animation you can probably tell me who won the jockey club stakes   13.150886266745701
then it was to go to her that you left us   10.527981666580128
everything was as we have said a question of arithmetic to cocles and during twenty years he had always seen all payments made with such exactitude that it seemed as impossible to him that the house should stop payment as it would to a miller that the river that had so long turned his mill should cease to flow   11.811928324167615
porthos looked at d artagnan quite amazed at the resources with which his companion s gascon sharpness continually supplied him   14.245868081246497
at tréport   12.19560583672685
exclaimed athos raising his right hand to heaven never   13.147273293140865
then after dinner the queen was to have a play in her apartment   9.747659161190438
returned peppino   15.4174392726282
ah that s quite another thing   6.785404940405141
if they come tell them what has happened   13.036611107805232
and now leave me alone   12.163280477457024

be pleased to give me that scrap of paper so that i may justify by a pretext at least my abandoning my countrymen   13.454791057558241
asked villefort after a moment s reflection what interest can this m   14.04619427184156
i will relate to her the details of the disappearance of this poor woman of which she is no doubt ignorant   12.331524535362576
this evening s adventure will serve for my excuse   8.851710543251528
accordingly that same evening d artagnan repaired to the quarters of athos whom he found in a fair way to empty a bottle of spanish wine an occupation which he religiously accomplished every night   12.854284334786032
oh don t let us talk of that m   6.464455917168631
the nations took attila who was doomed to destroy them for a conqueror similar to other conquerors and it was necessary for both to reveal their missions that they might be known and acknowledged   9.212533839883239
you furnished a principal of 100 000 francs   12.135147371420592
this celebrated woman fully understood the art of being dull with dignity   15.66107490849782
well do you understand monsieur   9.286639624980513
it is natural enough   17.33804625746152
he walked straight up to him and placed a pistol to his throat   15.042605564145244
but why into five parts   15.864886529582968
i am listening   7.477228483941333
hush hush   11.169874181364579
d artagnan was assigned to it and made his preparations to depart   9.672479288025528
heigh sir said d artagnan trying to laugh do you know we look very much like a flock of silly mouse evading women   9.626138571985368
well well but keep whole   9.498355399670004
the countess made no reply   12.971914071929973
at length d artagnan in pursuing his researches found near the wall a woman s torn glove   7.870730332762508
monte cristo watched her with an air so thoughtful and so full of affectionate admiration that she turned back and grasped his hand   11.060047210674693
on reaching home d artagnan found kitty waiting for him   9.001015257587142
yes if she is ignorant that these orders come from the king   14.982552293605963
but where to find this man   9.522376399586243
another flash showed him four men clinging to the shattered mast and the rigging while a fifth clung to the broken rudder   8.538070516018948
well he said turning towards his wondering son when this disguise was completed well do you think your police will recognize me now   12.83943794205174
it was also considered a luxury to have them alive it being an amusing sight to see them die for when dying they change color three or four times and like the rainbow when it disappears pass through all the prismatic shades after which they were sent to the kitchen   9.392049380585028
ma madame   10.852040059375755
to the end   12.146265032412842
it bears his signature as you see which is all sufficient   13.85748951420851
monsieur d artagnan continued the queen i know your disinterestedness too well to speak of my own gratitude at such a moment but i swear to you that i shall not forget this second service as i forgot the first   9.607103374982664
therefore he knew nothing either of the enemy s numbers or of those in command or of the purpose of the army   15.473006346869123
i dread this marriage maximilian as much as you   12.853815623429645
when i become quite motionless cold and rigid as a corpse then and not before be careful about this force open my teeth with the knife pour from eight to ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial down my throat and i may perhaps revive   12.772080510142837
you have been his mistress   8.256508271121843
what are yanina and its vizier to you edmond   10.662609617509727
cried his eminence for the third time   13.199599286797515
at this moment the door opened and madame de chevreuse was announced   8.79724856943071
how not much   9.02049052338644
as to aramis he had asked for leave of absence for five days and was gone it was said to rouen on family business   11.6006417038374
ah if your excellency chose said the captain you might have capital sport   15.522891941988494
nothing but bitter recollections   15.960292004231473
for it did indeed seem to be a ring which was placed there   9.877537052413414
you will see continued aramis that it breathes irreproachable passion   9.509166839523537
not the slightest but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere joke should lead to such consequences   8.869045423795344
sit down there before me d artagnan   12.403444254940531
for except myself these rooms would not hold a shadow more unless that shadow were feminine   10.972186734841511
villefort who did not choose to reveal the whole secret lest another should reap all the benefit of the disclosure had yet communicated enough to cause him the greatest uneasiness   12.128931041221001
but i wish to remind aramis that he can not quit the camp and that nobody but one of ourselves is trustworthy   9.610912363448255
everyone obeyed   15.635832811181523
edmond did not close his eyes   12.44537270504683
d épinay became very pale   17.30235937240762
on the cross i swear to denounce you everywhere as a murderer as a thief of honor as a base coward   15.84364153065708
you can understand our disappointment when arriving at a pretty little house on the skirts of a wood which at a distance had quite a gay appearance with its red roof and green shutters we found nothing but a poor wretch bathed ah   14.439186842825608
thought porthos this is poor work   9.912477654176296
i persist then madame in my wish he laid an emphasis on the word that your majesty should receive the coadjutor   13.592012549013424
cried aramis eagerly   8.883954387941477
if i had anything by means of which i could inflate the lungs said d avrigny looking around him perhaps i might prevent suffocation   12.716526270120713
and d avrigny approached noirtier   12.271458576493858
at a sign from athos porthos and d artagnan sat down the two others stood in front of them   6.793239537594422
some are affected with the mania of which you spoke just now that of living again in their grandchildren   13.994439197208038
behind d artagnan entered porthos aramis lord de winter and the man in the red cloak   11.64361690552712
should the night happen to be stormy they will not be sorry to find something to console themselves with   20.828307096043694
an overpowering sadness took possession of the young man his hands relaxed their hold the objects in the room gradually lost their form and color and his disturbed vision seemed to perceive doors and curtains open in the wall   10.458709421266393
it was considered that you dead the fortune would naturally revert to your brother unless he were disinherited   10.154673704729374
observed gaetano   7.762170816139433
is it true asked gondy feigning astonishment that her majesty summoned me to ask for my opinion   12.544453535904355
ah madame replied monte cristo all this is an affair between the french captain and the daughter of vasiliki   15.037013680758445
the guide held the door open   9.673182447225058
well then planchet gallop up to it whilst i tighten my horse s girth and come back and tell me if there is a light in any of the jesuits windows   10.264915849919326
the puritan then went out   12.51500476764688
this is an adventure worthy a place in the varied career of that royal bandit   15.388035565890931
then a piercing cry escaped from his breast and he cried still the hand of god   10.510619165494015
all the four are at your service   13.539450462163703
athos whose acquaintance i made about that period and porthos who had in addition to my lessons taught me some effective tricks of fence prevailed upon me to solicit the uniform of a musketeer   11.78509776943184
the four friends embraced with tears in their eyes   10.294313861390346
olivain was at the same distance in the rear when suddenly there resounded five or six musket shots   10.365136487573288
not even that   12.794476248426582
they ask where i was born   8.11073540818775
nothing in the two small chambers forming the apartments remained as it had been in the time of the elder dantès   10.002066607993491
and she greedily read the following few lines my dear child hold yourself ready   13.608319001674408
he may desire to become my heir and re   2.880414898923993
planchet sir   14.994347167823719
at length milady could hold out no longer   14.07191673438157
yet many things appeared very obscure to him in this half revelation   13.522025053508687
de boville he was in such a state of despair that it was evident all the faculties of his mind absorbed in the thought which occupied him at the moment did not allow either his memory or his imagination to stray to the past   10.323205441394546
france enfeebled the authority of her sovereign contemned her nobles returning to their former turbulence and insolence her enemies within her frontiers all proved the great richelieu no longer in existence   18.082008260821976
i could not help thinking so just now   15.502015370922068
i have let thee perish   17.18114759327662
monte cristo approached her and silently took her hand   14.362612163929143
he came to say that if these offensive precautions were not discontinued in two hours paris would be under arms   12.847826931913419
caderousse lingered for a moment then taking leave of old dantès he went downstairs to rejoin danglars who awaited him at the corner of the rue senac   11.77258798609823
i summoned all my strength and courage to my support   4.657000989093195
how does he come by his name his fortune   5.962682659126871
himself who took a pride in being considered a past master therein   16.44607752782333
i said my good fellow that i would do more single handed by the means of gold than you and all your troop could effect with stilettos pistols carbines and blunderbusses included   7.040707950893342
now it will scarcely require two years for me to communicate to you the stock of learning i possess   12.586635498191864
but he was beforehand with me he had quit the curacy the night before   10.941032271960495
peppino who cared little for being recognized now that he was in his own territories struck a light and lit a torch   11.670447543172088
a torrent whose bed was dry led into a deep gorge   15.286870435839505
these thoughts gilded as they were by a last reflection of love were not the less sad   13.99137599349797
yes but never with the same advantages said d artagnan in a tone of raillery   10.883106030671984
but what he saw made good what he lacked in perfect comprehension of the language   12.748209989317095
i am your only daughter and you are not so exacting as the fathers of the porte saint martin and gaîté who disinherit their daughters for not giving them grandchildren   13.73065454469487
carlini returned anxious to see his mistress and announce the joyful intelligence   12.602696565092812
the color mounted to the baroness s face and villefort turned awfully pale   6.4105179585239025
one step nearer said comminges putting down the sashes that the interior of the carriage might be well seen and placing his sword on his prisoner s breast one step nearer and i kill the prisoner   11.963323143094085
exclaimed the queen the friend of my husband   14.878789739080172
he gave them a tolerable repast   11.100006426859109
meanwhile all things considered and notwithstanding his suspicions as the wound might be serious he immediately sent off a mounted man to find a physician   7.908929419034635
and with these words monte cristo took from his pocket a small case containing his visiting cards and drew forth two orders on the treasury for 500 000 francs each payable at sight to the bearer   15.998831906462332
has she made a fortune also   10.347194626919725
chapter 42   9.34348294036719
i carry no sword this morning and can not return home to procure one   12.385490334427375
yes said he i came quickly   11.923164861941862
stay said debray   12.991540953359147
and he wiped his eyes still moist   10.7523373856738
but i can not suffer a poor old man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your fault   13.03208370852612
porthos had not only been well received by the company but he was moreover looked on with great admiration   9.425068930483437
very little except long live cromwell   14.91968151000703
now there remains the chevalier or the abbé d herblay as your majesty pleases   9.556710756389759
art thou dangerously wounded my dear mousqueton   14.745333063830198
then for the present m   8.504377391129239
it was the fault of that blockhead pastrini that i did not sooner assist you in your distress   15.882948167877089
in fact four men such as they were four men devoted to one another from their purses to their lives   9.613086448761567
that s lucky said athos shrugging his shoulders   10.846999594591146
the blade of a dagger was buried up to the hilt in the left side of the executioner   12.257449323873944
monsieur de tréville awaits monsieur d artagnan cried a servant throwing open the door of the cabinet   8.425830532768707
oh oh said the brigadier who thoroughly understood the trick   12.967654124625843
depend upon it the custom house people went rummaging about the ship in our absence and discovered poor dantès hidden treasures   18.254304379964772
when this was done eugénie opened a drawer of which she kept the key and took from it a wadded violet silk travelling cloak   20.357108229693036
come i am a good sort of a prince added he and although i like not puritans i do them justice   12.904958486095513
you see then that i speak to you in the queen s name   8.171485757229185
d artagnan approached the sovereign with every mark of profound respect and having fallen on his knees presented to her the cardinal s letter it was however merely a letter of introduction   17.167382578658184
but he was never to be found at home   10.300625508369958
porthos regretted that he had not at once made the lady of the red cushion a princess   16.899060110184976
so owing to your popularity no   13.420120798398957
now you get angry and attack our poor agents   17.461051335932932
perhaps you are right said aramis thoughtfully   14.252341492174082
you must understand it would be impolitic not to accept such a positive invitation   8.824232458891382
i do not believe you cried the soldier and he expired amid horrible tortures   9.263172508667896
this solitary place was precisely suited to the requirements of a man desirous of burying treasure   9.471068907722525
are you afraid that the holy spirit will come as a tongue of fire to open the doors of my prison   9.537452489043062
continued albert   9.550062201351558
ah monsieur mazarin monsieur mazarin said rochefort leading off his curate who had not found an opportunity of uttering a single word during the foregoing dialogue you will see whether i am too old to be a man of action   11.686280339653607
it is not difficult to divine that after all you have told me   13.912893763028853
cried the jailer retreating and putting himself on the defensive   13.928138591618374
there are no unimportant events in this world and we shall see that this apparently slight incident came near endangering the monarchy   8.758686514054526
how am i to justify it if i am here   11.368956970901953
i have been wrong   7.338411716542731
well what do you propose to do   13.539295637012362
and rising also he went off at a quick pace   13.245086016938238
but the principal features of his character were ambition and pride   15.420735524536436
the universal response was that the fare was detestable and that they wanted to be set free   11.06968706562467
shall i go and offer her my services   18.029662878525322
and now that i reflect about it i am glad to leave paris at this moment   9.337602587367625
then collecting all her strength she took the head of the young man between her hands looked at him for an instant as if her whole soul passed into that look and with a sobbing cry pressed her lips to his   11.92147182407014
however continued monte cristo drawing a small phial from his pocket i have an infallible remedy   13.63512872493116
oh saved saved   15.089339909137276
said aramis he resembles one of dante s damned whose neck apollyon has dislocated and who are ever looking at their heels   10.768748084384791
no he will not desert said the king   10.82928976530497
when the two were ready to go out the latter made grimaud the sign of a man taking aim and the lackey immediately took down his musketoon and prepared to follow his master   17.097944700883698
the morning dawned dull and gloomy and villefort saw the dim gray light shine upon the lines he had traced in red ink   10.488177191244061
you also stand aside he said to the masked man   13.662104891332689
but interposed monsieur de chavigny it seems to me that pistache is only doing what other dogs have done when they jumped for mademoiselle de pons   11.490006179866729
dantès had not eaten since the preceding evening but he had not thought of hunger nor did he think of it now   15.174167268330521
danglars but as he was not especially interested in poetical ideas he had gone into the garden and was talking with major cavalcanti on the projected railway from leghorn to florence   17.315066340893633
meantime the subject of the arrest was being canvassed in every different form   11.811779286843663
you had forbidden me to disturb you but the count of morcerf has called me   10.251598825279444
the secret cause of my presence within thy walls i have confided alone to him who only has had the power to read my heart   7.020632237837923
let us keep that paper carefully perhaps i have not thrown away my half pistole   11.634122758604319
and so closes our interview said andrea to the worthy steward   14.628170128220596
their greatest dread now was lest the stone through which the sentry was doomed to fall should give way before its right time and this they had in some measure provided against by propping it up with a small beam which they had discovered in the walls through which they had worked their way   12.718887110415766
in five minutes they arrived at the spot whence the noise had proceeded and then restraining their horses they advanced cautiously   14.470413639628939
well as for me i prefer hannibal   9.087399441217244
well said milady in a trembling voice why do you not enter   13.032955100856586
who will be waiting for me beyond the ditch   11.076428874449267
he passed them then returned so as to meet them exactly before the samaritaine which was illuminated by a lamp which threw its light over all that part of the bridge   8.487705610358043
let us recall the exact facts   12.962100815908022
to learn is not to know   13.913492219384072
you abuse my cookery because you dine at the table d hôte of the hôtel des princes or the café de paris   12.61359365262025
it was then richelieu s object not only to get rid of an enemy of france but to avenge himself on a rival   13.184174575510811
i have assumed the virtues that i had not   4.26414920407351
unfortunately however morrel had not only engagements with the house of thomson french who had shown themselves so considerate towards him   10.94226445229748
therefore you see me prepared to surrender my sword for after having accused my soldiers there can be no doubt that monsieur the cardinal will end by accusing me   12.31294940035746
d artagnan approved with a movement of the head and porthos with his voice   10.980075594564724
the count had learned that the two friends had sent to secure a box at the argentina theatre and were told they were all let   11.613347413895251
but i hear that he is ambitious and that s rather against him   11.766458509014324
just as the court was settling down in the cathedral a carriage bearing the arms of comminges quitted the line of the court carriages and proceeded slowly to the end of the rue saint christophe now entirely deserted   16.99430959357314
a troop   11.24132933796422
were you at the opera yesterday   14.992814147549476
the cicerone sprang into the seat behind   7.402489515080424
why do you do so   10.740976423238873
eight or ten   9.11840587122668
his eminence is not gone to bed and will not go to bed and wants you instantly   12.153328832636495
there will be some one at hand to pick it up   12.052553041615875
but porthos was not a man to abandon an old servant and when mousqueton rose above the water blind as a new born puppy he found he was supported by the large hand of porthos and that he was thus enabled without having occasion even to move to advance toward the cable with the dignity of a very triton   8.626146799864301
there it is all blood stained on the desk as a testimony of the crime   14.096303753020461
do as you please   10.518942229911021
very likely said albert   9.829075643745888
he saw that he was on the highest point of the island a statue on this vast pedestal of granite nothing human appearing in sight while the blue ocean beat against the base of the island and covered it with a fringe of foam   9.395136984032902
project gutenberg is a registered trademark   10.507763838534586
count andrea cavalcanti repeated the young man accompanying his words with a bow   11.373290998970145
morrel made a sign that he was ready to obey   12.186248012861597
in a very short time the noise of wheels was heard and the carriage stopped at the door   14.163727664485208
certainly at your first request   9.701665817014831
a shudder crept through the judges at the revelation of these unknown crimes   9.959700719756315
and yet said aramis i am somewhat of porthos s opinion   16.113137206541452
and with the exception of a file i have all that are necessary a chisel pincers and lever   7.891987828289057
shall i find you here then   15.909652580503415
everybody noticed that the king looked dull and preoccupied   19.092522009567745
perhaps we may take that meal at a later hour and in worse company   11.42318796645244
but the most fearful spectacle was noirtier being pushed towards the bed his face expressing all his meaning and his eyes supplying the want of every other faculty   11.77736266548276
though danglars could not see peppino the noise of his teeth allowed no doubt as to his occupation   10.883831142934234
gentlemen said athos my opinion is that it is not proper to allow lackeys to have anything to do in such an affair   11.142620441415444
what were you doing there   13.007120826774416
ah said the count you have then not forgotten that i saved your life   15.898314525422844
adieu till we meet again   16.59491110103741
de tréville listened to the young man s account with a seriousness which proved that he saw something else in this adventure besides a love affair   12.78880348957287
she was somewhat beautiful and exquisitely formed a little fairy like figure with large curls falling on her neck which was rather too long as perugino sometimes makes his virgins and her eyes dull from fatigue   13.004432975212122
the war cry of england is too often in the mouths of traitors   14.67860746260596
on arriving at the hotel de la chevrette they found the baron s equipage all ready and mousqueton on his saddle   11.237963956054854
alas sire answered athos your majesty has guessed aright   13.836651333236022
just at the moment when they were taking the dainty animal from the spit they saw edmond springing with the boldness of a chamois from rock to rock and they fired the signal agreed upon   14.363290856956349
his remarkably noble and austere expression struck morrel who began his story with trembling   10.338596830269019
i am not without a good reason for my conduct replied the banker   4.062265284028653
yes really   9.909446479378268
place the object which i desire to see in the ray of light which shines there and retire while i examine it   11.97739315470548
it is true nevertheless   13.531517922196535
she will enrich you and you will ennoble her   14.996615642108939
my first duty directly i had succeeded in recalling the babe to life was to restore it to its mother   14.101689725640824
where do you wish to be taken   10.172015784065723
to this monsieur de beaufort replied that since every opportunity of distinguishing himself in arms was taken from him he wished to make himself celebrated in the arts   12.667718018047577
you do not make raoul work so he takes his own way of employing himself   11.459780967420105
which road   8.549268478629447
the affair was described to the messenger with all the effervescence of enthusiasm   11.52534698037039
sire they are but men and men are become both weak and wicked   10.844144019891118
if you would condescend to be clever athos observed aramis i really do think you would be wittier than poor monsieur de voiture   11.92463308990393
oh cried andrea leaping with joy   16.585355266268575
my dear grimaud thou speakest seldom but when thou dost one must do thee justice thy words are words of gold   10.666308281617049
you are not exactly right m   16.52656343187248
she felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to magnify her own and still guided by the valet de chambre who never lost sight of her for an instant she was introduced to the magistrate s study   7.064018224392306
and whatever mazarin may say once on the shores of france your royal husband may find as many retreats and asylums as the seabird finds in a storm   8.670668170832307
and while he descended the stairs he heard the door closed and double locked   7.78241108817482
i hear no balls whistle and i see nobody   11.006333324392022
why when all was arranged   11.871166871866587
the road by which the carriage had disappeared encircled the forest   15.676444039118344
it was the man he called his phantom   11.967946410581977
toward the end of the evening however the beautiful lioness became milder   10.926297149062819
is she then the terrible witness to whose charge you dare not plead not guilty   13.872584971467203
if so he will have achieved a noble work   13.727722262525278
both inclination and positive necessity compel me to visit paris   11.168498047924176
the animal began to breathe again and as if he comprehended that they had come to his aid redoubled his efforts   11.447611566550023
well then your eminence said the queen becoming impatient what is your answer   12.946926878376091
it is closed after them and they are arrested   15.118890898297868
we are then reconciled dear monsieur porthos   12.932359288128767
why he is made of iron   10.1370893149119
he is first a father then a judge   11.481118202061879
let me carry it out and we shall laugh   12.722629744510638
cromwell s house   11.945041160847243
it appeared as if he had not expected so much from m   16.247165386976818
your eminence is right replied milady   12.581591944058447
speak then chevalier   17.843307397903025
i looked carefully around   11.405050909745245
the king replied that the words spoken in that interview had borne their fruit and that he desired another under the same conditions   14.356146380605576
not because his dungeon was so very disagreeable but because his uneasiness was so great   10.252725337745137
eustache   12.855484992680159
at length they entered a path which going out from the road skirted the mountainside   8.180550794373408
is it not a joke   13.693198064244703
some voices passed and faded away and the sound of a single footstep approached the door   11.401110753307771
but to his astonishment the room was suddenly illuminated   12.192244033672726
by that time we shall have returned   8.275338884141759
they were taking the part of a plebeian and in defending broussel they instinctively felt they were defending themselves   14.130345206878058
if they tried to catch him he would use his knife to better purpose   11.538675658546952
and that name of a town or village is written in her hand   12.447854784983223
never mind what he says morcerf said debray do you marry her   12.578101228387782
yes yes i understand very well ejaculated the baroness   14.939757576488658
de villefort and the radiant face of mercédès   14.68929105263764
come come continued d arminges to dinner   11.238199758110422
i shall work doctor when i work i forget everything   7.158107539819479
in that case they would have met with more fitting reward   8.197647740920809
go and fetch a physician   14.397184475583424
whilst raoul wrote on thus sir after a four hours march i stop to write to you for i miss you every moment and i am always on the point of turning my head as if to reply when you speak to me   11.731574320625153
yes but he must make haste   12.961171532489699
what is the meaning of that   13.786891189896377
the abbé rose and paced up and down pensively and then resumed his seat   11.736455163398604
you are the king s servant and must go wherever that service calls you   10.983745032986064
but tete a tete   11.79102281165077
inquired the young man perceiving that valentine hesitated   9.75803637906898
your blessing your holiness before you go i beseech you   5.605325133734899
in a pate   9.443278112636966
we have not a minute to lose   14.903742619948323
i make a hasty resolution   13.49176477897971
a sorrowful smile passed over his face   17.271351474841758
in favor of some member of your family   12.860402871802338
i doubt however said la ramee in sprightly allusion to the silence of his subordinate if he has said anything disagreeable to your highness   13.405743615670112
and you are far too exacting   8.760843146694473
d artagnan he called out in a coaxing voice will you answer for everything   10.096655913067472
why then not let me out by the door   4.011168455084263
he prayed and prayed aloud no longer terrified at the sound of his own voice for he fell into a sort of ecstasy   11.822737522550447
yes if we are better mounted than he   10.844368064657084
d artagnan swam to it and held it suspending himself by this rope his head alone out of water   10.91430552517496
allow me to present you my sincere congratulations replied madame de villefort   13.029897273336632
one would think we had tipped the wink   12.707110529172834
de morcerf the other day   7.902536206306299
i repeat that i am determined to have the announcement of yesterday contradicted   7.842367647875271
now my daughter learn from my lips how you may alleviate this misfortune so far as it will affect you   12.008524884782014
we bear witness to this said the two musketeers with one voice   14.245424073034984
and of what malady   14.975340605052267
and the result of the sitting was that the procurator s wife should give eight hundred livres in money and should furnish the horse and the mule which should have the honor of carrying porthos and mousqueton to glory   14.381840461977927
sir said comminges i am the bearer of an order from the king   16.981310992591755
and the count pressed her hand in reply as he had done eleven years before on the staircase leading to morrel s study   14.54392386861558
d artagnan pulled up his horse and whilst his musketeers continued to charge he returned and bent with drawn sword over the man he had knocked down   13.266155961387687
lackeys who have the order to warn their masters when anyone passes are not lackeys they are sentinels   13.083442576945309
if you plunge a dagger into your flesh if you insinuate a bullet into your brain which the least shock disorders then certainly you will suffer pain and you will repent quitting a life for a repose you have bought at so dear a price   13.888808895544924
albert as he took off his dress carefully preserved the bunch of violets   12.03325233716363
on the contrary i desire to stand high in her esteem   5.288696617626465
the judges proud of having a monarch to humiliate evidently prepared to enjoy the right they had arrogated to themselves and sent an officer to inform the king that it was customary for the accused to uncover his head   10.882623553896817
observing his indifference he shrugged his shoulders saying send on your business those who do theirs at the same time   11.058588825937958
the mind can see as well as the body   11.689185480605854
from time to time a dull sound was heard like that of a rising tempest or a billow of the sea   7.184385623328964
bah said debray when she had left these are fine projects   12.895403197159691
then the lamentations of the host and hostess pierced the vault of the cellar   10.962728206786583
morrel who forthwith conducting her up the flight of wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the feast was prepared was gayly followed by the guests beneath whose heavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of several minutes   10.068912997653126
let us sail before the wind and unless it changes we shall be drifted either to calais or boulogne   15.725506407493768
but the cardinal who feared that bassompierre a huguenot at heart might press but feebly the english and rochellais his brothers in religion supported the duc d angoulême whom the king at his instigation had named lieutenant general   11.812396089835628
the whole population was on foot   17.102010662154893
one fine morning the king commanded m   14.025401331761092
is it absolutely necessary then to send the money to luigi vampa   8.914632936154927
he therefore resolved to descend not through the same chimney by which he had come up but by a similar one conducting to another room   9.363807076539137
rochefort bit his lips in order to prevent a smile   5.170845635184714
murmured julie   6.287898262633296
in such cases extreme preoccupation is only to be combated by extreme carelessness   9.241789815678342
you do not like m   11.65934339335761
at nine o clock the next morning the drums beat to arms   10.063666722712068
as for my body it is lost   11.705420272617417
that is reasonable said the visitor   12.324167441458085
he again took in his strong arms the little girl whose pretty golden head and smiling face rested on his shoulder and placed her gently in the carriage   10.704360217525386
it was plain that this mode of proceeding piqued the lady in the black hood for she bit her lips till they bled scratched the end of her nose and could not sit still in her seat   8.818408096001317
force her door   12.439514170639429
men avenge them   16.584683392754513
andrea shuddered and looked on the young girl with an expression which proved how little he understood such ferocious honor   7.447746205036555
he had not so noble an air as athos and the commencement of their intimacy often rendered him unjust toward that gentleman whom he endeavored to eclipse by his splendid dress   12.418207930220383
an officer approached   9.109893263747242
at this moment aramis aroused by this unusual disturbance cautiously opened the door of his room   12.463870018058829
my faith monsieur he was in such trouble that i doubt if he can have retained a very clear recollection of me   15.649375982732249
and if he is killed well he will die bravely   14.564655329181509
oh monsieur athos was a noble gentleman said planchet was he not   14.146732134710321
alicante if you please   10.111073473160495
that which i have to say is too long and above all too secret   13.108542167509931
may i go and ask them that i may have the opportunity of making my peace with you   10.260659391374372
from this moment i declare the vendetta against you so protect yourself as well as you can for the next time we meet your last hour has come   11.526615779876614
the cause was not in dantès but in providence who while limiting the power of man has filled him with boundless desires   15.750435502086331
all the rest is my business   7.738246280097684
replied buckingham impatiently   5.985590343599384
and i sir said danglars shall be most happy to receive you   14.365143604396266
the young woman looked at him furtively   10.518619760922881
indeed he was all honey monsieur   12.158147359595914
do you understand that my dear franz no horses   14.76809121743436
you thought it a mercy then miserable wretch   10.676388962868767
and the man in the cloak said to him giving him his lantern light the lamp which hangs from the ceiling   14.569767306379898
she ran to her husband who immediately hastened to his agent and ordered him to sell at any price   14.372960109752437
they will treat you as a deserter i warn you   11.761290246116841
have you mentioned this death in your paper   14.23031073341281
the duke waited until midnight turning on his mattress like st   11.617030540550925
but neither the name of the traitor nor the treason   10.029897756693478
covet the goods of your neighbor   13.999784283953954
chapter lxxviii   8.91852840387576
no she must have conceived some pathetic scene   9.378004215542308
said milady listening in her turn to the noise of felton s steps which withdrew in a direction opposite to those of lord de winter   13.84669945519132
bravo bravi brava   10.665319536490404
if you received the work on a physical medium you must return the medium with your written explanation   15.291157564884386
from that moment we had no rest till we could find some trace in contemporary works of these extraordinary names which had so strongly awakened our curiosity   12.830470101782767
she had succeeded   14.156780784011698
that is to say you would rather not   16.171087906928964
no no continued danglars   13.156629421678396
at these words he gave me a ring   13.07929683103681
in the night he slept but in the morning refreshed and calm he was inspired with his clearest views of everything   14.16591915725651
very nearly replied planchet with a self satisfied air   11.005730616250144
morrel son   5.811368852509283
it was evident that he shared his master s apprehensions   16.275987050762367
de villefort arrived in a hired cabriolet at m   12.337332305491884
inquired porthos   13.771468549306295
a heart overwhelmed with one great grief is insensible to minor emotions   9.061926992502833
very well said porthos we will kill the sentinel and we shall have his arms   8.869962600631034
yes yes mazarin continued whilst his wonted smile full of subtlety lent a strange expression to his pale lips   9.27608753141529
of course you stopped at your father s   9.6044711000728
i shall remember old friends i can tell you that   9.289971698110037
speak to him yourself for ever since you were deputed by me to arrest the duc de beaufort this officer and i have been on bad terms   9.010654037456233
without doubt porthos had reasons for not abandoning this part of his vestments for instead of quitting his hold on the flap in his hand he pulled it toward him so that d artagnan rolled himself up in the velvet by a movement of rotation explained by the persistency of porthos   4.883527294331534
asked the commissary with an air of doubt   10.340097957458251
de monte cristo is as good as money   12.243384627985456
set to   13.458763846869104
the criminal strove to rise but ere he had time the mace fell on his left temple   14.7332149950463
if valentine is not now dead she will not die   10.495690758013703
but what raised public astonishment to a climax and set all conjecture at defiance was the knowledge that the same stranger who had in the morning visited the allées de meilhan had been seen in the evening walking in the little village of the catalans and afterwards observed to enter a poor fisherman s hut and to pass more than an hour in inquiring after persons who had either been dead or gone away for more than fifteen or sixteen years   10.813332088575521
to make a lunatic asylum of it similar to that founded by the count of pisani at palermo   13.20106726278854
nothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of our early childhood and with the exception of the two scenes i have just described to you all my earliest reminiscences are fraught with deepest sadness   11.062266068177081
well said beauchamp   13.229689608606751
the next morning at daybreak valentine and morrel were walking arm in arm on the seashore valentine relating how monte cristo had appeared in her room explained everything revealed the crime and finally how he had saved her life by enabling her to simulate death   10.8319429550727
on entering the rue tiquetonne he heard a tremendous noise and found a dense crowd near the house   12.743060771207928
ah i have come now to what is most difficult   7.69923477563022
dantès asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another even if it were darker and deeper for a change however disadvantageous was still a change and would afford him some amusement   17.47502965982237
but i did not tell you there would be an answer stupid   16.250363697347435
you are welcome gentlemen she said   11.744100709066934
aramis notwithstanding his self control could not refrain from a slight movement of surprise   5.085490084745929
while monte cristo unwilling by prolonging his stay to destroy the advantages he hoped to obtain made a farewell bow and departed leaving danglars to endure the angry reproaches of his wife   6.293474190112539
but replied madame danglars the count of monte cristo can know nothing or he would not seek our society as he does   8.088993354394685
i will say do you think you are engaged with a pygmy like yourself   10.729803500225277
you chevalier d herblay to his left   11.186404017069124
aramis opened the paper and in a voice trembling with hate and vengeance read d artagnan   8.865859259836547
peppino remained breathless   11.41490809007748
but she had her son   14.772318824705359
mercédès and albert were in that room   15.746908372648274
near the barrels stood selim my father s favorite whom i mentioned to you just now   13.381196157242657
oh it was cruel to us and dare i say it   16.13842832433137
villefort sprang into the room ran to valentine and took her in his arms   11.947872358332813
oh i was arranging a little surprise for you   12.216765798214437
then his dungeon seemed less sombre his prospects less desperate   12.225378072191397
well i call you and say to you friend felton john my child guard me and more particularly guard yourself against this woman   11.85844798001489
continued d artagnan with his frank expression   12.593384868758463
it happened however that the second soldier was a swiss of gigantic proportions so save that some few of the seams split his uniform fitted porthos perfectly   11.786030341740023
each moment s delay is an eternity for me   14.149008265103602
for at quarter past twelve i will cut off your ears as you run   15.94023428195199
when this species of summons was made the officer inquired aloud the point of the brig s departure its route its landings   13.813734070093908
an elegant carriage waited below and as it was drawn by two excellent horses they were soon at the place royale   15.994839750135984
which of the two horses will you ride that which you bought or the one that was given to you   16.392154181272627
but the sight of an old man clinging to life with so desperate a courage gave a fresh turn to his ideas and inspired him with new courage   10.230254599442748
on seeing the queen the men stopped short respectfully   10.372163167059202
hatred evidently inspired the englishman who knowing no other reproach to bring on the count accused him of avarice   12.875268708080796
shall i send the father to you   14.35153479218942
d artagnan was acquainted with villars cotterets having gone thither with the court on several occasions   10.975596991989473
said milady who having entered this track and perceiving that falsehood succeeded was determined to follow it to the end   11.206737981824482
well said the patron let what may happen it shall never be said that we deserted a good comrade like you   10.957007930815848
i was observing you both when you were walking in the garden and on my honor without at all wishing to depreciate the beauty of mademoiselle danglars i can not understand how any man can really love her   11.799584180465196
it seemed to him as though he were in a madhouse and was becoming as mad as those he saw   15.299507947145477
the scotch camp seemed as if at last awakened   13.389167792549053
who was your liberator   12.661483612817177
they fire like grooms said porthos   16.534538169906845
what above all manifested the shrewdness of the steward and the profound science of the master the one in carrying out the ideas of the other was that this house which appeared only the night before so sad and gloomy impregnated with that sickly smell one can almost fancy to be the smell of time had in a single day acquired the aspect of life was scented with its master s favorite perfumes and had the very light regulated according to his wish   18.63548833863274
why if you sought concealment did you call your horse vampa   8.484993119257306
ah ma foi   4.376062920238603
i succeeded a man of the most sublime genius that ever upheld the sceptre of france   13.850989170838133
this woman gave all the requisite particulars and it was intrusted to her   10.991617947144146
really my dear albert replied lucien lighting a manilla at a rose colored taper that burnt in a beautifully enamelled stand how happy you are to have nothing to do   12.406010400338712
oh no said villefort   13.468061412455768
but you are here my dear fellow let us speak of you   10.382075391710593
the house of morrel son anyone who had quitted marseilles a few years previously well acquainted with the interior of morrel s warehouse and had returned at this date would have found a great change   8.027857523139312
he could not bear solitude shared only by two corpses   5.33559603974248
they can even explain the marvellous by an algebraic calculation they have invented   14.971329132122737
speak said the duke   13.341242293849568
they found him in the large armchair which served him for a bed enjoying a calm nay almost a smiling sleep   12.554758871892458
so no more delay no more hesitation   6.165006613746682
at this moment mazarin became very uneasy at the turn which the letter was taking and paused to glance under his eyes at the young man   12.181794775653156
monte cristo rose and without making any answer for the tremulousness of his voice would have betrayed his emotion walked up and down the apartment with a slow step   12.885232239066037
for myself i want nothing   12.788991911819002
and as he bound her while saying these words milady uttered two or three savage cries which produced a strange and melancholy effect in flying away into the night and losing themselves in the depths of the woods   13.30856214357557
no upon honor and by the faith of a gentleman i bought it with the contents of my own purse answered he whom they designated by the name porthos   11.396122762910949
why it seems to me that the way in which he left us needs no explanation   11.356909608849328
you lie repeated the abbé a third time with a still more imperative tone   6.9904839732422746
he rode up a very quiet street looking to the right and the left to see if he could catch any vestige of his beautiful englishwoman when from the ground floor of a pretty house which according to the fashion of the time had no window toward the street he saw a face peep out with which he thought he was acquainted   12.387261849867711
on the contrary be off and quickly   10.50835166009269
their anxiety about their outfits had all disappeared and each countenance only preserved the expression of its own secret disquiet for behind all present happiness is concealed a fear for the future   10.368488945094398
what is this that m   9.50441452782573
and not without a deal of trouble too   12.184119814693053
true replied franz   8.913883187228066
he was accompanied by two of the yacht s crew   9.813675014347655
the night was dark but still the town resounded with those noises that disclose a city in a state of siege   20.692581696388466
when she recovered her father was by her side   11.655375446826206
these are melancholy doings your reverence which always fall again upon the poor   13.374821758457209
the matter is that you have proposed to me what is impossible said rochefort shaking his head with an air of disappointment   11.586497835086465
we are not living in the time of cardinal richelieu who would have closed the ports on bare suspicion   14.249672093297988
you no longer seem to love any of us   16.289971313108047
just now d artagnan continued you were disguised i mean to say attired as a murderer and now and now i look very much like a man who is going to be murdered   11.469450074226875
i am watching said porthos   13.249964305392664
chapter 49   10.113606438141364
i can comprehend that the spy may have been deceived by the person   10.981565194942165
now go returned franz or i shall go myself and bargain with your affettatore who is mine also   14.215652423012443
siete italiano   16.43361127279311
we will cross switzerland and go down into italy by the saint gothard   12.986134204797262
she began counting them remarking that they were much slower than the beatings of her heart   8.498290767606363
we are sworn once for all to implicit confidence and devotedness against all proof   6.430188699896753
what blows what blood   11.766868634109047
only of this i am sure i have dreamed he was dead and you know my dreams never deceive me   20.335158817793026
so blind were his contemporaries that they regarded the cardinal s death as a deliverance   11.952452555523191
let us go porthos but let us go well armed   10.672352896014754
for everything cried d artagnan who knew beforehand that he had not much to risk in engaging himself thus   16.026417908075516
you are unjust to a great poet it seems to me raoul ventured to say   16.718962278522667
that will spare me the troublesome and disagreeable task of coming to you for money myself   13.750988953231017
madame we are yours body and soul   13.804996836337196
franz questioned albert as to his intentions   10.494419158171695
what the devil are you doing there   9.916979036685857
give your orders said the three musketeers   17.909593400289246
aramis dipped a cloth into some water and applied it to the gash   12.178681896690122
and since then we have not seen the poor marquis three times   9.558161864310673
because said debray albert sent this morning to request us to come   18.0717057009654
i study the useful arts   11.02183947142369
you are right monsieur it is not with you that i have anything to do   15.426856755796244
you will then obtain the golden fleece if you are still in the ministry   9.09889769651602
madame he said you have wished to conquer the prince your brother that is to say the greatest captain of the age   8.054339017254163
and his buff boots still slightly covered with dust indicated that he had been on horseback in the course of the day   11.441710914675944
but make no treaty you understand me   17.003287048066596
i hoped to be able to rely upon that   7.249458312513463
you may well believe that we will not accept such steeds as these in exchange for those which had been promised to us   11.7011091036377
in a quarter of an hour he was entering the house in the rue du helder   12.904394523088925
i am getting more and more seasick   15.789139216344587
mordaunt bowed humbly   11.350565559449901
answered another voice which d artagnan instantly recognized as that of aramis   16.069700689498085
count i have reflected on the matter said franz i thank you for your courtesy but i shall content myself with accepting a place in your carriage and at your window at the rospoli palace and i leave you at liberty to dispose of my place at the piazza del popolo   10.0753471330422
that it is i who have opened the others which ought to have been opened by de wardes   8.49080191193201
she will however be in the salon in ten minutes   13.471135016640357
to promote your majesty s welfare madame replied mazarin fixing his penetrating eyes on the queen there is no sacrifice that i would not make   11.457288509215175
i hope so at least said cromwell rising and putting on his cloak   10.96197343999914

what could be the good of that   12.962627312836446
you shall live and you shall be avenged   13.722026784690822
but that idea if at last i have it your majesty will do us justice   13.146010996725394
that surely can not be denied to one who is accused   15.601168271421718
yes replied caderousse   13.756958114096767
and you will find traces of poison   15.414876618279113
let d artagnan speak said athos   8.552570949941908
true replied faria we are prisoners   16.671950464134582
i can t leave you alone in this abominable country   8.249081727579693
suddenly the ropes that still held it gave way and it disappeared in the darkness of the night like a vast sea bird   14.269933595006307
parliament can never have passed such an act as that   14.194434743548742
this made him less uneasy it must be owned than if the new comer had proved to be a customs officer   15.288829397082662
morcerf and château renaud were amongst the first to avail themselves of this permission   14.295703326348614
the tumult now began to increase   8.974149285430455
the ancona road replied the baron   10.883573041222611
when he was in england he seduced the wife of one of my friends   16.367624113440705
choose tyburn madame   10.778176008164019
that is because i am not his friend said she sighing but his victim   14.084960409780303
do you not know that all paris knew it yesterday and the day before it had already transpired on the bourse and m   15.540973616428776
are you making a sketch after poussin   15.842613106212738
but those of others that is quite another thing   12.220585117977313
with this consoling idea i leave you madame and most prudent wife without any conscientious reproach for abandoning you   12.353898246720014
adieu my dear rochefort   13.435460543636356
we were having a confidential conversation returned valentine   9.602744347205848
for the poison which she pours there is no antidote   10.943085611093812
d artagnan detained her by her night dress of fine india linen to implore her pardon   10.601047773125638
what are you no longer in possession of your senses   15.88050491476536
pardon my dear aramis but i thought you carried your eyes higher   11.26559855293948
then also as athos had predicted it became possible to find mme   8.699342775685631
but dantès knew it and had often passed it situated twenty five miles from pianosa between corsica and the island of elba and had once touched there   17.115685308714465
you are a hero my friend said mazarin gazing at the musketeer with admiration   15.875497665232416
your hand for perhaps we shall not see each other again   8.543909392806324
sir he said you have made a mistake   12.906120009313648
upon his return to the hotel franz found albert in his dressing gown and slippers listlessly extended on a sofa smoking a cigar   14.773782460851933
some were perusing the article others making comments and recalling circumstances which substantiated the charges still more   13.227392694375364
yes and at his age alexander cæsar and napoleon who have all made some noise in the world were quite behind him   14.589785619151876
signed abbé busoni   14.171085942638346
it is so rarely i make such a request i am sure you can not grudge it to me   10.618593194754837
well madame it will be a laudable action on your part and i will thank you for it   7.028948220438141
yes it is i said d artagnan it is i whom god has sent to watch over you   11.705026065232616
we severed our fetters with a file the englishman had given us and swam away   11.864110356884868
would you like to hear the story sir   12.800276698352384
is he danglars   14.416674546415368
did i not tell you just now that i was rich maximilian too rich   9.120800652216758
you undertook to do so   9.017049458135643
but what are you looking for   13.20195813670759
said athos and we will return to that subject later if such be your pleasure   11.31540393582968
but he is dead   13.014722853159302
the first thing he perceived through the damp gray mist was honest planchet who with the two horses in hand awaited him at the door of a little blind cabaret before which d artagnan had passed without even a suspicion of its existence   11.940974911605771
well said porthos i will run to the hôtel and engage our comrades to hold themselves in readiness by eight o clock   10.257630011469068
i have all my pay to take nearly three months wages   8.892700466575645
the count descended to the door of his mansion and beheld his carriage drawn by the very pair of horses he had so much admired in the morning as the property of danglars   9.13789073068807
this evening or tomorrow the cardinal will send someone to take you away   15.846928727353294
i have assassinated then and not executed   10.039000761907285
chapter xc   8.900077659950304
but what help is there for it   12.842777189951434
make haste and dress yourself   10.955072460630378
that which i found at your feet and replaced in your pocket   14.155968008358847
the sound had not yet died away when signor pastrini himself entered   13.299070641516069
i can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the learned world and the gentleman who was only a knight of the legion of honor was made an officer   13.47644886731974
of pale complexion and brown hair   13.22696689461052
and you have learned nothing from any other quarter   12.005302120593784
it was estimated at fifty thousand francs   15.684321089934365
d artagnan held the bridle of athos s horse and porthos that of aramis   16.81571020811736
denounced him as the enemy both of the king and the state and ordered him to retire from the court that same day and from france within a week afterward   15.606063063868028
and what did he say or rather do   14.870254571886885
demanded milady   17.830570165828327
thus in all their dreams their wishes and their conversations vampa saw himself the captain of a vessel general of an army or governor of a province   10.985108886514258
the house at auteuil monte cristo noticed as they descended the staircase that bertuccio signed himself in the corsican manner   8.177222927269986
and that applies very well to you   12.91953299354749
this chamber   11.731342495881178
time presses   7.826713394937232
d artagnan drew near the window and lent his ear   11.248588569239324
the knowledge of all which you will agree is not to be acquired without extended labor   15.189023063106063
it is impossible that she can carry to such a point maternal love or rather delirium   12.932702360532888
tell them to order number 25 to come downstairs   8.281802823320335
50063m ah   10.148009266420406
at this instant the door opened and the head of signor pastrini appeared   9.96404811377809
it is five minutes past seven and the appointment was for eight o clock   14.124497681360324
the heart of the young man overflowed with joy   15.512063564485318
the count of monte cristo s   14.765887023055209
noirtier was near the bed pale motionless and silent as the corpse   10.790716117229998
then said the traveller take these two venetian sequins and give them to your bride to make herself a pair of earrings   12.187036285957054
they were very happy   13.359154619945167
it was nine o clock in the evening   14.259693547773978
i am afraid that what was first done was unskillful if not worse than useless   14.946702428316376
about fifteen men were ranged around him and awaited the charge of cromwell s cuirassiers   4.689517997019507
she believes that someone has written to the duke of buckingham in her name   7.364132193147071
asked blaisois sharply is that their true drink   13.68143675583545
but the third time which is the present you may succumb   7.725371520902167
and the other i am the hammer of god in order that the divine essence in both might be revealed   12.85570635903656
but it was perfidiously stolen from me   13.134129269387387
and then you know he said an idea a supposition is sufficient   17.958259199731035
when you can find out a woman s age by her face it is useless to ask it   16.435027631024006
chapter 84   10.387512473016296
from the ends of these two wings extended the park   15.611332220210393
escape   11.320071472599588
yes let us go   8.640616586142759
madame danglars half fainted on the arm of villefort who was obliged to support himself against the wall   12.130462380167007
bravo cried château renaud   9.472002486416518
there you must find the curate or if he is not at home go to the convent of the augustines which is the last house on the right and bring me one of the brothers   9.029897421514892
return to france with us   11.410288118916258
say frankly what do you think of this business   8.260176084364076
all this appears to be a little mysterious   11.973430056125114
ah said caderousse no   14.16773100639386
porthos s plan appears to me to be impracticable said d artagnan inasmuch as i am myself ignorant of what instructions i can give you   12.560634701330807
de la trémouille a protestant and seeing the king seldom was of no party he did not in general carry any bias into his social relations   16.94719663537677
have you read the arabian nights   13.802562743520074
the world however is mistaken   6.6649843523426915
your treasure   11.544034831467304
but only one of these two is about to die   6.344549185061108
the president resumed i was on the spot at the death of ali pasha   9.78269792996909
the light no longer burns in yonder window   13.194356124062455
the duke fights against us   15.13915910720762
and the proof is that there were five of the cardinal s guardsmen against my three musketeers and monsieur d artagnan   12.37697467343418
your majesty is mistress said la meilleraie retreating a few steps   11.73756511849033
some few minutes had elapsed and the stranger began to show manifest signs of impatience when a slight noise was heard outside the aperture in the roof and almost immediately a dark shadow seemed to obstruct the flood of light that had entered it and the figure of a man was clearly seen gazing with eager scrutiny on the immense space beneath him   7.770465808004374
stand on one side d artagnan stand on one side cried athos   13.605452181436522
then we are upon the fugitives   10.51310528422797
asked eugénie   11.05699792372489
ay   11.8200071470375
do you want a map   14.541360074577446
then he closed one eye in token of inquiry   12.204790159259257
an indescribable ray of joy illumined that wretched countenance like the last ray of the sun before it disappears behind the clouds which bear the aspect not of a downy couch but of a tomb   15.508248836786066
i did not even wish to know her name nor do i know it   11.434362108559874
cried he in a hoarse voice come here   13.624907928871597
as he had foreseen lens had fallen into the hands of the enemy immediately after raoul s departure   11.001478663773412
is the king dead   7.3661356126750475
to the cardinal   18.162656730038854
every door was opened to him   13.550366552092653
we will take a bite and shall be there as soon as you are   15.274161058559724
but i am wrong to dispute with my master   13.136858411791245
to donate please visit www   5.491527112898158
bernouin introduced him   8.39388330088524
albert took beauchamp aside and communicated these ideas to him   10.767060502223767
this vexes you   15.58031164286785
in short madame danglars not being able personally to examine in detail the domestic economy and household arrangements of a man who gave away horses worth 30 000 francs and who went to the opera with a greek slave wearing diamonds to the amount of a million of money had deputed those eyes by which she was accustomed to see to give her a faithful account of the mode of life of this incomprehensible person   13.172627884658356
yes yes poor captain leclere   8.392224954077465
the fact is i look to my turn for keeping guard with horror   12.720035298568817
all the others remained on the right hand bank where they fell on their knees   6.669338870583161
that is to say you are for us   18.14967386032124
morrel was not insensible to that sensation of delight which is generally experienced in passing rapidly through the air and the wind which occasionally raised the hair from his forehead seemed on the point of dispelling momentarily the clouds collected there   12.735680410274918
said d artagnan giving his hand to the count   5.101869295672709
silence was re established   8.725116282344061
they resumed their route   15.246173688385463
let me stay here   14.277350183275649
you are certainly treating your cousin very handsomely   6.579577965691242
oh it s only a temporary postponement replied aramis   11.442869302322022
have no more concern about me   10.836698870244476
i won t hold my tongue   12.085606509938872
said d artagnan drawing his pistols from his belt you will kill nobody if you please   11.081751540989835
and this all knew so well that it was a double victory for the court a victory at home and abroad   15.146551276504418
his first visit was to aramis at whose residence he had not been since the famous evening on which he had followed mme   13.763931906053685
shivering for want of a fagot   10.787441472711679
very near only half a league from the barriers it is at auteuil   12.118072905563789
said the doctor with the impiety usual in persons of his profession   16.538923841123513
sire replied the queen with a faltering voice because in the midst of such a crowd as this i feared some accident might happen to them   10.143879551725561
planchet and grimaud appeared in their turn leading their masters steeds   15.813561459044918
poor woman   11.289316179338762
he added whirling his sword around him   12.611897030986748
monsieur he continued addressing raoul if you are not too tired follow me   15.980397599604085
i have sometimes thought as you do athos   12.71103363923381
go and tell lord de winter that his prisoner has fainted for this event not having been foreseen i don t know what to do   12.723701664837572
monsieur de tréville was but a younger son of a simple gascon family like me madame   14.566561136439807
the footmen were hastening through the rooms with waiters loaded with ices   9.607036539187176
i can not bear duelling ever since two seconds whom i had chosen to arrange an affair forced me to break the arm of one of my best friends one whom you all know poor franz d épinay   9.085755427099334
said porthos turning toward another musketeer   13.836899023578853
follow me then said the sentinel   10.842690420814252
no on the faith of a cardinal   13.615189039143921
but then your word is given   11.632337596163175
and monte cristo placed the bonds in his pocket with one hand while with the other he held out the receipt to danglars   12.605865645571821
seventeen   13.4604270887909
i tell you   14.793474571391101
a fleur de lis said athos   13.953963018480303
buckingham left alone walked toward a mirror   12.211218821943742
danglars in the same tone in which he would have said oh well what do i care   16.898041999812303
mute with horror the three friends had remained open mouthed their eyes dilated their arms extended like statues and motionless as they were the beating of their hearts was audible   11.073338091227244
doubtless my dear viscount you will not be taken by force   10.074600135031737
noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort because she is going to marry a man whose father he detested he can not have the same cause of complaint against this dear edward   15.183442496645267
i would not go at all said aramis   12.381398218247265
you are there sir   9.463172396978326
is anyone ill in the house   11.629434540525939
mousqueton was however somewhat consoled by d artagnan who the next day told him that in all probability war would always be carried on in the heart of paris and within reach of the chateau du vallon which was near corbeil or bracieux which was near melun and of pierrefonds which was between compiegne and villars cotterets   4.5178036654019795
he is very susceptible   10.918575629667567
asked athos fixing his clear benevolent glance on the countenance of the gascon   11.742008462886565
yes let the sermon be clear said the curate   8.05790828325521
the walls are double the thickness of the rest   14.148021280717796
great is truth muttered the count fire can not burn nor water drown it   9.072800186305042
yes the idea was yours   7.068458250778549
but you know better than i do that there are certain reasons why she can never abandon mazarin   11.351157782484265
the citizen followed him   9.797877551854484
well he will do more than he has promised   10.981993135973465
i thought they might be useful so i took them   11.507824228172955
hatred is blind rage carries you away   7.783135129962815
de tréville knows him and esteems him very highly and de tréville as you know is one of the queen s greatest friends   15.419788915136111
by thieves   12.781852459000334
but the count of monte cristo surrounds me with every paternal care and i am ignorant of nothing which passes in the world   19.12641016925566
you are mistaken in thinking so returned franz calmly   13.846996865659367
well do me the kindness to take my purse which i left on the mantelpiece   19.542919897021207
before he could defend himself that arm struck him so violently in the back that he let go the ladder crying help   15.285273380664567
yes continued he a charming woman who entertained kind views toward our friend d artagnan who on his part has given her some offense for which she tried to revenge herself a month ago by having him killed by two musket shots a week ago by trying to poison him and yesterday by demanding his head of the cardinal   16.740293863301783
command sir   15.665986313186847
i am not by any means resigned   9.531146789634093
villefort made a violent effort and in a tone he strove to render firm sir said he i am no longer able as i had hoped to restore you immediately to liberty   13.732030703864853
edward you naughty boy exclaimed madame de villefort snatching the mutilated book from the urchin s grasp you are positively past bearing   6.484728750621837
yes your french husband   16.69727908323264
oh yes said kitty clapping her hands very willing   12.958277825609155
they are coming to meet us   9.60210021578283
all at once his ear caught a sound resembling that of a stone rolling down the staircase opposite the one by which he had himself ascended   13.021440034572276
but who is to carry the letter to tours and who to london   9.59686578115615
you know that she is and i demand her liberty of you   17.233232989831848
idolized by edward who notwithstanding his fear of the count s large black eyes runs to meet him the moment he arrives and opens his hand in which he is sure to find some delightful present m   7.61269452264798
no one must know this secret my dear but yourself   6.491351461441818
a hoarse broken tone which was neither a cry nor a sigh escaped from her while she became deadly pale   12.37786193306188
it was then striking half past ten by st   12.419828199914011
thou knowest that mushrooms from the wood of vincennes are fatal to my family   12.732782524432361
the apparent reason at least said madame de villefort   18.54410004232825
however flattering this compliment the officer made no reply   8.982229358205759
noirtier s eye bade her stop   14.095803765768569
as to lord de winter he contented himself with calling the woman who waited on milady and when she was come he recommended the prisoner who was still fainting to her care and left them alone   7.298893843742991
and you sir continued the president with a calmness still more terrible than the general s anger i advise you not to touch your sword   18.02233467639673
there reigned a perfect stillness in the house   12.120529272452618
and on what account   8.360360945727528
since i set my foot in france and knew the traitor lived in paris i have watched carefully   13.469824847759607
and monte cristo drew another packet from his pocket   13.878412772175492
know then what i thought i had already told you that in participation in this world s affairs more especially in their moral aspects the count of monte cristo has never ceased to entertain the scruples and even the superstitions of the east   13.891393099473923
it is the first time i ever saw her in this condition said valentine   13.97702541494539
my orders   9.468868124988205
the same thing that happened to brutus the night before the battle of philippi   12.017497814879182
to ask me if i want money   12.27561453055046
d artagnan opened the letter and read as follows dear d artagnan dear du vallon my good friends perhaps this may be the last time that you will ever hear from me   12.374311028606513
his paleness terrified athos who however consented himself with saying that s a sad throw comrade   12.4639975268301
was there nothing to fear   13.34254123356947
this evening your destiny begins to change   8.235265707586496
now i can move neither my right arm nor leg and my head seems uncomfortable which shows that there has been a suffusion of blood on the brain   14.982204687228808
now monsieur de chavigny is not amiable i allow but monsieur du tremblay is considerably worse   17.03706470523951
from time to time noises came in the direction of the public markets   13.256331351180647
well then tell him this rochefort   6.231454221327107
yes yes war said anne of austria   13.606014945979636

drive to the palace said comminges to the coachman who was by then more dead than alive   11.548720095060977
what can the chancellor have to say to me that your majesty could not say yourself   14.362822368170768
you are about to see said mousqueton looking at blaisois with an expression of superiority which the latter did not even think of questioning you are about to see blaisois how we old soldiers drink when we are thirsty   11.464211773027282
the two friends rode rapidly down the declivity of the faubourg but on arriving at the bottom were surprised to find that the streets of paris had become rivers and the open places lakes   12.975096564802108
i received this morning five millions which i paid away   12.13144148841454
d artagnan saw that the moment was come   5.461867920774152
and after pressing the hand of athos d artagnan chose a moment when the ship rolled backward so that he had only to plunge into the water which was already up to his waist   14.43489515119252
you have only escaped from mademoiselle danglars piano to be attacked by haydée s guzla   12.49216126813097
probably lord de winter perceived this emotion   13.091564255650416
it lasted nearly three hours   8.607353404418491
and it was this young man who brought the monk to you   12.379069362085382
when shall we two walk together   12.486296725959651
i have looked at it with all possible attention said dantès and i only see a half burnt paper on which are traces of gothic characters inscribed with a peculiar kind of ink   14.547135068857898
each of the captains then led his company to the louvre where the king held his review   14.991937553092054
there is an enormous quantity of rats in that cellar   13.080984861130695
he had only found the first grotto   12.626585610329087
porthos comprehended that this chest although it did not correspond in shape with that which he had seen in his dreams must be the blessed coffer and he congratulated himself that the reality was several feet higher than the dream   13.878949489239588
the second time it was to demand who had sullied my name   15.27090872601502
all the horrors that disturb my thoughts make your house odious and fatal   13.791569306138387
he was then reconducted by the little staircase instead of passing through the ante chamber where d artagnan was waiting   12.442758990192793
he exclaimed suddenly where is my son   9.765551671653489
it is very interesting he said but it must be very tedious for a lifetime   11.728294384652
your never failing cheerfulness raises poor souls in affliction   13.250624043449932
now i can promise you that a frenchman might show himself in public either in tunis constantinople bagdad or cairo without being treated in that way   7.3303571176690685
i reached the lower door   14.081833640777157
are you ready sir   13.444823137731616
come come gentlemen said mordaunt impatiently let us depart   17.459832712295317
and will you make the same promise to my love   7.925705020981
i do not know him returned monte cristo   11.003317343837681
in fact porthos did not appear   12.63581308776005
oh the women the women   15.201610618740519
read this letter he said handing it to her   17.014382141052444
a general exclamation of surprise ran round the table with the exception of the elder dantès whose laugh displayed the still perfect beauty of his large white teeth   15.741712273684337
most fearlessly   14.691564443405111
at the expiration of a minute or two it appeared to d artagnan that m   8.830199785368068
blancmesnil and broussel seemed in the highest favor   11.937657445054898
any alternate format must include the full project gutenberg™ license as specified in paragraph 1   17.012090777076125
i have the price   11.003810668721787
you will also see that the greek servants hold no communication with those of this country   5.917641158010119
maximilian emmanuel if we do but discover him he must believe in the gratitude of the heart   15.744598831352842
the whole assembly were dumb with astonishment at the revelation and confession which had produced a catastrophe so different from that which had been expected during the last fortnight by the parisian world   13.49344075046319
and will you not torment me any more   7.6426261104730795
yes i know what you mean he said   14.769976144531089
that continued the cardinal arose not only from a feeling of natural equity but likewise from a plan i have marked out with respect to you   12.560142121031834
but where is franz   14.124722664069829
more than once the king had been humiliated by the cardinal whose police without having yet attained the perfection of the modern police were excellent being better informed than himself even upon what was going on in his own household   12.72487796564642
they were thus engaged when the count of monte cristo entered   8.215729335142534
merely the term unlimited nothing else certainly   13.153693310333903
ah exclaimed madame danglars alarmed what is there more to hear   12.130834560326205
but in the meantime   10.705484558399998
the child dropped from his arms and rolled on the floor by the side of its mother   14.0043741453452
during the six years that he had been imprisoned what might he not have accomplished   9.896838936240297
this modern place of entertainment stood on the left hand side of the post road and backed upon the rhône   9.03981054622126
the three friends burst into laughter   13.385215820328686
and i i tell you against both   16.305750312927604
and what did the count do   7.441699483476731
de villefort for you must be fatigued after so long a journey   13.365625755100739
morrel bounded to the door opened it and found valentine stretched out at the bottom of the stairs   9.711244189932152
i should only regret if the horse had not proved good   16.05490430028533
ah that is something said albert   12.026038882621446
i will tell the coadjutor said bazin   13.241495849496518
recollect that parisian gossip has spoken of a marriage between myself and mlle   16.556095240254468
certainly though valentine still labored under dreadful nervous excitement she was better   12.510907750297612
albert could not see the face of the countess as it was covered with a thin veil she had put on her head and which fell over her features in misty folds but it seemed to him as though her voice had altered   13.174821091675609
where the devil did you find out that   16.807357834837518
from haydée   12.924583804480651
could not contain himself and he made a step toward the queen s apartment with that pale and mute indignation which when it broke out led this prince to the commission of the most pitiless cruelty   10.275021675317461
the captain descended last or rather he did not descend he would not quit the vessel   9.195851076888378
and i doctor you know a man does not arrive at the post i occupy one has not been king s attorney twenty five years without having amassed a tolerable number of enemies   10.894950481708317
you must be aware that for our undertaking company would be in the way   12.387125990758003
will you now have the kindness to explain the nature of the statement which has displeased you   16.63532288685172
now i recollect what   11.932867662400175
do you know any other counter poisons   14.239095453314217
maximilian said he are your affections disengaged   9.469005037512485
athos you make me tremble   9.763427893126586
callest thou thyself eloa or astarte   14.16829374649532
cried the abbé i i die i 0229m so sudden and violent was the fit that the unfortunate prisoner was unable to complete the sentence   15.066448302579722
the carmelite convent at béthune great criminals bear about them a kind of predestination which makes them surmount all obstacles which makes them escape all dangers up to the moment which a wearied providence has marked as the rock of their impious fortunes   10.013784543787832
i shall be back here by the first of march and on the second i give my real marriage feast   9.30140440299746
ah ma foi under any circumstances   7.466736757144356
interested man   14.614490725267352
for those who were neither the one nor the other he was a statue of the law made man   10.239090890553184
after remaining for a short time in the parterre surrounding the house and gathering a rose to place in her waist or hair she turned into the dark avenue which led to the bench   8.885821407286555
ma foi my dear sir replied franz make no apologies   7.772299302939826
let us see your idea aramis said athos who felt much deference for the young musketeer   13.639979556086727
and the yacht   15.097397497301719
but she could not marry your brother being already married in france and having been d artagnan stopped as if seeking for the word and looked at athos   8.0681465816781
he went straight to the queen and in an altered voice said why madame have you not thought proper to wear your diamond studs when you know it would give me so much gratification   16.247700755699046
he flattered himself he should be able to frighten porthos with the adventure of the baldric which he might if not killed upon the spot relate to everybody a recital which well managed would cover porthos with ridicule   10.524758497045317
this paper my friend said faria i may now avow to you since i have the proof of your fidelity this paper is my treasure of which from this day forth one half belongs to you   15.893562844033726
no sir i assure you muttered raoul it is not   11.114125728789023
and now gentlemen that s well continued the cardinal   16.470095282387568
i am very tired and as i have not eaten so good a dinner as you i can scarcely stand   9.87057063967268
after reading the first lines of the letter mazarin gave a side glance at him to see if he was watching the expression of his face as he read   12.69826273114848
villefort fell on his knees   12.714613953038146
a terrible inclination seized d artagnan to grasp the mercer by the throat and strangle him   10.216314970853972
at the outer door the steward paused   11.458908066398768
will it last long   9.562183325126805
this athos then was a very extraordinary man   15.604186067675997
and you have no way to get news of them   13.696019790070338
both orleans and montargis are ours   9.647823388712773
the count followed them with his eyes his hands resting on the shoulders of the youth whose height was almost equal to his own   10.86344611230915
eugénie danglars said monte cristo   15.037620966895288
you see said lord de winter presenting d artagnan to his sister a young gentleman who has held my life in his hands and who has not abused his advantage although we have been twice enemies although it was i who insulted him and although i am an englishman   13.49559826221874
yes for his eminence will give you all that you want land money and titles   13.996669207581334
when i awoke a fresh meal was served   5.671700267725058
still the beatings of your heart   15.589962094421296
ah sir you have a noble heart   12.950886404785269
you sir   12.100004416638475
before the entrance of the magistrates and indeed frequently afterwards a court of justice on days when some especial trial is to take place resembles a drawing room where many persons recognize each other and converse if they can do so without losing their seats   13.870888107077514
i was trying on my wedding suit   10.144921089649056
one two three four five said monte cristo   12.88528615520524
let us be the avant guard said he to porthos and find good quarters at saint germain   14.3404306473413
the queen had written the keeper of the prison at saint germain will set councillor broussel at liberty   11.818103438991015
suddenly   11.060714739366976
back people   13.60405792240557
it is not so much the loss of the money that vexes me said villefort though after all 900 000 francs are worth regretting   10.435945862972375
and where do the servants sleep   9.079775745287828
there exists a man who has received me in this island entertained me right royally and has departed while i was asleep   12.493545232815706
but when it is not there are fifty others in the world who would do better than he   11.45851775883882
these citizens are dreadfully ridiculous observed d artagnan to porthos and went on his way   15.020969360064118
ah you philosophize replied villefort after a moment s silence during which like a wrestler who encounters a powerful opponent he took breath   9.317781994501502
change these lackeys said he   12.594517178444981
his nose quite straight and projecting direct from the brow was of the pure greek type while his teeth as white as pearls were set off to admiration by the black moustache that encircled them   19.081839073184092
he beat a retreat toward the market but there he met planchet with his halberdiers   12.612594734655264
yes replied the man but at what a price   16.64158427073498
whenever monseigneur wishes i am always at at his eminence s orders   14.66524026720127
and she assumed upon sitting up in the armchair a still more graceful and abandoned position than when she reclined   4.49353214895212
villefort s dusty garb his costume which was not of courtly cut excited the susceptibility of m   11.211222598504353
but the new skin was spotted by the poison till it looked like a tiger s   14.383054888798425
you have been to london   9.507069252521289
thy master was in the wrong   16.150544139425346
we render service to god madame in serving a prince so unfortunate a queen so virtuous   9.353465091912335
but it is beginning again i say   12.791081070095661
will there be any mass   16.574483388603262
you are right said milady   12.251389669120659
you are ambitious it is natural   7.168364076935633
it was the island of tiboulen   8.926257578700856
to be a woman condemned to a painful and disgraceful punishment is no impediment to beauty but it is an obstacle to the recovery of power   10.66297545719519
the first card struck off was taken according to your orders to the baron danglars rue de la chaussée d antin no   13.183227344597245
they explained what had occurred that evening   11.621756983252135
haydée had remained until the close of the meeting   10.50049545173292
cried the king all radiant a complete victory   10.525874939476658
any why not this evening   18.039357352910336
if that does not suit you you can point out what other hours you prefer and in this respect your wishes will be complied with   13.107980479795904
but she murdered the woman i loved   13.108562403544566
vampa smiled disdainfully at this precaution on the part of the bandit went before teresa and continued to advance with the same firm and easy step as before   13.636939681090785
she had heard something said about supper   8.864287298905356
it is a misfortune and government owes nothing to his family   15.33143566670515
when the young man on board saw this person approach he left his station by the pilot and hat in hand leaned over the ship s bulwarks   14.536479700078546
it is not worthwhile   9.26136583448926
he fancied he heard the sound of a piece of furniture being removed   13.226160827109421
de villefort went to the door which he closed behind the child and bolted   7.996398910806183
but what shall i wear   11.168957741050972
asked madame danglars   14.993044556034079
at beauvais they stopped two hours as well to breathe their horses a little as to wait for porthos   11.05654474635811
very inconvenient upon my word   13.321811631529894
she is to correspond with nobody   14.70752557390846
he found the cardinal dressed as an officer and he looked very well in that costume which as we have already said he wore elegantly   8.13805613624259
because then i knew not who you were   13.290955187398273
that is had formed the sign of the cross in the air with his thumb and as he seated himself in the carriage muttered a short prayer   15.240883454884306
it is not very difficult to say   13.104157554259217
besides i have signed   6.899410543440745
my wife adores me and there is yet time   11.943973093268474
the weak man talks of burdens he can raise the timid of giants he can confront the poor of treasures he spends the most humble peasant in the height of his pride calls himself jupiter   9.674201899986091
but feigning not to perceive either he immediately resumed the narrative begun by his wife   10.836635447857184
on reaching the jetty athos and aramis stopped to look at a little boat made fast to a pile and ready rigged as if waiting to start   15.64608231537237
nothing therefore was settled that day as emery s head was not steady enough for business after such an occurrence   9.460205672031819
keep your money keep it i say   13.29941933591768
you lose ground you are turning   10.510681559333689
said the sentry you may now go on   10.866956368319443
you have ample proof to the contrary if you look opposite said the baroness as she laughingly pointed to the beautiful greek   14.69231710649631
for i am a man and have suffered like yourself and also contemplated suicide   13.654666986737567
if we had been five   13.930498100790997
i was indeed said the stranger with a tone of sweet melancholy and with the sonorous voice peculiar to the east   13.68354137824157
he staggered and his voice was almost choked   10.059743431071855
that is he except that his beard has turned gray and his hair is white   13.052684748908765
nay that he can almost work a miracle   14.400978715536887
i am in his majesty s guards monseigneur and i have no reason to be dissatisfied   7.564465835891948
he has slain his uncle   13.074973775524455
make your mind easy he is in good hands   17.00603000271205
edward ran out   10.589645284298431
d artagnan examined the countenances of his companions which like that of athos wore an impression of deep anxiety   12.64829641161244
i am much obliged by your kind intentions towards me said monte cristo   12.622665476165192
athos uttered a cry of joy and admiration ran to a closet and drew forth workmen s clothes which the four friends immediately put on   11.674254166733384
but his name   13.427569195497533
at the other end of the room under a white sheet which covered it lay the corpse still more alarming to morrel since the account he had so unexpectedly overheard   11.622832021756375
the fate of our friends to say nothing of our own is perhaps in that very despatch   14.41038699420604
but do not touch with the tip of your finger a single hair of d artagnan who is a faithful friend whom i love and defend or i swear to you by the head of my father the crime which you shall have endeavored to commit or shall have committed shall be the last   10.978303933816731
and attention   12.27321586202344
i have not been in bed for two nights   6.6485767517133585
you spoke to me athos resumed of porthos   8.958971630557674
in my turn i uttered a cry but a cry of joy   12.49558224849693
besides he had the cardinal s hundred pistoles in his pocket so he went into the hotel without a word   15.528009375449358
asked the queen for i hear them   13.60559088025337
athos fancied he had seen him among the crowd   7.326765515150215
as to the rest in eight days you will be where you ought to be and my task will be completed   11.830232512495977
nothing my lord except that he is tormented with remorse   13.930637164176321
said morrel you dead   12.299515065401964
when he had perused the documents an indefinable expression of pleasure lighted up his countenance and looking at the major with a most peculiar smile he said in very excellent tuscan then there is no longer any such thing in italy as being condemned to the galleys   11.112915833173277
the carriage stopped at the door of the palace   15.408254581933672
well then i decide   12.554968854708045
a ride in the wood in the phaeton or on horseback will refresh you   13.04797632159103
quick as a flash he raised her in his arms and placed her in a chair   13.243966203054155
is it your father   11.35631728293439
at length the reading of the indictment was ended   10.825244737403285
then he stepped into his coupé calm and smiling and was at home in five minutes   13.921192685407455
then added in a low whisper you understand that on account of your uncle m   15.035965083797375
you do not want your lackey   8.261909931502064
a woman   15.171248401809866
the young musketeer was in excellent disposition to die heroically   8.550296571904331
for i had forgotten him said the lieutenant   5.391717233758889
valentine said morrel death is in itself sacred   12.801265672802652
one hundred thousand francs for a loaf   11.916212210265096
ma foi i should like to smoke   11.492702210386877
d artagnan and planchet remained for some moments still on the defensive   15.839124649967815
what is it that we really desire   5.957378744873468
alas i guess it   9.953377693907136
said mordaunt with a sneer there s one who is afraid   11.235914530045996
they withdrew to a private house and as they had reason every moment to fear for their safety they occupied but one room and provided an exit which might be useful in case of an attack   12.438297555432879
traitorous monsieur   11.419086284357043
which of the two denounced him   14.011113468556292
i will be accountable for her said athos   13.832219854398936
asked lord de winter   12.088209531447482
exclaimed madame de villefort   10.153573520767772
but you are rich valentine   13.048754163671935
the cardinal then was seeking to preserve him from some misfortune which threatened him   11.554444939580486
so once more good night   10.64235652437958
ali left the room   7.081998864001945
he thought the carriage was about to stop there   14.619799231780132
shall we be quite retired   10.636858286256865
did he name no one in his passion   12.902792428706721
his vengeance therefore consisted in coining curses on the head of mazarin   13.045413598909564
the man was caderousse he was pale and his shirt was all bloody   8.248674823081226
however jacopo insisted on following him and dantès did not oppose this fearing if he did so that he might incur distrust   19.44824404091376
then gentlemen you will not oppose our executing the orders we have received   14.70117404365919
it is hashish the purest and most unadulterated hashish of alexandria the hashish of abou gor the celebrated maker the only man the man to whom there should be built a palace inscribed with these words a grateful world to the dealer in happiness   12.660857621291784
comminges villequier and guitant were behind her and the women again were behind the men   19.955849829370717
remember if you talk if you babble if you get drunk you risk your master s head who has so much confidence in your fidelity and who answers for you   10.810144420579153
the carriage continued to roll on with rapidity   10.828709969607546
resolved to seek an explanation on all these points on the following day d artagnan in spite of his fatigue prepared for an attack and determined that it should take place after breakfast   15.457280667983749
as to mme   14.591973775480099
commend me to a sailor for going the quick way to work   12.369490282825344
it was to this apartment he had desired his guest to be shown with the purpose of overwhelming him at the sight of so much luxury   14.960264257219738
they had expected resistance they had expected to be thwarted to have to force the gates to overturn the guards   15.291707985589078
the count leaned over her and raised her in his arms   11.959568531317743
he desired me to tell your grace replied felton that he very much regretted not having that honor but that he was prevented by the guard he is obliged to keep at the castle   9.834547711128895
what lord ruthven do you mean   8.996860269148307
you need not fear   5.1869699417690835
he wished to subdue this woman in his own name   12.391688772599453
as he approached it noirtier s gaze followed him and his eyes appeared of such a fiery brightness that villefort felt them pierce to the depths of his heart   8.631191702658736
what do you say to that   10.374023972381849
de villefort formed the idea of uniting in the bonds of affection the two children of these inveterate enemies   11.357258205717516
the count looked at it with terror but without daring to inquire its meaning he rushed towards his apartment   9.812499890153571
upon arriving at her hotel franz perceived that she had deceived him when she spoke of expecting company   11.232706918313102
your pardon replied danglars i merely said you seemed in a hurry and we have lots of time   12.260257700821697
he followed where they led him   15.006191079799637
this began to be annoying   8.117100678446178
replied milady for whom this conversation began to have a real interest   11.5540391452858
monte cristo was for an instant alone   12.079406180863035
but your father died in your arms happy respected rich and full of years   18.871131058569528
well then sire continued d artagnan listen to the noise of the people   10.803740340876102
you watch while i sleep and you have come to bring me some news   15.45191847070246
the explanation would be too long my dear landlord replied franz   15.801592119165178
at bracieux alone i have twenty thousand francs in gold   17.41207340854489
we are consequently not friends   13.503823032074415
for when you go to auteuil and take your servants the house is left unprotected   13.477710023416972
the king s musketeers and the cardinal s guards d artagnan was acquainted with nobody in paris   14.713330625061129
come said caderousse wiping his large knife on his apron if i did not like you do you think i should endure the wretched life you lead me   21.804726982682354
and she is one of the greatest in her country too   9.543791482189313
athos replied the musketeer   17.856765294744083
the little apartment was charming for its taste and neatness   11.515645495366634
fortunately you won t be laid up more than a fortnight   11.203822109963339
i shall go and shoot on his estate   15.21204132626573
am i to put this construction on your visit   11.54633040792081
fear that relentless pursuer clogged dantès efforts   8.345211467393714
no i do not hesitate   7.970558555852259
oh you beautiful good little creature   11.535419648415909
where then sir   7.341342556152703
danglars was balancing his monthly accounts and it was perhaps not the most favorable moment for finding him in his best humor   14.061727893359372
sometimes he was delirious and fancied he saw an old man stretched on a pallet   9.149439141497886
d artagnan passed through the iron gate and arrived in front of the chateau   9.547656195285729
well said she you see he refuses   9.200252461696932
embrace with all your heart the vicomte for your devoted friend athos   8.791519280982769
there he found madeleine alarmed for his safety and anxious to tell him all the events of the evening but he cut her short by ordering her to put his supper in his room and give him with it a bottle of good burgundy   12.413791424182719
but d artagnan again shook his head   13.908444699298778
chapter lxii   7.449693564951988
lord winter was seated near an aperture arranged as a window to let in the night air his eyes mechanically following the course of the moon intermittently veiled as we before observed by heavy clouds   11.954549720098052
at this moment winter s voice was raised with the cry of forward   8.890232331337021
he has deceived her in her love humbled her in her pride thwarted her in her ambition   8.449883677463149
but all this eager attention might have been useless if the doctor so loudly called for had not chanced to be in the hôtel   9.356550181769762
you will present my excuses to the marquise and mademoiselle renée whom i leave on such a day with great regret   12.861784586318898
for my misfortune   9.664843229977674
explain my child he said explain my child he said explain where did you find this purse   15.847991814299293
upon the gospel said d artagnan throwing himself down by the dying man i swear to you that the wine was poisoned and that i was going to drink of it as you did   11.862628619318128
he was still comparatively young he was surrounded by the loving care of a devoted family but he had convinced himself by a course of reasoning illogical perhaps yet certainly plausible that he must separate himself from all he held dear in the world even life itself   14.021286012566609
when that is over you sir can return to paris while your wife passes the time of her mourning with her mother in law   7.986768708945638
important and urgent said he   13.571908194350984
the jailer went out and returned in an instant with a corporal and four soldiers   16.078196943159533
beauchamp an editor of a paper and the terror of the french government but of whom in spite of his national celebrity you perhaps have not heard in italy since his paper is prohibited there   6.076376295550733
no not if i can use more activity than my enemies   17.00063273024732
we will not venture to say whether it was from terror created by the threats or from tenderness at seeing four friends so closely united   15.909176484251883
how is that my friend   12.210466517167319
danglars and caderousse set off upon their errand at full speed   9.705125403660116
but the light of the torch revealed their true worth   15.678265994203397
villefort could lavish the tenderness some fathers do on their daughters   17.38222517093857
nevertheless as the crossroads offered him a better chance than any other place of meeting somebody he stood still   6.636897249507038
and that unfortunate on coming to himself found ten guineas that the french gentleman had slipped into his pocket   4.9451250189644895
do you suppose i carry 100 000 francs in my pocket   5.560264892961807
three days since you were with him in normandy   12.204212231736651
asked the young man surprised   13.722674346001618
life for life man for man   13.906701722695772
dear constance   13.832848861185033
ah said dantès you might well endure the tedious delay   10.23382457816028
he held a vial of salts in his hand   12.350414201950072
the count made a sign to haydée to address his visitor   13.443389828299075
repeated caderousse fixing his haggard gaze on the count   15.39899367410533
that is to say eagerly replied the wounded man who doubtless feared that the name of executioner would take from him the last help that he could claim that is to say i was but am no longer   5.320097463731477
i too said the young man am a musician at least my masters used to tell me so   14.228025154217601
then opening it took out a little golden box the top of which flew open when touched by a secret spring   13.863494035316188
since when i wonder in the musketeers did they grant men leave of absence without their asking for it   13.531054962573398
by the aid of ancient greek i learned modern greek i don t speak it so well as i could wish but i am still trying to improve myself   14.189901650200724
at this last command all the sails were lowered and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards   12.680939501509938
my dear count said he i fear one thing and that is that the fare of the rue du helder is not so much to your taste as that of the piazza di spagna   16.249503706184946
ah very well replied the cardinal quickly   15.183529308830533
are you a man of imagination a poet   13.23424366987581
after numberless windings dantès saw a door with an iron wicket   8.363544472196047
take it   12.68992742257262
but tomorrow today it is time to return   11.985299703421244
i can only say how sincerely i ask pardon for having grieved you   11.338624792164856
i will write a letter today to the director of the royal academy and tomorrow he will admit you without any expense to yourself   13.720674731773453
still further de wardes whom he had treated so ill was one of the tools of his eminence   12.194885642239358
come hermine he said after a short time answer candidly something vexes you is it not so   6.279022501831696
it was aramis who broke the silence   12.127493776101423
we have fallen in with a party of spaniards   6.376486460113533
i have formed an acquaintance thanks to my good fortune with many noted persons and have at least for the moment a crowd of friends   11.446963815688143
said the prince laughing i thought we should come to that   8.243666949347045
one would have thought the king was going to bed and not to his coffin   12.942843524160995
on the walls over the doors on the ceiling were swords daggers malay creeses maces battle axes   13.047074596728446
ah no madame that could not be   14.700678851992379
the balance would come to about that sum   9.032703387101973
i had one sir and thank god such as i could wish cried d artagnan   14.886752780121729
20135m from the imperfect means franz had of judging he could only come to one conclusion that the person whom he was thus watching certainly belonged to no inferior station of life   11.461309123465465
we shall see monsieur cardinal we shall see said the king who in his joy at finding the queen guilty of a crime which he cared little about and innocent of a fault of which he had great dread was ready to make up all differences with her we shall see but upon my honor you are too indulgent toward her   11.65571325831117
i know the house where you heard it or one very similar to it   11.477128403531866
you ve killed him i think   13.023151477278326
and what brought you here   7.798174770290219
she remained nearly always in her second floor chamber shivering in her chair or stretched languid and feeble on her bed while her husband kept his daily watch at the door a duty he performed with so much the greater willingness as it saved him the necessity of listening to the endless plaints and murmurs of his helpmate who never saw him without breaking out into bitter invectives against fate   12.682339783587524
what do they do   13.363342280351098
andrea who had often stayed there in his rides about paris recollected the bell and bottle inn   14.201560590836866
pray let us come more to the point and endeavor thoroughly to understand each other   11.034788929836619
here is what i am looking for thought d artagnan   8.90503111073129
because that which she does is part of a plan concerted between you of an infernal plan   12.878196202677742
these rascals will adjourn when they find that they are not in sufficient force said the comte de la fere   8.639304209851922
a moment afterwards julie saw him go upstairs carrying two or three heavy ledgers a portfolio and a bag of money   11.929781016626473
very well mordaunt exclaimed cromwell pleased at having his opinion of the young man raised once more   10.108404145763826
that s like good neighbors and we are quits   10.320303924196612
i then recollected you gave a breakfast this morning and here i am   11.515044093100514
well said the jeweller as he placed himself at table all i can say is so much the worse for those who are abroad   16.020263978939127
in the meanwhile as the godfather is a second father we beg the reader to lay to our account and not to that of the comte de la fère the pleasure or the ennui he may experience   9.11359877705259
said d artagnan stooping in his turn on the neck of his horse and answering on his side through the carriage window   9.781208815668114
because your strength is not in your head porthos said his friend   12.894627672725555
then when he had assured himself that he could neither be seen nor heard and was consequently relieved of doubts he said thanks madame thanks for your punctuality   12.557587613228527
he alighted as he saw a species of giant on the steps   10.935570111047937
encouraged by this invitation d artagnan followed the duke who closed the door after them   11.806961763194101
there is so much fog in that detestable country at least so d artagnan declares   14.629697441444169
oh you are a thorough democrat said monte cristo smiling   15.898424459040273
it s little enough   20.431444262427966
but if you please let us not theologize aramis   11.339657515197759
exclaimed the gascon tis a dreadful night my lord   13.55594502826006
the stables   15.741103596245413
let us try first to save the victim before we think of revenging her said d avrigny   12.152803434890286
but nothing clear nothing distinct nothing intelligible   12.343968057010324
but know that if you had even hidden your irregularities from your husband who has but the commencement of the art for generally husbands will not see you would then have been but a faint imitation of most of your friends among the women of the world   16.3433241731874
yes yes said de guiche a strange face   8.261620568731269
the jeweller took the ring and drawing from his pocket a pair of steel pliers and a small set of copper scales he took the stone out of its setting and weighed it carefully   10.530354065465534
i have both seen and heard her   8.773954590120029
de nargonne your first husband being neither a philosopher nor a banker or perhaps being both and seeing there was nothing to be got out of a king s attorney died of grief or anger at finding after an absence of nine months that you had been enceinte six   14.700638803890065
besides you must have seen that the person to whom i spoke was a woman   10.169095135929663
are you so kind so good so unsuspicious of ill that you can not understand valentine   9.061094149982356
i told you one evening in the garden after madame de saint méran s death because his system is accustomed to that very poison and the dose was trifling to him which would be fatal to another   9.898925859278478
my father and m   9.650747134591894
there he would inquire concerning the bracieux estate and go to the right or to the left according to the information obtained   13.807391218787785
where am i to die   16.793401031848532
madame replied villefort with a mournful smile i have already had the honor to observe that my father has at least i hope so abjured his past errors and that he is at the present moment a firm and zealous friend to religion and order a better royalist possibly than his son   13.266918577755895
danglars thought for ten minutes about his wife in paris   11.363382951102706
twenty four years ago i returned proud and joyful to my country   5.579166993454685
but all the time he was in paris you of course did not lose sight of him   14.576744220828704
you know i used to be a good cook   11.630421953527456
de tréville and walking with him toward the embrasure of a window well monsieur continued he you say it is his eminence s guards who have sought a quarrel with your musketeers   12.812138439527866
come louise let us talk of our affairs   16.83079327505848
my lord replied guitant such ministers do not weigh men in the same balance   10.942494287497047
the frenchman assured him he would follow him to the end of the world   13.453197823295493
mazarin wished to call out but porthos held him tight and passed him to d artagnan who seized him by the neck and made him sit down by him   8.39512697735484
the palace rose from the bosom of the water and to see the number of boats around it one would have fancied one s self not in paris but in venice   13.44736647608065
report to the king the condition of affairs   9.790850734520902
supposing it had been thrown aside it would probably be on the path which led to the little gate   7.42063604035673
her name was my god have pity on me   9.86147828838235
i will supply you with the means of supporting your accusation for i know the fact well   11.506353976606647
avow freely that you accuse him   14.149302343331836
it is in truth monsieur le coadjuteur s carriage said d artagnan   13.186210652298668
search then monsieur   14.244354470023616
mazarin resumed his reading it is important therefore monseigneur that i should be informed as to the intentions of france   10.605770978760109

the baron might possibly have perceived it but attributing it to a caprice feigned ignorance   13.311079471684362
yes my dear count i heard it   17.210840166218986

he could already see the intendant s beaming smile change to a contortion of grief   9.780919653501648
why i have only had the honor of being in her society and conversing with her three or four times in my life   10.598431608557675
the count laid his hand on franz s shoulder   8.818376432238178
it was not difficult to conquer as she had hitherto done men prompt to let themselves be seduced and whom the gallant education of a court led quickly into her net   14.343312434161197
felt instinctively that he ought not to reply to this question the queen having put it in an almost dying voice   12.978697028496251
i give you my word   9.082303156243858

chapter 95   11.010315455913242
one of the grand causes of this prejudice was the friendship of anne of austria for mme   13.65869746324452
the signs just now and the holy water   13.329075443953766
de morcerf continued beauchamp looked at this woman with surprise and terror   15.443940298481664
danglars took advantage of caderousse s temper at the moment to take him off towards marseilles by the porte saint victor staggering as he went   10.402863726277843
both resumed their way   13.790974694780825

he had a heavy hand dear old athos after drinking   13.24032309041332

a shudder passed over him   7.943671063527615
well when i was a clerk morcerf was a mere fisherman   15.25438707357603
he was accompanied by another man who carried in his hand something long and flexible rolled up resembling a washing line   14.519678983383816
it was plain by a paleness still greater than usual and by those traces which loss of sleep leaves on the face that he must have passed almost the whole of the night without sleeping   11.710466298020329
debray colored slightly and followed with his eyes the direction of beauchamp s glance   13.905160344500754
monte cristo called the owner who immediately rowed up to him with the eagerness of a boatman hoping for a good fare   11.380978213262054
but these two words would bring about my condemnation divorce exile   16.281580473127935
the queen advanced a few steps to meet him and then stopped cold severe unmoved with her lower lip scornfully protruded   10.744521952918472
it was very hard   10.709505592227464
with the hundred pistoles we can live well to the end of the month   12.214723351351063

a mass of straight black hair defying all attempts to train or curl it fell over his projecting forehead and hung down to his shoulders giving increased vivacity to eyes already sparkling with a youthful love of mischief and fondness for every forbidden enjoyment   9.15985766636394
my lord asks of what country you are said the young man in the purest castilian   14.016104002723567
she murmured   9.478765421771683
the above mentioned purchase was made on his highness s account whose mandate i had for the sum of four hundred thousand francs   15.477905414156403
in that case you would do better to keep it to yourself   8.860999690399723
not a step further said the man who appeared to be the captain or i will hamstring your horses   15.293072406429882
his assistant broke his leg last night beneath your majesty s window the cry we heard was his and there is no executioner nearer at hand than bristol   7.666571199682578
but in the first place i should like to be certain of one thing   14.084656149559702
you shall take half the sum that will be advanced upon it or i will throw it into the seine   11.920380149344991
but you did not come   12.024488463142871

at first he had been followed through astonishment then with derisive shouts then the porters had insulted him then children had thrown stones at him and finally he was obliged to run to escape the missiles   10.91876702174187
i was forced then to combat the fast of the evening with the nourishment of the morning   10.738382793521822
they were only fit for a young man   10.847088540632104
to you perhaps they will accord the time they have refused to me   10.510779644763575
i cover mine said d artagnan   12.953637189969287
toward four o clock in the morning the doctor arrived   10.636228468849486
he calls that being as poor as job   13.475148068783716
asked a porter advancing to the new arrival   9.974349531425073
it is for you replied a gendarme   13.57968381023191
proceed she said   18.516247309752053
a loud cry could be heard by her   12.576041972676974
he looked at his watch like a man who has forgotten the hour said a few hurried words to madame herbault and pressing the hands of emmanuel and maximilian madame said he i trust you will allow me to visit you occasionally   13.589284733944922
monte cristo and haydée took the beverage in the original arabian manner that is to say without sugar   14.903465181359891
i guess what brings you here   10.465113423347173
but when bazin passed in his turn with his eyes raised to heaven and walking in all humility the very last d artagnan pulled him by the hem of his robe   10.885772097467093
did you see all that   15.635057719435114
i have blessed you and you are sacred to me   8.736390887555368

scarron seemed not to observe that certain of his guests had talked mysteriously that letters had passed from hand to hand and that the assembly had seemed to have a secret purpose quite apart from the literary discussion carried on with so much ostentation   18.38908871285796
well can i see porthos   12.067684849995334
but i m afraid entre nous that his liking for wine has aged and degraded him   10.719607428512322
but your excellency replied bertuccio hesitatingly did not the abbé busoni who heard my confession in the prison at nîmes tell you that i had a heavy burden upon my conscience   7.065313625185545
there are then 40 000 francs for your share besides the 100 000 you furnished me to begin with making in all 1 340 000 francs for your portion   10.417681970601222
adieu faltered the count who felt his heart die away within him   15.788540262850766
they entered the bedroom   14.11336953155317
50201m maximilian said the count without appearing to notice the different impressions which his presence produced on the little circle i come to seek you   12.640509571621127

mazarin bit his lips   10.876538225736818

after ten minutes labor the wall gave way and a hole large enough to insert the arm was opened   13.73992125289385
at a shout from the boat the chain that closes the mouth of the port was lowered and in a second they were as dantès knew in the frioul and outside the inner harbor   17.6259913958797
then the cardinal will be pleased with me   12.238749355166005
again the timid girl found courage to return to the gate saying as she did so and why do you come so late today   11.526024735286336
does not his appearance speak for him   7.616155416562363
the wall had closed again   10.982650330471643

you wish to make me believe something too dreadful   11.662439378952643
one seemed as he raised the wine to his lips to hear him say come juice of the grape and chase away my sorrows   11.939169631792668
the two friends looked at each other   19.52623287209046
so distinguished an individual as yourself cried albert could scarcely have required an introduction   11.9741398671013
continued mme   11.893059454675626
you have conspired with your wife with madame de chevreuse and with my lord duke of buckingham   9.006695345997663
exclaimed debray   8.689811119307286
had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy i should have conducted you to monte cristo   11.974829512247956
felton would see all   7.8781716704792135
c est bien prouvé par le déluge   11.108285019210063
said porthos astonished at his friend s deception   7.8121612234768385
danglars bit his lips   8.059947076670596
then the steps retreated and the voices died away in the distance   10.385171078575391
said the officer who covered a part of his face with his cloak   12.698745033039074
ah your honor how can you say so   14.784907083493417
porthos men like us can t go out from here purely and simply   10.744272718141461
when he regained his dungeon he threw himself on his bed where the turnkey found him in the evening visit sitting with fixed gaze and contracted features dumb and motionless as a statue   11.497219853857233
so much the worse for them   6.452790048405204
albert seized them with a convulsive hand tore them in pieces and trembling lest the least vestige should escape and one day appear to confront him he approached the wax light always kept burning for cigars and burned every fragment   18.754319167614305
yes monsieur said planchet and i will go as soon as you please   10.09430099173943
we immediately drew and at the first pass i laid him stark dead   8.075963155201364
and he fell back on the bed   9.096377501244532
de tréville made a sign with his hand and all retired except d artagnan who did not forget that he had an audience and with the tenacity of a gascon remained in his place   13.128349601000057
why if you ever make use of the details i am about to give you that you will never let anyone know that it was i who supplied them   12.420993577493498
whither are you going count   11.527668961855584
by the bonapartists   12.530460823240219
said the gendarmes thrusting dantès forward   11.0793309055134
i am eager to see you attain your vengeance   6.936666469119778
in the first place his escape would be a serious misfortune to monsieur de chavigny whom he hated for the petty persecutions he owed to him   13.743612201800335
now this is the moment to consecrate your existence to the king of kings said d artagnan if you persist in offering him a civility   10.032822299004856
repeated mazarin in terror   15.921722971460785
the dangerous and mad prisoners are in the dungeons   14.119046711669604
on the contrary i am certain he will do so   12.526801298028875
villefort impassive as he was was struck with this coincidence   13.536667666818548
the dogs became in their turn silent   14.961380953147387
the count told baptistin to leave the plate within reach of his guest who began by sipping the alicante with an expression of great satisfaction and then delicately steeped his biscuit in the wine   13.749043760305462
i swear to you on my honor said he to await your decision respecting the course i am to pursue with m   15.141274517861923
and d artagnan obliging athos to look in the direction he pointed showed him the body of mordaunt floating on its back which sometimes submerged sometimes rising seemed still to pursue the four friends with looks of insult and mortal hatred   11.033868992268614
i introduce no one and certainly not m   12.498472487418457
the vessel was in as good condition as i am and as i hope you are m   14.096399385625755
gimblou a glass of wine   10.395124592814032
i do not yet know myself neither is it necessary that you should do so   14.621470221090703
oh said danglars i can when circumstances render it desirable adopt your system although it may not be my general practice   8.8146836820532
i should have been pleased to see her for i like her very much   10.415280136190447
the first time i saw him he appeared to me like an old lieutenant who had grown mouldy under his epaulets   16.24447007476207
i shall see everything and at the least suspicious sign i shall begin to exterminate   12.474295849269042
and without any other complaint passive and obedient either from true devotion to his master or from the example set by blaisois mousqueton leaped into the sea headforemost   9.986047369902112
pardon me monsieur but you are not my lord the duke of buckingham said mme   11.470817423347832
willingly answered the stranger   17.429596059799103
he was thought to be dead   13.677432736490983
their fasts make them pale the blows of the discipline make them hypocrites and their eyes become inflamed through weeping for the good things of this life we common folk enjoy but they have lost   12.324909943840286
then he sent his card to signor pastrini and asked for albert de morcerf   15.923963321603335
there is nothing more easy said mousqueton with a modest air   10.281182433580915
aramis assumed that perilous charge   8.658853864012608
i did not think that was the way of your people   14.667475222708177
a man advanced to the door with a kind of scythe in his hand   8.685066493724912
once a soldier what would you do with me a poor orphan forlorn without fortune with nothing but a half ruined hut and a few ragged nets the miserable inheritance left by my father to my mother and by my mother to me   13.801585896629833
because you shrug your shoulders   10.08168914668277
or that the sea should become dry as in the days of pharaoh and even then my vessels would become caravans   10.906349733274576
but i know you only as an adventurer sewn up in gold and jewellery   9.331818764176582
and albert handed over the paper to the count who read as follows a correspondent at yanina informs us of a fact of which until now we had remained in ignorance   17.638425717508653
help me gentlemen cried d artagnan we must break in this door   15.315991217224447
at length they arrived at the cemetery   8.838388047688024
as for what you do me the honor to say i presume you mean i was afraid   8.364585581068287
the master   11.334881212387343
d artagnan on his part had gained the summit of all his wishes   13.339076507734136
remember raoul this   7.907971749092253
when he was completely dressed he said send hither monsieur d artagnan   6.564499702948555
who are you sir he asked that forget that this is not the manner to enter a house stricken with death   12.772602528706477
tell me about it said the monk who sitting on the foot of the bed began to be interested in a story so strangely introduced   12.683960834303413
morrel looked at monte cristo with astonishment   12.25102141787478
when he had sufficiently recovered himself he said it appears then that the miserable old man you were telling me of was forsaken by everyone   13.416116874530145
caderousse was filled with wonder   14.15501602189207
do you know them fernand   10.613574764890446
danglars ask these gentlemen where they are caught   12.64586185260839
placed as he was between two possible sources of danger he kept his eye on the crew and his gun in his hand   11.514760407038956
debray smiled   10.711521228793705
d artagnan saw those tears and much disturbed softened he threw himself at her feet   12.539896120056916
dantès reviewed his past life with composure and looking forward with terror to his future existence chose that middle line that seemed to afford him a refuge   8.3215872614838
andrea who was in an adjoining room had shared in the sensation caused by the arrival of monte cristo and now came forward to pay his respects to the count   9.759541249766533
aramis seized his knife   8.789889729246616
he had tried to speak when alone but the sound of his voice terrified him   8.507132168652133
excited beyond his usual calm demeanor franz rose with the audience and was about to join the loud enthusiastic applause that followed   10.26947048543654
i trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish remarks we used to make about him   15.562043638487678
the rock already shaken by the explosion tottered on its base   7.091990203214104
oh heavens i forgot that it awaits me also   18.133860879365535
yes madame i expected nothing less from the justice of your majesty   14.428384631924331
did you recognize   13.149531023131972
so that on returning home d artagnan found the reunion complete   7.756402625676528
at the same time continued d artagnan notwithstanding your forty thousand francs a year and perhaps even for the very reason that you have forty thousand francs a year it seems to me that a little coronet would do well on your carriage hey   10.052402247446473
we can watch the skipper   9.932447123324852
well transfer it to me at the price it cost you   9.006797231152643
by demanding my head of the cardinal   7.996727033990539
the latter bent on his knee and kissed it   17.08976681827485
inactive my dear fellow   11.06026968283476
without that what would become of me   13.864580642592008
his forced politeness sat awkwardly upon him and approached almost to impertinence   7.4433186957428585
the major looked at the count with an indescribable expression of anxiety   11.22033910091415
she is called milady but she may be french   11.577208852684223
stop let me show you the way   9.749686720370217
well la ramee who is a gourmand sees his pates thinks them more attractive than those of pere marteau and proposes to me that i shall try them   13.389054149698344
in short he had reached that supreme moment when the bravest feel a shudder in their veins when suddenly in the direction of the rue de l arbre sec the crowd opened crying long live the coadjutor   11.681984361066217
de boville was in his private room and the englishman on perceiving him made a gesture of surprise which seemed to indicate that it was not the first time he had been in his presence   10.328502663119679
your interview will be private   15.08952133502559
gone   11.153693794395087
the magistrate harassed and fatigued had descended to the garden of his house and in a gloomy mood similar to that in which tarquin lopped off the tallest poppies he began knocking off with his cane the long and dying branches of the rose trees which placed along the avenue seemed like the spectres of the brilliant flowers which had bloomed in the past season   13.896791906426564
i thought he had seen me at work   12.684206988778953
porthos pretended that this occupation was proof of a reflective and contemplative organization and he had brought him away without any other recommendation   9.461851355494552
the duke undid his belt and gave it to grimaud who tied la ramee in such a way as to satisfy him   14.885866765330798
he will ask to speak to you in private and offer you five millions   12.033556358762114
alas returned the captain with an accent of the most profound pity we ought always to help one another   15.220853350932652
look attentively then at this gentleman   10.82230074714555
yes tréville yes said the king in a melancholy tone   13.748180058487396
he will give you a horse all saddled and will point out to you the road you ought to take   8.452927377359451
have you never heard that queen anne of austria was once saved from the greatest danger ever incurred by a queen   7.187186490353078
the latter anxious about his master and curious to know what had happened to him had taken advantage of the opportunity and brought the garments himself   6.792362028753075
and he looked round to see if anybody partook of his opinion   5.82926119279743
to you my preserver perhaps   13.635330213026647
be careful valentine said morrel hesitating to comply with the young girl s wishes   11.754683461129135
well then porthos shall show him how to knock down an ox with a blow of the fist and i how to trip up a bull by taking him by the horns   16.450678380486416
the carriage again moved on   10.627312630428653
and you baron pursued the count addressing franz do you also depart tomorrow   12.224918273625727
yes christian and surname are the same   13.995457475511198
he was a strong minded upright young man   12.477340878123297
bonacieux in her power   15.561503580660139
has the gascon been indiscreet   16.35511401188228
not only him but some of his friends messieurs porthos and aramis   8.420436296246663
if she said there is one among you who knows the king let him approach and say whether it is really his majesty lying there   12.497798416357242
with a man like you i fear nothing   9.748343668161386
and do you undertake to reform it   8.432004970082405
you have a quick horse a light tilbury you are naturally as slippery as an eel   10.860497697167702
you had no fears of my being tired when you ordered me to go to the palace to day to pass the odious decrees which have raised the people to rebellion   5.485104250254203
it was evident that every precaution had been taken   9.953959373830925
d avrigny i beseech you do something for her   14.439050594779365
emmanuel followed her and in the antechamber were visible the rough faces of seven or eight half naked sailors   13.513703124249266
asked the notary of villefort   18.691510452809325
dantès could not understand a man risking his life for such matters   15.750938567685
if i am free why these bars and these doors   8.221778391282083
but as we have said he was active strong and full of presence of mind   9.653360051190578
do as you like with your own but do not fill or empty mine   10.573839343486341
that would not be endurable in any case and is still less so on the part of those who came to bring the queen the message of a liar   12.649792294019694
i warn you however his services will cost you something   11.420410387749554
debray is with madame   8.889543095317558
and does the husband of this frightful creature still live   11.539994496207044
a pallor that suits you admirably mother but which did not the less alarm my father and myself   8.176192913456289
yes first and then to go to paris   9.749441600515016
monsieur de beaufort was at supper but he rose quickly on hearing the two friends announced   12.290298235281922
chapter 50   8.592870820730676
but the voice was all   16.11728335446451
both were addressed to king charles   6.844585422566903
d artagnan had recognized the voice of his old servant   14.950810539351112
poor king   15.113579667394617
why he must be a nabob   6.911517636062519
he then began pacing the room with a pensive and gloomy air glancing from time to time at the jeweller who stood reeking with the steam from his wet clothes and merely changing his place on the warm hearth to enable the whole of his garments to be dried   14.85523617652178
for an active ambitious nature like that of milady days not spent in climbing are inauspicious days   11.007590610299243
besides athos was very easy and a noble to his fingers ends   9.621471124334038
oh my mother   12.907853768644431
it is a veritable army   11.166965912319245
that is about the distance that separates your chamber from mine   13.719431107759961
but that proves that all is not yet over   13.01458991946915
then said danglars pale with anger which was not at all due to offended paternal love then mademoiselle you persist in your determination to accelerate my ruin   14.281167930490874
you have a sad air   10.242802667370263
and then do you take this poniard said the young herdsman   11.039409189196332
villefort opened the door and escaped for the idea had entered his mind to stifle the little remaining life in the heart of this terrible old man   10.791271276886075
but what has happened then since last evening count   7.763084046356058
adieu your holiness said the mendicant opening the door and bending low before the prelate   7.933378896470877
all is well i thank you   9.045752680977344
ings have been made in these caves   10.265744397536945
you think he is tracked pursued captured   14.238306015326476
i accept it said she   7.9113342064569
there were no questions   13.900191476885473
but contentment is so new a sight to me that i could never be weary of looking at yourself and your husband   13.143267952899759
but where the devil were you gadding last night my young master   11.209640677736344
to present our respects to the cardinal   11.51434356203347
aramis answered d artagnan who did not wish to undeceive porthos aramis fancy has become a monk and a jesuit and lives like a bear   5.799355574144581
that is the most direct line to london   13.574830577517442
that would have been another motive for sympathy between us   12.505159234620558
neither could give the others any information for all were ignorant who this man could be   13.320453787224857
the keeper relaxed his hold   6.624771551667336
i know myself father   12.062516272965736
he cried by jove   14.933124286168278
since his first arrival at paris he had had constant occasion to honor this excellent man whom he had always found worthy loyal and great   9.942991831847968
it is the enemy who have made a sortie from newcastle and are surrounding us   15.972760512097828
buckingham the executioner of this angelic creature   9.017032671329254
at length you are mine   14.981497330929503
my fault   7.96817900539848
said the procurator maliciously   12.308375950152291
and rushing towards the door she opened it saying here edmond here i am   16.19444601950517
milady continued one day our doors will ope with god come our desire   13.965007185964618
if i were betrayed as he was i would console myself   13.262974860730827
come let us see what you will do for me   4.631034789704406
it was at this moment d artagnan entered the courtyard of the palace in the coadjutor s carriage and a few seconds later the carriages of the ladies in waiting drove out and the gates were shut after them   14.860680670495247
god will punish you hereafter but i will punish you here   11.625531019190474
branded in the eyes of the world you invoke try to prove to that world that you are neither guilty nor mad   13.85556009802034
50249m danglars suddenly felt a strong inclination to see the person who kept watch over him   7.803282245483541
emmanuel go with them and see that my orders are executed   16.214962675172448
to enter the room he must again see the body of his unfortunate wife   14.635068114819013
monsieur de longueville is of royal blood madame said d artagnan   11.108952158070563
or at least that i had had no hand in it   8.444913364002197
she intoxicated   10.33456696320787
one with a letter and the other put it in the post   15.503938308676354
she heard something on the road which sounded like the rattling of a distant gallop   10.730007844338898
no fine lady ever trained and watered her geraniums her cacti and her rhododendrons in her porcelain jardinière with more pains than this hitherto unseen gardener bestowed upon his little enclosure   8.736446660716242
the proofs   15.343124086614985
have you finished   9.995764393214571
and the stranger muttering to himself directed his steps toward the kitchen   9.330858451559218
the world will think you abandoned and poor for the wife of a bankrupt would never be forgiven were she to keep up an appearance of opulence   15.576747447302527
for unlike porthos who accompanied the variations of chance with songs or oaths athos when he won remained as unmoved as when he lost   13.709481308073467
the other who was safe and sound continued his way toward the camp   10.645437293404122
you met a monk did you not   11.548421548750806
he could not contemplate the future with the indifference of the hardened criminal who merely faces a contingency already familiar   12.51443454372825
morrel had indeed placed a cross over the spot but it had fallen down and the grave digger had burnt it as he did all the old wood in the churchyard   9.838098301680024
and this reputation which he justly enjoys had decided me to confide a secret to him   12.045453287508849
a learned man before whom the last circumstance was mentioned as a fact declared he had seen the quarries in question which gave great weight to assertions hitherto somewhat doubtful but which now assumed the garb of reality   8.762979474999675
unquestionably   13.384234314559395
so you suppose i have need of an escort   8.516011445466265
or an ex emperor but his majesty the emperor and king driven from france which is his kingdom by violence and treason   6.948119883600125
a strasbourg pie   15.30622567774162
in the cellar monsieur   11.463742504619738
hold my stirrup bazin cried aramis   10.805835197314714
after so many years of painful separation said andrea in the same tone of voice and glancing towards the door what a happiness it is to meet again   11.42903340196703
this to me who expected but to find a blank enclosure surrounded by a straight wall is i assure you a most agreeable surprise   11.113639063231977
i want the album   12.747029641154757
that is to say athos porthos and aramis   8.247084807661443
but i am the more annoyed with this fate chance or whatever you please to call the power which has destroyed my hopes and my fortune and may blast the prospects of my child also as it is all occasioned by an old man relapsed into second childhood   12.696196192363688
their toilet finished they descended   12.836932772536532
only ten days after the flight of her daughter and three days from the bankruptcy of her husband   18.46197342296661
but the joke appeared an excellent one to the citizens who seeing the conveyance without escort and unarmed would never have believed in the possibility of so great an imprudence   16.796540543743554
as soon as he arrives inform me   14.805087166956222
i like that   12.312271862167748
shall you go then albert   12.140544977913502
the young man who one evening sought a quarrel with him on the pont neuf opposite the samaritaine   13.982331580699567
he cried athos   13.260611617225203
wherefore sir   13.844886781374008
if you know this how much must you suffer   15.281686183198483
monte cristo took the gong and struck it once   11.138669124666011
on rising he went to his window which opened on a terrace having the sea in front and at the back a pretty park bounded by a small forest   15.532960807838892
cried d artagnan in his stentorian voice   11.610176133341806
the count s well known courage will render unnecessary the aid of the police whose interference might seriously affect him who sends this advice   10.08701566711843
let him bear his share of the loss and we will go on as before   11.278146156051633
wretch cried d artagnan speak quickly   17.065022062222425
as for me it made me tremble   9.75693302222629
the tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been scarcely married a week   10.366269427358414
all hope of flight was gone   11.826738610488206
but you said that your name was d artagnan   11.955735042804028
morrel was mad   13.523349680828222
it s worth eighty   11.110556089048336
but take no notice   15.806309348392752
morcerf did not reply   11.303338640338179
some few words passed between them in that sonorous language in which homer makes his gods converse   5.4140622432615615
he said to the sergeant i believe you are impudent to me   13.161575121100809
may it not be about that cursed affair   10.954526179019853
for i now recollect you   12.162805385568081
he exposed himself freely to danger and while charging at the head of his company he received a ball through the chest which laid him prostrate on the field of battle   12.974345874061855
asked valentine clasping her hands   19.518796921194287
namely a perfect amnesty and forgetfulness of the past   16.275142429072424
50169m what i do not wish madame is that you should perish on the scaffold   10.941816385768112
tis true replied d artagnan   11.415725101850697
cried buckingham forgetting everything in thinking from whom that letter came   12.737121690455034
it was evident that he brought the answer of the emperor and that it was favorable   14.166809931936433
a moment after a carriage stopped before the door and the servant announced m   8.849871486292797
i made some curious observations on this at charenton   12.803552897049752
as to dantès he had passed it on his voyage to and from the levant but never touched at it   9.539912294844598
but when the time came to pay for his rosemary this oil and the wine the only expense the master had incurred as he had preserved a strict abstinence while on the contrary the yellow horse by the account of the hostler at least had eaten three times as much as a horse of his size could reasonably be supposed to have done d artagnan found nothing in his pocket but his little old velvet purse with the eleven crowns it contained   10.121777637435027
but let us be quick the king may change his mind in an hour   6.885771468286668
then you remember everything that went on about you from the time when you were three years old   9.570088205615296
morrel looked at the count with surprise   15.736908798164183
she stopped astonished then the voice reached her ear more distinctly and she recognized it to be that of maximilian   15.825475568026501
the fittings of the room were simple but in excellent taste   9.981523953982233
you will be drowned if you seek to escape and your strength has not been properly exercised and prepared for exertion   7.662289226514767
i have never seen her   14.132319794405813
the commissary now appeared to experience a little uneasiness   13.72812143301432
madame said he you are about to receive a visit from the chancellor who will communicate certain matters to you with which i have charged him   13.622748925075499
we should only be three one of whom is wounded with the addition of a boy resumed athos   14.872807429090146
where is that   15.262944395500487
put the oars into it so that it may follow in the track and there will be nothing to do except to cut the cord   13.470367236940678
bonacieux pronounced these words with tears in her eyes   13.571242399675242
three quarters of an hour   7.263275767838174
well yes you are right   8.539781417335613
and it conveyed me from nice to genoa from genoa to turin from turin to chambéry from chambéry to pont de beauvoisin and from pont de beauvoisin to paris   5.455966308984369
father and son chapter 13   16.460442305406193
i love you as my life for you are the best the noblest of created beings   9.194194055847007
if you would permit me said d artagnan with timidity   19.215237192613294
the king advanced toward madame the president with whom he was to dance and his highness monsieur with the queen   16.190303678355452
besides the woman wore that black mantle which d artagnan could still see outlined on the shutter of the rue de vaugirard and on the door of the rue de la harpe   11.230764362106866
continued he addressing raoul   9.967758532582614
it is a lovely night and a walk without rome will do us both good   16.790083049087013
thought d artagnan she is charged with some message for me from her mistress   7.670571454241291
and the two women parted exchanging charming smiles   12.515658093069392
to dantès if what he says is true what hinders his staying with us   14.738703297914125
if his excellency will recollect if he will think ah true observed monte cristo   16.86601383643822
you look dull   10.890518821009467
a man who will not tell his name but who comes from the cardinal   12.010500941283977
and will that be the first time you ever took that journey   12.71304851900624
five minutes after the door had been closed on morrel s entrance it was again opened for the count   11.678854936910993
oh said morcerf this repugnance if repugnance it may be called is not all on my side   11.587771965908185
this manner of acting roused much respect for d artagnan s policy among the musketeers   11.600522339656123
she worries me everywhere said d artagnan   7.541764035218789
then my keeper would begin to trust this man and to depend upon him and i should have news from those without the prison walls   15.413851652388672
but if in spite of all my precautions i am at last obliged to fight will you not be my second   12.913875029953145
i have bought them and stationed them myself at the most desirable posts that is in villages where no one generally stops   9.386101155180445
a musketeer for a time my friend as the cardinal says a musketeer against my will but a churchman at heart believe me   8.560438831345866
captivity has brought my mental faculties to a focus   14.014558706435448
by its influence time has no longer measure space has no longer distance   11.58088351742413
and this i swear by the two beings most dear to me upon earth my father and mercédès   13.882596193149213
stammered caderousse   11.760287956200644
said lord de winter after having played comedy after having played tragedy we are now playing melancholy   14.724442367596263
have patience and courage and remember that in spite of time and absence all your friends continue to cherish for you the sentiments they have so long professed and truly entertained   10.428972094145085
if he is here this is what the other man said let s see decidedly what to do with him   13.792017879886838
alas said milady i know it is so   11.377168294348607
you love me madame   18.698082645886355
the battle of charenton   8.648089725683779
madame de villefort in spite of all the remarks which she considered it her duty to make secretly approved of the proposition my father consented to it at her instigation and it was only on account of my poor grandfather that i finally abandoned the project   8.567918656146542
when left alone the two friends at first kept an embarrassed silence   13.101321905692213
you have no money coming in on which you can rely   16.12582692523297
the exclamation was drawn from athos by seeing the sword of cahusac fly twenty paces from him   12.016950080527554
ah comte de la fere said a calm voice though hoarse with running is it your habit to calumniate the absent   11.482745356277773
and one for aramis   18.005168959483065
morrel bent his head till it touched the stone then clutching the grating with both hands he murmured oh valentine   12.03766896863114
what do you think of that interrogator   8.997963096370723
both as this double precaution indicated had an interest in not being recognized   9.280083390013415
half of the work was done   11.776016093694366
they are coming then   15.173665776087521
especially when this young prince was scarcely thirty years of age   19.454501603833464
this was another little piece of italian the baron had learned from hearing his daughter sing italian duets with cavalcanti   10.94938687031357
i loved madame bonacieux with my heart while i only love milady with my head said he   7.1140223182590505
because insensible to all my sufferings you persist in remaining in a city where by remaining you run the risk of your life and make me run the risk of my honor   14.248519195451117
madame danglars had listened to this recital with a sigh a tear or a shriek for every detail   6.966374022941547
i not only approve of what he has done but i congratulate him upon it   7.8734004140725276
he was about to begin his repast when the sound of the bell rang sharp and loud   14.068325709720337
albert led his guest into the salon   11.362782864048288
boisrenard   15.927982810621726
sire the duke is right and i believe your majesty will think it equally important   13.528518905032863
my gratitude is already due   14.932408193061377
and then the queen   16.987913503890738
that is what i call devoted friendship to recommend to another one whom you would not marry yourself   14.337959017498694
one by one he undid the buttons of his doublet took it off and deposited it by the side of his hat   14.9414190602328
does madame de morcerf dance   14.247651538519214
now one of two things must happen either matters will not be arranged or they will be arranged in which last case i shall be relieved of my command and we shall still meet again   13.244126016911805
said beauchamp mildly   11.573419994953262
there was a moment s silence then the carriage cleared the gate   8.286734765385456
another long live the prince de conde   14.247943138260428
to horse then gentlemen   12.311148969471992
but above all things i am a marvel to you   14.6890751454196
and incited as much by a religious feeling as by gratitude he was unwilling to quit the capital of the christian world without laying his respectful homage at the feet of one of st   13.768460757990734
he was a man of forty to forty five years but he seemed at least fifty and his black moustache and eyebrows contrasted strangely with his almost white hair which was cut short in the military fashion   11.157893729446506
and what does he say   11.44854067438802
this being understood let us proceed with our history   10.596759612307212
it is my lord i have not named her   10.714287870624759
scarcely had ali disappeared when the valet entered the chamber   11.671843057275368
well then come along   10.988797353070717
for mademoiselle de villefort is in spite of all we can do to rouse her of a melancholy disposition and taciturn habit which frequently injure the effect of her beauty   13.90562823233844
and she passed over to monte cristo a bottle full of the same kind of red liquid whose good properties the count had tested on edward   13.965869779310596
how sprightly you are said caderousse   11.18589763851247
there came up from all nature in the dawn of day a perfume of herbs flowers and leaves which delighted the heart   15.99323434691236
he had to contend against a strong wrist but his agility was superior to all force   8.640999800305107
not only was the villa brilliantly illuminated but thousands of colored lanterns were suspended from the trees in the garden   13.349396484786325
the guardsman who had returned at the first discharge announced the death of his four companions   12.2413030258909
d artagnan on his part entered boldly at the principal gate   10.796428342556508
this morning the subject was introduced and my dear grandmother on whom i depended as my only support not only declared herself favorable to it but is so anxious for it that they only await the arrival of m   14.296759746991524
do you want any money   19.127096856838598
bonacieux in a tone of perfect good fellowship what has become of you all these days   16.195288144675956
edmond at the approach of his patron respectfully placed the arm of his affianced bride within that of m   7.930451712421574
with the view of assassinating or causing to be assassinated the duke of buckingham   11.860814296265499
the prisoner s first feeling was of joy at again breathing the pure air for air is freedom   15.418819101038086
during the first act the countess g entered   12.39571641264207
and though she has the look of an angel we must not always judge people by the appearance   18.807699977242983
the count of san felice pointed out teresa who was hanging on luigi s arm in a group of peasants   13.666366483746227
he drew kitty to him   13.205595034808741
in the meantime they filled the place with their golden and silky reflections   16.75756367408239
he intended taking advantage of the opportunity to make fresh inquiries of the new conductor   6.677085141830501
do you understand the meaning of my words   12.494722294821393
emmanuel returned my sister the house of morrel can only be carried on by a morrel   11.833709448198054
we are looking for the house of monsieur de la fere said d artagnan   9.388648223095196
it was those very terrible old days that made the present so excessively delightful and the blow was so great he rushed out overcome and forgot to shut the door   7.912922549140243
and then again i am not as brave and courageous as was my poor brother   10.27383823314673
you are joking yourself now   7.778550180615604
the ever new passions which consumed her gave to her life the appearance of those clouds which float in the heavens reflecting sometimes azure sometimes fire sometimes the opaque blackness of the tempest and which leave no traces upon the earth behind them but devastation and death   15.925451121364851
but why are you so sure of his being the winner of the jockey club prize   13.998558030001893
said porthos with a gesture fierce enough to have frightened an army   14.466146419093047
come said athos here s another good servant   9.670419918320388
i am already upon the scent resumed d artagnan   14.367677218208605
come gentlemen come   6.858591906188494
the attendant confirmed to the cardinal what the two musketeers had already said with respect to athos   16.200232557046967
and were you my son or my brother i would refuse you in the same way   11.207321799253371
and d artagnan held the lamp before the merry face of porthos who now began to comprehend the affair and be very proud of the whole undertaking   16.48295279417806
all this is very strange   9.09083689708541
something your majesty will happen between now and then to make the execution impossible   10.480631895941988
but whether this was reality or vision he had this time sufficient self command not to enter   14.615787013336352
speak my child speak said d artagnan   11.086743670809279
villefort s eyes were filled with tears of joy and pride   12.655146788294894
d artagnan then related all the mad passion of milady and her menaces of death   9.259558622152955
come tell me what can i do for you   5.7138964748970915
but on the contrary she threw herself back in her carriage and called out coolly to the coachman go on home   10.354083909069177
you first mousqueton and he stopped his friends directing the valets to go first in order to test the plank leading from the pier to the boat   13.377974142044312
stay here if you like but i warn you twill be rather too warm presently   15.702215639743844
i forgot to ask you where are you taking me   9.329169278321807
de villefort has just confirmed   12.706325396389929
say albert my friend do you wish it   16.091230693823753
40174m what i have done albert   12.999227249820272
chapter 77   12.001322751045175
i am fond of these jars upon which perhaps misshapen frightful monsters have fixed their cold dull eyes and in which myriads of small fish have slept seeking a refuge from the pursuit of their enemies   9.694085291475147
what do you know respecting it   8.527076699536721
and the words which had accompanied the present were above all price   11.544125845014067
this action is somewhat too sublime to be natural   16.365663244371937
morrel s salon   15.111400115502612
and from fromelles she had set out for armentières   10.08034512922408
but monsieur porthos replied that my house being the best he should remain where he was   13.811664844192201
he is gone   12.268192597968717
morrel looked attentively on villefort   10.585393615984284
the youth s dark hair was neatly parted and hung in curls forming a sort of dark frame around his face   10.240243577775344
i take it said m   12.421352414879843
after his wife the banker descended as pale as though he had issued from his tomb instead of his carriage   14.477420646620542
no he was no longer here   12.082564260333791
well mercédès beloved by you i would tempt fortune   11.50341392649335
de villefort is a poison that the prisoner is not acquainted with one that has no known antidote quick as thought rapid as lightning mortal as the thunderbolt   6.473536430860179
half a million is it   12.851702134397978
in fact the king counted them and the twelve studs were all on her majesty s shoulder   7.377636904274256
and the two friends began to laugh   8.67951583160692
the prisoners transported the previous evening from the carceri nuove to the little church of santa maria del popolo had passed the night each accompanied by two priests in a chapel closed by a grating before which were two sentinels who were relieved at intervals   8.063154103350534
milady looked at her lover in silence   7.428255810558195
and does he ever expect to be happy   18.662421228657777
but i deal in certainties   13.335249327173608
levasseur who had been suffering under severe illness made his reappearance in the character of bertram and as usual the announcement of the most admired production of the favorite composer of the day had attracted a brilliant and fashionable audience   11.436262760587068
tell me your wishes and i will comply with them   8.383510349390363
why he said does he enter without first asking for an audience   8.418600339789105
this timidity which might proceed from the astonishment of innocence as well as the shame of guilt conciliated some in his favor   8.630042587615003
he looked at d artagnan with an expression of gratitude and then bestowed on raoul one of those strange smiles of which children are so proud when they receive them   11.922601323487301
mercédès is not yet your wife   8.265930259090895
enough i think to fulfill your highness s wishes on this occasion   9.24580131655836
d artagnan had been a hundred times in the same room with the queen since he had become lieutenant of the musketeers but her majesty had never once spoken to him   9.677225712793348
enough viscount   10.647042602742964
the count of morcerf was not a person to excite either interest or curiosity in a place of public amusement   14.826900018427354
the bare idea would kill me would drive me like a madman to dig my heart out with my finger nails   6.430041688397614
my young man said d artagnan drawing his sword that is an order sooner given than executed   10.369482003024732
the king seeing that he did not reply repeated his question   9.934731839779129
athos gave raoul some of the holy water   12.740035984456549
you re right   8.684934697910581
passing alongside one of them d artagnan fancied he perceived on board it the woman of meung the same whom the unknown gentleman had called milady and whom d artagnan had thought so handsome   10.925413505921437
a son ought not to submit to such a stain on his father s honor   9.760351540820364
because i alone know what   12.20089651060805
and you are going alone   16.677892756183645
said morcerf turning pale with anger   9.03017209202508
i remembered him well   12.636606740758422
and your excellency wants something to eat   16.870078825307477
20139m under any other circumstances franz would have found it impossible to resist his extreme curiosity to know more of so singular a personage and with that intent have sought to renew their short acquaintance   12.831906527472311
therefore tolerably secure in being able to extricate himself from his position provided he were not rated at the unreasonable sum of 5 050 000 francs he stretched himself on his bed and after turning over two or three times fell asleep with the tranquillity of the hero whose life luigi vampa was studying   14.820768666364787
in fact about four o clock they were all concentrated about the palais royal the courts and ground floors of which were filled with musketeers and swiss guards and there awaited the outcome of all this disturbance   11.976703881774874
but it must be acknowledged this response was but momentary   16.48835920544975
devil s coachman   11.16765317209838
in a word said mercédès it was a way of assuring me that his abstinence was intended   12.993015557310294
go but to portsmouth or southampton and you will find the harbors crowded with the yachts belonging to such of the english as can afford the expense and have the same liking for this amusement   15.975337930240496
and one day i discovered that this woman was branded this woman was marked with a fleur de lis on her left shoulder   16.180115709004653
d artagnan in his turn sprang to the ground and just at the moment when the coachman alarmed at not seeing his master fell back a step he seized him by his collar with the left whilst with the right hand he placed the muzzle of a pistol at his breast   7.526066581982236
are you prepared   11.969164400979013
the general was there surrounded by the more prominent chiefs   14.180015513483674
three is just my number   4.216618707673979
the three men brought the carriage up quietly and took out of it a little man stout short elderly and commonly dressed in clothes of a dark color who ascended the ladder very carefully looked suspiciously in at the window of the pavilion came down as quietly as he had gone up and whispered it is she   7.976794101239561
from that moment he grew very guarded   7.9881875377388845
nevertheless d artagnan was struck by the appearance of this new personage   16.727126559102178
but what are we going to do there   12.649029766317916
besides he gives evidence of great kindness of disposition much keenness of wit and as to suitability m   10.07583473028173
and at these words as if all her strength was exhausted milady sank weak and languishing into the arms of the young officer who intoxicated with love anger and voluptuous sensations hitherto unknown received her with transport pressed her against his heart all trembling at the breath from that charming mouth bewildered by the contact with that palpitating bosom   13.048895953747385
the songs of the birds were heard in an aviary hard by and the branches of laburnums and rose acacias formed an exquisite framework to the blue velvet curtains   12.311023006390775
has the corsican ogre broken loose   13.933936743054154
yes my good friend this worthy porthos has just received a sword wound and i am taking him to his country house at saint cloud   17.609084048556227
perhaps we shall soon meet on the field of battle   8.624417091341654
you see mercédès said the young man here is easter come round again   13.678885842444103
locked   6.866533773253402
shall it be read or shall it be passed over   11.429398010785143
all the frame was adjusted except the head which lay on the table   11.065924511772044
then taking up his account book he cancelled with the greatest care all the entries of the amounts he had just paid away   11.208182255951526
his forehead was marked with the line that indicates the constant presence of bitter thoughts   16.4313852760335
i do not know said mercédès   8.97928594685333
no take it away   10.709940053002045
it is a way i have of speaking to myself   11.512074916948226
now this solitude was peopled with his thoughts the night lighted up by his illusions and the silence animated by his anticipations   10.500024211232747
no i can trust nobody   15.595212690377423
i am of a frankness of character quite french   12.821372113064328
the three last returned he with a negligence evidently unaffected for he could not imagine with what intention the question was put   17.87205133892612
stupid fellow yourself   7.370962511366554
fortune lavishes her smiles upon you   8.536307748642308
he was dressed with all the english peculiarity namely in a blue coat with gilt buttons and high collar in the fashion of 1811 a white kerseymere waistcoat and nankeen pantaloons three inches too short but which were prevented by straps from slipping up to the knee   12.206665470663674
with three fingers to be sure one for the father one for the son and one for the holy ghost   13.816670043991143
i have nothing to give you my son but fifteen crowns my horse and the counsels you have just heard   12.203784443919197
but hold should such a misfortune happen well athos passed his hand across his pale brow   13.097925003567745
quite rested sir   12.484103637691675
often in prison faria had said to him when he saw him idle and inactive dantès you must not give way to this listlessness   17.06565126378709
this path was formed in the shape of the figure of 8 thus in its windings making a walk of sixty feet in a garden of only twenty   11.54016795643988
cried the queen in whom the imperious blood of spain and austria began to rise   10.700115013554191
i only ask you one favor   13.052708485426836
in that case they have eaten everything   9.713468094310794
and i was just going to drown myself with the best grace in the world when you arrived just in time to pull me out of the water   13.289415235509779
i never swear my lord i say yes or no   13.633631770328773
while waiting his assistance i trust to your word   5.591283175274244
he looked in the direction whence it came and there under an arbor of virginia jessamine 29 with its thick foliage and beautiful long purple flowers he saw mercédès seated with her head bowed and weeping bitterly   13.62745088235004
yes replied aramis with an absent air   8.399805384063054
to his enemies he was a silent but bitter opponent   16.247235104902927
what i mean to say is that my mother is not quick to give her confidence but when she does she never changes   11.318840478452795
look at that wall without a single window which tells you fine things about mazarin s gratitude   15.90174591545378
tis raoul who has come back said athos   8.82906052144112
go and bow to her   8.505311223046416
i arrived three hours after her at boulogne   12.182117422447451
he is not so much of a devil as he appears   16.848392288680344
for it is getting late   14.664653430061973
the duke put his pen to the paper   11.57449788376784
mazarin sank into a chair with the deepest melancholy painted on his countenance   14.258359625023534
i would rather have had a hat said d artagnan   12.479074268840897
what do i know of the grecian affair   11.905998765820703
now then she said what next   8.876747625519844
a secret may by chance be betrayed by gentlemen   11.459910820200792
as he had said on a camp bed dressed in his black doublet booted unbelted with his felt hat beside him lay the king overcome by sleep and fatigue   10.99351565719125
what did you say sir   14.477665743683112
an hour afterwards luigi vampa was chosen captain vice cucumetto deceased   12.708115097018348
yes said the old man s look with eagerness   10.315415706205883
caderousse then looked around for fernand but he had disappeared   3.8058729224862784
it was past midnight   13.210376255235754
the watch might come up and take all the combatants wounded or not royalists or cardinalists   9.606315250587379
ah you fellows are good managers   13.091605135827269
cried the duchess   12.054369728614333
one of the two who was standing up was of gigantic size and was driving a pick with all his might into the wall whilst the other kneeling beside him was collecting the pieces of stone   14.048723358006237
baptistin this portion of the building was interdicted to him   14.26121603244105
you have truly monsieur said d artagnan bowing again a courtesy for which i assure you i am very grateful   10.386160008001992
he hoped to meet with m   10.960597365614678
a hundred times he had crossed it on horseback a thousand times had swum across   12.069436496655944
but that is not all continued danglars   13.374171807676737
and he pointed out to d artagnan the scratch he had remembered   13.053810494195645
and moreover i should not be surprised had we been forestalled by cromwell   12.761020203139969
if he has raised it he can put it down   11.541686087958903
so i have become a gardener and consequently adopted the costume of my calling   8.502446034040187
well said he i will swim on until i am worn out or the cramp seizes me and then i shall sink   17.027226406265157
oh yes he cried that was my only prayer at last   12.910706033007273
ah valentine said maximilian give me but one finger through this opening in the grating one finger the littlest finger of all that i may have the happiness of kissing it   16.613920847669867
but tell me it is a question of simple curiosity and which was suggested by certain ideas passing in my mind relative to mademoiselle danglars i dare say it is something disparaging which you are going to say   8.876206464009101
the lady with the black hood followed through all their wanderings the looks of porthos and perceived that they rested upon the lady with the velvet cushion the little negro and the maid servant   14.115901880103406
he found the other two friends sitting at table before a good fire drinking a bottle of port and devouring a cold chicken   9.26698647875342
if he has forgotten you mercédès   14.360597652559647
here i await the army of my rebellious subjects   9.359299140539989
the major looked at the count with his large staring eyes and then took a survey of the apartment but his gaze almost immediately reverted to the proprietor of the room   6.118622118314205
why surely a man of his holy profession would not deceive us   17.116896358805832
the man took his way toward the city   9.774311550505356
oh how distinctly i remember that kiss   8.804552775469372
then a sudden idea crossed the mind of d artagnan   15.694806873966758
apropos should mazarin speak to you about me tell him that i should have requested you to acquaint him that in a short time he will see whether i am as he says too old for action   14.265151436460775
the lights again   12.696538849486789
planchet alighted   8.374617817741807
aramis could not in his jealousy avoid being pleased at the coadjutor s misfortune and was about to utter some bon mot more witty than correct when athos stopped him   16.842087647715886
whispered the gascon to porthos   8.024504340768548
take the republic for a tutor   8.594748836964005
d artagnan seeing him approach drew his sword a foot out of the scabbard   14.482744681386063
the blow so they tell me at least was struck with a master s hand   18.651156071817574
when it comes to its height i shall probably lie still and motionless as though dead uttering neither sigh nor groan   10.444274688767406
exclaimed d artagnan stopping the carriage   9.843443188145452
de villefort said renée becoming more and more terrified   14.306907697783501
bonacieux uttered a little cry and fled   11.381392211128883
danglars rang and was answered by a servant in a showy livery   11.078538513818604
don t you know that i was in my youth a poet   11.511481775632426
it shall be done replied bertuccio   11.517908264314567
but as i before said i was anxious to get rid of them upon any terms   12.50867922134052
the young king would perhaps show us some gratitude   7.162512749737656
ah if you could tell me that you would be doing me a service   13.638933685822682
nevertheless i carefully preserved my ladder against one of those unforeseen opportunities of which i spoke just now and which sudden chance frequently brings about   10.317429362996046
but as soon as the daylight gained the pre eminence he saw that he was alone with a corpse   11.440010916539702
who is that   10.395590197155396
the villefort family vault two days after a considerable crowd was assembled towards ten o clock in the morning around the door of m   10.819721859894827
dead you may raise your head and say i am the son of him you killed because for the first time he has been compelled to break his word   15.390946577265264
perhaps if i employed my strength against women i might perchance find them weaker than myself and consequently conquer them   11.33169023550404
the noble animals bounded forward   10.495589495242518
the duc de blacas assures me you have some interesting information to communicate   10.023632282091093
pardon me i love him so much   7.646787390348113
what of the postscript   14.767653027729098
debray in pacifying a kingdom   8.708252798756732
the past like the country through which we walk becomes indistinct as we advance   12.80931910569379
but i come expressly for that purpose   18.828609896110954
ah sir said d artagnan you have a wicked smile   12.158169917519206
the name of that port   7.535558575399214
are you not he asked the priest who here in the château d if is generally thought to be ill   6.53375173780574
he lodges at the hôtel des princes   10.147508186403243
you know that i care nothing for my title   17.662403556980905
why didn t you say so   6.805427824268255
i will suffer without complaint the pecuniary deprivation to which he has subjected me   13.983518739226767
ah monsieur said d artagnan as if to sum up in a word all that conversation if only his eminence would relent and grant to monsieur de la fere our liberty   10.949102226276676
there is nothing compromising in the name of a town   12.54279341619529
said he what does that mean   7.378464054285468
a gentleman and a diplomatist   16.678931763110583
there is but one way   7.7493514037839875
madame danglars turned very pale then exclaimed i can not believe it   15.91195698487803
then at the other extremity he heard the footsteps of those who were pursuing him   13.04852759297227
two shots were the reply to this threat   16.362482121734267
the king clasped his hands and raised his eyes to heaven   8.330193473258648
beauchamp looked at albert with the smile which was so peculiar to him and which in its numerous modifications served to express every varied emotion of his mind   11.885034627290645
the englishman entered and found morrel seated at a table turning over the formidable columns of his ledger which contained the list of his liabilities   9.0671184815371
i bought two thirds of the shares of that company   9.44121783885048
keep your ill humor at home in your money boxes or since you have clerks whom you pay vent it upon them   12.912591300536238
0295m it seemed however to edmond who was hidden from his comrades by the inequalities of the ground that at sixty paces from the harbor the marks ceased   12.10381877804811
not exactly it is the wine that was sent by your order   14.726496838453418
the monk turned pale wiped his brow and went and bolted the door   9.758370864872727
rest assured   11.506670421993627
my dear little love   7.536203606746759
really that demoiselle d aubigne is very charming   12.008314461754816
i wish to see the governor   20.79221620416956
melancholy in a capitalist like the appearance of a comet presages some misfortune to the world   7.701828696282743
the jesuit persisted in his opinion   8.134418878393046
while singing milady listened   10.598355159496245
monte cristo felt tears start into his eyes and he again walked hastily up and down the room   11.889429040402318
what do you want with me   12.250736558415886
i have won five pistoles of aramis   7.648750867951672
they heard the hissing of the scimitar and the cry of the victim then a truncated mass sank beneath the blow   13.749523110749076
i may sacrifice my soul but what matters it   12.849676317948752
valentine perceived him without betraying the least surprise   11.65911951808315
charles stuart you are our prisoner   14.827406998796427
but the wound remains and will reopen at the first loss   11.908781719672081
besides i might be deceived   9.058671299225077
you have water woods flowers there   10.254895288707909
madame danglars with tearless eyes but with her breast heaving with concealed emotion placed the bank notes in her bag put the certificate and check into her pocket book and then standing pale and mute awaited one kind word of consolation   12.807429559510679
you lie you lie   11.555955825497941
this was more than his life the life of the woman he loved   12.861547350152993
in front of them the lys rolled its waters like a river of molten tin   7.659591687237248
but in the first place this woman i have described must be found who is desirous of avenging herself upon the duke   15.093480616268053
welcome to you i expected you   7.076147310356276
they opened it and found 900 000 francs in bank scrip   16.013682534994793
morrel held out his hand to her   11.432922950743883
she had already been an hour in this apartment   14.266559239476123
his brow was not one of those that long remain clear   16.366728000266754
do you know me madame   12.469354622074627
but he saw nothing except what seemed like a ruin where three or four men went and came like shadows   13.010573149168307
why said albert he was talked about for a week   10.440666372919301
inquired the count who seemed to become somewhat interested in bertuccio s story   9.32383854591879
his second the almost miraculous preservation of madame de villefort s life   15.678427027257666
in exchange for his silence athos drank enough for four and without appearing to be otherwise affected by wine than by a more marked constriction of the brow and by a deeper sadness   16.125447166930705
mazarin marked with surprise the diabolical expression with which the young man uttered these words   4.534532630696514
all my hopes are blighted my heart is broken my life a burden everything around me is sad and mournful   15.38869760767803
you see they are going to send a whole regiment against us said athos   15.209952288002256
who calls richelieu calls satan   10.23073712615589
the man remained in the village   4.20703145475843
this last proof instead of giving him fresh strength deprived him of it   9.631272615668145
and your eminence will tell me in what convent that woman is   12.724080321512096
monsieur du tremblay received d artagnan with extreme politeness and invited him to sit down with him to supper of which he was himself about to partake   11.668555629691628
if ever you meet him again wherever it may be whether on the high road or in the street or in a church anywhere that he or you may be put your foot on his neck and crush him without pity without mercy as you would crush a viper or a scorpion   12.367665624424179
my poor child replied monte cristo that is merely because your father and myself are the only men who have ever talked to you   8.138099972279079
monsieur that my dear father is here   12.130082620012432
replied aramis becoming as pale as death   9.413143695338855
it is likely   14.180944925265973
and i my lord said d artagnan accept it as it is given   7.332305627200232
at the sight of d artagnan who entered the courtyard on horseback bernouin rubbed his eyes and thought he must be mistaken   12.175602793593054
he listened to know whence this sound could proceed   11.798697930698998
and then anne of austria had so often deserted her friends that her support seemed most precarious   16.92304258952828
it was he who gave us so much trouble and kept us on the road so much   14.240550234772478
i suppose that is not all   17.919772566032123
got what   5.393994514293551
i am almost a prisoner   12.939040798461745
as for me replied aramis i have in my pocket the very programme of the conditions which the deputation of which i formed one went yesterday to saint germain to impose on you   13.35144417988002
an instant afterwards the door opened she felt two arms encircle her and a mouth pressed her forehead   15.58282421533712
andrea surrounded by his friends complimented flattered beginning to believe in the reality of his dream was almost bewildered   11.084706300255286
then proposals from any quarter will be agreeable to you since for the moment you have no master but god   14.419470790301087
thought the gascon where has he heard it   14.254999597114884
he resolved therefore to let things take their course without making any direct overture to the count   16.64394204768983
milady had spoken to the man in the black cloak   8.065006558692573
don t try to appear anything but what you are a true country youth   6.630779914036099
may i venture to repeat my prayer to your eminence   9.284035410431928
now gentlemen cried the king forward   14.123839648665399
this battle won by me the king will have no further resources in england or in scotland   11.012613988452376
mingling the immensity of his dreams with the immensity of the ocean he came his horse going at a foot s pace to a hill from the top of which he perceived behind a hedge reclining on the sand and catching in its passage one of those rays of the sun so rare at this period of the year seven men surrounded by empty bottles   18.497899035919556
but to wait surrounded by assassins and poisoners   11.719686329756502
what are you about   16.302459294869085
she called the grandest ladies of the court her friend and the queen proud as she is in her double character as austrian and as spaniard called her her sister   14.386036364441505
but instead of growing easier dantès pains appeared to increase in violence   10.057225737332853
monte cristo with moistened eye heaving breast and lips half open extended to albert a hand which the latter pressed with a sentiment resembling respectful fear   10.02580603141663
the cardinal took the queen s hand and pressed it with an air of gallantry to his lips   9.471029084759905
d artagnan and porthos withdrew to a corner of the cabinet   9.732804727714697
her reputation would be lost it is true   6.935276817308749
could you have imagined this scene château renaud when we saw her at the most three weeks ago about to sign that contract   11.756647442787632
on the contrary he was very kind to me   12.261737922404723
so you defend him   6.372997717759089
it will not be so difficult replied d artagnan springing to the ground   12.86487113705204
more especially since your wishes coincide with mine and as soon as m   14.679536306304932
the house as i said is between the court and the garden   12.520893139876538
cocles went away perfectly happy for this eulogium of m   12.631199990212641
often before his captivity dantès mind had revolted at the idea of assemblages of prisoners made up of thieves vagabonds and murderers   14.26092005900653
i read the advertisement in one of the papers and was tempted by the false title a country house   8.62281342050143
the old man again signified that it was a notary he desired   11.44931235748371
reverend sir murmured caderousse seeking to regain the window which the count pitilessly blocked reverend sir i don t know believe me i take my oath a pane of glass out continued the count a dark lantern a bunch of false keys a secretaire half forced it is tolerably evident caderousse was choking   14.2573153377942
franz was the excellency the vehicle was the carriage and the hôtel de londres was the palace   15.869287803136132
let him escape inaction is a pardonable offence   15.349289329040822
it is she   6.759710557354413
sir said mousqueton i much fear that what you ask for are very rare things in this detestable and barren country and i think we should do better to go and seek hospitality from the owner of a little house we see on the fringe of the forest   2.228725575699327
the priest had a writing teacher at rome make three alphabets one large one middling and one small   14.44153888551094
monte cristo is the name of an island and he has a family name   8.941577066794292
are you quite sure you do not say so to tranquillize my fears   15.689618510593405
and was it not found out at last to whom the horse and jockey belonged   12.098391137881292
again that accusation   19.471690683263404
from this moment vampa devoted all his leisure time to perfecting himself in the use of his precious weapon   14.635150391549134
just now i told you it was of m   13.54310794624396
while fighting and retreating as i have told monseigneur he found the door of the cellar stairs behind him and as the door was open he took out the key and barricaded himself inside   9.607743078495517
speak or no absolution   17.606081148350988
but i do not see the count of monte cristo here   15.64149908267489
the same evening when the flock was safe at the farm the little luigi hastened to the smith at palestrina took a large nail heated and sharpened it and formed a sort of stylus   15.145932143707475
the coachman perceived at once by the expression of the man who thus addressed him that he had fallen into a trap and he remained with his mouth wide open and his eyes portentously staring   11.947057037658604
how dear sister   9.487424417846265
alas my dear mother some have suffered so much and yet live and have raised a new fortune on the ruin of all the promises of happiness which heaven had made them on the fragments of all the hope which god had given them   12.30095101109335
in the left side was it not and with a knife   11.339490251649826
valentine witnessed this scene with a sentiment of stupefaction   13.397495267629472
asked madame danglars shuddering   17.257594580265827
but what can four men or rather three men do for i tell you you must not count on monsieur d artagnan   12.53561809143261
therefore said monte cristo feigning to mistake his meaning therefore i will not for another instant retard the pleasure of your meeting   12.649260318131905
a cloud of dust mounted toward the sky and all was over   9.82832327128119
i bought my experience dearly particularly fair women   14.58057784990731
the rapier had pierced his bosom   13.807797027540836
of what did he die   11.64867350317568
advance gentlemen said the cardinal   10.517413432766912
sire i have every reason to believe that a storm is brewing in the south   9.686868031991066
but a recompense was in store for him   9.80532293821086
50167m no no no i tell you   14.352281163946927
his piercing look was fixed in vain on the satirical face of the gascon and the unchanging countenance of porthos   14.37963580322851
the moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed it and morrel saw villefort come out upon the steps followed by a gentleman in black   14.190867613953351
and what is this condition   11.350017967443673
ah said he you have remarked i must have been blind not to have seen   14.753733791442304
and villefort dashed open the window in front of the carriage   7.82682130432503
replied d artagnan who knew nothing about it but who wished to appear to know everything that was going on   9.7813229484134
or rather to observe the chronological order i and d artagnan replied athos   11.67489454129233
tis i really i   9.448435155811667
but every simpleton would not be able to understand your heroism and sooner or later you will find yourself compelled to explain it to them more energetically than would be convenient to your bodily health and the duration of your life   9.279064759152908
it is horrible indeed but no one assassinates   5.805197093951594
two duels which he had already found the means of fighting in spite of the edicts against them and more especially in spite of his tutor s vigilance these things excited the greatest curiosity in raoul   13.81384957721406
one might by the fearful swelling of the veins of his forehead and the contraction of the muscles round the eye trace the terrible conflict which was going on between the living energetic mind and the inanimate and helpless body   13.34567697041716
and you aramis you were going i think to visit madame de longueville   14.484028567748009
well the english like good wine as you may know monsieur   12.025814412464213
i do not mean that for you blacas continued louis xviii   15.631231488563158
and your visit if it should ever be known to the cardinal will thus seem legitimate   9.105264579403565
the field of battle instead therefore of being at saint denis or at charenton will be near compiegne or villars cotterets   8.241163087962128
i must take care   14.757372655518662
from a distance they perceived aramis seated in a melancholy manner at his window looking out like sister anne at the dust in the horizon   8.374901419017021
scarcely had i covered it with earth when the arm of the corsican was stretched towards me   16.33051061547643
and did your superior order you to treat me in this way   13.313649678677846
who knew that he had several thousand francs in his belt and who had often examined his weapons which were very beautiful if not with envy at least with curiosity   3.239979493917895
monsieur d artagnan is not with me   10.6803560590068
well what matters all that to us   8.829092395542636
but i wish to see the governor   15.756070425412288
come thought franz he is still more mysterious since the two accounts do not agree   12.447960010771586
but i should not have recollected it if you had not reminded me   15.464073047491553
his grace the duke of buckingham will not set out for france   9.539798159481442
is the committee willing to hear this witness   10.191256772849785
will m   12.6695225394688
danglars thought dentro la testa meant put in your head   14.454402578394136
tomorrow morning i start for paris   10.222821391276993
here are two hundred said andrea   13.495510218432852
her attitude though perfectly natural for an eastern woman would in a european have been deemed too full of coquettish straining after effect   12.999252897959881
pray learn monsieur olivain that people like us are not to be served by cowards   11.569264973568892
men may subdue men they can not overcome the elements   10.895640133809248
the poor girl was so sad that she did not even notice milady s condescension   13.415650080121688
were you stopped   14.363578368126195
you are accused of high treason said the cardinal slowly   10.590299341704089
under orders from general cromwell   7.612021348671622
did he die   15.096175133008188
and the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter   10.924345663183056
all four were to meet the next day at eleven o clock   10.456452241520529
tis capital   14.60849923531477
there is nothing now to do but to put the address to this letter   10.373825403420753
cried aramis i may have done some good   11.64213945067548
old woman   12.093245829596528
merri you begin   11.173365304097503
mazarin sighed   6.3939031180520765
we need not say she stopped at the first floor   12.862248641411687
at this moment and as though the utterance of villefort s wish had sufficed to effect its accomplishment a servant entered the room and whispered a few words in his ear   11.25411786941685
i have almost given them away as it is   11.26297815782179
keep the struggle for yourself bear all the suffering but spare her the trial of poverty which must accompany your first efforts   9.60442683692961
bonacieux opened the door of a closet which was entirely dark and led d artagnan into it   9.06003650172212
cucumetto fancied for a moment the young man was about to take her in his arms and fly   16.183502639243528
the object then was to examine the place near enough to verify the reports   8.790257734613645
let them come in cried the young princess bounding to the door   10.198836590072203
this appalling sight almost bereft me of my senses and finding that i could no longer be of service to anyone in the house my only desire was to fly   8.686806171159555
i desire that these horses with completely new harness may be at the door with my carriage   19.62949344859865
for is not the destruction of the vital principle the repose to which everything is tending to which every unhappy being aspires is not this the repose of matter after which i so long sighed and which i was seeking to attain by the painful process of starvation when faria appeared in my dungeon   12.927916258667977
his valet looked at the visitors through a sort of wicket   10.435341156173989
it is evident that you wish to avoid her   18.946912584990194
are you disposed to obey count de rochefort   10.258060787192093
there is a will   15.758401538117045
then here s to our next merry meeting   11.83810090641375
and i can answer for his having been up these two hours   14.283215479045015
we must pierce through the corridor by forming a side opening about the middle as it were the top part of a cross   11.156673276106151
the tears so long rebellious gushed from his eyes   16.164341728107757
do you permit me to return   12.009872011003303
asked the coadjutor   12.846576144437638
these were the ancestors of charles standing back dimly in their tarnished frames   10.14710351828591
still continued the procureur looking at the doctor with uneasiness if you wish it if you demand it why then it shall be done   12.924594303042523
and he suffered almost as much as poor kitty who at that very moment was crying in the next chamber   11.105877651435119
that tells me their name and nothing else   14.043038592490682
what you have just said induces me to hope that you intend breakfasting with me   11.484261972811252
today   12.410018394120709
her eye alone lived and glared horribly   8.739687760468904
then suddenly struck with an idea i am saved   7.706893856525594
alas were it only for my own sake i should prefer to die   13.063439543463867
the house had not been inhabited since we left it but it had just been let for nine years   9.725907145422642
monsieur cardinal you know that i do not like worldly pleasures   6.793425879493281
well said dantès mark this   17.390743204132495
the door was thrown violently open and the unfortunate mercer rushed into the chamber in which the council was held   11.618773877716588
how convenient that there s a bench here   11.044104806635135
but he stopped doubtless to reflect   12.786612210707176
saved by the crew of the vessel that has just entered the harbor   10.515207185014747
as i am rich we will today begin to dine together again expecting that you will be rich in your turn   14.986633748466849
it is his way and you must take him as you find him   10.70098785987189
my friend said my mother when your master s orders arrive if it is the poniard which he sends instead of despatching us by that horrible death which we both so much dread you will mercifully kill us with this same poniard will you not   9.014248769362073
with the queen i double her risk   15.216842028434009
my dear friend all those things i have but i am a hermit in the midst of superfluity   13.151448648202665
and then must not all be over   12.663629073858928
but if he be willing to accept my offers will you oppose them   11.583980868737036
soon he saw the lights of la consigne   12.159369602450816
a joyous smile lighted porthos s face   15.791299246323607
and it will be so far advantageous to you to accept my services that upon edmond s release from prison no further change will be requisite on board the pharaon than for dantès and myself each to resume our respective posts   14.929071159641374
d artagnan felt a strong inclination to embrace planchet as he had embraced him on his departure   14.31824955038044
for the people had learned that broussel and blancmesnil had made speeches in their behalf and although the eloquence of these deputies had been without avail it had none the less won for them the people s good will   12.930071218818867
tis caderousse who has heard of your arrival and no doubt comes to congratulate you on your fortunate return   7.88818478255312
yes surely he said he said   14.148678640145848
he opened the door of the room in which the musketeers were and found porthos playing an earnest game of dice with aramis   13.646928600104687
where was she   18.62515964862266
whilst all this was going on athos and aramis were entering paris by the faubourg st   12.041823458564723
danglars is a money lover and those who love money you know think too much of what they risk to be easily induced to fight a duel   14.681915255172218
a whole bottle if you will drink my health   14.349595427274291
according to the care we bestow upon it death is either a friend who rocks us gently as a nurse or an enemy who violently drags the soul from the body   12.711743560281464
oh murmured danglars that bed is probably one of the coffins hollowed in the wall and the sleep i shall enjoy will be death from one of the poniards i see glistening in the darkness   13.110313525319107
he looked at the queen with anxiety   6.9795343704053465
night came   10.975790043886803
instead of the spectacle of gloomy and silent death the piazza del popolo presented a spectacle of gay and noisy mirth and revelry   6.171200530074147
and these two living statues whose hearts beat so violently under their marble aspect separated from each other by the whole length of the room forgot themselves for a moment or rather forgot the world in their mutual contemplation   9.227743428694666
on the cross cried i rising for at that abhorred voice i had recovered all my strength on the cross i swear that no promise no menace no force no torture shall close my mouth   12.46535387181398
it was really very good of you to recognize me so quickly and still more so to bestow your first visit on me   11.853340537590109
and however the old sailor and his crew tried to pump him they extracted nothing more from him   12.49783714403587
i admire i love him for i know his former adventures but i shall not speak to him until the day after to morrow   13.531670975585204
in heaven s name my dear athos do not make a useless sacrifice   14.425892406579129
you will not have long to wait said the landlord   16.978038232983153
she had often in her youth spoken of poverty but between want and necessity those synonymous words there is a wide difference   9.21386583639023
my husband has five or six valises   12.087109935807414
d artagnan came again on the morrow and was still better received than on the evening before   14.953087389153303
until then you will not see me   11.834226541719193
near the pan he also placed a pretty little basket of villetri grapes and a flask of orvieto   10.26726526508654
juxon was waiting for him impatiently   11.894586797698247
as for franz he remained at florence and after having passed a few days in exploring the paradise of the cascine and spending two or three evenings at the houses of the florentine nobility he took a fancy into his head having already visited corsica the cradle of bonaparte to visit elba the waiting place of napoleon   10.484600095820673
villefort s astonishment redoubled at this second thrust so forcibly made by his strange adversary   9.26706031474066
do you suppose that the real savant addresses himself stupidly to the mere individual   11.564152254278964
you know what it is to love my lord   7.056304041123679
this morning he made two or three exits worthy of didier or anthony   17.759612259531323
at their approach planchet came out leading the two horses   8.350132023623976
d artagnan the welfare of the state is deposited in your hands   9.027471204917598
it was agreed that the three millions should be intrusted to danglars to invest   11.824457672668801
on the honor of a gentleman   14.09172968963117
i will teach you how to laugh to morrow but in another manner   12.504461973086137
i should think we would see him   12.73839787592002
you have seen your dream realized   14.813664414990587
sir you have distracted me   16.139664160600987
and your presence you must be aware would compromise the cardinal   13.678129066186207
murmured cromwell   15.154542359709271
how was such a thing possible   14.676958142112618
i thank your majesty said aramis but under these robes i have a coat of mail a pistol and a dagger   10.67920816088782
he opened the case and offered them to the queen with deep and silent anguish   17.53966534089784
the count is fond of travelling and being rich possesses a vessel of his own   10.045670473959824
it was that paper you read this morning   9.939707204630196
oh you may make sure of him   15.920653485759786
i count upon it   17.354063409623805
still sir   5.0576600124056394
that is all i wished to know   15.442518835535015
timidly asked the old soldier   7.165039764059725
you hear sir said d artagnan turning to mordaunt   13.194848462582806
well my friend i am come to give you this very title which you wish for so much   10.16578049705233
the lackeys were brought by the cries she made   14.387162585154611
i was forced to go out of my road to obtain some information near nîmes so that i was somewhat late and therefore i did not choose to stop   11.764788954625093
it is mere want of occupation   7.540819775026897
were heard above all the noise deafening as it was   18.56231668123423
but perhaps they have killed him   12.645547455621992
i was not aware my alms were so well invested   13.153320165269221
these active beings flitted here and there like so many demons completing some unknown labor   15.025489162454743
it proves you have a good memory for it must be about ten years since we last met   11.487516195232278
when he had fixed his piercing look on this modern babylon which equally engages the contemplation of the religious enthusiast the materialist and the scoffer great city murmured he inclining his head and joining his hands as if in prayer less than six months have elapsed since first i entered thy gates   15.119961369202429
and yet he said to reassure himself that this pavilion perhaps had nothing in common with mme   4.0164245964502
and did he invite you to dine   15.709040346241839
morrel called her and she ran to the gate   12.260196037149127
if i once went up those stairs   14.730324137391483
that s a snare said athos   13.131479229932468
from this moment i become your friend and since you are engaged in my affairs i ought to occupy myself in yours   11.312497257102658
mordaunt wanted now only two or three fathoms to reach the boat for the approach of death seemed to give him supernatural strength   15.195849291559673
then turning to mazarin now my lord let us enter if you please   12.335120971206873
he would not die by what seemed an infamous death   12.143239130077712
but as though in a dream he was transfixed to the spot his eyes glared as though they were starting through the sockets   11.991015565346864
grimaud appeared   9.923316324366466
sheathe your swords gentlemen sheathe your swords   8.420081322155704
the first row seeing their sergeant stop stopped in their turn and so on to the very last   13.174628844541731
wasn t his name faria   10.205785830404189
enough sir said morcerf we will speak no more on the subject   14.299263598881396
d artagnan placed the ring on his finger and again waited   11.515410228626484
this voice startled her   6.3321898525645075
have you finished grimaud   15.086265680510746
when a thing suited him he paid the price demanded without thinking to ask for any abatement   10.219798740143938
franz to provoke him and to fight with him   14.264125378161324
30079m how kind you are   13.705621103528777
why do you not recollect the name of the celebrated bandit by whom i was made prisoner   10.985593187159353
yet i am sure she is not happy said caderousse   11.239769778843826
de villefort the king s attorney   12.323168753181987
sire it was really impossible to learn secrets which that man concealed from all the world   10.685436458968923
if the emissaries of the cardinal arrive he will take no notice   10.867125229482117
bonacieux ate a few mouthfuls mechanically and just touched the glass with her lips   14.649321071232805
yes sir replied raoul with slight hesitation   10.036958610317235
five millions why what a crœsus you are   12.098231231871214
silence prevailed for an instant during which monte cristo gazed intently on the picture   10.412586299039834
excuse me gentlemen said the general   9.872845812406279
both sir he has both fortune and position both   11.2540529179463
how have you spent this 250 000 francs   9.703717353187363
spur your horses   14.044847936640485
you have been spoken of in a promising quarter and you will soon i hope have news that will be agreeable to you   17.50578263852023
wait here for me   10.32910846369209
and kill him said porthos   14.15686244862184
villefort shuddered and looked at monte cristo as if he wished to read in his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he had just uttered   11.185603683631461
oh cried the duchess i can not make war alone but i can avenge myself on that ungrateful queen and most ambitious favorite on the honor of a duchess i will avenge myself   11.479535266985163
devil take these puritans said mazarin aside   15.687344899239342
dantès might have waited until the evening visit was over but he was afraid that the governor would change his mind and order the dead body to be removed earlier   12.29005136660696
it appears too you kept him waiting a long time at boulogne   13.322913014584605
at least keep him there till my daughter be married   14.961124243455753
0079m certainly not   14.591787387612637
of perugino of raphael of manners customs of the famous aqua tofana of which they had told you i think you said that certain individuals in perugia had preserved the secret   16.24519916735848
but continued the queen you have doubtless come for some important purpose   5.980347740834563
anne of austria stretched forth her hand closing her eyes and leaning with the other upon estafania for she felt that her strength was about to fail her   9.724371372546578
and the result of that letter you well know madame was my arrest   7.064807010895634
then murmured louis he was well informed   12.48322209684898
sir said she i perfectly understand my grandfather s meaning at all times   13.456095499025718
d artagnan reassured her as well as he could and promised to remain insensible to the seductions of milady   16.00991831779624
when you leave this you will behold my men at work   9.888101369745678
the waiter did as he was desired   9.426627832969658
said monte cristo i trust he is not going to tempt me by some fresh insult   16.347665427203598
no boat   10.406960557880005
athos surmised what had taken place and smiled   8.407590021866902
now as regards the second question   10.417321612280022
he was sixty years old but to me he was handsomer than all the fine youths i saw   10.774149207771192
madame said la meilleraie do not say too much against him before me for the service he rendered me is still fresh   11.439919657979711
porthos said nothing but he handled in his pocket the fifty pistoles he had gained from groslow with a degree of satisfaction which betrayed itself in his whole bearing   15.089652433615104
excuse me sir said baptistin who had followed his master with indescribable terror but i think i see a carriage down there under the trees   8.33396160499133
then each of these men retreated as far as the ditch from which each took a concealed musket   15.123195845918119
i shall require your services to see that all be properly arranged   14.191989934038189
the woman who was outside the window turned round and passed within four steps of d artagnan pulling down the hood of her mantle   6.950380893242097
a faint cry of mingled pleasure and surprise escaped from the lips of valentine who almost instantly said in a saddened tone as though some envious cloud darkened the joy which illumined her heart alas no maximilian this must not be for many reasons   12.992320427827172
at length about the hour the governor had appointed footsteps were heard on the stairs   8.817547300538966
in the corridor he again met the pretty kitty   12.983885184201934
if we die for him it will be grand   15.163148369424668
have i guards   12.45552229208139
30303m and what are his claims to the peerage   12.343670918542506
if you prefer another name it   11.459523298048108
athos imparted to him his greatness of soul porthos his enthusiasm aramis his elegance   11.792823089647467
but monsieur le prince is to set out for the army   15.686771003648921
i intended this money for the charity fund and i seemed to be robbing them if i did not pay them with these precise bonds   8.52382342435415
pardon me monseigneur for saying such things but they form my excuse   10.929042114518827
i know you even better now   11.4263683997484
now said athos sleep or try to sleep my friends and i will watch   6.99493807731451
i will do all i can and i hope you will be satisfied   13.24530944041527
whither are you taking me   15.485114850860963
then taking him aside he whispered to him thou hast done right   16.40307904040521
i will say and do nothing until i am convinced that he has quite abandoned me and then andrea had formed a plan which was tolerably clever   12.672857809618456
the latter a pretty girl of about twenty or twenty two years active and lively the true soubrette of a great lady jumped from the step upon which according to the custom of the time she was seated and took her way toward the terrace upon which d artagnan had perceived lubin   15.004903087798436
he fixed his eyes on that window he distinguished a shadow in the darkness   10.898401160455819
another possessed all mercédès heart   11.301396053438443
dried lizards shone like emeralds set in great squares of black wood and bunches of wild odoriferous herbs doubtless possessed of virtues unknown to common men were fastened to the ceiling and hung down in the corners of the apartment   11.489277507654586
what has become of the minister   8.949084059906697
i have already told you it is a fancy you have taken in your head   16.545874612156194
yes i will not deny it i do await and i do love him of whom you speak   9.878703721998185
athos never received any letters   7.693878602806396
farewell said charles farewell my children   9.10172610928301
now continued aramis as the ladies did not see the singer come back and as he was found in the rue payenne with a great sword wound through his body it was supposed that i had accommodated him thus   12.78843007924001
perhaps they can yet save my life   13.034231596600094
why do we love   11.155160884554176
could you allow me a few words in private   16.230197062196176
what the devil did you come to such a country for athos   7.3835466663700675
and you have heard his fortune mentioned   16.314691309598757
it was very polite of you   12.005786233938958
this clever person is your relative then   13.768889476870951
madeleine s brother entered d artagnan s service   8.841180606696579
yes said milady   0.5535931480589245
a moment later he came down again holding in his hand the small shagreen case which he opened to assure himself it contained the diamond seemed to hesitate as to which pocket he should put it in then as if dissatisfied with the security of either pocket he deposited it in his red handkerchief which he carefully rolled round his head   13.174037163216648
he had expected this declaration for the last two or three days and when at last it came his eyes glistened as much as they had lowered on listening to morcerf   7.8795682378018626
felton himself might now be watched   11.83841603384152
it s a misfortune to which his friend the devil treats us said aramis   11.523739151663344
i will not sleep where i must scorn   9.418556190168855
by bacchus   9.384757233998876
then cried planchet joyously i see well that it is the same comte de la fere whom we seek   7.835254841121242
his excellency is not perhaps aware that m   6.719668445367107
and it was the sight of his odious blood flowing beneath the ax of the headsman which spread that charming smile upon her lips   10.164139860533183
that my orders go far madame   10.80423942899221
40132m andrea went as she directed him and on the third floor he found a hare s paw which by the hasty ringing of the bell it was evident he pulled with considerable ill temper   17.803651090815855
he hired the apartment in which he lived furnished passed only a few hours in the day there and rarely slept there   10.442267896458478
where is thy master   18.472969269286292
and turning with that fury which made him so formidable he rushed toward the chief of the insurgents a man who with a huge sword in his hand was trying to hew a passage to the coach door through the musketeers   9.207552930440828
think often of raoul   16.991250486358666
the sailors did not require much urging   5.217778084242112
shall i ring   7.853038507021248
on the eleventh the queen in going to mass at notre dame as she always did on saturdays was followed by more than two hundred women demanding justice   12.13682993396679
benedetto was thus forever condemned in public opinion before the sentence of the law could be pronounced   11.832005539856274
from them i learned it all   10.55497246273486
captivity the fifth day milady had however achieved a half triumph and success doubled her forces   10.856803871803264
he would extinguish the sun if the sun incommoded him   12.431929975166213
tell them this athos resumed d artagnan   12.779059212522233
on what subject shall i converse with her   14.610071685601447
tell the captain we are coming   10.107220185093428
a tear trembled in the eye of the invalid   11.79753052850429
he was hungry   12.131329253211188
you are my landlord   12.837016023477835
but as they drew near in order to cast anchor a little cutter looking like a coastguard formidably armed approached the merchant vessel and dropped into the sea a boat which directed its course to the ladder   12.159646600171714
defend yourself   14.649481728261552
anger mounted to d artagnan s face   8.456463573151412
he launched into a eulogy of his eminence and said that he should not have failed to enter into the guards of the cardinal instead of the king s guards if he had happened to know m   10.174224212030687
a longer stay in this dangerous spot would have been useless imprudence   11.891404267187871
anne s head was bent down she had not seen the italian s smile   12.700375783253982
the carriage stopped at the left side of the portico two men presented themselves at the carriage window   12.485652957107504
but if i do fight you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in shooting and fencing   19.39248617079143
i will write to him then nearly in these terms   12.259729562527108
upon fifty soldiers   13.85209051396265
she looked like a woman destined to live to be a hundred years old from her apparent sound health and great activity of mind and body   10.654157345374315
albert completely exhausted with the exercise which invigorated monte cristo was sleeping in an armchair near the window while the count was designing with his architect the plan of a conservatory in his house when the sound of a horse at full speed on the high road made albert look up   14.824495067677564
grimaud drew out a pistol   15.442781798518238
yes said aramis we have promised   11.819280333295438
it was brought to me   17.600562561010754
you call yourself in paris the count of monte cristo   7.452414562057228
it would be a difficult matter to arrange said monte cristo   12.612662870882566
i mean the russian prince who you said had 30 000 livres and we only found 22 000   7.317815304418014
d artagnan then remembered the injunction if you value your own life or that of those who love you remain motionless and as if you had seen nothing   9.857647187452743
the duke had followed with anxiety la ramee s unspoken soliloquy reading it from point to point upon his face   7.877272072459689
listen my dear my adored valentine said he in his melodious and grave tone   13.47215926857731
albert with his eyes closed was standing grasping the window curtains   14.59905290970006
now since d artagnan did not constitute a body of horsemen since he was alone since he was not going away from rueil and was going to saint germain no one paid any attention to him and his journey was not obstructed in any way   16.650482900250726
i am obliged to you guitant although your intention was perhaps not very favorable to me for such an opportunity   20.838297794654935
the cannonade of the isle of ré presaged to him the dragonnades of the cévennes   9.860537968214249
this is a fine conversation with an officer of the king   14.596616685747716
there are the fifty louis i faith said aramis emptying the purse on the table all bearing the effigy of louis xiii   10.33864563606861
to day monsieur   16.43277596692064
he was therefore occupied in revising his reply to cromwell when some one knocked gently at the door of communication with the queen s apartments   11.94523456458297
as soon as lord de winter saw buckingham was dead he ran to felton whom the soldiers still guarded on the terrace of the palace   11.46950197269111
he gave accurate descriptions of naples and malta which he knew as well as marseilles and held stoutly to his first story   13.056770677237829
here is a pardon for one of the prisoners   9.526220685742716
albert in his turn sat behind   10.519873401632747
oh how bitter a fate is mine to serve either as a victim or an enemy to all who are stronger than myself while my only friend and supporter is a living corpse   7.291125657312509
we will give them money   14.213074764388626
how can such enormous jars have been manufactured   9.241543022599231
is the abbé at home   15.264805538879777
ah if i were in your place said albert   12.823605271845743
enter gentlemen and be kind enough to wait for me   9.425543475275434
the devil thou dost not   9.312810510564667
we are going to return to the service mouston replied porthos still trying to restore his mustache to the military curl it had long lost   7.674988704303059
most willingly   6.509151883324133
he fancied that they buried the dead at the château d if and imagining they would not expend much labor on the grave of a prisoner he calculated on raising the earth with his shoulders but unfortunately their arrangements at the château frustrated his projects   10.647751918934194
still in spite of all you must admit that this count of monte cristo is a most singular personage   14.060877881050839
said beauchamp in a calm tone   13.368336307484086
dantès obeyed and commenced what he called his history but which consisted only of the account of a voyage to india and two or three voyages to the levant until he arrived at the recital of his last cruise with the death of captain leclere and the receipt of a packet to be delivered by himself to the grand marshal   11.11105687571573
if his eminence said he did not have personal motives the cardinal saw what the king was about to say and interrupted him pardon me said he   10.085751757762507
the blood mounted instantly to the temples of d artagnan who arose and replied i consider it worthy conduct of a pupil of jesuits   10.164622029221052
he turned round as if to give an order to cahusac and houdinière   12.939256880451525
and if i lose   9.849852468446656
upon my word said albert i deserve no credit for what i could not help namely a determination to take everything as i found it and to let those bandits see that although men get into troublesome scrapes all over the world there is no nation but the french that can smile even in the face of grim death himself   15.384881445216916
place that table there said a voice which the prisoner recognized as that of felton   14.746558597000547
he turned up the cloth and found these hieroglyphics carved upon the wood with a knife port   15.482274897750782
monte cristo turned pale and looked at albert while playing with some magnificent pistols   10.124832555092064
in fact the dream of poor bazin had always been to serve a churchman   11.27300408397265
you will not find one better carved between albano and civita castellana   10.873993223444693
for you have never seemed to me so grand as you are to day   11.663900830897965
franz untied it and in the midst of the most profound silence read 40038m extract of the report of a meeting of the bonapartist club in the rue saint jacques held february 5th 1815   6.7604259570744905
have you then so much confidence in your servant that you can intrust him with a secret you will not allow me to know   14.542746589181611
has your majesty forgotten that the king expects your reply and awaits it in agony   12.560886330615016
do you know what has become of athos   18.116758692396008
i had been told that you had endeavored to escape   16.39479427160765
the unfortunate youth was intrepid in the attack and rude in the defence   11.620074296524262
what else was opera invented for   12.567237181641945
he was thinking of these matters when porthos summoned him to dinner   11.587295570273938
you are not hurt   13.71710611672253
then inviting albert to take the vacant seat beside her she recommended franz to take the next best if he wished to view the ballet and pointed to the one behind her own chair   9.40817581885844
he is an excellent person   6.619031464113103
but that reminds me that i must ask your leave of absence for some days   13.936174446781644
well i was not hot headed then well but what else could you play for   9.917307712463657
nothing nothing replied the priest   11.9486081533862
yet in spite of his earnest prayers dantès remained a prisoner   8.252927698426806
but i tell you monsieur commissary cried bonacieux in his turn there is not the least doubt about the matter   21.213195241169316
well sir asked franz what do you wish me to do with this paper   17.13610992955478
the interior of the musketeers when d artagnan was out of the louvre and consulted his friends upon the use he had best make of his share of the forty pistoles athos advised him to order a good repast at the pomme de pin porthos to engage a lackey and aramis to provide himself with a suitable mistress   12.889557696041038
he stepped forward and touching the young man s shoulder said i was looking for you my friend   20.483678434724588
nothing at least personally said monte cristo   9.264223927935909
and he pointed to a magnificent hotel situated on the very spot whereon the vaudeville now stands   12.220888624879302
i shall rely on it   7.9779139799433185
cried the musketeer as if he had received a ball in his heart   9.947271138485089
in one was depicted the illustrious coxcomb receiving a shower of blows from cardinal bentivoglio whose servant he had been   15.014876171865312
luigi asked permission of his protector the steward that she and he might be present amongst the servants of the house   14.713914763420263
from that glass door the pale faced man went to the count s bedroom and raised with a constricted hand the curtain of a window overlooking the courtyard   9.837271815592082
on my word replied the count not more than another   9.819319913488131
now gascons are always poor are they not   16.48799292569386
de la trémouille reflected for an instant   9.270211824230248
50119m where is morrel   9.682892932432111
and he took hold of one within his reach   9.358281823066276
and it is well i can chevalier said milady for do you know what is going on here   13.985806447827303
hey friend   10.16767271486114
mercédès seized fernand s hands with a transport which he took for love but which was only joy at being no longer alone in the world and seeing at last a friend after long hours of solitary sorrow   19.705385529183953
never sir said raoul as long as i possess the happiness of having you for a protector shall i deem i have the right of freeing myself from a guardianship so valuable to me   16.082175170127186
how do you know i was praying sir   15.05947272812542
the king s procureur alone was deprived of his office being suspected of royalism   10.298510546315129
and now what do you want   11.194206052078943
if he were rich if he had cavalcanti s fortune that might be pardoned   18.733645416934237
you your command and i my title   17.77273625328512
yes your excellency and it is true   17.2284277949773
and you my dear boy   12.048153317881397
but instead of finding sympathy in the eyes of the doctor and his father he only saw an expression as inflexible as that of maximilian   11.12950188526606
if i live interest would be converted into doubt pity into hostility   13.792208483000776
in saying these words d artagnan appeared at the same time majestic and grieved   12.747255552128108
i am enormously anxious to finish my night at the duke of bracciano s   15.963497835249271
make all your arrangements and tell me where i shall be able to find you this evening at ten o clock   11.844599252319991
if you do not go sir said de guiche remember that we have two steeds able to catch your mule and the power of having you seized wherever you may be   15.923279962467877
and your guardian sir asked the queen who could not help feeling some interest in the handsome young man before her what is his name   7.693376929956207
monsieur said mademoiselle d aubigne to scarron as if she wished to join in the conversation he was engaged in with raoul do you not admire monsieur voiture s friends   8.215255124442864
de tréville the guards to that of m   10.198218841577793
yes dear monsieur porthos   12.136384456984498
yes but he has been avenged   13.08356717320931
nobody saw her replied d artagnan and he related to m   13.871038459182808
display is not becoming to everyone m   14.205825062554453
my dear porthos you are really a man of most superior understanding said d artagnan with a look as if he spoke against his conviction   13.566622959963272
i do not know said the servant but the housemaid is in mademoiselle valentine s room perhaps she has emptied them   12.975964580171835
his first cry was for his father   13.069935734227446
touch nothing my little friend cried the count eagerly   12.599707854187518
this expression sprang from the very bottom of the heart and like the first there was no mistaking it   11.45741154173005
but how did he obtain it   10.536479799298641
the paralytic closed his eyes in token of assent   8.420196223027704
we have made considerable advances   9.80172206067797
it sounds like the cry of one who is being murdered murmured the host   11.846264750804567
and then shut out from friendship having but one affection which could not be mixed up with her ordinary pursuits she thought of herself of no one but herself   20.48149460168409
paris this odious paris waking up one morning without queen or king surrounded besieged famished having for its sole resource its stupid parliament and their coadjutor with crooked limbs   15.997707674860235
i begin and without any rhetoric   10.47228449023131
still further he had seldom seen the young musketeer   10.544125868245564
there go three or four limping away   7.777505826099014
sit down and let us talk it over   14.002300055445792
and she again tried to think what it could be   10.492027720078886
oh said valentine we have been waiting for you with such impatience dear m   12.119414648011059
that is the crime of which i accuse her   14.858669394633562
then you were about to tell me all the isolation of your life the griefs of your heart   8.256588291119868
said madame de villefort in a harsh and constrained tone   11.488073079099312
dantès took the lamp placed it on a projecting stone above the bed whence its tremulous light fell with strange and fantastic ray on the distorted countenance and motionless stiffened body   12.777080530234564
the proposition had been made and received with enthusiasm when fortunately eleven o clock struck   11.687268218643828
and as the pharaon arrived today why you understand   8.207824273269805
never did a perverse nature declare itself more prematurely and yet it was not owing to any fault in his bringing up   9.017158739245993
he s not going to hunt for he has neither dogs nor arms   12.166943239910259
the honor of no one will have cause to complain of what i have to tell   11.935874721109188
i am innocent   15.269138699720006
tis you la ramee   12.664701822546611
the steward attempted to expostulate   14.614224173259906
the corvette must now i think be on her way to fécamp must she not   9.577790471851234
and you think that to save such villains as you i will become an abettor of their plot an accomplice in their crimes   14.434502420818301
expiation notwithstanding the density of the crowd m   13.190378022920719
aramis cast a glance upon d artagnan to see what effect all this produced and found his friend gaping enough to split his jaws   12.790288866940731
our passport   6.893756641704844
i can still do much for you   11.023347451914008
then you must have something on your mind   12.49309662941079
interrupted the stranger   16.083513274006414
laugh as much as you will replied albert i am in love   13.505045645525982
he is doubtless a delightful man but inconceivably peculiar in his ideas   16.740519516309405
for heaven s sake don t laugh for upon my soul it s no laughing matter   16.576484096344885
tell him they warned lord de winter of my journey to england   12.7680994872541
i have heard that name in greece   11.22027074423332
sometimes with the queen of england sometimes with madame de chevreuse   12.211363528561822
athos may always be found replied tréville ready to answer when it shall please the gownsmen to interrogate him   10.083234591038833
sometimes when the cardinal always on horseback like the lowest gendarme of the army cast a pensive glance over those works so slowly keeping pace with his wishes which the engineers brought from all the corners of france were executing under his orders if he met a musketeer of the company of tréville he drew near and looked at him in a peculiar manner and not recognizing in him one of our four companions he turned his penetrating look and profound thoughts in another direction   9.965857228637796
the sword   8.822973918589414
it gave me pain and it was an ungracious part to play but i have said nothing either to the one or to the other   13.33994425221373
the child conceals it   11.00837032859626
while he was listening to this recital delivered with the greatest simplicity the duke looked from time to time at the young man with astonishment as if he could not comprehend how so much prudence courage and devotedness could be allied with a countenance which indicated not more than twenty years   8.132032539721584
yet the hours passed on without any unusual disturbance and dantès knew that he had escaped the first peril   12.504254715576531
at the same hour as on the preceding evening d artagnan retired   6.3546606477410705
the doctor turned pale   8.340542110800321
in this case he was not the judge but the executioner   9.207938919646256
why for him and not for me   11.363459143213383
yes yes that is true   15.432902218171964
you may perceive madame by my uniform that i am an officer in the english navy replied the young man   12.848286958526705
de villefort be as you always are kind and equitable and give him back to us soon   8.25192540447157
the permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him above all for the fair peasants had appeared in a most elegant carriage the preceding evening and albert was not sorry to be upon an equal footing with them   5.967488711261606
then my son return to the world still more brilliant because of your former sorrows   14.856959399722061
at length after waiting a quarter of an hour and just as twilight was beginning to thicken a carriage appeared coming at a quick pace on the road of sèvres   5.807906370786269
maximilian said she maximilian my friend my brother on earth my true husband in heaven i entreat you do as i do live in suffering   9.107571986019046
the first person that struck him on his entrance was aramis planted near a great chair on castors very large covered with a canopy of tapestry under which there moved enveloped in a quilt of brocade a little face youngish very merry somewhat pallid whilst its eyes never ceased to express a sentiment at once lively intellectual and amiable   11.504259664192851
the porter was drawing the cord at the moment milady cried from her window don t open   11.706546295279363
exclaimed raoul ashamed of so much attention   14.436498925842718
this time it was a great matter that was under discussion connected with a vessel laden with turkey carpets stuffs of the levant and cashmeres   6.109948109298702
he had not seen morrel   10.729489326567343
but the travelers declared they would sleep in the common chamber each on a mattress which might be thrown upon the ground   17.97598065229777
he caused me to be arrested had me conducted hither and placed me under your guard   10.721693278282304
i wish to speak with him   10.87946054085868
take one of the carriage lamps bertuccio said the count and show me the apartments   10.402110271007302
d artagnan and athos put themselves into saddle with their companions and all four set forward   13.72847449032881
i have not lost my time   16.598819072819737
i suspected where she was concealed   10.941480850397934
he came to request his master to return to his lodgings where his presence was urgent as he piteously said   11.711000359057582
corbleu   11.767535037833666
never till then had i placed any confidence in presentiments but now i can not help believing them valentine   16.957934182330664
he believed having triumphed over me in my sleep that all was completed   13.971709474291972
the proposal was seductive but la ramee was an old stager acquainted with all the traps a prisoner was likely to set   10.547112088812298
ali as my model   16.78791837519055
a strange thing is the mind and it is wonderful what revolutions may be wrought in it by a sign a word a hope   14.38526054410096
i will await her return and beg her to come up here   13.556561007378754
and she fell on her knees at the same time holding me up towards heaven as if she desired while praying to god in my behalf to raise me actually to his presence   16.233232372226656
yes but that would take too much time and i am thirsty   15.648960723247518
d artagnan and athos took the nags of planchet and grimaud and the two lackeys started on foot carrying the saddles on their heads   15.174851821303575
listen attentively   5.906216116113534
five and twenty thousand francs is not a large sum however replied monte cristo with a tone so sweet and gentle that it went to maximilian s heart like the voice of a father   10.13280791260469
well said porthos seated in the courtyard of the hotel de la chevrette to d artagnan who with a long and melancholy face had returned from the palais royal   14.353747810773527
peppino nodded and taking a rosary from his pocket began to mutter a few prayers while the clerk disappeared through the same door by which danglars and the attendant had gone out   10.992598835669328
20355m scarcely had the first congratulations upon her marvellous escape been gone through when she wrote the following letter to madame danglars dear hermine i have just had a wonderful escape from the most imminent danger and i owe my safety to the very count of monte cristo we were talking about yesterday but whom i little expected to see today   8.942064663826091
deschamps the notary that he received from the postman a small billet which he knew to be from valentine although he had not before seen her writing   9.759442366078662
oh yes said château renaud   8.027208662933699
i have brought my receipt   12.47956574828369
mazarin disappeared as they rose from table   8.51405953123049
magloire a little frequented passage enclosed with a turnstile at each end   13.79958214399745
i make no requests or commands   17.062240889986654
not of my own   17.133759027650534
but permit me to say i see nothing laughable in it   14.502729227288107
besides the manner in which beauchamp had closed the conference left a bitter recollection in his heart   8.621786025653446
this was a blow to d artagnan   15.666768465661416
i said sire that four hundred thousand pounds are owing to the scottish army   8.72171000057433
danglars observed that during the whole conversation morcerf had never once dared to ask if it was on his own account that danglars recalled his word   10.44404344880201
can it not be put off till to morrow   13.180870666259928
andrea had taken the precaution to leave no traces of his feet in the ashes but still it was an outlet and in this light was not to be passed over without serious investigation   11.182468857640103
honor   10.910589106111729
but true parisian as he was bonacieux could recognize every street by the milestones the signs and the lamps   7.9061646634382825
and by whom were they recommended to you   6.0812646469528175
we have asked him for money   14.72801804309407
but dear friend if you ever need me you know that i am entirely devoted to you   14.151085886906133
the union of physical pain with moral uneasiness had produced the effect so long desired   14.355984826712287
i am your prisoner said aramis giving up his sword to porthos   16.071147085688608
not worth speaking of   7.964849597332737
he cried with his gascon accent   14.793361623767762
you must attribute it only to natural scruples under similar circumstances   9.528575809961307
request him to come here directly   14.18091926123799
the blush of pride mounted to the count s forehead as this thought passed through his mind   12.438937408601786
it is agreed is it not   8.38396405712731
i reflected long for a gnawing ambition had long preyed upon me and then i replied listen i have always heard of providence and yet i have never seen him or anything that resembles him or which can make me believe that he exists   10.87575273079849
the swiss received two wounds and was not aware of it by reason of the cold   12.750478244800753
fool   14.49463749938618
what s the matter now planchet   12.293403894549533
that the count has never been willing to partake of food under the roof of m   15.622372881739967
if she is a cardinalist she has no fanaticism at least   11.35954921861278
but first of all pray have a servant father   11.588883822736706
he is following me   11.85437803447983
i am going alone   10.63334638946418
but i betrayed sacrificed buried have risen from my tomb by the grace of god to punish that man   16.80098125093453
i shall meet them there and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview   12.553743981866706
the drums beat   15.343543747957973
a frenchman   8.131108122232671
m repeated franz   15.395547171493872
come hither and let us talk   8.337340697699984
the affair at armentieres   8.240364852774537
monte cristo slowly left the house and turned towards the quay   11.723591213738441
convinced that the ship was full of powder instead of having a cargo of wine grimaud hastened to awake d artagnan who had no sooner beheld him than he perceived that something extraordinary had taken place   11.452993944886474
suddenly exclaimed debray   14.554225259576409
sir said raoul as he turned to leave the room i have thought of one thing and that is about the duchess of chevreuse who was so kind to me and to whom i owe my introduction to the prince   11.34395678640345
i had told your excellency he is the most famous bandit we have had since the days of mastrilla   12.465809464499499
furnished by two years of premature meditation and a long sojourn among the puritans   11.378823027831258
and i even i opposed the designs of the great man who held the destinies of france within the hollow of his hand   12.571585485456934
a portion of the troops had already arrived and the remainder was expected from moment to moment   9.782139419481599
have they not obeyed me   8.846183114409605
yes egad   8.833752296223091
one might have supposed the bastille appeared before you and that the gigantic medusa had converted you into stone   13.062681944069958
i was at school at the time and the adventure appeared to me to be cruel for the king   7.0840149846938205
she made him a sign to dismount and come to her   6.877389137883771
at this sight alone franz felt his legs tremble under him   12.73747632179966
and how does france appear in your eyes accustomed as they have been to gaze on such enchanted scenes   15.537739302294828
whom shall i announce   9.486755496197075
instead of aiding the movements of my horse i paralyzed them   9.757779092816122
in the donjon of vincennes   5.838139197016798
she that was enceinte she who was walking while she waited for bertuccio stood at the open door with his eyes starting and his hair on end   14.701984722926532
and nothing when he was in that state of mind increased his depression so much as gaiety in others   16.578923257880767
avenged yourself said the baron   16.744473016804683
had you known this edmond dantès of whom they spoke   15.963543754170708
you will then submit to what fate decrees for you without even attempting to contend with it   11.373680865641504
i think you wished to do so of your own accord   13.10861821338331
oh what a detestable crew they are these mercenary speculators   10.017278825571536
mouston cried porthos   9.548630212553123
and did you go alone   16.089737181195574
wrote in a hand as small as possible another note on the margin of his horace and then looking at the duke with the air of a man who thinks he has an idea of his own while he is only commenting upon the idea of another said go on my dear duke go on i listen   12.983151364693251
then more helpless than an infant and colder and paler than marble more crushed and broken than a reed trampled under foot he fell back doubled up in one last convulsion and became as rigid as a corpse   15.743739336526666
he was at that period of intoxication in which vulgar drinkers fall on the floor and go to sleep   17.702935568390387
now i understand he said why you had me brought here to this desolate spot in the midst of the ocean to this subterranean palace   11.515613639449358
if you go on so his eminence will be forced to renew his company in three weeks and i to put the edicts in force in all their rigor   15.635170995763882
why then was it impossible to dantès   14.04824971611846
there i will indicate to you the best place and time   17.193472408972518
i am sure of it they would prefer dying on the spot to being arrested or taking back a step   8.518780456317689
baptistin will tell you where if you do not know their address   14.201241049203588
he opened his arms and haydée uttering a cry sprang into them   12.862340094157895
oh said albert with all the cajolery of which he was capable   14.610053169839848
the pope is the successor of st   14.490995060406938
for believe me but for you i should have ceased to live on the day i doubted my father and renounced his name   13.661948369475834
and as there are a great many cabriolets to be seen on the road to the low countries and as nine tenths of them are green the inquiries increased at every step   13.390884899501753
may you be happy monsieur and grimaud saluted and turned toward the door to go out   14.196641306565624
50113m well i must confess these are scruples   10.389235190415743
you forget sir that you very nearly ruined forever that of my master   15.276494058749641
he had about two hundred men in the courtyards and stables and he placed them at the queen s disposal   14.99333921559013
i wished to make my adieux to you but time does not permit   12.663617177146321
at this moment the tapestry moved aside and a nubian black as ebony and dressed in a plain white tunic made a sign to his master that all was prepared in the dining room   16.407139466138627
my story will be accepted for there is no one left to contradict me   13.103283096731197
this contest at length exhausted jussac s patience   12.456057272811844
no replied the countess it was certainly empty during the first act   12.987501563656387
in a moment thanks to her habit of conversing with her grandfather she understood that he asked for a key   7.091376791592063
come you are growing discontented you are no longer happy   10.437970194696298
during that time he had many moments of despair   14.755401320990329
now monsieur de chavigny piqued himself on his infallible penetration   16.775293313442745
land might resemble a cloud but the fire was not a meteor   3.5323696022990543
then another error seized me on seeing you in company with these gentlemen i was afraid you were dangerously ill   9.64173469079931
i believe he is a lutheran   8.461519269856502
porthos bowed   12.718953119221828
there terminates at least to the present moment the duty i had to fulfill toward you   13.248329860566972
no i remain replied athos with a threatening gesture that promised no good to whomsoever it was addressed   14.016083260816842
as to what you say about not seeing you again i believe not a word of it   14.936348690564907
de tréville in a feeble yet perfectly calm voice you have sent for me as my comrades inform me and i have hastened to receive your orders   14.354508479746634
i wish to visit in person the outposts which surround the palais royal   8.746443683659
so much the better so much the better   15.061131544934454
and he convulsively grasped the hand of d avrigny   10.46533468066034
these two women held each other for an instant in a close embrace   8.46215519856879
as for grimaud his hair stood on end and drops of sweat ran down his brow   10.59749629523149
we are going to rejoin that good fellow porthos   12.205676128895824
eh how can i tell   11.917839166031774
everybody is ignorant that you are the bearer of a letter from the island of elba and addressed to m   11.335752941824408
the count left his box and a moment later was saluting the baronne danglars who could not restrain a cry of mingled pleasure and surprise   12.047718481053346
question him then   13.961762371306447
providence has declared for us since i have found this brave man again in so miraculous a manner   12.242400532745227
porthos was snoring most musically when some one touched him on the shoulder   9.329403866700268
caderousse had once more parted with his treasure the banknotes were replaced in the pocket book the gold put back into the bag and the whole carefully locked in the cupboard   10.32652638603363
the count took another spoon and again dipped it into the golden box   15.579237483567038
he entered third and aramis who shut the gate after him last   12.802571903413634
when you have cherished a wish and have charged me with its fulfillment have i ever replied it is impossible   7.090893099595171
thought d artagnan it is very little to offset the unexpected tribulations i am bringing to this poor devil who has so warmly welcomed me   16.09734180647181
the duke exchanged a signal with them   12.05183404430125
you have a capital house your own i presume   9.029319855293894
yes said the count yes   9.840535703563408
at this very moment friquet passed mounted on raoul s horse waving his parti colored cap and crying broussel   10.038584619802066
you must be cruelly bored here   14.589905637834065
a country clown said anne of austria people will laugh   10.543193114422536
oh it is terrible   12.611963572378933
he is lord of the hill and the plain and is now carrying on a suit for his feudal rights against the bishop of noyon   8.651943073272054
he too ten years ago had piously sought out a tomb and sought it vainly   14.897970091801577
when all had gone out and the door was closed m   11.838224461085673
bonacieux what is it   14.486301050766821
well fernand i must say said caderousse beginning the conversation with that brutality of the common people in which curiosity destroys all diplomacy you look uncommonly like a rejected lover   4.417581147282016
make your complaints known   14.428882657248032
ah how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman should be so avaricious   6.025628797974747
alas her emotions were wholly personal she was thinking only of villefort s departure   11.282831713926992
at this moment he saw the light of planier gleaming in front of him like a star   10.88869429086219
when you arrived here i allowed you to enter   11.285969318005753
come said d artagnan let us inquire further   20.49777209778786
the matter is replied d artagnan that i can see upon this pier neither inspector nor sentinel nor exciseman   13.626320530897276
we know that said beauchamp   12.778650590718328
everyone who surrounds me is free to quit me and when they leave me will no longer have any need of me or anyone else   10.321470920669018
but my mother as a child saw her   10.401042671750902
and when shall i be avenged   13.69605981754516
perhaps she was even writing a letter imploring forgiveness from her virtuous husband a forgiveness she was purchasing with her death   10.925261670525101
you see on the contrary i come to you first and instantly replied franz   11.001521546820502
at last it became aramis s turn who performed it with a good grace and who succeeded as he said by selling some theological books in procuring a few pistoles   13.818266439437583
gad i should be very happy but i have my companion monsieur du vallon and the two prisoners whom i can not leave   12.153931365436554
carmela was precisely the age and figure of teresa and teresa was as handsome as carmela   12.206921812142406
twice during the hundred days had morrel renewed his demand and twice had villefort soothed him with promises   15.119566481237442
willingly said albert   9.971400430553699
ah cried d artagnan really carried away by the passion this woman had the power to kindle in his heart ah that is because my happiness appears so impossible to me   12.849490966026991
bertuccio without answering pointed to villefort with something of the gesture macbeth uses to point out banquo   7.8138209150168585
and monsieur d artagnan of whom you spoke just now monsieur d herblay   11.955604141213149
ten minutes afterward mazarin entered the court of that chateau which his predecessor had built for him at rueil   11.270084415484053
beauchamp did the same   15.574173852027236
there was a moment s silence   6.946557643393542
my patron died   10.765596336542739
and the proof is that i paid twelve pistoles for it   14.857276817361338
but how did the accident happen   16.532324654059366
we can find out said grimaud   10.803427995808129
you have not forgotten st   8.328420920633192
then he added in spanish anne are you mad   7.999899865443764
what i have said i have said answered caderousse   12.697467117200164
yes said felton   10.15220245380997
a charming man elegant discreet and a writer of poetical verses   14.176386680887669
chapter 3   14.913326244648271
now if i had taken the veil all this fortune would have descended to my father and in reversion to his son   13.172524237645016
it was mordaunt   13.478704181440618
remember this is no affair of mine said the trembling voice of la carconte as though through the flooring of her chamber she viewed the scene that was enacting below   14.726296240202755
besides should you find your income insufficient you can for the sake of the past madame make use of mine   12.02279711720754
i know what is become of vasiliki and haydée   7.911967751328477
five minutes afterward bazin set off on a full trot urging on his horse by the blows of a parapluie which he was in the habit of using instead of a riding whip   13.296851170669438
speak sir   15.651138775042304
and continued he casting a side glance at lucien who was turning over the leaves of an album mademoiselle eugénie is pretty i think i remember that to be her name   11.508032008568811
your eminence will judge the ball of madame the constable   12.687840686951406
they may serve us   18.138238345451043
it was ten o clock at night   15.894155812595777
a sword en pale on an oval shield like all the italian armorial bearings and surmounted by a cardinal s hat   9.555121455887612
if we see a close carriage at all suspicious in appearance come out let us fall upon it   7.151039445841984
this child lives and someone knows it lives someone is in possession of our secret   12.627586606956493
consequently morrel having left the rue meslay at half past eight by his timepiece entered the clover field while the clock of saint philippe du roule was striking eight   10.415302787298154
this was the second time within the hour that he had invoked the name of god   7.9004390989470314
what have i done then   12.198047798988272
after the soup the maid brought a boiled fowl a piece of magnificence which caused the eyes of the diners to dilate in such a manner that they seemed ready to burst   10.582818300109496
asked the cardinal with a certain degree of anxiety   15.159764610887057
tell me may i shake hands with you saying beauchamp acknowledge you have injured me and retain my friendship or must i simply propose to you a choice of arms   10.983607345764158
the second i heard his name by chance   13.388863237141328
we look hideous said athos   10.89469224315683
see what is going on monsieur d artagnan said he   14.565486120785973
mademoiselle danglars   14.605501678733079
one day when i was reproaching him for his unavailing searches and deploring the prostration of mind that followed them he looked at me and smiling bitterly opened a volume relating to the history of the city of rome   11.630740524640649
the host had reckoned upon eleven days of confinement at a crown a day but he had reckoned without his guest   14.438485030853343
demanded d artagnan lowering the point of his sword but without yet surrendering it   17.679567714865577
they dined apart from one another wherever they might happen to be or rather where they could   13.164188939172178
don quixote took windmills for giants and sheep for armies   12.908883647582757
want one   10.453072810992357
there was no occasion to push the door it was wide open   10.784302860600569
i defy you to find him who executed it   7.1446172484229145
repeated i   13.503152634004426
planchet went out the curate remaining for a moment   10.903694519897185
however i am rather too old and tough to be very good eating   13.07846948417378
i shall not go   7.02013025392347
i do not say i regret   16.96867769486898
exclaimed franz the peasant girl who snatched his mocoletto from him was a lad of fifteen replied peppino   12.784157032779099
monte cristo made a sign to him to be silent   10.916341679415746
i cried the steward with a strange expression   12.260190549889444
i do not believe there is a god howled caderousse   20.39768158960875
pray explain your meaning for you excite my curiosity to the highest pitch   8.860819223264985
shall you be able to pay m   11.710717626779338
ah so much the better i feared this little precaution might have been forgotten   11.801451552613791
but i tell you that the favor of a minister is ephemeral and that a man must be mad to attach himself to a minister   11.796509957902906
i leave him with you my friend   11.75258427607309
noirtier closed his eyes   8.025667951089117
danglars at the other and eugénie in front of him   11.376805671355527
i am not in love with mademoiselle mercédès   13.899624270799038
he told me so at least sir when he desired me to return to paris with monsieur de chatillon who was charged to carry the news to the queen and to bring the colors we had taken   13.339131286411403
then this young man escaped with you   8.92283893481992
this was a blow with her fan applied with such force that the little feminine weapon flew into a thousand pieces   13.391398449363718
well i shall see him to morrow and tell him about you   9.645189312052853
athos remained motionless looking after him until he turned the corner of the street   5.944978642160538
d artagnan had already opened the door of the second room and from the expression of his face it was clear that he there beheld some extraordinary object   14.639705587651573
because no one knows not even the assassin that for the last twelve months i have given m   17.90769605992858
we hear from yanina chapter 79   10.693933120650152

monsieur porthos has just been to your house and has left this for you saying that the letter was important and must be given to you before you left   9.985044756623582
it seems to me that it is neither your majesty nor myself who can charge himself with such a mission   14.684380717753289
the domestic peace of this family is henceforth in my hands   15.751845177710742
i do not know who could if i could not said caderousse   14.655040482040286
he approached the dying man and leaning over him with a calm and melancholy look he whispered i am i am and his almost closed lips uttered a name so low that the count himself appeared afraid to hear it   7.933367950228322
at which hour he rose in order to repair to the residence of m   13.083490332981432
this one is built against the solid rock and it would take ten experienced miners duly furnished with the requisite tools as many years to perforate it   7.638850538020065

you understand then comte de la fere you understand chevalier d herblay that i am altogether and always at your service   8.980807064943281
cavalcanti he paid no attention to anything that was passing   18.216647478267465
here he said here is a draft at sight   15.938280380660952
how perfectly he remembered his former entrance into that very room   17.38277916266016
valentine had solved the problem and was able easily to understand his thoughts and to convey her own in return and through her untiring and devoted assiduity it was seldom that in the ordinary transactions of every day life she failed to anticipate the wishes of the living thinking mind or the wants of the almost inanimate body   10.541136010765241
alas said edmond smiling these are the treasures the cardinal has left   9.528452416817446
repeated porthos and aramis   8.059347709841134
a quarter of an hour to go to the tent a quarter of an hour to return   12.06080382569568
well so be it said d artagnan   16.19950879300867
where are we to go my lord   11.003600488331728
you must stop at the little village of eccuis in which there is but one tavern the shield of france   13.424077328650911
we also informed monsieur porthos of what was going on   9.652240868812385
but whom are you seeking debray   10.77541185726319

felton offered the weapon to milady who examined the temper of it attentively and who tried the point on the tip of her finger   14.1282179909153
by daybreak we shall have reached our retreat and nobody can guess where we are   7.485872843960952
well do you know if the persons you see there are rich or poor if their sacks of wheat are not rubies or diamonds   9.683440569698469
he consented   14.771371378812834
an hour after the vehicle was at the door   5.973292601745477
dantès is my friend and i won t have him ill used   9.108427220779106

the queen at last asked him if he had anything to add to the fine discourse he had just made to her   12.995474895506579
murmured the gentleman   15.424870949642376
he listens most devoutly to the third act of robert le diable and when the fourth begins takes his departure   11.983383812003906
bertuccio said he   12.559983421559606
the gallery on the sea side which had long been in ruins was rebuilt   13.74218251957612
his natural prudence however never forsook him for a single instant   10.788999769236309
i think i have some clew   9.617494942766854
he placed the cloak on his shoulders and the hat on his head whilst the musketeer got off the box   9.832026037751106
till then god preserve your majesty   13.3843359392777
and afterwards the road to châtillon   14.940341954942852

he was placed before a large glass which reflected the whole apartment and so without any attempt to move which would have been impossible he could see all who entered the room and everything which was going on around him   10.75476341140308
ah it is you peppino said the count   12.813538800654387
what is the use of following the alleys   8.929613622747535
said franz reseating himself   11.264002553539722
his pallor was so peculiar that it seemed to pertain to one who had been long entombed and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow and hue of life   12.02776596152403
peppino at the same time that the steamer disappeared behind cape morgiou a man travelling post on the road from florence to rome had just passed the little town of aquapendente   14.070376177523205
but like the aurora which guides the navigator in northern latitudes opened new vistas to the inquiring mind of the listener and gave fantastic glimpses of new horizons enabling him justly to estimate the delight an intellectual mind would have in following one so richly gifted as faria along the heights of truth where he was so much at home   12.488448489661442
i would realize how would you realize   14.128686285340088
but you have been silent for twenty years sir   11.485145187075775
i would buy with the proceeds certain lands around my father s chateau which is a pretty place well enough but with no land to it at all except a garden about the size of the cemetery des innocents   14.295563240858682

it is not to abandon them that we have separated but to avoid compromising them   12.617093061311161
it need not be said that planchet in resuming his former functions resumed also his former humility and was not ashamed to make his breakfast on what was left by d artagnan   8.397340921875516
they will be much less likely to   11.683482462184372
it may be supposed that dantès did not now think of his dinner but he insisted that his comrades who had not his reasons for fasting should have their meal   12.921461343507918
and her husband found out that she had a fleur de lis on her shoulder   7.172178521538771
that is because your fancies go too far replied the triumphant bonacieux and i mistrust them   6.293871680878355
which means resumed aramis that he might perfectly understand the two hands are indispensable for priests of the inferior orders when they bestow the benediction   11.269643293137047
the guards were under arms and d artagnan took his place in the midst of his comrades   12.347079236627243
not one struck him   9.881927016763843
you monseigneur   11.963071119031357
but how could you have these fish brought to france   16.57553657078597
come nearer said the magistrate with a patronizing wave of the hand and tell me to what circumstance i owe the honor of this visit   8.766529336376891
two hundred thousand per annum would make four millions of capital   11.620634533891218
the daily renewed promise of the young man that the moment would not long be delayed had alone kept him in the service of a musketeer a service in which he said his soul was in constant jeopardy   14.103406271012354
the countenance of poor ali recovered its serenity   11.302448011919083
my faith yes said athos   11.891903580149023
it is very clear notwithstanding replied the young man with an artlessness wholly free from affectation   8.205957510609263
approach and look at him and say if we have the appearance of people who wish to run away   14.633407725770763
milady was not deceived   8.066693720253099
you have travelled then in italy mademoiselle   10.41297340382594
was that affair hot   13.067489237059908
but of what sort   16.228845702491505
you hear me at a quarter past midnight in fact in twenty minutes   15.985832567485376
at his country house   16.220220939864436
take this said athos with his usual careless generosity giving him his own and be a good lad   5.835535243625625
the comte de la fere inhabits the castle of bragelonne in the environs of that city   21.07396775279677
eustache church watching carefully to ascertain the popular feeling   9.994331724363207
to sleep after the manner i speak of absolute calm and silence are necessary and then a certain preparation i know the famous hashish   14.91224775360623
soon a torrent of vivid sparks fell around them then at last the volcano was extinguished then all was dark and still the floating bark and heaving ocean   3.009705933335697
you shall shut the door that you may be certain i contemplate no injury to you   16.444937535563973
though you suffer   8.009019471154925
valentine turned pale and leaned her hand against the gate   10.11551842648612
the four frenchmen of whom two were sent by the queen to her husband and two by mazarin to me   10.969862385793114
said villefort while d avrigny advanced to lead morrel out   12.489588323754283
to tell you all i know was the reply   14.02064652338175
during this time danglars fixed his piercing glance on the young man on whose heart caderousse s words fell like molten lead   15.245938434691876
enter and ask for monsieur bernouin said the porter opening the door of the third room   11.89444051770456
sir said the young man will you be so good as to tell me if it be true that cardinal mazarin is no longer minister   14.571241286333283
then said athos woe to de winter for the child had done no harm   12.390144369834248
lord winter   17.423128177900207
we are carrying port wine to anvers   8.101981175811792
still i found nothing nothing the chest was no longer there   11.728919080914954
my lord madame i ask a hundred pardons   8.985760512018576
then by one of those wild caprices which made her so adorable and at the same time so dangerous she had suddenly put her arm around his neck and kissed his forehead saying vicomte may my good wishes and this kiss bring you good fortune   13.622655097315034
it is with valets as with wives they must be placed at once upon the footing in which you wish them to remain   12.231538436758326
he found the prisoner in the same position as if fixed there his eyes swollen with weeping   17.30842123683935
after some search i found that the floor gave a hollow sound near the head of the bed and at the hearth   5.5553328215823
yes sir answered athos agitated   13.065322308065435
i know her very well   11.762381547856563
well this is what you have to say said d artagnan my lord your sister in law is an infamous woman who wished to have you killed that she might inherit your wealth   14.297361454977029
the change that had come over villefort during the examination the destruction of the letter the exacted promise the almost supplicating tones of the magistrate who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce punishment all returned with a stunning force to his memory   8.234035868638234
the king turned his head away as if these words had not been intended for him   13.81130421076391
the evening of the 3rd   14.229877475117105
no the coachman ali and baptistin will go   8.64333644005548
pooh said caderousse   9.415985970294688
how lovely the blue heavens and star enameled sky   12.056598737528418
then you have nothing more to do here   11.123191940938373
and she looked at d artagnan who embraced her tenderly with eyes which seemed to burn themselves away   3.8548601589294833
sire said athos perhaps a king should act thus but not a husband and a father   12.942294837366607
can we have the honor of seeing his highness   10.539345045004932
valentine fell on her knees and pressed her almost bursting heart   15.995862795196746
but porthos for his part had done his work as conscientiously as d artagnan   15.020370593534743
but does your grace mean to give me the studs without the casket   12.894916363401693
morrel i didn t dare to say maximilian had been made an officer of the legion of honor   10.225512441294114
the demonstration did not fail to make him uneasy at first   10.966096239925223
there there said la carconte   12.291783415075436
much obliged to you monsieur dulaurier   6.346590205209305
blaisois seeing bazin in clerical guise was a little discomposed at his denials and wanted to pass at all risks believing too that the man with whom he had to do was endowed with the virtues of his cloth namely patience and christian charity   12.343190472518527
answered the cavalier   12.464471850061312
it was then when the count could not see albert that he sent for his servant who he knew was authorized not to conceal anything from him   13.447511658998616
nothing could be more agreeable to the duke however he had presence of mind enough to exclaim to the devil with your grimaud   15.31419683030656
i don t know anything about that replied renée   12.23146195421781
de monte cristo may have heard it and to enlighten himself but why should he wish to enlighten himself upon the subject   10.94714331762079
and you failed   14.831850396860473
what is this gentleman s name   15.374297520090778
i shall tell them madame and those who accompany me will say the same thing   11.04646891428089
d artagnan darted a look into the obscurity of the place   17.91131616794799
yes sir five or six months ago last february   10.473294537645343
calm and cool as if on the parade except that his noble and beautiful countenance became sad as he saw slaughtered so many men who were sacrificed on the one side to the obstinacy of royalty and on the other to the personal rancor of the princes   9.069232297008803
stop up your excavation carefully do not work any more and wait until you hear from me   10.937423878891053
friend said he for athos this is too much   13.550905577793412
this valet whose name was germain and who enjoyed the entire confidence of his young master held in one hand a number of papers and in the other a packet of letters which he gave to albert   12.470118953081178
there was a moment of frozen silence between these two   10.066238535169422
albert turned round just in time to receive a gracious wave of the fan from the baroness   13.78769821497357
content with making me pay for my hat he may desire to become my heir and re   8.260622977628632
in a moment he had passed through them and could see the house distinctly   14.821646331668148
returned home with athos aramis and porthos inquired eagerly the cause of the strange interview   13.14498006553314
it is true sir and i beg his pardon for he has always been very good to me but i was mad   14.093844351901005
the family began to get accustomed to their obscurity   14.228363176894927
added porthos   8.959647569895521
at the end of a quarter of an hour vampa quitted the grotto   14.556396055232888
no the son s   12.06523068222997
debray muttered something bowed and went out knocking himself against the edge of the door like nathan in athalie   11.426915517197282
bonacieux he will rouse the whole quarter   18.12990413084585
you are right sir and no one can doubt my position   9.012186526505129
but i have judges quite ready who will quickly dispose of a woman so shameless as to glide a bigamist into the bed of lord de winter my brother   13.829222280412464
said athos to aramis we were to have slept here but we can not we must push on   13.878295490465854
the sergeant burst into a fit of laughter   7.188079931538239
and the man after throwing two or three silver pieces at the foot of mine host galloped after his master   8.833868280155588
yes i fear   9.22424842395306
do not conceal anything however serious let us see the island of elba is a volcano and we may expect to have issuing thence flaming and bristling war bella horrida bella   8.800990279263754
my attendants obey my slightest wish   12.423122699201109
i was going to tell you   9.564227975463378
let them answered d artagnan   11.45183241388374
at these words she passed her arm under that of d artagnan and urged him forward eagerly   13.813730441737397
he is an upstart a man of no name who will only be the tool of a party in france   9.655112713109759
that s true replied d artagnan   9.44763323809349
ten minutes afterward she was at home   13.792483630121446
that knife give it to me for a minute only for mercy s for pity s sake   12.722200927980724
three companies presented themselves each offering equal securities   10.22548805121473
well said porthos if any one had told you in the old times that the day would come when planchet would rescue rochefort and that you would protect him in it i should not have believed him   9.86598697172074
from the top of an eminence d artagnan perceived a group of people collected on the other side of the moat in front of that part of the donjon which looks toward saint maur   9.062049182217905
gentlemen said athos no divided attention i beg   12.630350018683442
answered the boy the thing is done   13.233918873579878
tomorrow you will go   13.606684735963348
and do you feel sure of succeeding   14.331161818692351
and that is all a prisoner can wish for   6.3780777813395595
she would invoke the past recall old recollections   15.178171273853016
they may if they like but we will not   12.86997452898919
this positive assurance seemed to give caderousse a little courage   16.529952316482287
i may go where i please   11.878646086501567
what shall i do   14.361073239215258
but which requires a profound study of both the scriptures and the fathers   12.059502905076306
i am rather late in claiming this gracious promise but here is my friend whose character for veracity you well know and he will assure you the delay arose from no fault of mine   6.927310417273329
no my lord duke replied la ramee in the fullness of his heart   12.857319672483326
ah said morrel   15.830653947390878
by no means replied the young lady quickly   13.816972059685094
and porthos in full dress mounted his finest horse taking the part of supernumerary musketeer as d artagnan had so often done formerly   8.024126062007916
we will save your soul said the young man   8.872269668043629
the king could not give that order since at that time he was hardly four years old   8.605363268718545
a fanatic has just assassinated him   14.302740093999766
no one would have thought in looking at this old weather beaten floral decked tower which might be likened to an elderly dame dressed up to receive her grandchildren at a birthday feast that it would have been capable of telling strange things if in addition to the menacing ears which the proverb says all walls are provided with it had also a voice   11.230756093850523
then why do you apply to me   8.779983556910887
yes he is a terrible antagonist   14.835737436943523
you are almost a boy   13.353604251246182
diplomat or not i don t know   8.263361670659787
he went to find aramis   9.005276555906779
breathe not a word of that or the comte de la fere will be furious   15.59850569397159
a carriage was waiting at the end of the via macello   14.001319335474749
tis a comfort said the gascon since we shall not die of thirst   12.44963349112824
buckingham could not under any pretense be admitted into france as an ambassador   10.445091529107312
de tréville thought it best to be first in making the complaint   13.156107643514925
can you see what they are doing   13.496729038171942
and then continued mme   15.745569849766419
mazarin smiled sarcastically at this speech which showed that she had taken the minister s proposal seriously   7.395626178027345
do you wish for a proof   13.080518537232464
it is you who have been his mistress madame   14.383428657271667
here said he to him are the diamond studs that you came to bring   10.882591458881208
but in certain circumstances five minutes are five ages   14.531520159607126
was he so sweet then   12.628215868373065
why did you not say all this before you took action sir   14.484991795864133
alas faltered out the abbé all is over with me   10.56883591891889
for my part i ate but little   13.720222032232714
i have discovered a sort of subterranean passage which runs beneath the street and we shall only have to raise one of the marble slabs before the door to open you an entrance and an outlet   12.203233765457531
did he reflect before he insulted my father   15.004592854045491
she is under the big chestnut tree replied the spoiled brat as he gave in spite of his mother s commands live flies to the parrot which seemed keenly to relish such fare   13.023590621901572
the shots were fired about a hundred paces in advance of us in the thickest part of the wood and we returned to ask your advice   12.453224159044742
i will go straight to the louvre   16.137589069943058
well then continued emmanuel we have not fifteen thousand francs in the house   9.261730917751574
on no pretense leave the door for you know that last night my lord punished a soldier for having quit his post for an instant although i during his absence watched in his place   7.363738714807874
imagine my astonishment continued milady when i found myself face to face with this woman   4.539040052576928
at vincennes tis true one lives faster my lord replied la ramee my lord or dies sooner for it comes to the same thing   12.482298440517026
athos started passed his hand over his brow to remove the drops of perspiration that burst forth and rose in his turn with a nervous movement he could not repress   9.57618117286544
every one is naturally more or less devout certainly   13.707450398497514
i not the less maintain said the cardinal that the duke of buckingham came to paris for a project wholly political   10.821755735208857
you are the first man i ever met sufficiently courageous to preach egotism   7.266798643197434
the four friends exchanged glances   11.845419790970743
open the door i beg of you   13.606284286025037
i did my best to make them drunk   15.692010115792442
good lord how cold i am   16.64205766411961
i told you i did not wish to be behind my time   10.99497728886005
the friends embraced   7.3863552561561985
but i must make you see this time that it is too late to retreat   14.265528062545108
morrel and then ran on to mercédès   4.634662198448279
but come resumed the englishman are these men of yours dangerous   9.946407393788615
however he toiled on all the night without being discouraged   15.903611096983944
he remained motionless but gnashing his teeth and wringing his hands with fury   10.001171989844195
it is woman who has ruined us still ruins us and will ruin us as long as the world stands   13.110286270206455
and to what penalty do you think the king will be condemned   8.850650470556898
i am a brute   13.844354630214596
i only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of whoever wrought it   11.375591015132887
when one is eating ideas flow easily   15.584421970993002
and did the mercer rejoined athos tell you d artagnan that the queen thought that buckingham had been brought over by a forged letter   10.292460383253083
brunhilda and fredegund were the results of the painful struggle of civilization in its infancy when man was learning to control mind were it even by an emissary from the realms of darkness   12.707204717610594
nobody but i know it   8.803513783688548
no one who had seen the magistrate at this moment so thoroughly unnerved by the recent inauspicious combination of circumstances would have supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the annoyance   12.391813190554666
franz astonished advanced a step   16.17365532784944
i ascended into the red room and waited for night   10.829415598970474
do you take any interest in politics   9.498312191024166
cried a voice in french answering to that of winter which made them tremble   14.21383582578912
bassompierre and schomberg from deserting the army a separate command had to be given to each   11.353788790695294
yes monsieur quite ready said bazin   14.680612272539808
the boat at this moment turned around and the dying man was by that turn brought nearer athos   10.87418905180439
her mistress put on a charming face and smiled on her graciously   22.30645224606924
you can t refuse help to a poor hunted devil   10.230107392372078
but you know the guilty do not like to find themselves convicted   13.04704874059678
30271m when daylight dawned i went down again   14.321509132919433
ah my faith yes   9.656807758780845
said d artagnan we can t be overtaken   14.949712168273486
my brother in law and myself expected you yesterday and the day before but in vain   6.451259472970225
but i explained to him the cause of my refusal replied dantès and i hope he fully understood it   12.03532408440615
oh my god no   9.285625430783972
aramis mumbled verses to himself and porthos from time to time pulled a hair or two from his mustache in sign of despair   9.80689444776851
bonacieux had also reflected   13.516817917913146
oh i do not mean her fortune only   13.29270633629796
italy seems fated to misfortune   11.578058503266298
how a gardener may get rid of the dormice chapter 62   15.557929229623065
flying through an army sire said athos in all countries in the world is called charging   12.93984303801702
we must now only think of you my dear friend and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your flight possible   9.242404564744994
go to go to   8.77107386102977
selim selim   11.984123293366466
morcerf thanked him with a smile and pushed open the door above which were his arms and which as we have said opened into the salon   13.841551848132987
but the cardinal was there observing them with his vigilant eye   13.953196659616921
villefort seized the doctor s hand   16.718834154848746
an ironical smile passed over albert s lips   16.400104823282398
the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees waved and rustled in the wind   14.784549084767205
no fifteen thousand are not enough i can not again become an honest man with less than thirty thousand francs   15.804330085255483
spanish policy and austrian policy would have their representatives in the cabinet of the louvre where they had as yet but partisans   11.866424925836595
and so in spite of m   13.087285098664662
morbleu monsieur   10.818858706282473

then bring some wine said d artagnan   11.403123082282855
yes he said yes doubtless it is painful if you violently break the outer covering which obstinately begs for life   11.639176219142694
why upon my soul my dear fellow it strikes me that our elegant and attentive neighbor must either be some successful stock jobber who has speculated in the fall of the spanish funds or some prince travelling incog   10.056037620191411
my head feels actually cold said porthos   11.751465737524143
it is not so we should evince our resignation to the will of heaven   14.832630627455092
well i too could keep a servant   9.88510690818438
i deliver them to you without compulsion   11.186445894281828
it must be a very irksome office to be the father of a grown up daughter   19.475596730126167
oh he exclaimed running furiously and tearing his hair oh who will deliver me from this man   12.412165785434206
the salutation was so well understood that morrel with the same expression in his eyes placed his handkerchief to his mouth   13.262058972833152
said mordaunt   11.475101836247674
you are a generous man albert but perhaps you may be blinded by pride or resentment   14.021814492021951
in short doctor although i know you to be the most conscientious man in the world and although i place the utmost reliance in you i want notwithstanding my conviction to believe this axiom errare humanum est   13.754973198214703
tis true that he came the next morning to my house thinking that he had to do with an abbé like all other abbés   12.305421680388584
in his pride he fancied that every one must know the chateau du vallon   13.18337401967202
ah true said debray you did fight some time ago   12.835840992729832
nobody knows who she is or where she comes from   16.764216223976582
he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that was about to strike ten and taking up a whistle of silver gilt that stood upon the table near him he shrilled it twice   13.5132751449894
what is to be said   7.495681272998917
because you have the order of charles iii   8.60156766296932
in fact aside from a poor widow and a royal orphan who wept in the corner of the louvre no one appeared to be aware that charles i   13.253256668288302
as he said this he became silent and gazed straight before him like one overwhelmed with a strange and amazing thought   11.343273669463462
then as i said before sir very well   13.989120366149695
the eye of noirtier clearly showed by its expression that he was not deceived by the false assent given by madame de villefort s words and manner to the motives which she supposed him to entertain   5.914183119480994
this is all very easy for you to say replied d artagnan for you athos who live like a dumb man with grimaud who forbid him to speak and consequently never exchange ill words with him   12.517649125705177
then he fixed his eyes on mercédès   14.570238826117627
be civil or i shall beat you   12.661622833736875
after five and twenty years of labor after having acquired a most honorable name in the trade of marseilles m   14.581104796900663

go and tell him the ring is his d artagnan and bring back the two hundred pistoles with you   14.074640141476948
you know well replied de comminges that there are no prisoners at rueil because there is no prison   9.75544066426171
they still laugh at them in france and yet always wear them for all that   8.219722258275329
d artagnan wiped his damp forehead and the king slid off his bed saying let us go   10.836047818975143
i am going sir   10.678923076363981
and i said athos am returning to bragelonne   13.138758520197449

dessessart took up their quarters at the minimes   17.941353208869025

d artagnan thought this could not last long and continued to look with all his eyes and listen with all his ears   11.689893455642483
he has served your majesty longer than we have   8.153809668601282
instead of having watered his cabbage with arsenic he had watered it this time with a solution of salts having their basis in strychnine strychnos colubrina as the learned term it   17.94214133719994
mazarin attempted to open it by a key which he took from his pocket but with such shaking fingers that he could not find the keyhole   12.250246745748466
a don quixote without his corselet without his coat of mail without his cuisses   5.7311994496159935
edward said villefort fixing an imperious glance on the child go and play in the drawing room my dear   14.31927162220079
can i have been intercepted by french telegrams to the pontifical authorities   10.601991469820163
this moment sir   6.5192213350838175
this was precisely what franz had heard the evening before in the ruins of the colosseum   9.430770099103636
while today we have a splendid lawn bordered by trees which appear to be a hundred years old   17.300738724404013

he came twice to milady s   11.950240995835884
it will be well to prepare a light supper of which you athos and aramis are not to partake athos because i told him you had a fever   12.21976401074192
she already heard morrel s voice when suddenly a cloud passed over her eyes her stiffened foot missed the step her hands had no power to hold the baluster and falling against the wall she lost her balance wholly and toppled to the floor   12.010983458817144
yes if you show me a certain embroidered handkerchief   13.955214823943017
just then the count felt his arm pressed   10.132056835134883
my mother had been crying all the night and was very wretched   11.05719346942729
it may therefore be easily imagined there is no scarcity of guides at the colosseum that wonder of all ages which martial thus eulogizes let memphis cease to boast the barbarous miracles of her pyramids and the wonders of babylon be talked of no more among us   16.473210488451755
she tried to be agreeable and she was charming winning the good superior by her varied conversation and by the graces of her whole personality   13.514107707814887
i hope so with all my heart said the gascon and i confess my weakness   14.874414521990452
he has plenty and to spare for supper   10.294416244718285
go to blin or véronique for your clothes   17.090854099984487
but the next moment the unfortunate man was nearly killed with heavy blows of sword hilts and among those who set upon him the king recognized captain groslow   7.823273663273067
this evening m   10.724098560357678
but his wound had rendered him too weak to support such an exertion   8.639587113659442
the man in the red cloak the despair of athos had given place to a concentrated grief which only rendered more lucid the brilliant mental faculties of that extraordinary man   15.905260641759503
i offer you a beggar my lord   10.68317089544404
he cast himself on the ground weeping bitterly and asking himself what crime he had committed that he was thus punished   13.38828525866864
and you what have you done monsieur porthos   5.134408277984447
his eyes were closed and the mouth was distorted   17.1792035670415
and on my word he would be bad company in going either to heaven or to hell   15.240352895276704
but you madame you appear to be free continued the novice   13.514809082502035
i believe so replied the secretary with slight uneasiness   8.333216712188047
come hither   13.961490401041175
i will answer for it her resentment will not hold out against such an attention   12.745882044421599
d artagnan then looked around attentively   15.151644255433318
that m   13.25043359299805
upon my word   9.813440736194007
when i hear misfortunes named madame he said i have within the last few months contracted the bad habit of thinking of my own and then i can not help drawing up an egotistical parallel in my mind   8.741707814962876
he motioned to valentine to approach   15.375527464799987
said the brigadier stopping the servant the person who is ringing appears to want something more than a waiter   12.790914877839333
in short it seems to me that nature herself wears a holiday garb and that the trees instead of leaves and flowers are covered with red and green ribbons as on gala days   14.466347992335894
i repeat to you however and this time on my word of honor i think perhaps too often that i am in haste great haste   10.532931133700236
my position is not sufficiently elevated for that   12.946513247110103
you will come with me then maximilian   10.38442494417339
i turned towards my grandfather as though to question him as to the cause of his emotion   10.69342975385307
i have sent for three of my friends but who knows whether they were at home   8.294376166914466
now excuse the indiscretion marquis but have you any landed property   11.616701436998946
aramis he continued was intimate with a young needlewoman from tours a cousin of his named marie michon   9.882900611166974
raoul arose and threw himself with emotion into the count s arms   15.002506264454881
that person is here madame said the officer leaving the entrance open and drawing himself up in an attitude of respect   8.636316670504478
life is full of humiliations and sorrows continued he becoming still more melancholy   12.558617728039774
in such cases the greatest poet is he who gives utterance to the most natural and vehement outburst of sorrow   9.211095084789807
debray will perhaps be obliged to go to the minister and besides albert looked at his tablets it is the hour i told the count 21st may at half past ten   15.82473412685393
there he had a chair made on his own plan and one day visiting anne of austria in this chair she asked him charmed as she was with his wit if he did not wish for a title   17.737821735528765
what particulars would your excellency like to hear   7.665637138607531
well blacas what think you of this   10.976735980121886
then he had made himself another enemy less to be feared he thought   10.60198975492582
besides bazin is ambitious and learned   9.146507759918192
will your excellency visit saint peter s   14.697892146894342

monte cristo was not deceived   15.88251783248547
twenty five   13.483825259205561
the features of the spectators on the third and fourth stories were visible   12.810255586515657
i have eaten nothing   13.851537891567318
there is no occasion to make such a fuss since i give myself up   16.292990441681177
if i were sole owner we d shake hands on it now my dear dantès and call it settled   15.228256477537947
four men carried me from paris to châlons walking six leagues a day   14.599105769486199
the black horses of the musketeers their martial carriage with the regimental step of these noble companions of the soldier would have betrayed the most strict incognito   8.14558559573036
for me the grave opens when i pass the threshold of this house   11.414361878007561
what can have become of her then   9.605986367258522
after nine at night pardieu   8.819030359344941
and he mounted on the bench to try and get a sight of her   12.49887177768916
for all even for myself among the rest replied villefort   9.41960376824628
from two o clock till five franz and albert followed in the fête exchanging handfuls of confetti with the other carriages and the pedestrians who crowded amongst the horses feet and the carriage wheels without a single accident a single dispute or a single fight   10.229569334136453
you will help me to recover my spirits   12.63013443185843
you have my word monsieur and here is my sword   11.518936394909867

the pilot again changed the course of the boat which rapidly approached the island and was soon within fifty paces of it   7.228786992924429
the day was employed in preparations for the execution   10.525057603323223
you particularly wish it   10.03592697123645
athos waved his flag turning his back on the guards of the city and saluting those of the camp   17.876618613540636
we are dying of hunger   14.97636038577723
in the passage she saw a retreating shadow   12.06676259889272
i fully believed that when he went out in the night he would be forced to traverse the whole of the garden alone   13.18400395267498
do you know about that institution   16.104921614646063
why should i stand in a comrade s way   10.1478181448189
said d artagnan deeply piqued   12.699370001088512
as to d artagnan he will go by what route he thinks is best in planchet s clothes while planchet will follow us like d artagnan in the uniform of the guards   9.541865344549343
the bed belonging to the present occupants was placed as the former owner of the chamber had been accustomed to have his   9.891682454931997
still he had patience for another half hour which appeared to him like a century   9.93514172077721
it is he who sold us   9.968922083376432
the commissary was seated in the chair and was writing at the table   11.729099332706301
leap coward   7.4404206119035265
i feel as if it were ordained that this man should be associated with all the good which the future may have in store for me and sometimes it really seems as if his eye was able to see what was to come and his hand endowed with the power of directing events according to his own will   7.3074628494332785
have you never seen anyone enter your room at night   16.205934933366002

still more must be done   12.483692913132495
d artagnan then remained majestic and intact in his susceptibility till he came to this unlucky city of meung   7.909648942783361
napoleon is the mahomet of the west and is worshipped by his commonplace but ambitious followers not only as a leader and lawgiver but also as the personification of equality   10.413476770373727
you would fight only by broad daylight warn your foe before an attack and never attempt anything by night lest you should be accused of taking advantage of the darkness   13.986261506286489
what a pity mademoiselle de villefort is dead   19.62277224369737
but pursued danglars with one of his sinister smiles an order for unlimited credit calls for something like caution on the part of the banker to whom that order is given   12.782178293682499
patrick said the duke bring me the casket in which the diamond studs were kept   20.416964567954096

it was the king who was passing through the streets which led from the louvre to the hôtel de ville and which were all illuminated with colored lanterns   15.46474639672076
my fair friend said athos allow me to tell you that everybody is tired of war   14.491582835047996
i loved my brother tenderly as i told your excellency and i resolved not to send the money but to take it to him myself   15.251905721216874
d artagnan reflecting on his future amours addressing himself to the beautiful night and smiling at the stars ascended the rue cherish midi or chase midi as it was then called   12.262901272663184
morrel said he it is a happy day for me to feel that i am beloved by such a man as you   11.823265273884628
from the count said bertuccio   10.519947429293836
non siete tedesco   14.383094923008752
yes and at the same time making a hole in the wall   12.195406830338476
before him rose a grotesque mass of rocks that resembled nothing so much as a vast fire petrified at the moment of its most fervent combustion   10.78898534453138
i will stop at the first posting house said danglars to himself   8.619913580355831

the abbé took it and in return gave caderousse the diamond   7.080612823171036
her own hands were moist and icy cold   14.656987477437248
when there is some idea of being resuscitated you say he s a scoundrel an impudent fellow a miser a bad master   16.094650723116438
bonacieux raising her hands to her forehead i shall go mad   10.23479069364471

it was a very serious charge   11.275037801408192
how yes and no   7.6906336097657
because as they say in the opera of thisbe the whole world conspires to break our bonds   11.776813107655846

two large slabs of marble on which were inscribed their names were placed on either side of a little enclosure railed in and shaded by four cypress trees   11.645354547317142

years rolled on and amongst the descendants some were soldiers others diplomatists   7.580402359514341
d artagnan looked attentively at friquet and recognized the little chorister of the rue de la calandre   19.336714730246122
his eye was calm and even brilliant   8.715689677591419
do you then regret nothing   15.473555289801102
athos recognized his comrade and phlegmatic as he was he burst into a laugh which was quite excused by the strange masquerade before his eyes petticoats falling over his shoes sleeves tucked up and mustaches stiff with agitation   7.098464715702483
of the interval passed nothing remains in the memory but a vague mist in which a thousand confused images of trees mountains and landscapes are lost   13.578069184881906
de villefort replied the doctor with increased vehemence there are occasions when i dispense with all foolish human circumspection   6.569637856049674
if my father had offended him why did he not attack him personally   6.464741665239945
why i was here only ten or twelve days ago   16.505823736873786
my opinion is that on the ground the drunken man was not intoxicated   12.111876572459257
30055m it is true said valentine as she passed the end of her slender fingers through a small opening in the planks and permitted maximilian to press his lips to them and you are a true and faithful friend   9.488009797478353

the comte de la fère   5.547637625654762
said valentine i see that i have given you pain   16.581551738028722

we ll search paris all day long said athos and if we have no news this evening we will return to the road to picardy   14.741107630833142
you may get into trouble by what has taken place   15.247771321351731
although it certainly never had occurred to him that his father would carry candor or rather rudeness so far as to relate such a history   11.447161824394838
old dantès however sprang forward   9.65058855021747
you will find your horses in bad condition from the results of this accident   13.42370816648798
and what the devil are we going to do in london   11.778423670388081
and it is very sad believe me to see thus two parties in france two heads to royalty   13.413382568931858
but the prisoners were in their saddles and lost no time hastening to the nearest gate   7.324168925268123
charles stuart had asked that bishop juxon might be permitted to visit him   10.484295003946867
she was owning to me her repugnance to the marriage with m   10.855347847238168
but it seems to me said monte cristo and i must begin by asking your pardon for what i am about to say that if m   5.023844829725047
and that is that their swords may never leave their scabbards but in your majesty s service   10.858123280800818
since god himself dictated those words to his prophet why should i seek to make myself better than god   10.281271869018758
they asked him if some time ago he had not received in his house two gentlemen who were pursued by dragoons   9.119682933311095
d artagnan rose and took his hat   12.364857034470822
what can you expect   14.84159419108264
now young man regulate your conduct accordingly   11.907560411277728
but continued morcerf à propos of danglars we have strangely wandered from the subject   9.91620723730028
and you wish to interest your jailers and your hangmen against me   8.726642061980115
are you still friends with monsieur porthos and monsieur aramis   7.670047250136588
that same evening m   8.91099864263867
how do you explain the influence the count evidently possessed over those ruffians   6.282004527012411
who is this young person m   12.347018951915153
they then led him on about fifty paces farther evidently advancing towards that part of the shore where they would not allow gaetano to go a refusal he could now comprehend   12.457473743963451
at length parliament was convoked   8.578747821297334
oh poor woman poor woman   15.002547220625255

50273m friend he cried i feel that i am dying   14.479036226879838
answered the prince   12.080740918614458
yes but i   18.667590346190323
and by the aid of these two languages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others so that at the end of six months he began to speak spanish english and german   10.715538750538911
after a minute or two they were able to distinguish a man who approached them swimming vigorously   7.634042299793847
yes it is indeed he who has so long pursued my father with jealous hatred   10.9596847012635
milady made no reply but became as pale as a corpse   14.453636337286593
one of the culprits will be mazzolato   12.87587629051762
this belonged to one of his friends at the café de paris so that the innkeeper picking it up after andrea had left was convinced that he had let his horse to the count of mauléon 25 rue saint dominique that being the name and address on the card   13.39970487879637
she was suffering from malarial fever and seemed dying by inches   18.931075889686845
it was you who cut off the two diamond studs from the shoulder of the duke of buckingham   12.191543136380805
the history of athos s imprisonment was then related to them   11.56825844268586
listen then   13.842629345901049
and where did you get so much money   12.941859957048223
i see returned the englishman that a fresh and unmerited misfortune has overwhelmed you and this only increases my desire to serve you   13.603862368753814
you see said he calling d artagnan s attention to the fact that they had come back to the chateau after an hour s walk we have made a tour of my domains   13.90749418250821
you can not at least deny that you are very harsh judges of each other   13.082656438287957
that is the hour when i am expected   9.49357735547583
there certainly is one said m   16.11763193513037
duke you already know that it is not i who caused you to be written to   13.136499549511756
la ramee laughed   11.650590707888165
de villefort who had remorselessly brought misfortune into her family as though they had been strangers   10.934935552162345
but another thing   11.27904410542275
and thanks to that interest for which i am very grateful they send me all the robbers of paris and the neighborhood under pretence of their being caderousse s murderers so that in three months if this continues every robber and assassin in france will have the plan of my house at his fingers ends   11.394480345544379
had been distinguished by his white plume at the battle of ivry   5.787370927228455
his heart was oppressed by a horrible anguish   8.93687346231181
what without chastising this insolent boy   9.823877926972138
said tréville with a brow flushed with anger   11.581644788782556
baptistin opened his eyes with astonishment   8.391764132960873
indeed madame you believe me too credulous   17.184593670430946
the young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eyes of his neighbor   13.511123814971292
bonacieux came in   10.790012110062504
from time to time a broad sheet of lightning opened the horizon in its whole width darted like a serpent over the black mass of trees and like a terrible scimitar divided the heavens and the waters into two parts   15.191295444568258
yes a chief   9.934288876181032
because you can and ought to return to france   10.765052701672952
you are right aramis let us travel on   8.62924324860884
sometimes he feared she had had an intrigue with another who in a jealous fit had surprised her and carried her off   9.661002081269196
it is an excellent spot for bringing down a man in proper style   8.354896795453573
both men entered monte cristo s carriage which in the course of a few minutes deposited them safely at no   8.31014543008408
athos and d artagnan said nothing but their silence seemed to imply consent   16.39908897274689
on the same day the treaty of paris was signed and it was everywhere announced that the cardinal had shut himself up for three days in order to draw it up with the greatest care   8.42923221607306
at the first word you dared to utter at the first freedom to which i had to reply i called for help   15.081518016904752
then when the cardinal had ended alas sir   17.94173114158652
you see my position madame said morrel bestowing a grateful smile on monte cristo   11.137333775529475
in one second athos joined him   11.53665575699214
do one thing   8.584519920963013
it is i who lose my cause and it is ill luck obstinacy and folly which have caused it to be decided against me   6.899649085777787
30193m excuse me sir replied the man raising his hand to his cap   13.525463768275092
the answer pleased him and he laughed   10.326515878905935
i do not even know them under their true names   6.939889273097147
i don t know what you mean nor do i even desire to know what you mean replied the cardinal   11.67569608339108
but tonight you neither can nor shall   10.414769737248038
grimaud bowed but stepped back   6.692697909087154
when we have peace we shall regain paris   14.379594940493824
renée shuddered at the word cut for the growth in question had a head   10.881855206995345
but you can t go out so said kitty   9.333122405785733
d épinay should be called tomorrow to sign the contract then you have my promise maximilian   14.283339427105652
then noticing in the dim light the still youthful and veiled figure of madame de morcerf pardon me he added with a smile i leave you albert   11.8719132048857
it is you monsieur d artagnan she said smiling graciously   6.10210782719486
as for franz he examined his arms with the utmost coolness   12.789852289332133
valentine had raised herself upon her elbow and had scarcely time to throw herself down on the bed and shade her eyes with her arm   11.205683000535588
the bandits shouted with laughter   11.070210610033968
in the centre of the cell in a circle traced with a fragment of plaster detached from the wall sat a man whose tattered garments scarcely covered him   9.382564136783486
or perchance faithless   15.74664314231701
on perceiving mazarin he bowed   9.69240115990591
edmond inserted his lever in the ring and exerted all his strength   11.075662153560334
for the wicked are not so easily disposed of for god seems to have them under his special watch care to make of them instruments of his vengeance   15.794817088492252
but why then did you cry out so   9.015958494292025
but if he annoys you this young fool to be sure he does   7.0242710908493935
monte cristo listened or appeared to do so with the greatest calmness   13.331190414883181
at your age we have faith in life   16.947160219970314
you understand then that if it were so said he rising in his turn and approaching the baroness to speak to her in a lower tone we are lost   8.99073817256797
the old man nodded   9.923618039923996
he approached paid her some well merited compliments on her toilet and offered his arm to conduct her to a seat   17.28752381154678
lord de winter did the same   12.416366615091093
for i entreat her to give to the poor the immense fortune reverting to her from her father now a madman and her brother who died last september with his mother   10.106631011956692
they re after me   10.794419478610441
a burst of laughter from the auditors did not in the least disconcert the speaker who continued yes gentlemen   15.506310415581197
d artagnan drew from his pocket a paper   15.016505891586188
and you would have flattered him for certainly as you say he has no manner   18.96712471560876
send tomorrow at twelve and the bank shall be notified   10.704278366486566
you unraveled it yesterday to the great satisfaction of all   10.19010386715504
there are your instructions said mazarin   14.46085540296449
faith i ve half a mind to do it   10.154302734033363
why you were drunk   11.904676083228976
monte cristo pointed towards the door with the most commanding dignity   17.26873343378547
d artagnan who had been at first the most eager in pursuit of milady sat down on the stump of a tree and hung his head covering his ears with the palms of his hands   11.501139005408277
bonacieux addressing this epithet to her husband   8.624629688980987
yes monsieur the handsomest in the inn a chamber that i could have let ten times over   7.220808187756856
and athos set forward toward charenton followed closely by aramis   9.913611789583335
we can not leave you here so and yet we can not stay   10.823898924767224
heaven grant that this light prove not a devouring fire   14.887955886898329
cavalcanti moved a step forward and albert turned towards him   7.993145603107696
no but they mean to make a fronde as they call it said guitant   13.57103694979517
now is my time to make peace with this gallant man said d artagnan to himself having stood on one side during the whole of the latter part of the conversation   9.796299638469094
the donjon being taken i should be obliged to let them hang you at which i should be most unhappy certainly   8.67631798814493
will you believe the government of a republic a kingdom and an empire   12.725217060835844
it would be impossible to make use of a diligence equally so to engage post horses   11.860499243793175
excuse me excellency but these details are necessary and you promised to be patient   7.81010270579379
do you live in this way always   9.503116937084423
i beg your excellency s pardon for keeping you waiting said the man in the roman dialect but i don t think i m many minutes after my time ten o clock has just struck by the clock of saint john lateran   16.642227654843275
0075m oh to be sure   8.741271541770805
i think so indeed cried he   12.443299859689686
de monte cristo that you must demand an explanation   15.459794298476783
d artagnan unfolded the paper   7.368079708725763
the history is ended   12.914445982623715
you can tell within ten crowns   12.066454160676342
bonacieux lived on very quietly wholly ignorant of what had become of his wife and caring very little about it   12.265454331319214
then when they were opposite the fire he steered to the centre of the circle singing a fishing song of which his companions sung the chorus   14.604938791352467
raoul seeing that he could not arrive in time to cross the ferry with the travelers halted to wait for olivain   10.096538151428957
mousqueton recognizing the voice of his master s friend got up suddenly and in doing so let fall some louis which he had appropriated to himself illegally during the night   10.585793380304853
and whether it was the result of chance or whether a similar feeling had possessed them both while he had donned their costume they had assumed his   7.445012081889301
let me see him   8.371571502646512
this man had been four years longer than himself in prison   12.439690391588007
from here to paris it is a hundred and forty leagues   16.67264828585957
it is the sun which brightens the place and makes it appear so cheerful   14.301412413340975
from what he has told me i know you now   10.736360523797138
i shall die of it   15.429998058301365
sit down madame and let us talk as the cardinal said   12.282228019500893
signor pastrini turned toward franz who seemed to him the more reasonable of the two   11.357938918905418
this night i am determined to be free   12.383310855337726
why it was he who spoke to me sir said dantès with a smile   8.835638035465173
i could never get such a man as that   14.582778973471925
monte cristo was eager to ascertain the strength and number of his enemies   15.08636638694332
they both mingled as they had leave to do with the servants and peasants   15.081662502217497
at the same time the door was opened   9.130140915928688
you admit that you would fight then   11.746730194171853
this news was brought to us   15.19206339792324
and as if the statues had been but shadows from the tomb they had vanished at his waking   7.3655548681092196
at first the captain had received dantès on board with a certain degree of distrust   8.47103766860365
at that unhappy period it was an important consideration to be surrounded by such men as tréville   13.179178979733182
during twenty he had been lieutenant their captain since the night before   12.721541955735098
a bottle perhaps   15.584250844811724
a woman s letter monseigneur   9.63788303624241
listen to me sir   8.376802700052558

sir cried she be kind be clement listen to my prayer   9.977368469484318
a certain monsieur grimaud my lord   8.067198772525805
in a handsome running hand   16.12192783308111
adieu my lord   13.268740155395413
there is a way of detecting its presence   13.953852709076276
cried she throwing back her veil yours which i alone perhaps have not forgotten   10.470614979689467
he burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated me   12.98371054752472
the imprudent young man expected a surprise mixed with shame a slight storm which would resolve itself into tears   20.275448822168812
sometimes we don t go to bed at all   14.805061703034543
asked debray of beauchamp   8.757788037778997
and who thus designated it   15.846508817974275
but if the pharaon should be lost and this last resource be gone the poor man s eyes filled with tears   12.653367629487985
well i will go and take a turn in the champs élysées and at ten o clock i will return here   12.830326704707142
he is really king of paris   13.9207912725487
the young man was himself astonished to find his heart beat so violently   10.816396016621466
you remember what a beautiful night it was   7.109293821102499
and i tell you that i will save you yet   11.421296621991047
why you told me he was a young man   12.5533467541871
his horse bounded to one side losing its footing and fell entangling raoul s leg under its body   12.155603313584189
and the king putting spurs to his horse set off to the tent of lord leven   14.474627760565479
the duc d elbeuf obtained payment of certain sums due to his wife one hundred thousand francs for his eldest son and twenty five thousand for each of the three others   8.869495922935734
it s nothing it s nothing   13.726119180701362
come now that we are alone said athos let us talk of yourself   13.430561901833311
the deputies bowed and left the room   12.891289553397526
bernouin alone knew a little more than the others   10.449774534923948
you fear to acknowledge that your correspondent has deceived you   11.404162299335288
return whence you came   12.683534798055927
ah perbacco indispensable were they   11.728942903340124
this fourth murder is apparent to all and if thy father abandon thee valentine it is i and i swear it that shall pursue the assassin   13.618512313039659
well then three months said penelon   18.334637486366304
no the third was brought to me this very morning by a groom out of livery who would not tell me in whose service he was and who said he had received orders from his master   15.545843109013846
the cardinal won t allow it   9.587690575915321
now my dear friend look upon all i tell you as merely the statement of a monk of a man who resembles an echo repeating simply what he hears   16.347450358618413
as for me i feel anxious to preach a sermon said d artagnan   14.0971299100579
near the camp you might be recognized   16.967332415076143
certainly said d artagnan   16.256844123709705
the sheath at his belt was empty   12.955982125095199
alas like most things in this world which have nothing in their favor but appearances the baldric was glittering with gold in the front but was nothing but simple buff behind   12.872924051591053
is the spot far from here   14.949772863570601
as he descended the staircase morrel met penelon who was going up   11.31065504733963
between people like us threats are out of place everything should be amicably arranged   12.76801845124728
yes madame the comte de la fere   10.858792004994777
he threw some dust over the topcoat which he had found time to unhook from the antechamber and button over his ball costume and going to chapelle en serval he knocked loudly at the door of the only inn in the place   11.803494186467184
asked la ramee giving more serious attention to the duke s words   9.004739629995685
oh leave me   15.725854162933128
i don t see that at all answered porthos   13.775061947050428
what proofs do you require   13.861923950706682
that is our brave musketeer i think said the cardinal   10.669309595488459
it is when one is lowest on the wheel of fortune that the merry go round wheels and rewards us   11.86823146499586
i was present during his last moments   11.77357685571872
if you refuse at least to tell mercédès i am here i will some day hide myself behind the door and when you enter i will dash out your brains with this stool   14.593949302271827
then you hope the poison will take no effect on valentine   21.392922831004476
there could be no fault to find with this arrangement   10.022875495003436
that s unfortunate   10.057708020458318
he meditates   15.7912741482351
and the friends spurring on their horses rode to the hotel the arms of england   8.839197270148368
on approaching the hotel of the roe he found however that it was in front of the next house the mob was collected   11.238909971778535
you at last   9.154200570310252
in ten minutes it would strike seven   15.738211888847339
then i shall say the duel did not take place   13.774790363929132
there were caskets of diamonds cashmere shawls valenciennes lace english veils and in fact all the tempting things the bare mention of which makes the hearts of young girls bound with joy and which is called the corbeille   8.696315438156125
i believe her to be a cardinalist   12.111703233443889
cried the lieutenant   10.145488624433225
but this is the hour when we usually give m   14.024180592963637
no news had been received of them   11.147657591144196
athos and aramis remembered that this was the name by which de winter had called the man they had found in the passage of the king s tent   15.091952728381042
one might think you really suspected us monseigneur and we were undergoing a real interrogatory   8.475352784858623
as he had prophesied would be the case he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left leg and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself   15.181951871551627
that is admirable   12.272938327202526
replied bonacieux in a sepulchral tone   12.241863819974293
i want to know if you were left alone and nobody interrupted you   16.470123339917414
he began to laugh i threatened to strike him and he made two steps backwards   12.327737731488554
he endeavored to cheer him up in his solitude   13.146462883962345
four men of good will who will risk being killed with me   14.594535750718983
what i have always wished for desired and coveted is the life of an artist free and independent relying only on my own resources and accountable only to myself   5.629907825949104
that is all very well and enough for today   5.6834492970688935
return instantly   9.939824502793453
it would ruin me replied the abbé   10.737905063893027
but gentlemen i warn you unless you kill me your victory will be of very short duration   16.952299849560458
i should have thought her too reasonable to be led by imagination   14.455846033859103
a gentleman   14.278289672551843
your spanish wine is excellent   10.17083723011174
does the house approve that the examination should take place today   10.304272797558257
while d artagnan turned the two horses into a lane went round the house and came back to watch the conference from behind a hedge of filberts   13.737382343128886
your excellency s name is the baron franz d épinay   9.142505551317505
in three days we shall be delivered from this creature and where i shall send her she can harm nobody   12.51174698708602
how long have you been here   8.927775319055236
but even if you had caused me to wait a little while i should have felt quite sure that the delay was not occasioned by any fault of yours   14.581405495147449
but it did not prevent his getting very tired or from talking at every moment of returning to paris so that if the messengers and the spies had failed his eminence notwithstanding all his inventiveness would have found himself much embarrassed   11.59898666239563
at this moment the clock struck eleven   5.545610589019148
let me also ask you a question   17.59090162808288
oh woe to me   11.917166061769132
but an imperious glance from the stranger stopped him short   11.675674463308845
howled milady   12.94608444090504
however he continued to take the left hand   14.568554467366255
you know how i settled the matter   12.990932774799123
monsieur does me wrong said planchet   11.791707836049941
and a magnificent one   11.932107152405962
the count de villeroy said that he did not know how any fear could be entertained for a moment when the court had to defend itself against the parliament and the citizens of paris his holiness the coadjutor who by a signal could raise an army of curates church porters and vergers   14.298231740535412
his opinion has been given   7.4899358302373145
in that case felton would escape her for in order to secure success the magic of a continuous seduction was necessary   9.666197936537298
i do not thus betray my enjoyments to the vulgar   17.096377477586184
ah well   9.668421895585285
he dismounted and entered   13.129285725404927
the same smile returned   14.975494264199254
we were almost agreed on those replied mazarin   5.8619367050218525
i am replied dantès in bad italian a maltese sailor   15.180158140743842
to so good a marksman as you are i may say what would appear absurd to another   15.601471591195978
no but according to all probability she soon will be replied edmond   11.809703231729728
you see them whenever god pleases to allow them to assume a material form   15.96479495068126
why said he does not the emperor who has devised so many clever and efficient modes of improving the art of war organize a regiment of lawyers judges and legal practitioners sending them in the hottest fire the enemy could maintain and using them to save better men   14.014821700131131
what injury has fernand mondego done you in betraying ali tepelini   8.319874942771918
monte cristo carried them both to the salon and deposited them on a sofa   11.76259967680578
on my left i will place him who has ever been as a brother to me pointing with a soft and gentle smile to fernand   11.09039160470667
come sir do not keep me starving here any longer but tell me what they want   11.490643508443375
said a swiss who was drinking rum out of a beer glass   14.214360738463013
and the following afternoon at half past five o clock the young men parted   9.639316262405888
a lady entered to whom franz had been introduced in paris where indeed he had imagined she still was   10.820256751530918
and who are you   9.504959076046525
while he was endeavoring to find out which of his companions stood in greatest need he caught a glance from athos   13.276047474879288
i dressed myself as quickly as possible   11.491770520846005
perhaps what i am about to say may seem strange to you who are socialists and vaunt humanity and your duty to your neighbor but i never seek to protect a society which does not protect me and which i will even say generally occupies itself about me only to injure me   10.422961993676179
one day when they were talking over their plans for the future they heard two or three reports of firearms and then suddenly a man came out of the wood near which the two young persons used to graze their flocks and hurried towards them   9.750717733099261
monsieur d artagnan shall die   15.310045589749352
but milady with her ear on the watch had heard the noise d artagnan had made and opening the door said come in   15.050200677290947
you didn t know king charles   12.673932153049655
so let the matter end   14.046808134711704
asked morcerf   11.5780211618785
but this i know that i had but to write to her and she would have sent me fifteen hundred   8.963035201775929
yes yes said porthos trying to give to his mustache a curl which it had lost whilst he had been alone   15.499072591476274
athos was at home emptying sadly a bottle of the famous spanish wine he had brought back with him from his journey into picardy   8.533870521304724
it is not necessary for milady to be seen by this fellow continued the stranger   14.194883542607988
the hostess replied only by gasps   12.291076615705991
it remains now for us to keep our word   13.86842401056279
the stranger ascended a rough staircase and before a table illumined by a lamp whose light was concentrated by a large shade while the rest of the apartment was in partial darkness he perceived the abbé in a monk s dress with a cowl on his head such as was used by learned men of the middle ages   8.66893491996063
but do not keep raoul with you   7.344607748271871
do you know the count of monte cristo   12.777695559986698
eight days my lord   7.252644267719526
exclaimed the duke who from time to time looked at the clock the fingers of which seemed to move with sickening slowness   11.4229265281292
monsieur de mazarin had thought that we had rendered service to general cromwell instead of king charles which would have been a disgrace rebounding from us to him and from him to your majesty a dishonor which would have tainted the royalty of your illustrious son   11.520783257755241
richest my dear fellow   16.597261684348794
monte cristo took her hand and imprinted a kiss on it   12.302257524613708
this duet is one of the most beautiful expressive and terrible conceptions that has ever emanated from the fruitful pen of donizetti   11.967427828318735
said lord de winter with apparent good nature   12.432280333650281
his eye took in at a glance the plump cheerful countenance of the mistress of the place and he at once perceived there was no occasion for dissembling with her or of fearing anything from one blessed with such a joyous physiognomy   11.04282049458223
milady had stabbed herself   14.73619847262274
to save the king   5.718174007222895
behind the event that had overwhelmed him he saw the hand of god   13.665041137259617
he had gone to the rendezvous had encountered there the adversary indicated whose name he had never known had given him a pretty sword stroke on the arm then had gone toward aramis who at the same time came to meet him having already finished his affair   11.401620738930376
look well at me   9.95608731764042
we will be with you at six o clock my lord   13.48822988437755
the room was whitewashed as is the custom in prisons but it looked quite brilliant to a prisoner though a stove a bed a chair and a table formed the whole of its sumptuous furniture   11.331260714433428
i understand said the duke   12.443227086978672
yes i see for the young man raoul said d artagnan   13.202602518090456
to be decapitated   10.332155340379158
you have ill understood wrongly interpreted   9.15776657695682
i believe that his only crime is to have at the same time the good fortune and the misfortune to be your husband   17.9798793052356
their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell and the unhappy young man was no longer called edmond dantès he was now number 34   9.823339125698132
the young men wished to decline but they could find no good reason for refusing an offer which was so agreeable to them   15.979750312146047
but the face i had a large hat said aramis   10.677957010850696
the musketeer returned home hungry and in bad humor   13.61119172688754
it is humiliating said he thus to receive money given grudgingly an uncertain supply which may soon fail   12.096112306754378
he had admired the assurance of his look and the firmness of his voice   13.970092733636264
let us see what more does athos say   15.182553429864111
the old patron did not interfere for he too had recognized the superiority of dantès over the crew and himself   12.743589379031437
bravo d artagnan your opinion is mine cried athos besides we must be consistent   8.73373723800937
at the saint gervais bastion said porthos   9.628124437613687
grimaud had indeed during twenty two years of service seen his master extricate himself from so many difficulties that nothing less than athos s imminent death was likely to make him uneasy   10.210772804653248
i should give up broussel said porthos   12.543039070481672
yes yes murmured cromwell   12.232161753459351
if we lay hands on this fortune we may enjoy it without remorse   17.399681521010212
ah i see you are smiling   12.190138947452041
it is important that you should be seen there   12.657594376008664
this time however due precautions were taken to prevent any attempt at escape   11.822350371391611
i arrived an hour since   10.377128896761555
when villefort trembling and crouched in a corner had endeavored to lessen the storm by supplicating glances at the implacable old man sir said d épinay to noirtier since you are well acquainted with all these details which are attested by honorable signatures since you appear to take some interest in me although you have only manifested it hitherto by causing me sorrow refuse me not one final satisfaction tell me the name of the president of the club that i may at least know who killed my father   14.617305100032727
man as you know said aramis is a strange animal made up of contradictions   16.09873585893195
and i have an excuse for mine would not be the first hand of a man that has been placed upon you i imagine   15.816897898747378
she was sent to me by someone of high rank under the name of kitty   14.068836018433869
with some gentleman who was traveling this way to whom he proposed a game of lansquenet   12.296953803579566
i too as happens to every man once in his life have been taken by satan into the highest mountain in the earth and when there he showed me all the kingdoms of the world and as he said before so said he to me child of earth what wouldst thou have to make thee adore me   11.01220738771081
whilst the groom ran to a neighboring building   19.17194872152972
confound it yes   14.556435586809227
he was a man as must have been already perceived who made but little noise and yet was much sought after   10.21437288180802
i am now on my road   11.254111138747655
madeleine said the gascon give me your apartment on the first floor   15.450881213897182
the celebrated breviary remained in the family and was in the count s possession   9.597026096170001
everybody had remarked that something had passed between the king and queen   13.685502794441085
danglars instantly descended   12.08073033021131
monsieur de chatillon cried aramis taking from his saddle bags a second pistol i think if your pistols have been discharged you are a dead man   14.168062067435892
yes it is   9.968877698669738
an englishman visited toulon who had vowed to rescue two men from infamy and his choice fell on you and your companion   9.993940959809418
you really mean to declare that such is not your intention   9.496407300757431
i will introduce you to him for it will be necessary he should know you as he is to pay your money   10.313905058508805
valentine said she only drank half the glassful   8.9926814961502
danglars coming out of his cabin who will furnish you with every particular   14.49310485049878
no monsieur he is as well as a man can be with four sword wounds in his body   9.771688099412389
and morrel was right for he returned home crushed by the humiliation of a refusal   10.946001519377635
are you sure in her conversation with you that your wife mentioned no names   13.97083323936723
i was concealed by a column and might witness the whole of the terrible scene which was about to take place   9.325497147149976
as you will valentine   15.536024838768064
i recognize you there my brave d artagnan replied athos   9.188418191546118
major cavalcanti chapter 56   18.438317977996313
in the daytime nobody was seen there but mendicants devouring their crusts and children at play   12.830668708361399
examined the cupboards and placed the key in each   6.785795341345281
calumnies did you say sir   7.6174869585899945
for you must know monsieur that all our provisions are in the cellar   14.578940698496059
while yet young unfortunately handsome i was dragged into a snare   6.592062258365248
yes i have something of the highest importance to tell you   8.658878437999373
the return d artagnan was astounded by the terrible confidence of athos   4.6750874512523275
the means we might have used which we in our blindness could not see then seem simple and easy and we say why did i not do this instead of that   12.213346500880226
and she is not to be despised in my opinion   9.948105838300354
it was the end of november all the verdure of the garden had disappeared the trees were nothing more than skeletons with their long bony arms and the dead leaves sounded on the gravel under my feet   12.66618533030596
at least we can have a window   13.122078090643521
but of ten three only remained the rest having been broken by the waves   14.550157115440397
and where is it decided to transfer him   8.155764096503509
yes and the queen too   11.71286057440919
i heard it with my own ears   10.039946159483613
this gloomy fortress which has for more than three hundred years furnished food for so many wild legends seemed to dantès like a scaffold to a malefactor   13.071679544363901
replied the sergeant their vehicle has broken down a second time   12.569453743675027
but with regard to the present the cardinal is always telling me there is no more money in the royal coffers   12.528517337287665
i mistake my father intends giving a ball   12.359913420760362
the company clapped their hands   13.296826474526434
nevertheless you can understand that when 700 000 francs leave the wife s pocket the husband always finds it out   9.037951836852024
no said noirtier   13.498127681969088
then answered the elder prisoner the will of god be done   7.667656742738532
he was sustained at first by that pride of conscious innocence which is the sequence to hope   17.012069790676534
drink to his health he added filling caderousse s glass and do not interfere with us   7.601597118742612
like a genuine frenchman albert had employed his time in arranging for the evening s diversion   11.97304944715234
again you drive me to despair maximilian said valentine again you plunge the dagger into the wound   12.533022936660423
but one thing at least is clear which is that you decline allying yourself with my family   8.48635549694656
goose grease is kood with basdry   13.61308263487576
murmured the duke looking at the king and dandré who spoke alternately like virgil s shepherds   13.274697323019828
go out this way said she opening a small private door and come back at eleven o clock   12.168381805543687
they are those of monsieur le coadjuteur he said   4.211812068370108
gramercy   7.01138607568988
of which we each of us ate a slice with a hearty appetite   12.743132728690448
the poor exile frequently beguiles a weary hour in playing over to me the airs of her native land   10.901926581136841
remember the soldiers and sentinels who guard these doors   18.11560131325153
you are the master and i could not have the least word to say   13.84994036694012
they brought me that book   3.2541657111172704
and now farewell   13.577355748106028
oh no monsieur said villefort with a bitter smile   11.87773733244204
will you promise me   13.186457585015303
are you not well   12.057269126394614
unfortunately i had not above 1 500   12.383728941312734
certainly you give a most commonplace air to your explanation but it is not the less true that you ah but what do i hear   6.68528346977167
it is not a matter of royal etiquette this evening but of the king s safety   8.535965161188345
i have seen that mother   13.964695558560258
this circumstance pleased m   13.64960267971465
he must wait   11.05692136821572
the salon downstairs was only an algerian divan for the use of smokers   7.134819095735063
anne of austria looked with wonderment on the warlike countenance of d artagnan which betrayed a singular expression of deep feeling   13.52426419871096
a gentleman turned around   15.155178839340909
as the police minister related this to the king villefort who looked as if his very life hung on the speaker s lips turned alternately red and pale   7.763058464753312
she sighed as she looked at him   18.357295824061268
if i had them i should think myself as rich as croesus   15.009797963129593
sir replied comminges it seems that it is impossible   10.392809472196944
a death without agony a death which allows me to fade away while pronouncing valentine s name and pressing your hand   11.231367162748954
why does not he go about his business   6.22913966208614
you told me that your instinct and although you pretend to know nothing about speculations i think on the contrary that your comprehension is very clear upon certain affairs well you told me that your instinct led you to believe the grant would be given to the company called the southern   11.362192806153585
so much the worse for those who fear wine for it is because they have bad thoughts which they are afraid the liquor will extract from their hearts   13.772439359092868
the english repulsed foot by foot beaten in all encounters and defeated in the passage of the isle of loie were obliged to re embark leaving on the field of battle two thousand men among whom were five colonels three lieutenant colonels two hundred and fifty captains twenty gentlemen of rank four pieces of cannon and sixty flags which were taken to paris by claude de st   14.1987667193303
albert smiled   7.938723192745136
you will do me the favor to bring us some spanish wine and then to withdraw   9.49205799100136
at about half past eight o clock they reached the first houses in noisy   9.745879528600273
the count withdrew without opposition but it was only to place himself in a situation where he could watch every movement of morrel who at length arose brushed the dust from his knees and turned towards paris without once looking back   13.515146643087618
why said groslow that is just what we are taking him to london for   12.152337089033633
the cardinal seated himself before his bureau and taking a sheet of paper wrote some lines upon it whilst d artagnan stood imperturbable without showing either impatience or curiosity   13.680052631491145
for long   10.568251634933358
de schomberg on the south from perigny to angoutin   12.042830731909147
groaned porthos i am a widower and have forty thousand francs a year   6.9863489291765895
decidedly this is a clever fellow murmured athos   14.61664167160703
afraid of making any inquiries at this house d artagnan entered a small tavern at the corner of the street and asked for a cup of hypocras   12.04541359660244
he is a perfect nobleman very polite modest and agreeable such as may be found constantly in italy descendants of very ancient families   12.145227471621554
yes keep it keep it   9.444594831316032
i am not begging my fine fellow said the unknown to the servant with so ironical an expression of the eye and so frightful a smile that he withdrew   13.211983777421384
he reflected but he remembered that he himself would have charge of the food and the wine and therefore that no powder could be mixed with the food no drug with the wine   7.8659441532495675
you know you have staked the harnesses against the horse or a hundred pistoles at your choice   16.910482192393623
his agitated features presented the appearance of pale and hideous terror   15.606213487484672
the entire chamber was lined with crimson brocade worked with flowers of gold   11.509189282053136
arriving at the faubourg st   15.701854400617242
i have at length then intelligence of you   16.324536845955112
caderousse then was as usual at his place of observation before the door his eyes glancing listlessly from a piece of closely shaven grass on which some fowls were industriously though fruitlessly endeavoring to turn up some grain or insect suited to their palate to the deserted road which led away to the north and south when he was aroused by the shrill voice of his wife and grumbling to himself as he went he mounted to her chamber first taking care however to set the entrance door wide open as an invitation to any chance traveller who might be passing   8.727440158799437
it was aramis   10.772467522179133
that s all right my dear aramis take care of yourself said he   13.675120061833733
why it seems that i crushed for him a parliament councillor   15.641617933360848
said athos at the end of ten minutes   13.30101575096382
he alighted passed through the corridors and entered the house without observing the hesitation of the door keepers or the coolness of his colleagues   9.87154508951728
and that is true   11.243188371934018
never replied the count who was by this time perfectly master of himself again   10.195098120856528
he does not like eugénie sufficiently   7.76689713421421
0097m as he had now arrived at the door of his own house which adjoined the palais de justice he entered after having coldly saluted the shipowner who stood as if petrified on the spot where villefort had left him   6.985759767391094
asmodeus that diabolical personage who would have been created by every fertile imagination if le sage had not acquired the priority in his great masterpiece would have enjoyed a singular spectacle if he had lifted up the roof of the little house in the rue saint germain des prés while debray was casting up his figures   10.451055871508427
be it then as you desire   16.77840224753865
now my lord said the poor man let me have the poire d angoisse   13.69077100247631
madame de villefort left and valentine remained alone beside the bed for the procureur overcome with astonishment at the unexpected death had followed his wife   5.508435900757396
but who will distribute these things   4.904442321868341
i will go continued maximilian i will seek m   9.873503449334798
they search her   6.460226109524258
my senses are confused and during the last hour the most extravagant thoughts have passed through my brain   11.193475657843951
as there is a diamond let us sell it   12.2034035758701
i thought your excellence considered the death of charles i   8.364629727741145
i am in the service of the king and queen of france and form part of the company of monsieur dessessart who as well as his brother in law monsieur de tréville is particularly attached to their majesties   3.151935557240421
villefort for a declaration to be available should be made before the competent authorities   12.21099411714368
it was plain that the small shagreen case which he turned over and over in his hand did not seem to him commensurate in value to the enormous sum which fascinated his gaze   5.348028624837925
what matters it about broussel it is a name not a thing   11.839703269273356
how much were they worth   4.5404493370915695
you are too late madame   13.085395097822364
aramis at this movement drew his sword   11.590516457151086
aramis accordingly took the quill reflected for a few moments wrote eight or ten lines in a charming little female hand and then with a voice soft and slow as if each word had been scrupulously weighed he read the following my lord the person who writes these few lines had the honor of crossing swords with you in the little enclosure of the rue d enfer   12.769881723867
yes my lord i accept them said d artagnan   11.872655144548132
he was a relentless enemy that damned cardinal continued aramis glancing at the portrait of the old minister   14.02251397522671
i reflected for a long time and with the hope of averting some impending misfortune i resolved that benedetto should accompany me   8.056585563342047
pardon you monseigneur   15.202127721470049
then let him come in if you please   12.29043867666865
except your signature and your partner s m   8.14202350554348
in the anteroom valentine met barrois and looked despairingly at the old servant   9.925653974775116
d avrigny said he believed they both proceeded from poison   8.51174487771955
i had the honor of saying to your eminence that there had been some mistake   10.217274698399658
he was about to remove the pistols from the saddle he had quit to the one he was about to fill but he found the holsters furnished with similar pistols   13.432573474386356
tis you who have named him as m   11.34986583708086
said he at length   15.637652505808289
noirtier made a sign that he was ready to answer   8.52680320500708
peppino mounted the seat behind   12.5718082851256
d artagnan employed himself in arranging a little plan of which we shall hereafter see the execution and which promised him some agreeable adventure as might be seen by the smiles which from time to time passed over his countenance whose thoughtfulness they animated   7.364581175610651
then turning toward the door and seeing that the young officer was waiting for his last orders he said   11.761593891618856
yes that is true   15.545697145183762
but i must return to paris   9.897928169008052
d artagnan therefore thanked the man and gave him a crown piece to drink to general cromwell s health   14.938523318831122
their agony formed part of their merit if they were not seen alive they were despised when dead   16.539986553316414
milady was there as it were where you sit   13.581694624902156
then replied grimaud you wish me to allow monsieur le comte to be killed   9.091475870589711
and we start in his carriage then   12.77921837524836
remain said caderousse   9.118340344236689
only a few men remained   12.925504064558574
he inquired how they were fed and if they had any request to make   17.747180942127535
and he touched his mule   12.65986179068924
till tomorrow rash youth said the jesuit   16.412220674059203
he seized monte cristo s hand   9.573546595792521
dantès declared however that he would rather die where he was than undergo the agony which the slightest movement cost him   15.015149399814618
the four friends took leave of him and asked if they could deliver any message for him to his brother   10.13088538337354
the old man looked at her for an instant with an expression of the deepest tenderness then turning towards the notary he significantly winked his eye in token of dissent   11.356341801009957
why what can have happened   10.181560103244514
the latter did not appear to arouse from his lethargy   9.732637930897106
when i go back to france i must suggest some such convenient course to cardinal mazarin and the coadjutor   12.189317666169131
then sounding his bell he said to ali who entered i am going to madame s chamber have the carriage ready at one o clock   8.863193917061446
you were the tool of those cowards who dared not kill her themselves   7.2954185934255324
do you know monsieur d artagnan   15.232760775807696
stop said albert here he comes   15.911224479140513
coquenard they arose slowly from the table folded their napkins more slowly still bowed and retired   13.538129405493262
i will say then monsieur quite short   15.311946944943038
i was there too and i never shall forget the old man s smile at this prescription   13.896390479858212
wonderful   16.755919375680552
i have forgotten the other key   14.246989716362084
oh do not fear my friend said morrel raising his head and smiling with a sweet expression on the count   5.553576018606997
i doubt that replied d artagnan for they are advancing very resolutely   16.313912456090605
here is night coming on   6.811764452508604
i will not speak again said château renaud   11.290181762489128
i had it   14.938821175796818
porthos ventured to put his head between the railings to try if his glance could penetrate the gloom   11.950341844673927
you only acquired my protection after the influence and fortune of your father had been ascertained   12.020273800996165
he appears cool   11.617751217136336
would i were but a baron   13.554194649757418
are you not afraid of making people envious of me duchess   13.095882620087108
i have told you twenty times that if you wish to die on that day i will assist you   16.545421496141355
our landlord s to be sure   17.367067396491787
and what was most frightful continued milady her voice altered as if she still experienced the same agony as at that awful minute was that at this time i retained a consciousness of the danger that threatened me   9.870883519047872
war had made her a queen   14.887508118480257
i shall be brought home   16.52618815543272
now the scripture says positively make a sacrifice unto the lord   10.52214399262774
yes count it is a strange thing and one which might astonish you but i feel an indescribable horror at the sight of yonder man   13.475539014599258
the host stood at the door   11.123685388599664
but at the same instant the crowd of guests rushed in alarm into the principal salon as if some frightful monster had entered the apartments quærens quem devoret   13.743033267790594
and with that white teeth a piercing eye dark complexion black hair and haughty carriage why that s my man of meung   13.32598605692818
this voice made everyone bow before it resembling in its effect the wind passing over a field of wheat by its superior strength forcing every ear to yield obeisance   14.590224368822783
speak command i will obey   14.702895219861606
the avenger was conquered   10.255156429740873
besides all they require is a good room with sentinels or their simple parole that they will not attempt escape   12.873428291693738
d artagnan approached him and seeing him stare so fixedly said well friend   12.921436553701248
the abbé saw he had overshot the mark and he added quickly no one   11.262508722896156
no i do not replied monte cristo   11.213887528298695
his spurs jingled his cuirass glittered his sword knocked proudly against his ample limbs   8.593240345504832
now this rock it has met has been a long and narrow boat manned by six or eight men who have surprised and plundered it some dark and stormy night near some desert and gloomy island as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses of a forest   13.45955865224783
the last two mounted guard at the door during this examination   11.58532568660726
ah like the charming journey the other day when it rained bullets and produced a crop of steel traps   12.695053200617176
it is best to constitute myself at once a prisoner with athos who is already arrested and with d artagnan who most probably will be   13.600814175870036
the white lips no longer quivered the eyes were suffused with a bluish vapor and the long black lashes rested on a cheek white as wax   14.422710886735128
general oliver cromwell   6.908126643126804
could you have been so cruel as not to bring her   11.190716529402003
maximilian had scarcely finished his story during which the count s heart had swelled within him when emmanuel entered wearing a hat and coat   13.256545710452492
stuff   11.77030588839424
but said mordaunt looking at athos and aramis with bloodshot eyes these are frenchmen i imagine   12.43273055839498
at this moment a soldier entered to inform them that groslow was waiting for them   8.08065519401743
let the civil war last but one year and i will have a constable s sword gilt for me   11.370363796394717
at last about ten o clock and just as dantès began to despair steps were heard in the corridor a key turned in the lock the bolts creaked the massy oaken door flew open and a flood of light from two torches pervaded the apartment   12.19844653291454
but that gigantic body guard replied to the look with his great bass voice be tranquil my lord and mazarin became more and more composed   11.582645685525767
and the two gentlemen shortly afterward left the louvre   6.250138664877459
this time he fell on his knees and clasping his hands convulsively uttered a prayer intelligible to god alone   7.218420785316279
d artagnan at the moment of quitting milady felt only the liveliest regret at the parting   12.495028772771462
his ears had perceived sounds without comprehending them   10.86718602689833
the count inquired of albert de morcerf   7.194574698570504
and you too charlotte   12.538785097083004
he spoke of it as a thing already decided   13.413465789854786
be satisfied all who are named in that letter shall be punished as they deserve even the queen herself   8.440074692595463
waiting below in my carriage   13.879763419088482
ha ha ye romans   15.994569299492273
a pistol shot seems quite delightful compared with this catastrophe   10.260133196664151
the swiss was six feet high d artagnan was hardly more than five   10.85606675324386
yes to be sure   16.339081268958772
before his death had placed in the hands of aramis   7.615024885894901
it is a forgery   13.77112280521247
the guide was coming   16.210263142962106
asked d artagnan with anguish   10.18848362661541
athos rose walked toward his friend with a slow and solemn step embraced him tenderly and as he burst into violent sobs he said to him with his noble and persuasive voice friend be a man   12.317680919336519
you think of starting at once then   11.097770061384727
without reckoning the value of that diamond he cast a complacent look at the ring which he had kept instead of restoring to d artagnan which is worth at least ten thousand francs   12.077393699168091
i will watch over them as i have over you   8.53103594849715
the king rose immediately took his book closed it and went to lay it down on the table near which he continued standing in order that mazarin might be obliged to stand also   18.65931102570176
thank you no sir   16.144715400520113
ah said monte cristo it seems to me this was nothing but murder and robbery   15.354152791116075
the two guards led the prisoner toward the table and upon a sign from the commissary drew back so far as to be unable to hear anything   15.323282483337666
he is bidding you adieu   11.53393016893338
felton believed he heard the singing of the angel who consoled the three hebrews in the furnace   10.34610307975981
raoul trembled lest he should laugh among the rest at madame de chevreuse for whom he entertained deep and genuine sympathy but either instinctively or from affection for the duchess he said everything in her favor   9.220779253434301
do you hear it   12.578746058464933
in the other he announces that he is about to transport his prisoners to melun since rueil seemed to him not sufficiently secure   12.436190248268659
her beauty serves as a bait to her victims   15.849914648471454
raoul was seated at table with the count de guiche and his tutor when all at once the door opened and grimaud presented himself travel stained dirty and sprinkled with the blood of the unhappy executioner   13.398548255635713
i could live upon a hundred francs   12.69888464895177
is he at liberty   10.819961341442422
shall further inquiries be made   17.566381986579067
four times two makes eight then said aramis   15.940274926919678
oh cried madame danglars it was enough to drive you mad   14.088538982616067
i will not continued he after a moment s silence conceal from you that while your probity and exactitude up to this moment are universally acknowledged yet the report is current in marseilles that you are not able to meet your liabilities   4.072500205732098
it is not god s will that they should be accomplished   16.39881847988326
bonacieux the second time as he had carried her off the first   12.80568466691132
d artagnan replied in such a manner that kitty remained in her great delusion   14.715786512679804
the young officer however remained mute and motionless   14.634697770801687
having been brought up on the banks of the loire he might have been said to have been cradled on its waves   9.244105881598236
below these lines were written in a strange hand the following in italian se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani alla sette il conte alberto avrà cessato di vivere   17.176798745998127
the former sign was repeated   10.672888580310824
the road to bayonne   10.099181812901797
they are regular misers   8.19022537659739
d artagnan was again in the presence of the circe who had before surrounded him with her enchantments   9.861629760003677
milady not seeing me come again would not be able to understand what could cause the interruption of my visits and might suspect something   8.693467931003134
ah yes it is indeed strange   8.92989868049606
rospigliosi quite set up with his new dignities went with a good appetite and his most ingratiating manner   11.658363660098699
in fact the bullets had actually pierced the cards in the exact places which the painted signs would otherwise have occupied the lines and distances being as regularly kept as if they had been ruled with pencil   5.825588164450957
but because you have paid the price of a slave do you imagine that i have ceased to be your king   10.581776878229807
only when pressing his hand a little more warmly than usual he informed him that the company of dessessart was on duty at the louvre and that he might repair at once to his post   16.760667882692687
because i am not willing to die   7.34504863604413
for the examination of our cash takes place tomorrow   13.849010704314916
go on with your recital sirs said the queen turning to the duc de chatillon   10.025085962570962
reverend sir said caderousse drawing still nearer   15.76236721935209
there is something so awe inspiring in great afflictions that even in the worst times the first emotion of a crowd has generally been to sympathize with the sufferer in a great catastrophe   12.745343755318014
the bodies were not plundered were they   9.951533789093844
i have then five minutes said monte cristo to himself   8.820522606826227
noirtier is desirous of making his will   16.063010066404416
good said he   18.225247921980454
she soon whispered to her husband i think it would be better for me to retire with your permission for the sight of me appears still to afflict your mother in law   10.78685669189081
i pointed to the spot where i had concealed myself   14.210024463590262
and now said the queen we are forgetting one very necessary thing   14.69799787853874
the eyes repeated several times no no no   15.164651140704015
let us go then said franz since you wish it   17.800265504530284
she will buy heavily and she will certainly lose when beauchamp announces the following day in his gazette the report circulated by some usually well informed persons that the king was seen yesterday at gabrielle s house is totally without foundation   15.438787629545448
so make the best of it   14.770801110435153
and gaspard caderousse unable to appear abroad in his pristine splendor had given up any further participation in the pomps and vanities both for himself and wife although a bitter feeling of envious discontent filled his mind as the sound of mirth and merry music from the joyous revellers reached even the miserable hostelry to which he still clung more for the shelter than the profit it afforded   12.939911346682315
whole days have i passed in these titanic efforts considering my labor well repaid if by night time i had contrived to carry away a square inch of this hard bound cement changed by ages into a substance unyielding as the stones themselves   13.470224358667679
he had made some difficulties about going under pretext that he still suffered from his wound but d artagnan had said to him remain if you like my dear monsieur mouston but i warn you that paris will be burnt down to night   11.140824003939253
tell me his name   9.005787578920227
the noise came nearer and nearer   11.041891342762897
but during the last two or three days i have obtained proof to the contrary for which i thank god for it would have cost me very dear to think she had forgotten me   12.798812326729587
positively these four men must be on my side   17.2014164905002
no count he replied i am the only victim in this case   14.630120633777063
the day before franz had been presented to madame de saint méran who had left her bed to receive him but had been obliged to return to it immediately after   10.899759078241159
you thought yourselves alone and talked about that tragical death and the fatality you mentioned then is the same which has caused the murder of valentine   8.13146861242825
well monsieur le comte said the duchess smiling does one leave so solemnly his old friends   16.248758273008857
you should give the father a hint you are so intimate with the family   8.933189527361538
my lord said la ramee now we are quite at our ease and enjoying ourselves pray tell me one of those forty ways invented by your highness   16.12906349168903
chevalier said d artagnan laughing you could eat a piece of mouston couldn t you especially after two or three days of fasting   11.837695832385911
i don t even know their names   12.574062577689574
you were speaking of the champs élysées just now worthy foster father   15.298665960252706
i can well believe that so learned a person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being tormented with the company of one as ignorant and uninformed as myself   8.725297039920441
very good said the count   12.971523236804853
and do you command nothing in your own name   15.289810122561931
give it to me then   17.152367993924898
monsieur porthos du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds   14.509443310492022
a woman of intrigue who wanted to keep up against me the spirit of cabal she had raised against m   18.94903662594374
athos waved his hand he dared not trust himself to speak and raoul went away his head uncovered   12.334263103463705
it was illuminated by lamps with ground glass shades which gave only a feeble light as if out of consideration for the envoy s weak sight   16.51973610338176
i would wish to know if the misfortunes which have happened to you misfortunes entirely beyond your control and which in no degree diminish my regard for you i would wish to know if they have not in some measure contributed to render you a stranger to the world in which your fortune and your name entitle you to make a conspicuous figure   7.468567317620199
at the same time the door opened   9.838106804276006
and who found this father for you   15.219289505291703
why that which dantès left at porto ferrajo   14.075652612990414
said he to caderousse   10.59850316685041
well that is perfectly right   13.577965628622026
your majesty probably refers to god said m   12.543188976325816
that we are not able to say   17.437539729246005
emmanuel and reciprocally as they say at the polytechnic school   10.18726409529303
said chatillon   12.778425033930848
the guards asked permission of la ramee who gave it to them but not till the evening however   6.761049147575772
my good fellow you must have lost your senses to think it possible i could act with such cold blooded policy   10.217386458863073
but at the moment he opened his mouth d artagnan who had heard all precipitated himself over the threshold of the door   12.084560796170312
is my mother ill   16.26297081253332
anne frowned slightly when mazarin in taking leave kissed her hand   9.030629298591881
but you can easily conceive that surrounded as i am by influences i can only muzzle by discretion i desire your presence in paris to be unknown   10.950537527045698
good quite right   11.846817675108989
you are the child of my captivity   14.16725138994065
said the king i should not have been rescued   6.328904900673125
valentine with a color still heightened by emotion entered the room just after her parents had quitted it   13.35140935888911
d artagnan at once comprehended that this was his recompense   11.958507660566392
said the swiss who was chatting with the four friends when the letter came   13.79004356975677
an instant after they were on the deck   18.922731075175236
la ramee made one movement in order to satisfy his conscience   12.538986989548961
he told us that the army was disbanded and that he should return by châteauroux clermont ferrand le puy and nîmes   6.809627405590371
said d artagnan raising his sword   20.011729832103846
i know father you are the most honorable man i have ever known   13.331730498345575
albert went to his room and dressed with unusual care   9.644653112754419
besides the eyes of the gascons have as it is asserted like those of cats the faculty of seeing in the dark   11.030761867900095
since i have this i will keep it   6.070933611835834
then he said aloud you met him i dare say in the park hunting perhaps   6.935693238366418
i have no time to see them   11.435417851446445
the rochellais then had no hope but in buckingham   12.95950899703798
men fear him and spare him   10.945069072533604
thou good mousqueton   20.861877333651996
come said d artagnan let us go   10.945626655306782
who does not love you   10.761533548745007
well grandpapa said valentine kneeling before him and pointing to maximilian i love him and will be only his   14.212539144478779
pistoles have no name young man and that ring has a terrible one which may betray him who wears it   7.76968947032981
off civita vecchia we lost our brave captain leclere   16.14769655898526
la ramee cast an inquiring look around him and observing the same signs of antipathy between the prisoner and his guardian he smiled in token of his inward satisfaction   14.943551223534227
when he saw franz the servant came up to him   16.679754407807504
the young girl rose instantly but the man lay on the earth struggling in the agonies of death   8.568527730896687
i am pleased sir to hear that   18.3707794715293
de tréville s clock three quarters of an hour but i thought as it was yet only twenty five minutes past nine it was not too late to wait upon you   13.838220591500754
he struggled to conceal his emotion and bowed to franz   14.333467160055742
another way of getting hanged   11.410807168240929
yes assuredly replied the minister   16.137919083910624
do you see said caderousse all my happiness is marred by one thought   13.817996959255721
monte cristo took the delicate hand of the young girl in his and was about to raise it to his lips when the simple child of nature hastily withdrew it and presented her cheek   12.151276554747987
to porthos and aramis to accompany their friend whom they are not willing to abandon in such a painful condition   14.247194741762268
nothing my dear replied the unhappy man the tears starting to his eyes at this simple question nothing only i want it   15.330043739809438
continued the mercer with a trifling alteration in his voice so trifling indeed that d artagnan did not perceive it any more than he had the momentary shade which an instant before had darkened the countenance of the worthy man   10.825921678455874
finish then what you were about to say   14.438233581541182
monsieur de chevreuse had not been appointed governor of a province and if the queen should consent to be godmother it could be only of her grandson or granddaughter   13.674132685538023
we have never had the happiness of pressing his hand continued maximilian   11.16317960865519
enlighten me and i will then communicate my information to her   12.231276042429467
caderousse entered hastily   17.394497637261555
porthos take yours from your holsters   9.28667983662996
i wished to leave you still to enjoy some moments of sleep my child   15.03138561054612
return at five o clock and i will tell you   9.811485004946096
we have been in this place nearly eighty three hours   7.8861688048695395
in the space of five minutes the monk turned around to ascertain whether he was followed or not   9.134108546817092
his cheeks and temples became purple as though he was struck with epilepsy   10.935185015157437
and you really understand none of these signals   11.57155455504382
a carriage awaited him at the door   14.517353320360632
how do you know that   13.69250361109848
and will your grace sign that order without remorse   10.387302587318397
franz had been to announce the ceremony and madame de villefort had also written to beg the count to excuse her not inviting him   11.260017273444827
why did he not tell them his name   14.787893828696939
and like every other reflection passing in a mind that entertained none but noble thoughts this feeling was expressed in his eyes   11.38992900858964
you would call acting generously knowing your conspiracy and not informing against you that is what i should call becoming your accomplice   12.939947617968377
but in all probability i should have performed so important so necessary a duty as that of making myself acquainted with the wonders and beauties of your justly celebrated capital had i known any person who would have introduced me into the fashionable world but unfortunately i possessed no acquaintance there and of necessity was compelled to abandon the idea   13.425254770204369
will not the count of monte cristo be here tonight   9.782923923345681
go go i implore you and return hereafter   12.929319905147286
why you know my dear fellow when one has been accustomed to malibran and sontag such singers as these don t make the same impression on you they perhaps do on others   5.798554395297668
i shall return to the catalans   8.47040709822469
but at the name of milady his hand trembled so that he was obliged to put the glass on the ground again for fear of spilling the contents   12.494354721095648
you must do so   11.473174695651245
but he met here m   11.054499742831073
in one fashion or another you have a terrible enemy on your hands   15.553581866473415
or having delivered you make you sign a flaming parchment surrendering your soul to him as esau did his birth right   13.188803338050738
this time you shall not escape me   14.138825711024607
the report of firearms was heard near the rue saint denis and occasionally church bells began to ring indiscriminately and at the caprice of the populace   13.234440448479686
said milady lifting hers to her mouth do as i do   12.43661131260062
let us rather kill them   10.630118115800167
d artagnan pouted out his lower lip in a most extraordinary manner   12.17438103037069
it is not fernand mondego s treachery towards ali pasha which induces me so readily to excuse you but the treachery of the fisherman fernand towards you and the almost unheard of miseries which were its consequences   15.84055291776243
oh no was the tranquil response   10.985920465944137
i ridiculous   13.668212019141713
asked the host quite cheerful again   10.784055902090174
asked the queen almost timidly   12.899927134590213
whenever you please replied the abbé   14.102493609036154
an enemy who has insulted me so cruelly that between him and me it is war to the death   13.357585332755212
from that moment she watched all his actions all his words from the simplest glance of his eyes to his gestures even to a breath that could be interpreted as a sigh   16.33025521988885
come dress yourselves gentlemen dress yourselves   8.651980479104596
de morcerf into the drawing room said he to baptistin while he led the beautiful greek girl to a private staircase   11.474035292688107
but will that not excite suspicion sir   14.030976365955908
the day had been burning hot   12.29274132248628
that s no doubt very fine said porthos   17.087585145706573
no i have good luck that is all   14.822842479043416
at st   4.581695042896574
but go on signing said monte cristo   9.998562501258924
it is fair to assume that dantès was on board a smuggler   7.115658976959118
still argued caderousse i would give a great deal if nothing of the kind had happened   13.88416154366733
in this case milady would cross the garden and gain the village on foot   14.808786786356112
the mob had insulted him on account of the ostentatious luxury of his wife whose house was hung with red velvet edged with gold fringe   10.776986150138615
then he came to the corridor all the doors of which he found open   12.849385669173117
repeated by the shrill voices of a thousand vendors two or three stars began to burn among the crowd   12.173274481397822
and i again repeat you shall not commit suicide   11.608408200013592
under his assumed name in order that he might be appointed to the post he subsequently held   9.547376391407184
cried the cardinal and welcome your friend too   8.312372572651114
and knowing all that your honor remained here far from the city tranquil and inactive   11.502460562102723
till we meet again my forgetful charmer   11.923364155649496
stephen and who would not have taken the trouble had i not been told that when you travel much it is necessary   11.188620565400033
and as at this moment the orchestra gave the signal for the waltz albert put his arm round the waist of the countess and disappeared with her in the whirl of dancers   14.736827678769153
it is the usual block answered the man in the mask   13.645932509512285
and when he had bound the scarf around his waist and when his hat placed coquettishly on one side let fall on his shoulder a stream of ribbons franz was forced to confess that costume has much to do with the physical superiority we accord to certain nations   13.098479678025793
and that you may be quite sure i am not mistaken this time listen well to what i am going to say m   9.45749479290323
on one s death bed the crimes of others appear very small in comparison with one s own said the executioner   14.474301442356872
that cousin of aramis that marie michon that needlewoman notwithstanding her low condition had acquaintances in the highest rank   6.758434528932014
no the order is imperative   18.74310809120719
we arrived four or five days ago from the vendomois as you know and we are going to give mazarin something to do   7.540338121954015
as we have already said milady was admirably acquainted with this part of france   13.275424872425413
this is the mystery said danglars   13.079489769745038
replied mercédès with a mournful smile   10.83994477334189
besides he is an englishman   13.592638150591283
a duel in which i hope you will take your part   10.488531427581098
well then i don t know   15.017055681573527
he perceived château renaud and debray who had just gained the good graces of a sergeant at arms and who had persuaded the latter to let them stand before instead of behind him as they ought to have done   14.129315000447361
condescend to listen to me and you shall know all   9.12994296898001
cromwell is stout and short and this man thin and lanky rather tall than otherwise   13.958356969950634
the grooms polished their arms   18.942735697061085
the interview   12.12394272892989
i look upon this restitution as a weight thrown into the scale to balance the evil i have wrought   9.189728625595226
i would triumph over her and supplant my rival   8.797921134462076
i am john francis de winter   12.14728272910155
sometimes a chief is wanted but when a chief presents himself he rarely has to wait long for a band of followers   17.743469017428964
the notary looked at the count with astonishment   7.067338272270408
does he not dislike the idea of marrying the granddaughter of a jacobin   8.710373872947073
i shall be in the lobby when this note is delivered to you   11.637100030631656
he had now leisure to look to his wound   8.606396660261634
bear witness that we have done all that we could   10.20216811370558
but there is one thing i wish to know   10.945263331534152
it might be so under the bourbons but at present it has always been so my dear morrel since the reign of louis xiv   16.036367995716375
with a single glance villefort s eye ran through the room   11.400567278449918
this is simple enough said the count   8.180453774307857
you say you fear nothing but death   12.189595908212885
while you sacrificing the baron would still remain the millionaire   16.8530611891084
cried milady suffocated by terror her hair loosening itself and rising above her livid countenance as if alive   9.417264886243952
the sweat streamed down his marble forehead and his hand under his coat tore his breast   12.292797138991926
in the first place you will sup with me will you not   17.447117712555226
yes among your friends of other times   15.318837653796892
porthos seemed to breathe more freely   16.258982867897778
i am giving them the slip said eugénie   11.161694849376508
all around him were lying the palikares writhing in convulsive agonies while two or three who were only slightly wounded were trying to escape by springing from the windows   11.81411196860311
he seated himself upon a log of wood   7.479344959307599
he fancied himself a burden to the society forgetting in his perfectly juvenile good faith that he had fed this society for a month   11.468020213067444
in march there was a question about a grant to a railway   10.59378634606875
he has not been unreasonably exacting it seems to me   11.348811280267114
i had no intention of fighting to day sir   14.067521984426145
but in that like all the rest misfortune pursued me   8.997326281062689
de tréville feigning the most profound astonishment   12.911294310280642
athos looked at his watch   7.655238488823711
and why presently   8.178099232862747
and embracing his father and nodding to caderousse he left the apartment   16.450467530391226
and now it s all over everything is all right again   14.25263680065992
look at m   11.260525169498383
but notwithstanding this request notwithstanding the tone of anguish in which it was uttered the door remained closed   13.47555043288051
i suspected it   12.281989488131018
if you do not receive it in ten days you can leave   7.984278958968038
yes yes madame   16.740482403335193
tis well said the abbé convinced by his manner and tone that caderousse spoke the truth   11.357387382701672
martin and the fort of la prée   7.926646552115721
it was that another partook of his punishment that another partook of his anguish that another was to die before him   11.743322256063074

demanded villefort turning over a pile of papers containing information relative to the prisoner that a police agent had given to him on his entry and that already in an hour s time had swelled to voluminous proportions thanks to the corrupt espionage of which the accused is always made the victim   12.442180458435304
the floor of the abbé s cell was paved and it had been by raising one of the stones in the most obscure corner that faria had been able to commence the laborious task of which dantès had witnessed the completion   12.744045207429895
then i have leave   8.980117262907164
the turks used to be so picturesque with their long and flowing robes but are they not now hideous with their blue frocks buttoned up to the chin and their red caps which make them look like a bottle of wine with a red seal   12.807623519431388
you know the history of the pasha of yanina do you not   10.174125384294692
if i should follow the two fugitives to the end of their journey   12.276201922315398
said monte cristo with well feigned interest   14.241082081455927
faria with an air of triumph offered the paper to dantès who this time read the following words traced with an ink of a reddish color resembling rust this 25th day of april 1498 be   7.734185819184305

you have no idea my dear fellow how one acquires bad habits in these cursed convents or what evil ways all these men of the church have with whom i am obliged to live   12.413322318638166

he was evidently suffering the tortures of the damned   7.409298225537665
how did you know about it   8.257229861737631
beauchamp for instance   13.650781213273078
it is an old man s caprice   12.86911294175106
then he added aloud yes sir i am hungry very hungry   9.387487411269403
covered with flames assunta rushed wildly to the door but it was fastened   12.69102681839586
but suppose i should happen to be brought in contact even four times a year with such intelligence and devotedness why i should be a ruined man   15.284691130053169
oh said he is it you captain   11.588546031890695
0111m the boat continued her voyage   8.552188539805815
as the door opened the sound of a guzla reached the ears of the young men but was almost immediately lost for the rapid closing of the door merely allowed one rich swell of harmony to enter   12.09302989422169
i shall be expecting you and if you fail to come i shall think for how do i know to the contrary   16.779164247719756

on the third the cabbage began to droop and turn yellow   17.57960078633093
she noticed that the young man did not say my father   10.414985231877314
then seeing that the musketeers had cleared the quai from the pont neuf to the quai saint michael he raised his sword for them to double their speed   12.84231749190044
a feeling of faintness came over villefort   14.023904988957998
asked mousqueton with a serene and glowing countenance   14.621918141314255
the bitter cup of adversity has been drained by me to the very dregs and i feel that the grave is not far distant   10.372264768728039

well excellency said the landlord triumphantly and without waiting for franz to question him i feared yesterday when i would not promise you anything that you were too late there is not a single carriage to be had that is for the three last days yes returned franz for the very three days it is most needed   12.75909084027277
the old man s eyes sparkled and the good doctor understood that he wished to behold his child   9.58505120290116
shake hands i crave your friendship   12.98848187239725
come said danglars you appear to me a good sort of fellow and hang me i should like to help you but yes said caderousse but how   14.774789657236731
now can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could possibly have had in the destruction of that letter   15.720464705893885
yes cried morrel make haste   12.271326272827665
and he drew nearer to her   12.003209040923016
the queen read it recognized the writing and since there were no details in it of what had occurred asked for particulars   19.368580497681783
cried mademoiselle d armilly whose pity returned as her fears diminished   12.662940174479102
however it does not signify   9.99631422836963
quite alone   9.627606720159584
but perhaps i may be more honorable in my shame than you under your pompous coverings   10.635258348032625
ah my heart clung to the count when he mentioned the dear spoil found beneath the flowers   13.816421167100703
the rest of the start will rejoin us later   16.679417877221866
why the devil have they any stairs with such windows   12.718179113843672
it was a new face   10.581608212506847
but fernand was mistaken   13.322162026533896
he looked expressively at the newspaper i had been reading   12.337769722610771
and when they had arrived at a distance of a hundred steps from it monsieur d arminges took his usual precautions and sent on in advance the count s two grooms   8.75670323682574
in that case he must either have paid his debts a russian do that   9.177814233352958
no said fernand   12.59409820256141
after which he smiled and turned towards the young man in question   9.505972111179378
monsieur cried dantès i can tell by your voice you are touched with pity   12.457573785354782
indeed said julie might we not almost fancy emmanuel that those people so rich so happy but yesterday had forgotten in their prosperity that an evil genius like the wicked fairies in perrault s stories who present themselves unbidden at a wedding or baptism hovered over them and appeared all at once to revenge himself for their fatal neglect   8.533251152780668
and you have me my lord   13.157139228330124
villefort s first impression was favorable   7.43829428204407
but let us talk of this plot m   5.085922958700849
de villefort a true parisian considered the cemetery of père lachaise alone worthy of receiving the mortal remains of a parisian family   15.341609136748598
the prisoner glanced at the windows they were grated   13.428467050566608
before his departure the count went to haydée s apartments told her his intention and resigned everything to her care   10.537125963663154
the lungs are attacked my friend   14.692089557143975
twenty men   10.722227460615679
the queen will only be the more grateful to you as she knows your antipathy for that amusement   10.285964843398986
morrel evidently discomposed came to meet monte cristo less with the intention of receiving him than to exclude his entry   9.797087393643968
at these words it was still possible to observe in monte cristo the concentrated look changing color and slight trembling of the eyelid that show emotion   13.170306291600525
well then said the gascon take care of yourself for i am not a bad hand at the rapier   12.140757341426134
her friendship was a fatal sign which called down persecution   11.143938642802311
d artagnan came as usual he should be immediately admitted   7.335469390666404
he will ask you what you want and you will answer by these two words tours and bruxelles   15.31110039886752
at the first words of the count de guiche the prince having in mind the direction whence came the sound of cannon had understood everything   19.387528141317855
but this expression was fleeting as the reflection of lightning   10.645047805016402
terror had had such an effect upon the poor girl that she had never ceased walking from paris till she reached burgundy her native place   12.454530548415354
but suppose we all go said d artagnan   11.240279533572945
you came seeking me to make to me certain proposals but did you make them   7.5118191781366885
he feels the wound though he can not recollect when he received it   20.14008891237048
and we are pursuing the duke with the very horses he has just left   12.839754490023653
begone begone   12.069222251296848
i will hasten replied franz   14.869799885175924
a lost and adored son   6.445336426277336
dantès approached the upper rock which now without any support leaned towards the sea   10.785898634614176
said aramis but you forget the officer   10.423236604178186
and what does it concern then my captivity   8.420634298416232
on the contrary olivain is to stay and i am to go   8.421869806754522
confide in me   11.038978976769238
but he was no longer there having withdrawn on the previous evening to la bassee misled by false intelligence of the enemy s movements   4.957364062340217
you promised to bestow on me the friendly affection of a brother   17.8761372252934
the musketeer thinking that his lieutenant had just arrested some prince in disguise bowed and drawing his sword signified that he was ready   13.74447668508581
by degrees the enchantress had clothed herself with that magic adornment which she assumed and threw aside at will   6.8861019123190905
he was going to his banker   15.153875813334988
a noise was heard like that the instrument of death would make if moved upon the block   9.102148439052463
tell her grace replied athos that the viscount has just mounted his horse to proceed to the hotel de luynes   7.691117632121285
how much do you suppose he possesses   14.716729962855554
you said anne de bueil did you not   13.048867150263312
se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani alla sette il conte alberto avrà cessato di vivere   6.011714863340857
it is a style of language i never heard in the house of my parents or in that of my first husband   11.789475730255027
you ll see that that queer fellow will be a sheriff before i shall be a captain   12.179447445570752
a practice he has carried on for six years on the steps of st   10.373007920453354
beauchamp albert was wrong i acknowledge to betray so much anger and i come on my own account to apologize for him   11.521032367051037
is it so   14.097179632380014
monsieur d artagnan will enjoy our conversation better   10.90461193119071
the young girl smiled   12.644705955206726
that contemptible mazarin has stopped poor scarron s pension   11.246851469924318
and so they descended the private stair mazarin leaning on the arm of d artagnan a hand the musketeer felt trembling   8.171068849172645
cavalcanti looked at danglars with a stupefied air and the latter making an effort arose and stepped between the two young men   14.205349470943112
let him know   13.250811647582562
i had well concerted my plans pursued aramis   12.960380931271471
there was a moment s silence and then was heard the crackling of burning flesh of which the peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even behind the wall where dantès was listening in horror   9.420811330423636
is monsieur d artagnan there   12.634972353592557
porthos sighed   10.615172887050573
i love to see you thus   11.259120413835376
bertuccio glanced through the door which was ajar   7.846526570808799
but how can you continue to receive us   10.368595772249526
but this time d artagnan was better informed than she was   13.3955431818137
continued milady in the tone of a woman accusing herself of a crime   14.633381921329038
0207m it does   9.408986834596488
as for the cellar i have searched every part and poor stuff i found   12.750248765515297
all his furniture consisted of a bed a chair a table a pail and a jug   14.067223578948902
the noise became louder   15.44420963124987
no for porthos will pay you   9.407211681284412
is so loyal that he does not suspect treason   11.114671675254645
asked she   17.995669110731484
the gale had given way   17.73381236394455
you understand no more delay   11.527236722661177
tell me of those men said the abbé and remember too he added in an almost menacing tone you have promised to tell me everything   11.55166488868772
they ask for broussel and are only too happy if you release him to them to live under your government   12.875196461953239
0239m it is time now to proceed to the last part of the speculation   15.662347554495975
de villefort s garden   11.453975692879437
i think the arm will make up for the sword   10.596982969954144
valentine rang the bell and ordered the servant to tell monsieur or madame de villefort that they were requested to come to m   8.76306325922
i want to know the route i am to follow said d artagnan   9.805651928857955
i now see my error i acted like a madman in coming in here   8.74614092270323
you have one at heart aramis one deeper and more painful a wound made by a woman   13.328180429373571
he could not detach his eyes from that disordered bed and the pale corpse of the young girl who was lying on it   9.423804488644418
let us leave these facts alone and reason coolly   13.138579840826392
you who never interest yourself in politics   15.60700663384387
go on go on sir replied the king   8.622049743496008
at all events answered d artagnan with a smile almost as crafty as the cardinal s they beat them when they draw their swords   8.50716952163275
he forgot the necessary slowness of navigation   15.573414148073962
come murmured athos if she is not proud of him she must be hard to please   7.832055865728997
de la trémouille who had nothing to do with the matter with the loss of his hôtel   11.53180864101607
but that has passed away as suddenly as it came and is forgotten   13.910838158845399
into these pavilions he admitted the elect and there says marco polo gave them to eat a certain herb which transported them to paradise in the midst of ever blooming shrubs ever ripe fruit and ever lovely virgins   9.260254339469673
the carriage stopped near the meta sudans   16.426222296720887
and stay close to me he added in a low tone   10.863889437581696
as to that no replied athos laughing   7.786269104179501
and with a light step an eye on the watch observing the movements of the enemy and taking advantage of the accidents of the ground d artagnan succeeded in reaching the second soldier   16.854145431995804
the whole accompanied by cries that were never heard in any other part of the world   11.037798631886663
did you not see his face   11.948959050688366
and now said the youths we have done all we can for you   11.137034947090427
the jailer saw by his tone he would be happy to die   11.753046448163357
had it been possible to save you i should have considered it another proof of god s mercy and i would again have endeavored to restore you i swear by my father s tomb   9.855967451984261
i had fixed the embarkation for the twenty fourth   12.413242551134653
i have drawn nine hundred thousand francs you therefore still owe me five millions and a hundred thousand francs   15.231228753550631
the deputy procureur was therefore the first magistrate of marseilles when one morning his door opened and m   15.766303155882168
oh no replied aramis i should much prefer blaisois   12.602952543532686
mouston breathed a sigh   13.776552773308694
villefort was about to retire but m   14.899025963907716
and when he saw his adversary pretty well fatigued with a vigorous side thrust sent his sword flying   8.774460660476231
porthos bowed to the cardinal   13.845456660848587
an ironical smile curled the lip of eugénie   7.874582841735851
one would have said that his gaze could pierce the branches of trees which limited his horizon   12.22239708380263
his leg was inert and he could no longer make use of one arm   7.7758840189933975
to this athos replied quietly we also have money left for i have not yet drunk all my share of the diamond and porthos and aramis have not eaten all theirs   8.8305749014315
i will strangle him and upon my honor if that is made a condition i will return to prison   11.338640482400589
for they walked without either guide or escort and on arriving at the barricades had nothing to do but to speak to those who guarded them who instantly let them pass with evident deference due probably to their high birth   10.439073323651236
i thought you somewhat corsican a great deal smuggler and an excellent steward   12.689603364814078
two men to the astonishment of d artagnan appeared shortly   12.021975616963783
the past the count departed with a sad heart from the house in which he had left mercédès probably never to behold her again   9.306125494435667
scarcely longer than eight or ten days   13.480302525799804
am i to accompany you your excellency   10.16956540381383
thanks for those sweet words   8.872008902686618
as i said monsieur lubin did not know me and told me our adventure from one end to the other   16.069849496502343
well what has this bandit to do with the order i have given the coachman to leave the city by the porta del popolo and to re enter by the porta san giovanni   8.195159268661468
and then our gascon with that large quantity of conceit which we know he possessed compared himself with de wardes and asked himself why after all he should not be beloved for himself   10.076716517976115

porthos observed a last struggle between love and avarice   16.65105405147538
but they who so assiduously try to buy things cheap ought to permit others to seek more generous friends   10.424450411207191
we thought it dead   12.527307261540326
take care my worthy host said albert better is a sure enemy to well   16.62105390966614
understanding however that in the present state of things the laugh would decidedly be against him he turned from the door towards which he had been directing his steps and again confronted the banker   12.357440220759239
speak then i am all attention   11.137414742458686
this threat brought no reply   12.257318976116164
and d artagnan threw the bag upon the table   11.766010347048432
i am going to prove to you that i have not   11.439030513821939

well asked the president what do you say to this letter general   11.156233895164746
the ceremony which was just concluded had not appeared more sorrowful than did that which was about to begin   8.427864879824682
grimaud put his basket on the ground and sat down with a shake of the head   11.695763267775872
the king s musketeers are arrested by the guards of the cardinal are they   13.02152324218051
i know not who can have uttered the cry said the king but the noise is easily understood   12.73654532569897
certainly there are people whom i love   10.213525476236057
give me then that letter madame   13.479893999519344
you accept this young lady as your interpreter m   13.713141555656907

ali was his principal attendant during this nocturnal survey   12.115291345073485
since you are here it is well   12.479533186691397
if by artifice by entreaty by accident in short if by any means i can delay this marriage will you wait   8.019132796016386
but what sort of madness was it   10.82488184600252
and he held out his hand to julie who gave him hers carried away by the look and accent of the count   9.316987052008471
athos went down and returned immediately   9.739819948149275

from eight in the evening until six in the morning come in by the window   12.17249191493349
at length he one day received a letter stating that the abductors of his son now offered to restore him or at least to give notice where he might be found on condition of receiving a large sum of money by way of ransom   15.519659076351598
good bye then   12.171415116515687

in the interim it pleased providence to cause the apprehension of caderousse who was discovered in some distant country and brought back to france where he made a full confession refusing to make the fact of his wife s having suggested and arranged the murder any excuse for his own guilt   9.822101255456921
it appeared to her that the sounds spread to a distance beneath the vaulted roofs and carried with them a magic charm to soften the hearts of her jailers   12.320254577430234
one hardly a young man   14.61774337294315
eugénie concealed louise in an angle of the gateway so that if the porter chanced to awake he might see but one person   17.650770636222177
you are a wonderful man my dear count said aramis   11.782915940368794

come do not affect indifference but confess you were pleased to have it   14.460326061627626
the gendarme smiled   10.834980491423343
he then rolled them separately and put them in a hat which he handed to mordaunt   3.0867600247613307
yes but let us understand each other returned athos seriously   13.214474105583538
no not at all   12.430654572098451
at the same moment a fearful hurrah   10.138955585119145
teresa followed him with her eyes into the darkness as long as she could and when he had quite disappeared she went into the house with a sigh   14.843019108525048
or to speak in plain terms do you really think that what you do deserves being called anything   10.223572927653288
it is really as if i were prescribing for you   7.471500670579779
the tumult at length became so great that the cardinal fancied there must be some riot and sent la houdinière his captain of the guards to inquire what was going on   16.489542986591736
i see you at last   14.894330596551846
this is how you have lived during the last four nights valentine said the count   10.012867963076399
for i put it in execution that very minute   9.885119012588952
never sir replied the jailer never   6.517604987613916
not a bad idea   8.300008561029243
the clock of the invalides struck a quarter to twelve   9.443764908360823
i have related it but once and that was to the abbé busoni   10.839804008600506
i offered you your liberty continued the minister   13.460837595021225
the two friends began to dance around the venerable st   9.206670617245656
thank you morrel   18.12944688917231
if the king appeared to be the first gentleman of his kingdom the queen was without doubt the most beautiful woman in france   11.053569229952284
a knife was plunged up to the hilt in rita s left breast   13.174194624853767
coquenard knit his eyebrows because there were too many good things   13.391670723507032
i should bombard the troops till not one grain of gunpowder was unexploded   7.283088329637047
my study   9.91747308687875
so that when you went on board the pharaon everybody could see that you held a letter in your hand   9.18751575534086
and since you know it there is no occasion to tell you that gascons are not very patient so that when they have begged to be excused once were it even for a folly they are convinced that they have done already at least as much again as they ought to have done   9.782939198817644
oh nothing   10.935027254757276
that is not a family name   14.845838158906364
i will apprise my mother of my intention and return to you   11.64450508826214
dantès perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father responded by a look of grateful pleasure   17.382745651209387
can he have guessed my errand   18.80475795336845
he did not see a fissure without introducing the blade of his hunting sword into it or a projecting point on which he did not lean and press in the hopes it would give way   13.442897984439211
unlock the door antoine   13.136443893132935
gentlemen in the name of heaven   8.845189865700913
and he drew out the handkerchief   10.514823025735678
a poet is as good as an abbé   9.789359852075037
now you know nothing is more disagreeable than being disturbed when one is at breakfast   12.599125496451506
it was his father   12.629399790585035
but i think it would be still better said aramis to inform the queen and lord de winter at the same time   12.284523725540199
one day when he had an appointment with a duchess he endeavored even to borrow it of athos   13.687834568466632
it was the cannon which announced the closing of the port   13.95916731281356
and why then have they not laid hands on him   11.637683148333716
conspiracy danglars followed edmond and mercédès with his eyes until the two lovers disappeared behind one of the angles of fort saint nicolas   9.919918104867179
cried danglars   9.731409871216488
and because i am only twenty   11.330820297434602
so i should suppose by her dress   10.5843755412478
why do you wish to know   7.145378433506579
that is the cause for which she was branded   13.692602567299627
at first indeed they were doubtful whether the king s visit to the parliament had been in order to lighten or increase their burdens   10.575965578467608
had a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of dantès or hell opened its yawning gulf before him he could not have been more completely transfixed with horror than he was at the sound of these unexpected words   5.403754100457098
50   14.101532288280149
then he opened the door bowed and went out before the young man stupefied by his letter had ventured to address a word to him   13.479364493227187
madame danglars blushed in spite of all her efforts   11.793515720770396
but really we have talked long enough of money count we are like two stockbrokers   16.365744090185014
well my dear father in the shipwreck of life for life is an eternal shipwreck of our hopes i cast into the sea my useless encumbrance that is all and i remain with my own will disposed to live perfectly alone and consequently perfectly free   11.807591564149522
and you shall have it   14.476476770225176
yes but understand me   15.085356106366326
put it up again my friend said d artagnan   10.421560587117979
de tréville grasped the situation   8.266486680275001
look here   8.433467133701933
and aramis contended that a master should never attend to anything but the civilities paid to him   12.71975043146984
take them to yonder shed my friend said aramis pointing to a low building on the plain   13.736588967150045
bonacieux having left his house at seven o clock in the evening to go to the louvre never appeared again in the rue des fossoyeurs   12.73165076100023
but it appears that is not possible   12.875706306641735
here are our three leaves of absence which came from monsieur de tréville and here are three hundred pistoles which came from i don t know where   14.781140467659926
here are two hundred pistoles which you can dispose of as you wish and return to me when opportunity occurs   17.894220307574948
albert albert said madame de morcerf in a tone of mild reproof what are you saying   13.67379245853311
dantès waited only to get breath and then dived in order to avoid being seen   15.490954061629443
the doctors open the body and say with an air of profound learning the subject has died of a tumor on the liver or of typhoid fever   10.293881392907704
porthos went away after having appointed a meeting with the procurator s wife in the cloister of st   11.390293208105566
d artagnan shows himself as athos and porthos had foreseen at the expiration of a half hour d artagnan returned   13.984341738695047
having reached the summit of a rock he saw a thousand feet beneath him his companions whom jacopo had rejoined and who were all busy preparing the repast which edmond s skill as a marksman had augmented with a capital dish   14.724984681493565
as i told you everything can be attained porthos women and doors by proceeding with gentleness   12.443152131890969
d artagnan therefore returned to the rue férou   10.687740650548598
athos did not leave his chamber   10.207027729233857
i am a soldier madame and fulfill the orders i have received   10.673740390875375
ah yes it was just after this that you spoiled everything   10.695912983683439
may i ask what that was   11.683341342652813
a hundred leagues   16.485366569427544
do not give yourself the trouble my lord said d artagnan with his right foot forward his beaver in his hand a smile on his face we have followed your eminence step by step and here we are   11.926603944868596
a good mother can not depart without her son   9.034448911214362
the third attack now that this treasure which had so long been the object of the abbé s meditations could insure the future happiness of him whom faria really loved as a son it had doubled its value in his eyes and every day he expatiated on the amount explaining to dantès all the good which with thirteen or fourteen millions of francs a man could do in these days to his friends   12.304218788570054
is m   10.318848159608397
i have an order to give you   12.711991848872426
that is well understood   12.500585414830647
what musketeers are now within the palace   15.730553736363644
has he not seen monsieur d artagnan at my house   14.962745129996804
king s musketeers said athos more and more convinced that he who interrogated them had the right to do so   10.084717134194467
the prisoner was led away   7.306132468924544
he turned and saw julie   11.1869668884362
that evening milady was still more impatient than on the preceding evening   13.1989873088417
50275m oh thank me again   14.427920278594842
bernouin shut the door and went away   11.140707909907988
the will chapter 60   11.014491754948166
and after her came madame de villefort   15.824640122596705
you smile   9.898483375767174
come in your excellency said vampa   12.426955531493531
but my orders   7.932732275257343
the interests of the french crown endangered at this moment are to discountenance rebellion in a neighboring nation   10.540596285890336
observe this is one of her peculiarities to get rid thus after one fashion or another of all the people who bother her   2.29959629594328
then by degrees the reality broke upon me full of chaste terrors   14.737193429454152
franz and albert bowed   10.269789547819705
very little without you mother   14.51493574663643
d artagnan did not know where he was and wished himself a hundred feet underground   9.640112762618138
bonacieux blushed   12.346369286223352
here s an envious fellow making himself boozy on wine when he ought to be nursing his wrath and here is a fool who sees the woman he loves stolen from under his nose and takes on like a big baby   14.905315329765479
the other three were occupied in opening an enormous flagon of collicure wine   12.20897124006041
yes yes said the king caressing it with his hand yes my arthur thou art a fond and faithful creature   7.905585176904736
i do not recollect now all the various subjects of which we discoursed madame continued the count with perfect calmness   14.12560778495337
but i must see him instantly   9.33270069124388
the stone had been brought with the evident intention of barricading the road but some one having perceived the obstacle had partially turned it aside   12.445612674382241
40074m haydée looked up abruptly as if the sonorous tones of monte cristo s voice had awakened her from a dream   8.534878995142902
where shall we lodge this new guest in our great capital   6.817431247396218
and the young lady s eyes swam with tears   10.650093801175004
the instant the letter was written carlini seized it and hastened to the plain to find a messenger   11.684928496718015
true said beauchamp   10.995889205794812
nothing shall be done without the full approbation of albert de morcerf   11.444553743094197
well since we must part said the count holding out a hand to each of the young men allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey   10.047172806994631
so that if one of us had the misfortune to lose her treasure the other would still have hers left   11.016195923607725
morrel back   13.669309091255888
he is an excellent fellow and we must not leave him   13.14416735813028
i say so and i repeat it for the third time   9.861250233709306
that you had been thrown alive from the top of the château d if and that the cry you uttered as you dashed upon the rocks first revealed to your jailers that they were your murderers   10.20310823033864
but why not porthos   10.137741180432577
fifty pistoles at most   6.677475427044486
yes you have guessed rightly morrel said the count that is what i intended   13.398510574273487
this very much astonished the sailors although not one opposed it   19.812459716607698
i come for your commands my lord he said   18.56729105711297
pray do people get into a passion at random at noisy   12.535950442808604
asked d avrigny fixing his penetrating gaze on noirtier   13.57907093055055
then all at once starting she cried my god   7.953473070863497
the dog sprang and in spite of the height jumped lightly over it   10.611039326089214
he said to the prisoner   11.15954757511248
i hope at the same time to procure you amusement and glory gentlemen said athos   10.622488298393618
it is a resolution which my father has taken and i know he never alters his mind   15.026233485749044
is there a house in the neighborhood   8.295292878310969
i need you no longer   16.69762737325963
i invent nothing madame   12.49956617915602
what promise of future reward have you made me for all the submission and obedience i have evinced   4.465214891880027
we were too devoted servants to refuse him a request of that sort   19.146516895595983
like myself he laid an emphasis on these words an ancient musketeer of the company of tréville   12.301043075126499
there are no bandits cried debray   3.843994342887779
afterward mme   16.77661571246952
fine looking men upon my word   9.880417202141349
i am waiting until you send him to speak at the luxembourg to laugh at my ease   9.995293239914263
the host was at his door and everything was prepared bed bandages and lint   12.785792477648105
as for the ink said faria i told you how i managed to obtain that and i only just make it from time to time as i require it   11.259133865816738
since there is no harm said athos in my knowing that d artagnan is here i presume there will be none in his knowing that i am here   18.948861777314598
what grottos   11.233713823333204
where your life was spared   15.104744483438175
what has he to say   6.782428957063969
that you had taken the place of another prisoner   15.015911472035356
true said andrea   12.586287468685573
parry odious as was this sight to him sought for those among some eight or ten workmen who were making the most noise   8.187010490171334
you have paid two louis in advance   6.097138643359479
you asked for candor and you have it   12.52166336191273
athos said a word to one of the vergers who bowed and proceeded toward the basement   11.772383455362984
i foresaw that and have embraced them both from you and myself   10.288587855847815
i am ready said he   10.885545909180948
the duke however overcame all difficulties with a word his majesty s order   11.363214464040182
i made myself some excellent ones which would be universally preferred to all others if once known   18.085330860629874
at once if you please   12.347304574950076
it was the signal of a visit   7.523523469344268
and if that were the case it would be worth while to make some sacrifice   12.857571463794319
grimaud was reluctant to leave the man alone and yet he perceived the necessity of starting at once to bear these tidings to the comte de la fere   12.401685287429347

besides has she not yes sir said the major she has 30127m paid the last debt of nature   10.853765707099916
the towers though solid and as if built yesterday were open and broken   14.043387776711722
debray who was slightly disturbed at this visit recovered himself when he saw the calmness of the baroness and took up a book marked by a mother of pearl knife inlaid with gold   16.403979061134933
you will then come on saturday   17.34772394762505

grimaud nodded the third time   10.630662706156118
these words were followed by a general murmur and it was evident that several of the members were discussing the propriety of making the general repent of his rashness   14.989509728558723
sir replied the host we will do all in our power to procure you one this is all i can say   17.68904080957342

don t let that disturb you   11.447295825927075
this manœuvre was incomprehensible to dantès   9.349310500839398
except that which i ask of you dear love   13.394990949592767
because that young man so handsome so elegant so polished is a child i have adopted and who does not even know who was his father   12.891362724816252
and how do you know there is a young woman whom i love and that i believed that woman dead   14.89926345128362
his calm noble gaze forced the man to turn away his head   12.171351814505957
now as i have never known any sinbad with the exception of the one celebrated in the thousand and one nights well it is one of his descendants and a great friend of mine   15.701255222145365
albert felt his heart bursting at these particulars but gratitude mingled with his sorrow he would gladly have embraced those who had given his father this proof of esteem at a moment when his honor was so powerfully attacked   9.841825277667695
bertuccio sprang out and offered his shoulder to the count who this time leaned upon it as he descended the three steps of the carriage   11.711361173022318

d artagnan without losing sight of the lady of the red cushion continued to watch the proceedings of porthos which amused him greatly   17.355313084979393
no replied noirtier eagerly   15.75693907308726

alas said monte cristo it is the infirmity of our nature always to believe ourselves much more unhappy than those who groan by our sides   12.298272057547258

what has put this into your head   10.036789805775076
at the same time four of the band who were concealed on the banks of the almo surrounded the carriage   13.83924163999018
i do not suppose you will have the presumption to set it to rights that would be to accuse her majesty queen anne of falsehood   9.492827112135426
at least according to pistache   8.733840693787087
finally at lilliers i lost all trace of her   13.109126030857908
the newly introduced personage followed bonacieux impatiently with his eyes till he had gone out   9.838719880897827
you will be lost said the curate shaking his head sorrowfully   10.57067229516778
well beneath this uniform beats one of the bravest and noblest hearts in the whole army   8.76102779475276
replied d artagnan bursting into a laugh   10.32897225891885
yes and a fine opportunity you have chosen   13.160883689337197
have you seen madame de chevreuse   11.854393647376513
then one of the panes became quite opaque as if a sheet of paper were stuck on the outside then the square cracked without falling   11.918536518948988
deceived by this intelligence he had concentrated his forces between vieille chapelle and la venthie   15.071993930281128

he rose to conceal his emotion and took a turn around the smoky tavern where all the languages of the known world were jumbled in a lingua franca   10.839051756678844
asked andrea with some uneasiness   11.265072740769561

this is a magnificent emerald and the largest i have ever seen said château renaud although my mother has some remarkable family jewels   11.34655463775213
danglars was tired and sleepy   15.358770394648324
and as to aramis to tell you the truth i have never been seriously uneasy on his account   18.780721348978165
well louis said anne why do you not kiss me   13.941761929467036
do you hear anything   11.697769395796348
20227m what time is it now   14.692212835674225
the interests of the prince de conti or of the ducs de beaufort de bouillon and d elbeuf and of the coadjutor are herein consulted   16.354448374625726
mousqueton ran thither hearing the noise   9.24159059123025
eugénie she said to herself is lost and so are we   18.768912106223688
but there should be at the end of one s devotion something to gain   10.074104690720798
aramis appeared to make a strong inward effort like a man who in the full relation of a falsehood finds himself stopped by some unforeseen obstacle   11.433451837269658
well but we should be taken out of prison   15.8124278459649
but the presence of this woman did not prevent milady from thinking   15.077209345748901
20222m it was   9.33864816769277
after a wild youth he had retired into a convent there to expiate at least for some time the follies of adolescence   10.24655912585349
monte cristo gently smiled and said i was there   9.500950619973558
bonacieux moved by a double sentiment love and curiosity   13.67178060446536
thou man of noble heart   12.006568973567823
i have lost all that bound me to life death smiles and invites me to repose   12.68936520855337
the other three exclaimed   9.448222577058747
have i any need to tell you so   10.151698945469937
come come what then   13.140607804080558
d artagnan quietly pushed him in again and by the light of a lamp on the staircase made him ascend the steps backward one by one keeping his eyes all the time on mordaunt s hands who however knowing that it was useless attempted no resistance   14.689739678842944
you see that everything is to our advantage   6.546619712657405
de tréville did not return went away very uneasy as to what was going to happen   8.792932869630832
that dear friend is because nobody is more worthy than yourself   13.301448067287422
the extreme beauty of the countenance that shone forth in loveliness that mocked the vain attempts of dress to augment it was peculiarly and purely grecian   9.54860192566517
indeed monseigneur responded the mercer i have heard her pronounce all those names   5.542582953746338
constance   9.516835733609337
i quit the world   10.999709695688464
said the governor   14.439908354298275
he opened his eyes and looked through the window expecting to find himself in the midst of some town or at least village   10.688514744543491
he would have inquired after them of their mistresses but he was neither acquainted with porthos s nor aramis s and as to athos he had none   8.568807196750623
be of good cheer replied dantès   13.457065442118953
you were going to ask me if the count of monte cristo had arrived or was expected   14.161177912531958
in an hour you shall be obeyed   6.427625821562872
he was a clever man   13.88299051210621
d artagnan said athos gravely i assure you that you do me wrong in dwelling so upon that   16.339101601407418
and you know women don t like to be kept waiting   14.986247881732295
the affair at armentieres whispered d artagnan   10.738509407399677
that is very simple   10.960926737672148
i have finished mine   11.247145289086735
besides his intention was formed to make the brave musketeer all suitable apologies but without meanness or weakness fearing that might result from this duel which generally results from an affair of this kind when a young and vigorous man fights with an adversary who is wounded and weakened if conquered he doubles the triumph of his antagonist   14.657033076031
what nonsense   14.532352327234204
and d artagnan who was very weary bade good night to grimaud and laid himself down in his cloak with naked sword at his side in such a manner that his body barricaded the passage and it should be impossible to enter the room without upsetting him   11.347258585542482
what do you think he is paying his addresses   6.527989385953212
and can not women be dishonored by appearances   13.629186352996527
father replied the child i swear to you that they shall kill me sooner than make me king   6.061622957557539

this same waiting maid seems to have an agreeable style said the messenger carelessly   8.248814656612936
come now what are you telling me   16.345629210029298
here is my passport   13.890508573345768
i gave her a few lines for the director of the valle theatre who is under some obligation to me   11.673627655013908
neither is it my intention monsieur for this time i was seeking you   12.995203600524677
but at two o clock she had not returned   10.344934790566274
father you know very well that the general was not a man to drown himself in despair and people do not bathe in the seine in the month of january   13.766787732309174
te deums were chanted in camp and afterward throughout france   15.059556605294071
she calculated that the repose of a few hours would not only refresh her head and her ideas but still further her complexion   11.215571072726242
is there any difficulty in the way   12.653073848972065
if that be the case said d artagnan they are doubtless transporting her from one prison to another   11.667169950671243
stuff and nonsense   10.697977971702263
do not speak thus for your reply evinces neither logic nor philosophy   17.961876059396555
that is it is it not monseigneur and i shall have nothing else to do   13.230685860250468
this dinner consisted of meats nicely dressed choice wines and superb fruit   8.436160580640852
very   11.507838870774055
i have always said to you i love you as a brother   12.358780603796832
now then let us calculate how much we posses in all   8.332018407220158
richelieu slowly tore the paper which d artagnan had generously relinquished   10.552197366298874
d artagnan himself was frightened by the change in her countenance   8.359154337533795
then turning to aramis aramis he said break your sword   10.412005864367604
but i was impatiently waiting for your arrival that i might send for your father   9.103819002953886

danglars his intention of only staying a year in paris during which time he proposed to spend six millions   10.845779362088063
albert had left the count to speak to his mother danglars to converse with young cavalcanti   9.235325613935213
and i too edmond oh   12.810865762535203
there is to be war in flanders   7.70918995144959
but who who   12.48995654172066
through the grating however dantès saw they were passing through the rue caisserie and by the rue saint laurent and the rue taramis to the quay   11.804986659693645
it appeared to him as if there was something supernaturally gloomy and terrible in the expression which gleamed from the brilliant eyes of haydée at this moment   7.960579147889759
that is to say he was there replied planchet   19.667295245773055
26 a cruel operation which consists in cuffing a comrade who may have fallen into disgrace not with an old shoe but with an iron heeled one   12.78242797312982
but the man instead of dissolving like a shadow again approached her and said in an agitated voice now you may drink   17.21141910883558
there do you hear   13.88077731138742
and shall we take no notice of this incident   12.026404782774907
replied morrel with another struggle which like the first failed in releasing him from the count s iron grasp   11.823066196287002
he is   8.474480297330622
then without asking permission of anyone he proceeded in all the wilfulness of a spoiled child unaccustomed to restrain either whims or caprices to pull the corks out of all the bottles   13.317577830526464
every drawer and closet in the house had been forced open and the money stolen   7.23522167153739
and by whom was he arrested   7.26838200598835
i tell you marquis my fortune is made if i only reach the tuileries the first for the king will not forget the service i do him   7.838768882478276
for god s sake tell me did you know this englishman   12.480930068926174
it was dark and silent as the tomb   11.52092414925456
i do not allude to you my boy   11.65242738686354
shut up there   10.574722149298331
you would not then prefer a method resumed d artagnan which would equally avenge you while rendering the combat useless   10.82872143978342
my dear bazin you ought to perceive said d artagnan from the place in which you find me that i am greatly changed in everything   15.655389852442294
the major will bring his son with him this evening the contino as we say in italy   12.825923548903459
he held a book in his hand   7.720428602969626
what your majesty is pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity is simply owing to chance and i have profited by that chance like a good and devoted servant that s all   18.164355247313154
this was the more easy for our three companions in particular   13.934698278479615
cucumetto stopped at last and pointed to two persons grouped at the foot of a tree   11.98618031445693
there what do you think now of the affair   13.089201084188472
they were indispensable   11.331119192003936
tell it to me   8.143033658078267
the notary who was at the door immediately entered   11.60365034834612
she had formerly been suspected of an intimacy of too tender a nature with coligny who for her sake had been killed in a duel in the place royale by the duc de guise   9.694083282752906
sir said d artagnan you will go and release your companion who is guarding the coachman   12.709814425981971
i recognize him   8.551951544550164
on the contrary sir on the contrary said louis xviii   12.191461396852848
he cried as they descended   19.344797616824245
indeed indeed i did not   12.364812165306459
come planchet let us pay a visit to the king s treasurer and then set off   12.393483225953343
but address yourself to the keeper of the seals   9.501025876560199
that just shows the meanness of this slander   13.233977607033381
well morrel let us both examine the depths of your heart   11.950388300254511
they all went out and on the stairs met madame morrel who had been afraid to go up into the study   12.707545437053454
but that is of no consequence i can take one of monsieur de tréville s   10.266559787131172
unfortunately madame answered villefort the strong arm of the law is not called upon to interfere until the evil has taken place   11.38910330629195
for i had seen you aramis with the king and you count i knew would be under the scaffold and for that reason i forgive you he added offering athos his hand for you must have suffered much   12.334866741973599
does his island produce him such a revenue   8.818142365068924

and how shall i know whether your excellency has succeeded or not   10.987152683694253
a tall dark man with black mustaches dark eyes and the air of a gentleman   14.423027571615222
but in what force was the enemy   10.70943142404604
ah madame he said why did you not make that request of me   9.038219104211816
gondy who began to feel uneasy examined the tapestry with his eyes touched the coat of mail which he wore under his long gown and felt from time to time to see if the handle of a good spanish dagger which was hidden under his cloak was well within reach   14.80483817164621
the procureur without going to see either his wife or his daughter went at once to his study and offering the young man a chair m   10.884483436265402
a simple plume of violet feathers adorned his hat   6.90632749186182
yes in a single day he had accomplished what his more serious minded companion would have taken weeks to effect   11.09626041573004
sleep as soundly as you can tonight and tomorrow if you can we will take our departure together   14.23278668158779
i beseech you   14.142927355897413
debray perhaps as it was once proposed   16.858100208067466
by the way planchet i think you are right with respect to our host and that he is decidedly a frightfully low wretch   13.605205496364128
be ready then at the first signal   8.57476074506171
yes when the house where he fraternizes is suspected   13.446601310448452
and the crew   10.775095134215663
jesu   10.997878242323978
no not me but a young corsican my companion   13.284428908944808
try again whispered the count who depended on the secret spring which was unknown to the picklock clever as he might be try again you have a few minutes work there   11.57031340638808
i have no influence with any one   9.65314691131864
chapter 107   6.5406616633235375
if you know no more than that everyone here is as well informed as yourself   14.820577933462888
he had entered the service of porthos upon condition that he should only be clothed and lodged though in a handsome manner   11.128497171932345
not even to your mistress   11.76084404253478
how go then   10.405158092442269
a great prince said aramis with whom mazarin sought an alliance was invited by him to send him a list of the conditions on which he would do him the honor to negotiate with him   9.98929074652238
yes i have seen him but i don t know what he calls himself   9.369497258130934
all that could be required of me   15.236000394448322
in a moment the whole party was assembled   9.794417681626411
we shall get out into the gallery you have described   18.365268514971063
no but reasonably hideous   4.48061394767241
he went into her room and has not been downstairs since   9.148588499157398
but he had not time to address any question to him a cry of admiration burst from every mouth   12.925641159576992
porthos did not feel the ridicule of this and took it for a piece of simplicity at which he laughed in his large mustache   14.250842205987402
what granted me   10.502525496443534
what made you choose a house at the gates of paris m   14.68180370042326
hold your tongue replied aramis   18.99229386477513
a thunder of applause saluted its appearance   12.449704164230521
it was the governor who returned followed by the doctor and other attendants   14.015191879387372
de villefort who examined him attentively and who no doubt practiced upon him all the psychological studies he was accustomed to use in vain endeavored to make him lower his eyes notwithstanding the depth and profundity of his gaze   20.175531295185138
they only conversed in a low voice looking around attentively to see that no one overheard them   15.89129742466967
this room was occupied by dantès father   10.917381531327297
pray sir said villefort with marked uneasiness do not disturb yourself   13.84256346399077
who was he   16.204665918877588
yes his mother   8.132649703545676
now to horse that i may see you depart   11.996575310999848
the young girl much astonished raised her head to look at him but his face was so gloomy and terrible that her words froze to her lips   13.48347962038207
the two lower rooms consisted of a dining room with a table chairs and side board of walnut and a wainscoted parlor without ornaments carpet or timepiece   12.270977214698798
now if you have them   16.19349981614792
he insisted on being introduced saying that although he was not a deputy from monsieur de conti or monsieur de beaufort or monsieur de bouillon or monsieur d elbeuf or the coadjutor or madame de longueville or broussel or the parliament and although he had come on his own private account he nevertheless had things to say to her majesty of the utmost importance   11.005630734294517
at this moment olivain appeared   12.819845509617881
but as planchet said people do not eat at once for all time even when they eat a good deal   12.09843280295498
the man in the mantle quitted the wall and advanced into the middle of the street   8.47494738917881
or tomorrow   6.027433149038632
agreed as to the old burgundy   10.064937341755687
oh never fear   12.62559121856381
his voice was still youthful as if belonging to a hercules of twenty five and his magnificent teeth which he had preserved white and sound gave an indescribable charm to his smile   11.49733024336775
hold athos said aramis perhaps there is yet time   10.787016955192836
the distance was short and at the end of ten minutes his carriage or rather the count s stopped before the hôtel de londres   7.71060073277755
faith i would give a good deal if she is young and pretty   15.801110104119676
ecco   9.808732646202845
he related to athos all that had passed except the letter to m   12.163284852756686
yes said d artagnan athos is right it must be burned   9.14010669234324
eh pardieu   11.697747425801085
we beg them to take one step backward and to transport themselves the morning of that day of great catastrophes into the showy gilded salon we have before shown them and which was the pride of its owner baron danglars   12.952268528438509
they led me away masked   16.417149726343894
recall the scene for the words you thought were only given to silence and solitude fell into my ears   9.790815835761382
the tall man had scarcely read these lines seen the signature and recognized the seal when he bowed to denote that he had no longer any objection to make and that he was ready to obey   8.306752672129559
this is not my weakness i tell you at once   19.80035986939193
still there have been men who suffered more than you   6.547801442359878
said the swiss if she is as great a lady as her writing is large you are a lucky fellow gomrade   11.308288812851135
on the contrary gentlemen we would assist you if it were necessary   15.358899626961179
tomorrow is the twenty third and buckingham sets sail tomorrow with his fleet   12.75778235606649
a third the illustrious mazarin stealing the portfolio of prime minister from monsieur de chavigny who had expected to have it   14.333564601353958
inquired the captain of the patrol   10.856809586638171
i will down with mazarin in french in good french my lord take care of your accent   12.806774941865285
well what do you want   12.780520735011246
never did funeral knell never did alarm bell produce a greater effect on the hearer   11.15400693756724
ah that is where the art comes in   12.346838863899986
caderousse awed by the superior power of the abbé sat down and wrote sir the man whom you are receiving at your house and to whom you intend to marry your daughter is a felon who escaped with me from confinement at toulon   7.623430994748199
there is the impression made by my shoulders on the wall   10.683154055535857
come he said stretching out his hand to d artagnan come don t be sullen my dear son for i have said all this to you if not in the tone at least with the feelings of a father   8.652379795260153
inquired athos of the youth   9.214871165442297
20169m behind the penitents came a man of vast stature and proportions   13.415590697601056
why what nonsense are you telling us   18.841951869965825
besides the ordinary cicerone who seizes upon you directly you set foot in your hotel and never quits you while you remain in the city there is also a special cicerone belonging to each monument nay almost to each part of a monument   17.706224816526905
the antechamber was full of police agents and gendarmes in the midst of whom carefully watched but calm and smiling stood the prisoner   15.029003373412925
you know what athos told you the other day   11.195429152592935
replied d artagnan straining both at the same time his quick ear and his intelligent glance it is the murmur of the populace in revolution   10.954035592198737
and with this conclusion a way peculiar to himself he rose and left the room   17.049554930508847
i am not like you viscount   11.915085338467499
richelieu remained standing leaning against the mantelpiece   12.885239767840568
she burst into a forced and melancholy laugh her arms stiffened and twisted her head fell back on her chair and she remained motionless   13.69644757524066
this is the kind of difficulty which i wished to represent to you my dear count   11.89738201136559
then when it was ended as if he had met with a bitter disappointment he asked have you nothing else to say to me by the living voice laporte   13.880593339177635
interrupted d artagnan   8.738714573878923
my dear sir the government is rich and does not want your treasures replied the inspector   9.49745305518593
i shall only reply to you when you have satisfied me of your right to question me   10.867444838071034
i i own that when my mind returns to that terrible period i have no recollection of anything but the rigid corpse of poor madame bonancieux   11.040653131525199
three times i presented myself to ask his support and three times he ordered his servants to turn me away   12.597455238906937
he was perhaps about to regain his liberty   12.199720231238071
asked the young man with glistening eye   15.53221939275635
madame madame   12.254019519989273
it is not true said milady in a tone of voice so firm and with a countenance so unchanged that if d artagnan had not been in such perfect possession of the fact he would have doubted   10.416385404171395
why did not the countess the proud mercédès the disdainful catalane who will scarcely open her lips to her oldest acquaintances take your arm lead you into the garden into the private walks and remain there for half an hour   15.094529336602307
during the darkness as before my supper was brought   12.558632128532288
d artagnan received the compliments of those who were present in his own way and whilst the conversation became general he looked earnestly at athos   11.951683678817695
i did go there   9.176409497267267
he took his seat amongst them   16.211609230659313
it s tiresome work to keep awake a whole night   10.417440111265188
we need not say that a smile of condescension was stamped upon his lips   12.125509378398506
well i was very near being hung by mazarin and that made me more popular than ever   11.488593275219625
pardon me count pardon me   13.26138916118014
but your future career d artagnan your ambition porthos   14.686502613158043
i staked grimaud the silent grimaud divided into ten portions   12.117055860936894
cried athos be men   11.223921330496932
he raised himself to glance in the direction which they pointed out saw the monk and fell back upon the litter his face illumined by joy   13.859099372108767
come don t look so angry and you shall have 4 000 francs of the money to do what you like with and eugénie shall have 2 000   12.39756161869491
a sort of smile was discernible on the motionless lips of noirtier   12.33336453397649
never mind where he is let you and i go and see what is to be done for our poor friends   12.643981223724156
i was therefore obliged to give it up as you may imagine but i own i went away with rather a heavy heart for the horse had looked at me affectionately had rubbed his head against me and when i mounted him had pranced in the most delightful way imaginable so that i was altogether fascinated with him   7.245869708382243
she called some of the nuns who against all monastic custom found themselves in the presence of five men   14.440147659787996
and he answered that monsieur bazin went to noisy   9.322670212343038
de monte cristo would lose the opportunity of discovering an enemy whom chance has revealed to him who now sends this warning to the count a warning he might not be able to send another time if this first attempt should fail and another be made   14.595539895074513
but that it may prove laughter worthy even to the end let us not lose time   8.3039877314331
sir replied bazin the true friends of a christian are those who aid him in working out his salvation not those who hinder him in doing so   13.618535232539054
i like him much and it gave me great pleasure to hear that he was about to become the son in law of the marquis and marquise de saint méran   12.024202472343655
a thousand pistoles i said   9.474708075560276
have you noticed the remarkable beauty of the young woman m   19.372069928198762
here said she here is a ring of great value as i have been assured   11.337789718641451
he found tréville in a joyful mood   9.711516356575629
it had been resolved the night before to change their encampment   3.568361167157109
is he not the son of general de quesnel who was created baron d épinay by charles x   11.310497216437831
the answer was so little like the one mercédès desired that she turned away to give vent to a sigh which sounded more like a groan   10.48696617223373
the prince assigned the count de guiche to his father and kept bragelonne near his own person   10.328470107638768
nothing is lost then   13.026716318833172
oh villefort villefort murmured the count this scene must often have haunted thy sleepless hours   13.075551351960293
then you will lie here said d artagnan   16.992487816003234
why replied porthos mouston of course   14.742030778442807
then the young woman confided in him the terrible secret of which chance had already communicated to him a part in front of the samaritaine   11.101601918236845
he got up and knocked on the door   15.400714447746898
you can not but perceive that all this must end some way or other   7.270376907244066
is he then advancing on paris   9.48025872335457
come to us this evening and to morrow we ll return your visit   14.5161910900501
you do not know me yet   13.370790495352297
the first year he offered government a million of francs for his release   14.48309184443413
that worthy prince   14.319831231659071
my faith gentlemen said porthos turning round upon his chair and twisting his mustache that s a fair bet i hope   13.840258699365357
mazarin saw the sign and remained convinced that d artagnan had seen and heard everything   8.981729571489149
i must then place my life my honor my reputation in your hands   11.706996537908244
indeed said maximilian i have often been almost tempted to attribute to him the gift of prophecy   13.947447115655137
it seemed to her that they wanted to revenge the past and not to anticipate the future   9.531818459825015
everything in the apartment gave evidence of a violent and desperate struggle   14.340208137984359
i make you my lieutenant general said the king   17.80394465865304
what monseigneur   8.785167331188797
you would make me weep if such a thing were possible   17.528150938284917
then began his travels his duels his caprices   13.47906065026786
said valentine looking anxiously around   7.8651976358246705
then monsieur de coligny was killed and yes said mazarin but the coadjutor is not yet made cardinal   10.164006503304527
these words were addressed to the countess g who had just arrived and was leaning on the arm of signor torlonia the duke s brother   16.72674885329839
murmured madame danglars choking with fear   7.630006492391456
a cry more prolonged than the others and ending in a series of groans effectually roused me from my drowsy lethargy   7.967558006932757
he pressed the hand of the lord of pierrefonds and went in search of athos   11.177469751512964
it has cost me much trouble to find you but i had resolved on giving them into your hands and if i had to recommence my search it would occupy all the few remaining years of my life   8.060678225156092
the same happened to valentine of whom he was jealous   12.810186145335553
de tréville hastened to report himself at the louvre   13.316933382922812
they know me by heart and are steeled against all my weapons   12.785787574565104
fortunately added he my good friends are down yonder and they will not allow me to be carried away without a struggle   10.39665589682216
nay answered monte cristo with the most gentlemanly air tis not for such trifling sums as these that your banking house is to be incommoded   8.230483660884108
mousqueton therefore was soon provided with tools and he began his task   11.295878802756782
and now we understand each other   7.047283152116595
back already   15.318156249771942
i have even informed him of a circumstance i consider very serious   12.371579456112311
cried eugénie smoothing the scattered curls of her hair which had now quite a masculine appearance   13.694715259950062
d artagnan the elder girded his own sword round his son kissed him tenderly on both cheeks and gave him his benediction   9.87750488045322
the young greek smiled   8.264290764297927
i am a sailor   8.510326058128149
is he at home   17.555785177731174
it is only half past ten o clock come in   13.63529123860386
needless delays but increase the grief of parting said monte cristo and maximilian has doubtless provided himself with everything requisite   7.939436154799421
heavens athos a murder   13.14003366321324
there were seven minutes left that was all   12.56871244282048
haydée said he you well know   12.529723116395107
because he is an enemy   13.90048639737196
andrea to think of marrying   9.123086484860208
to transport me for life how merciful   16.326299545235916
now thinking that her host was a priest that coquette took it into her head that it would be a happy souvenir for her old age among the many happy souvenirs she already possessed if she could win that of having damned an abbé   13.139331055956534
suppose a watchman should pass   9.480572019889989
cried the horsemen rushing on d artagnan with naked swords   8.621251111572867
villefort bowed   12.292506611762619
with the same frankness i accept them   3.2452667745660833
the commissary who had till this time held his head down over his papers looked up to see what sort of person he had to do with   13.685088711974439
he held the knife with which milady had stabbed herself open in his bosom   14.998795222275128
how so planchet   15.142984870867462
what athos   13.525354510393182
and give up your share of the venture said edmond to remain with me   15.610917815391629
i looked into the kitchen once more and saw caderousse sitting by the side of a long table upon one of the low wooden stools which in country places are frequently used instead of chairs   10.157704094702758
the little fellow who arrived last night in a post chaise with his sister and who asked for an apartment with two beds   13.997407762157113
ali turned his intelligent countenance towards the boy on whom he gazed without any apparent emotion   9.974536753815066
the officers table and that of the king were opposite to them   11.192025340947373
then you pity him   12.281383753775303
40120m villefort shrieked clasped his hands and looked at the doctor with a supplicating air   18.564649944590418
come to me   7.634350297456567
and then when bonacieux s cries were no longer audible good   14.086658718953235
but what for the moment engaged my attention most earnestly and i am sure you will understand me d artagnan was the getting from this woman a kind of carte blanche which she had extorted from the cardinal and by means of which she could with impunity get rid of you and perhaps of us   9.558306500423848
the day passed away as rapidly as an hour   9.04036690813367
but grandmamma leave me go   14.711306095725607
at the turning of the first street they would light the lamps as it would be foolish to attract the notice of the police by too many precautions   14.444430491241803
bonacieux pushed a little servants door open by day but generally closed at night   9.415059307988694
tony carries our muskets   15.867562305169645
mousqueton is propped against the door and here s the key   13.199843814995127
monsieur albert appears to me quite innocent of the treason charged against the general   7.866969220730242
but some little red spots on her handkerchief indicated that she had bitten her lips till the blood came   7.719918920269943
bravo d artagnan   13.90593683614254
besides there was one thing that engaged his most anxious thought in what way was the escape to be effected   12.069238547027247
finally the prince led the right wing resting on aunay   15.672802891109356
i neither know nor care   10.826351470547097
monsieur d artagnan is a young man scarcely nineteen or twenty and this gentleman must be thirty at least   12.750244628520226
peter blessed with the fingers   10.892107742624097
i can relate to you day by day your actions from your entrance to the service of the cardinal to this evening   10.833424871853804
my carriage shall take you back   13.393333761395853
ah that is what i do not know   10.296701752636373
it is true said porthos   15.946161258961759
that is different   12.080386173982742
if this man should ever discover the names of the others my master is lost   9.24554660389884
by jove my lord said d artagnan you have well said but these are only words   10.871810599445103
well then you must be registered as charlotte backson   10.61352604059935
the greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised   10.818903237851588
no quarter   16.08035870613158
i do not think it is a moment to give way to useless sorrow   11.424910999731377
when you say invisible interrupted albert it is only to keep up the mystery   20.984744222031516
what a dreadful death what a blow   11.631785382916528
do not notice things which those whose interest it is to see them pass over   9.368974084719309
d artagnan the elder   13.728533818077446
the window turned on its hinges and a man entered   7.240959585560261
he spoke of me to lord de winter already prejudiced against me and told him that his sister in law was a prostitute a branded woman   11.578443667814401
your majesty has treated her with a severity it is thus i will always treat my enemies and yours duke however high they may be placed and whatever peril i may incur in acting severely toward them   11.429310189358024
he cried they must have obtained my arrest   10.40692727212079
but they might be the fruits of a plot   14.282720146875633
and at some moment when nobody is expecting it behold trouble and misery and all sorts of persecutions are heaped on the unfortunate wretches who can not even see whence all their afflictions come   12.448261137435633
my friend urban grandier wasn t a sorcerer he was a learned man   10.732048343209582
it may be observed that at the very moment when thanks to the ray of the sun he perceived the gun barrel he was thinking with astonishment on the forbearance of his eminence with respect to him   6.787043342590651
because my dear fellow you understand one must never be eccentric   15.695425116167174
perfectly said the dragoon   14.031359694097857
ah said beauchamp you doubt me   11.568650789078543
the count bowed again but lower than before   15.039606307449887
well replied mazarin and am i not almost a king king indeed of france   13.039902012132588
the other members silently dispersed   12.933904030147275
for the first time in his life danglars contemplated death with a mixture of dread and desire   11.83906303158891
i would take the hundred pistoles   12.31843197724441
both the heart and the ground absorb that beneficent moisture falling on them and nothing is outwardly apparent   7.5009163769014515
but i suppose you had no tools to aid you   12.990948380933531
sir resumed villefort we are thinking of marrying valentine   10.79688970231973
you will say he calls himself andrea cavalcanti   0.9539345406952169
he has a right to pay the dowry which i shall take with me to some convent   12.702078918463076
and he threw the money into the river   12.931665011845311
i have reached my destination   14.16961515851592
in five minutes bazin made his appearance looking in every direction to see if he were observed but he saw no one   10.37478002437392
a miserable old age awaits you   10.329475225263819
i really did not observe whom i had the honor to receive under my poor roof   10.38908438707352
when you please replied beauchamp   10.20237358620156
come come thought d artagnan emerging from behind the curtain decidedly monsieur planchet is no fool   18.980892675743235
thank you sir but the way by the subterranean passage would take too much time and i have none to lose   12.36024875533644
i confess that unless you deign to give me some proof of what you advance what do you think of this   10.157520345823178
is it for this i name you captain of my musketeers that they should assassinate a man disturb a whole quarter and endeavor to set fire to paris without your saying a word   11.038314014156741
tell it me sir   11.907434586530963
who and what are you   10.89665900602541
but what must i do   10.444210933747929
yes said m   13.76778433804465
and lastly aramis the third to take orders and become an abbé   12.205806446501683
cried olivain reappearing at this accusation   12.423291307285142
indeed m   14.303093803002643
it goes without saying that this impatience to return toward paris had for a cause the danger which mme   13.654961215878426
one instant after the heavy step of a marine who served as sentinel was heard in the corridor his ax in his girdle and his musket on his shoulder   5.9719892344254655
take   16.144273550669944
la carconte went to a cupboard and returned with an old leathern pocket book and a bag   18.17325415523993
no politics caderousse   9.888405525465188
my sister how did your husband die   6.8752968776555115
but on the road an aide de camp from cromwell sent orders that colonel tomlison should conduct him to holdenby castle   12.706300261356153
but d artagnan was at the same time impetuous and curious   18.167945083937084
a whole bottle   8.8033450615461
i have abjured my affections and like all renegades i am of evil omen to those who surround me   10.794553703377995
tell me have you ever thought that seven times 1 700 000 francs make nearly twelve millions   13.451555212864442
soon as the road turned the chateau de la valliere appeared in view   14.61825301242565
the fact was in leaving notre dame the coadjutor had learned the event of the day   13.419688832495929
i am sure i am the first cried morrel   18.05353557718714
exclaimed porthos in dismay   13.624049644358978
porthos ran to him   12.3234210889459
to return instantly to england and to inform him as soon as the duke leaves london   8.778010001063986
mousqueton will lose another that s five   13.048594743828193
we were together a good deal during the carnival at rome   11.48987034761415
their horses flew and they never ceased speaking of athos and aramis   12.664621651192494
then calling planchet he said now my lad you may claim your seven hundred livres but you did not run much risk with such a note as that   15.541957897955392
buckingham at once remembered the circumstance and suspecting that something was going on in france of which it was necessary he should be informed he only took the time to inquire where the messenger was and recognizing from afar the uniform of the guards he put his horse into a gallop and rode straight up to d artagnan   14.788574801612226
bazin beadle at notre dame   15.144588127946072
and both set off towards the capital at full gallop   16.472346030307953
by a murder   11.325212442862204
i declare to my nephew guido spada   11.874808211558213
they have allowed all this time to elapse and then all of a sudden rake up events which have been forgotten to furnish materials for scandal in order to tarnish the lustre of our high position   8.719806126557174
50065m woman siren that you are do you persist in fixing on me that fascinating eye which reminds me that i ought to blush   16.057382779844907
irrevocably   17.1955939935854
shall you be attacked on the road   20.985948746952133
cries of despair resounded on all sides   10.153484742515152
de morcerf these words were accompanied by a most peculiar smile whether you undertake upon my arrival in france to open to me the doors of that fashionable world of which i know no more than a huron or a native of cochin china   7.786904878614053
the four men stood motionless   11.548173609904598
then what may it be   12.09552113085514
you discovered what had become of your mother   11.371092972695436
really you alarm me   8.895169100037286
the duke in order to pass away another quarter of an hour pretended to be reading something that interested him and muttered that he wished they would allow him to finish his chapter   13.603040494096902
should our bark be upset we are five of us good swimmers able enough to turn it over again or if not to hold on by it   13.565901558152078
i stretched out my arms   8.11268124110535
it is a wound that confines him to his bed   13.915612765436878
as for me you must know i can not possibly live out of lucca   12.804434355219291
athos   14.688867401482877
will you remember us to him and ask him to solicit for me the same favor that he will have obtained   9.776131061694905
treat him kindly therefore in the future   10.0811486451125
then his head was seen passing at the back of the boxes and the count knew that the approaching storm was intended to fall on him   16.662127075812887
all s well he cried as he entered   16.18029345106861
the door had been opened and shut again   9.075010489194199
then taking the tablet from the wall he handed it to franz who read as follows the public is informed that on wednesday february 23rd being the first day of the carnival executions will take place in the piazza del popolo by order of the tribunal of the rota of two persons named andrea rondolo and peppino otherwise called rocca priori   14.016612826809567
no noise gave reason to believe that it was inhabited   10.4521878772217
the mêlée became general but strength was on the side of the musketeers   8.706933988939378
he had been obliged to seclude himself more than ever to evade the enormous number of applications presented to him for the purpose of obtaining tickets of admission to the court on the day of trial   10.979868163987547
a wintry blast   6.379846472067185
let us go on to another of his exercises   16.129129829202913
the four friends pleaded an engagement and took leave of m   15.061984048322433
that is true said mordaunt and they will be far from thinking of you   7.253690897293182
madame he said to the duchess i have had the boldness to present myself at your hotel without being known to you   12.778253144761765
for you surely would not wish to compromise one who from this day regards herself as destined honorably and happily to bear your name   19.693553999125136
you are included in the conscription fernand and are only at liberty on sufferance liable at any moment to be called upon to take up arms   10.569833121402056
franz did not doubt that these plans were the same concerning which the count had dropped a few words in the grotto of monte cristo and while the count was speaking the young man watched him closely hoping to read something of his purpose in his face but his countenance was inscrutable especially when as in the present case it was veiled in a sphinx like smile   4.493718433649287
d artagnan colored and grew pale several times in reading this billet   13.054891934173476
it is true murmured the englishman   7.792496020464744
d artagnan who had no settled habits of his own as he came from his province into the midst of a world quite new to him fell easily into the habits of his friends   9.902760623651092
do you know what those three windows were worth   8.53414691456755
it is so long since we were separated that i have not the least remembrance of him and besides you know that in the eyes of the world a large fortune covers all defects   12.926908575823093
the young woman complied   12.180702408734572
very well said the voice   9.62665419544655
she was very beautiful but her usual pallor had increased   15.99242035137597
cried planchet can it be   13.609175566666496
you are wrong then   9.27352054252539
upon being informed that the person who wanted to speak to him came from tours we have seen with what rapidity the young man followed or rather went before bazin   9.81851725372459
yes said he i made a vow to our lady of the grotto not to cut my hair or beard for ten years if i were saved in a moment of danger   13.425456745548555
he came hoping that i would accept my shame as my shame was consummated   15.905664635804222
four men disguised as workmen were to get the king out of prison and take him to greenwich where a vessel was waiting   9.1828811177221
porthos my friend said d artagnan don t distrust providence   9.810523600723347
scratches himself   12.602453729209488
i address myself therefore first to the benevolence of your majesty that i may know what has become of my friends reserving to myself if necessary the right of appealing hereafter to your justice   13.238080923580872
50282m during the perusal of this letter which informed valentine for the first time of the madness of her father and the death of her brother she became pale a heavy sigh escaped from her bosom and tears not the less painful because they were silent ran down her cheeks   15.777346545423747
and which instead of being given as you gave me those poor twelve thousand francs with sour looks and reproaches for my prodigality will be accompanied with acclamations with bravos and with flowers   7.462875320515105
and what was the result of those duels   11.34339552401609
do not be unhappy dear friend on that account   9.10047635288942
has not one of you a cross   3.410861588589759
which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of july replied danglars   12.16762151121667
true but that makes no difference   11.178539354812825
said porthos a broad smile spreading over his honest face   11.804013708050377
yes of you   11.940137720895542
but the glass cutter was a prudent man who had provided for all emergencies   10.00104258708542
well i must confess it does replied d artagnan   18.606653148527684
d artagnan was not one of those foolhardy men who seek a ridiculous death in order that it may be said of them that they did not retreat a single step   13.465483908096344
de villefort who had been the king s attorney at nîmes and afterwards at versailles   15.25477077033899
i had need of distraction   10.680469619504361
the fact is said porthos with an air of finesse i am rather incredulous   12.91493033714309
tis more than possible answered the comte de la fere   12.637909874130797
you are mistaken viscount   15.185497259126844
said bertuccio   12.363042204532942
he said and put it in his pocket   7.261806285756463
the house belongs to him   13.497119516320797
bring hither that horse   9.707541979918515
yes much   20.313570765701314
certainly quite ready   12.090599905841714
grimaud rose   10.380694662484057
i hope it may be so replied caderousse his face flushed with cupidity   4.555359046907773
speak my friend   15.574948680870436
in a very simple manner colonel said d artagnan   12.848186729866379
charles rose and turned toward parry whom he saw pale and with his temples dewed with moisture   13.57943754384243
i accept them at once   12.089375469864105
i said the traveller am called sinbad the sailor   12.082001165015894
yes said danglars while the perspiration started from the roots of his hair   13.313270116344334
yes indeed the marks are recent   11.21292313357682
i don t believe that monsieur de mazarin thinks of cutting off our heads for heads are not taken off without previous trial   8.75578193037769
i merely wish to overtake one of my friends with whom i am going to hunt tomorrow at chapelle en serval   16.588906729106313
the enemy will not rally for fifteen days and until that time i have no need of your service   13.138331966827668
the lion was daunted   11.6675964862023
the concierge closed the door leaving madame danglars in the street   17.32158500602938
i therefore repeat to you i speak not to a magistrate but to a friend   11.467894592296924
now the deliverance of the cardinal would be the ruin of our hopes   10.04079576427791
at a solitary and retired part of the road he drew his sword and required the messenger to deliver up to him the papers of which he was the bearer   14.021329452003734
hasten to monte cristo avail yourself of the fortune for you have indeed suffered long enough   15.442108586604519
while porthos was calling for help with all the power of his strong voice aramis ran to the table to get a glass of water   6.396440422769887
the anger of heaven will not pursue us since you are pure and i am innocent   6.663270078703467
dantès uttered a cry of joy and surprise   11.98552333234635
that she shall not with one blow dishonor her husband and her child   11.197384521848786
haste to him and warn him cried the wounded man if he still lives   10.604744335120007
in the meanwhile as the thing is difficult to find in france and your abbé is not probably disposed to make a journey to paris on my account i must continue to use monsieur planche s anti spasmodics   5.319885970254299
instantly afterward a door opened and a light played upon the staircase   8.303330627348615
de villefort answered nothing but sat or rather threw himself down again upon his chair   6.913527507314613
30111m do you think so   2.9275824719657937
this port wine belongs to the english therefore it belongs to us   11.082693588086713
follow me mr   14.161808971640578
when seven o clock came dantès agony really began   9.133779173758423
as if the same idea had animated these two beings mercédès was doing the same in her apartments that he had just done in his   12.377670978405629
so au revoir dear athos   10.808697723069447
he knew albert had insulted the count dreadfully and that in every country in the world such an insult would lead to a deadly duel   9.639603712987121
if his eminence entertains any suspicion against one of my musketeers said tréville the justice of monsieur the cardinal is so well known that i demand an inquiry   13.370700243696488
drink a glass of port said aramis   12.504115648599573
but the feeling in dauphiné is quite the reverse of that in provence or languedoc   13.469050234940235
surely answered danglars one can not be held responsible for every chance arrow shot into the air   9.816059492217715
monte cristo repeated all the titles he had read on the baron s card   9.783172517492867
but the queen has obtained an order from the king by means of which she has been conveyed to a convent   12.69579238050579
may amount to nearly two mil   19.182505049549597
monsieur is full of generosity said athos   15.153573047963578
he is sure never to leave my service   10.359256212975477
he had been apprised by the groom of the last stage of the count s approach   13.600025104473165
the abbess only crossed herself without approving or disapproving   10.642560754949098
perhaps he will be young strong and enduring like yourself and will aid you in your escape while i have been but a hindrance   11.968655252244178
he answered therefore i think monsieur le comte that you had something to communicate to me at your chateau of bragelonne and that gentleman he pointed to aramis had also something to tell me when i was in his convent   7.857106286099204
that is the sum m   13.725079893530081
yes said athos it reminds me of a family jewel   7.22754758047923
in a court of justice that is called an alibi   7.381164632762752
heaven keep me from jesting with that which is far dearer to me than life itself   12.414598480314414
bazin stretched his arms rubbed his eyes and tried to go to sleep again   17.869366522595627
accepting the hand of the officer she began the descent of the ladder at the foot of which the boat waited   6.2381227045110945
de tréville chapter iii   10.372198581665808
they stopped the horses and cut the escort to pieces whilst i opened the doors of the carriage and monsieur de rochefort jumped out and soon was lost amongst the crowd   19.872707024279126
but the awful murmuring which indicates an angry people continued   13.129937743198608
still higher   11.282963001137063
it must be done in the palace   12.887130872376538
without doubt the rioters are in prison and you come to tell me justice is done   14.90750867128064
here i am said vampa instantly appearing   14.340469499124874
la ramee entered   14.818752702186359
place this man in the care of his guards again and let him wait till i send for him   14.23473726328922
good night friend   9.468780364964484
do you think you have to do with galley slaves or novices in the world   15.392038039886986
oh yes i heard that   10.041103457008003
his footstep was heard one moment in the corridor then the rattling of his carriage wheels as he was driven rapidly away   8.886369272387292
i did not say france my lord   12.350264256661257
let us take ourselves out of the way and leave things for the present to take their course   11.348474778956913
i was going to make you the offer my dear d artagnan giving you all the time necessary for repaying me such a trifle   7.8318515093849035
what is your name then   8.756651550223234
surely that is where you yourselves sleep   8.90037441401612
yes yes i know what you mean the railway of which he has obtained the grant is it not   12.444696084687473
after that she plunged into the cabal headed by the duke of beaufort   14.493109579911625
the jailer stared   12.75199116206678
gervais   12.674374386728012
although warned that the man she had loved so much was in great danger the queen when his death was announced to her would not believe the fact and even imprudently exclaimed it is false   15.895514972741603
but friquet sprang from the entresol on to the top of the carriage   10.40933719968088
athos asked   12.15453062565846
we have no need therefore to say that d artagnan dared not join in the conversation only he looked with all his eyes and listened with all his ears stretching his five senses so as to lose nothing   14.704441885725927
he wished to confess to the officer and upon his refusal uttered such pitiable cries that the officer told him that if he continued to deafen him thus he should put a gag in his mouth   9.945821675921069
and he jumped into the carriage with the alacrity of a man of five and twenty   7.9612699282600845
de villefort had on the right hand madame danglars on his left morrel   12.63190120799153
and is that all is that all   14.548279750287408
i parted from him two years ago at palermo and he was then on the point of setting out for the most remote regions   11.357263550031226
there are the horses   10.286844606659653
for after the death of richelieu everything went on contrary to expectation in the same way as before   9.387286337246467
he resolved to adopt the second and began that day to carry out his resolve   10.885784281576825
said gaetano   12.67792745392334
yes madame replied the magistrate   16.30354431906349
the cardinal envied that composure which he attributed to the habit of meeting danger   15.429571180317287
have you not perceived it   12.725764852301774
he had two double barrelled guns and a rifle   15.050154155553802
with the enemies you have to do with there is no time to be lost   14.104580724230527
did you observe anyone during the first act   10.807709082856434
the corsican ogre at the sight of this agitation louis xviii   10.728906556383473
i said mazarin with his most smiling expression   13.037699420970526
the handkerchief you saw had not been given to me but it had been forgotten and left at my house by one of my friends   13.903534896199798
forgotten he   11.529334118984755
the latter and the coadjutor touched the brush with the tips of their fingers and made the sign of the cross   8.753080490073637
can he give me any particulars   13.465367380016517
no madame they struck me always struck me   15.74392126745189
they were anxious about you here   10.58009328073052
he continued his way toward the quai des grands augustins while the two friends went to ring at the bell of the unfortunate porthos   8.18100542571569
it is the monk whispered porthos to aramis   11.86730033212486
the coadjutor returned to parliament more a monarch than king queen and cardinal all three together   8.639173540182004
in the court of the old chateau of saint germain he entered his coach and reached the seine at chatou   10.769408262954755
and mazarin in requesting the archbishop of paris to make his nephew preach had evidently had the intention of administering to monsieur de retz one of those italian kicks he so much enjoyed giving   7.355275233036624
and if they will consent to go with you to england i will give to each a duchy the day that we reascend the throne besides as much gold as would pave whitehall   13.759514626991784
should he who had so often for mere amusement s sake plunged to the bottom of the sea to fetch up the bright coral branch hesitate to entertain the same project   11.67933723801594
what magistrate would find or even venture to insinuate anything against this   14.288691950001748
he did not wear the uniform cloak which was not obligatory at that epoch of less liberty but more independence but a cerulean blue doublet a little faded and worn and over this a magnificent baldric worked in gold which shone like water ripples in the sun   14.613897527100104
speak monsieur   6.724161459317472
i know an italian prince rich as a gold mine one of the noblest families in tuscany who when his sons married according to his wish gave them millions   12.267370242586008
athos came down last and found d artagnan already on horseback and growing impatient   13.825930964797719
but you i presume have decided to assert your pretensions viva voce   7.154328345989918
porthos who could never see anything that was not self evident talked to him as usual   10.099629403408665
and as he uttered these words of doubt and depression within his mind a voice beside him said respect to fallen majesty   14.734597737741536
ah i know said she lowering her voice and going close to the old man   12.694547091414242
why does he go in secret   10.97371677383974
the coming instant would in all probability decide the rest of his life   8.794080884479207
beauchamp said monte cristo as if this was the first time he had seen the journalist that evening   19.403878976433454
50049m at one time he thought he was saved for he heard the brigadier exclaim in a loud voice to the two gendarmes he is not here   13.628375552083288
said porthos what a fearful day my dear d artagnan   9.25099207305991
when i listen to you existence no longer seems reality but a waking dream   7.525717384990148
now you are exactly what i dreamt you were the man i always loved   14.430594621922623
into the blue drawing room according to your excellency s orders   13.71152622945605
do you love her much   13.712655457992629
let me ask you why you deceived me   11.794128465945642
villefort looked at her with that piercing glance which reads the secrets of the heart   13.651575700630994
it was the last he ever gave me and i feel as if it were still warm on my forehead   14.053675463767746
answered d artagnan you are too good   11.82142074436722
during this short time valentine must have held her breath or moved in some slight degree for the woman disturbed stopped and leaned over the bed in order the better to ascertain whether valentine slept it was madame de villefort   10.801159815457527
but she was greatly embarrassed   10.459562497576549
it was not that the sight of the wretched pony did not excite numerous smiles on the countenances of passers by   12.606456963225614
your milady said he appears to be an infamous creature but not the less you have done wrong to deceive her   11.341359965029941
gervais athos and the napkin which was converted into a banner   18.598775010437762
when i came to myself again i was stretched in the same place   14.559478697215154
by degrees the light of the lamps gradually faded in the hands of the marble statues which held them and the perfumes appeared less powerful to morrel   16.016721418732082
never fear dear friend said porthos   13.817351083250836
the name was not wholly forgotten but mixed up and confused with ancient recollections   12.938716013901303
porthos was discontented with his condition   13.402429894880207
besides nobody came thither but the three musketeers   10.471006692719369
one thing however reassured him   10.006043183326524
give it back to him sir and since you have such a man in your service make him useful   11.67013548698008
yes monseigneur replied the officer   5.709340608643517
then boats filled with armed soldiers will pursue the wretched fugitive   13.24752151985591
i felt some degree of nervousness as i entered upon the history of the diamond but to my inexpressible astonishment he confirmed it in every particular and to my equal surprise he seemed to place entire belief in all i said   11.127499266451043
and it must be so for the abbé knows correctly the amount of all the largest fortunes in europe   15.63525441684531
do you know m   18.68617645870085
he had collected all his resources and fearing lest the report of his distress should get bruited abroad at marseilles when he was known to be reduced to such an extremity he went to the beaucaire fair to sell his wife s and daughter s jewels and a portion of his plate   10.784515404875346
chapter 102   15.505872605920171
inquired albert   10.20996640641809
well the man whom i offer you is a general syndic   15.138426963493472
as the carriage stopped at the door and albert was alighting a man approached and gave him a letter   11.182410006363577
furious at being held in check by one whom he had considered a boy he became warm and began to make mistakes   10.270592815882084
to take mazarin   13.112605426298433
five minutes later he came down the grand staircase   18.075998703046285
in fact the count s face brightened   17.43358452148216
yes that s it no doubt   16.319642994611527
that ring is defiled d artagnan   11.290325135783295
the avenger   13.393331258990177
one of them was a foreigner english i think   11.724056800040357
ali mute and attentive brought the pipes and coffee and disappeared   15.579540528136935
i wish i had never seen you   14.637802749690017
come said he this matter will want a good deal of talking over   10.74963621480838
the duke went from one surprise to another   10.143930363028248
she was not at home   10.456597293424538
no no answered dantès   13.217900738557562
the king too who had listened in the greatest agony now breathed again   8.52808762234178
through the gate was seen kitchen gardens carefully attended to a spacious courtyard in which neighed several horses held by valets in various liveries and a carriage drawn by two horses of the country   12.622123848272839
is the conference ended   10.436337792890441
then add that his grace has in the precipitation with which he quit the isle of ré forgotten and left behind him in his lodging a certain letter from madame de chevreuse which singularly compromises the queen inasmuch as it proves not only that her majesty can love the enemies of the king but that she can conspire with the enemies of france   12.304689546006477
monsieur de beaufort had said that he had forty ways of getting out of prison   11.52697666693618
all day he toiled on untiringly and by the evening he had succeeded in extracting ten handfuls of plaster and fragments of stone   9.035195537523524
where shall we escort him   13.94089755831336
yesterday s affair must have shaken him a little   13.328268544686317
if succor be sent to me i will accept it   15.718513715230092
i mistook him for a monk and revealed it to him in confession   14.767690657517232
but at the first word the young woman started and exclaimed in a sharp bantering tone which sounded strangely in the darkness are you afraid dear monsieur d artagnan   7.964825664101483
wishing to know on what topic the soldiers were conversing he approached with his wonted wolf like step pushed open the door and put his head close to the chink   9.063755802030812
for example supposing it were the daughter of a banker he might take an interest in the house of the father in law of his son   15.657415451861297
noirtier s eye remained fixed and firm as if to imply that a promise did not suffice   19.647106708515423
he drew from his breast the diamond cross and the star of the garter which she had sent him by those generous frenchmen   10.907613609047676
that s exactly the reason i won t go said d artagnan   14.36421668038026
you know the best harbors   12.16347417712787
what did he say   11.544642357040178
like you i hesitated but the count s eloquence decides me   10.930308808130949
a delay would save my honor and consequently my life   15.186810166783436
besides in what manner can i make advances first   12.369109595836967
besides it will be an opportunity for her to wear those beautiful diamonds which you gave her recently on her birthday and with which she has since had no occasion to adorn herself   11.887839437455156
his charities alone amount to 20 000 francs a month   10.398957146527104
they lifted him off at the door of a cabaret left bazin with him who besides in a skirmish was more embarrassing than useful and set forward again in the hope of sleeping at amiens   8.957610416943004
you have no reason to envy him on that score for i owe to you the pleasure of knowing him replied the witty woman with a smile which recalled marie michon to aramis and to athos   12.603078592882628
d artagnan had fallen into an ambush   12.020599086698954
his figure had grown rotund and as it were canonical   8.818135507274514
the sea is the cemetery of the château d if   19.250427029557116
but all things are possible   11.651780051885748
it was only however by means of one of these senses that he could reveal the thoughts and feelings that still occupied his mind and the look by which he gave expression to his inner life was like the distant gleam of a candle which a traveller sees by night across some desert place and knows that a living being dwells beyond the silence and obscurity   10.76383254287145
the queen and the duke   6.824410519687153
he examined attentively the countenance of the applicant for place and fancied that the contracted eyebrows thin lips hooked nose and prominent cheek bones of grimaud were favorable signs   8.49350716946493
and what is that great lord s name   9.170412470527472
everyone knows the history of the famous return from elba a return which was unprecedented in the past and will probably remain without a counterpart in the future   10.164437530760306
a gentleman received from hand to hand money from the king and was not the least in the world humiliated   9.731024929630422
a carriage was to await you at nice   9.610419575608542
it restores the blue color of litmus paper reddened by an acid and it turns syrup of violets green   11.410192869461811
you will bring lights and relieve the sentinel continued felton   16.115064833302107
and d artagnan retired but as he passed out he glanced at the curtain through which the queen had entered and at the bottom of the tapestry he remarked the tip of a velvet slipper   7.305673284057792
you know the environs of paris then   16.55082539959004
we will tell him that we have come as amateurs to see what is going on   11.092482474074158
this child was the only heir to lord de winter if lord de winter did not marry   11.037821125187685
of the war yes but in politics you must know it is not his element   11.926919030064548
he then called for his horses drove to the chamber and inscribed his name to speak against the budget   17.82567100948425
but morrel remained motionless   10.449281127529263
and he lost two hours in his attempts which were at last utterly useless   10.947981821674915
you are gentlemen and i am a poor innkeeper   14.062533068068419
sure of what   10.507181529523878
let me add that i would not for the four thousand piastres at which i had fixed your friend s ransom that this had happened   15.861686805444583
ruined yes that is it   16.899793943415837
she then bowed to m   9.28460103049074
excuse me for speaking so very candidly but as this is intended only for ourselves i do not see why i should weigh my words   7.502551073501001
bah i have passed perhaps ten times through chantilly and out of the ten times i have stopped three or four times at your house at least   13.682466331144525
inquired the countess eagerly   9.495382959187086
come with us said albert   12.827725629953749
of this however be assured that should any favorable opportunity present itself i will not fail to offer you the choice of being present   12.137866603628309
the soldiers were complaisant   11.432114568282003
where did the army cross the lys   10.803758446167777
its purple visage and its violet colored hands showed that it had perished from suffocation but as it was not yet cold i hesitated to throw it into the water that ran at my feet   8.794782241836606
hardly had they put foot on deck ere her head was turned towards hastings where they were to disembark   11.428646206083931
devoted men are so rare tréville by the back staircase   9.453584367948555
if you happen to have any jewels hide them directly   7.669789249795683
his boots were covered with dust and he inquired if he could not instantly cross over to england   13.978543093485793
believe me my lord it will be your best plan   10.127003825747273
i do not know sir   10.791910993749443
then said the count your feeble spirit will not even grant me the trial i request   17.152921384191494
he struggled against his thirst till his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth   12.206928178861085
and milady twisted her arms as if in a paroxysm of grief   4.502315942335188
cries were soon heard and then moans which someone appeared to be endeavoring to stifle   15.769666535154725
one must not dispute matters of taste and colors said rochefort laughing   13.020455550911986
it was about eleven o clock at night   16.812373958487324
but this deception would probably not have stopped our fiery young man if the host had not reflected that the reclamation which his guest made was perfectly just   10.00229619468918
what are your eminence s orders   10.943788509437084
tomorrow said he you will be avenged or i shall be dead   12.687905157021275
and he looked at the young man as if he would read the bottom of his heart   14.832699486410904
it was an old soldier of the guards who could not see his king pass captive before him without rendering him this final homage   10.222315625398716
get them at borel s and be sure you say they are for me   15.028950251663934
we know nothing as yet of the conspiracy monsieur   17.99932833266897
yes there it is   10.763459463038238
today is the 30th of july 1816 why it is but seventeen months   7.273220857340867
50087m but mademoiselle de villefort stammered the nurse   15.919064657342867
i said anything i pleased in order that the solemn declaration i have just made should not be withheld which otherwise would certainly have been the case   13.985076772883104
a point short you know the proverb   15.777452478845726
we are for the king and the princes added athos   16.219816586373973
you sent me a strange madman this morning   9.873671079916559
is it possible that you can see anything more than the merest chance in this meeting   14.29716539958878
his whole body appeared in its ordinary state of calmness only an unusual fire beamed from his eyes like the effects of a fever   12.872132954348887
well said he but you had another subject for your thoughts   14.056759220701933
does the sum you gave for them make the animals less beautiful inquired the count shrugging his shoulders   12.658265188728762
at the first sight of his old friend danglars assumed his majestic air and settled himself in his easy chair   10.26583197166822
i had such a delightful dream   13.198671304215795
it was the first time one of these visions had ever addressed her in a living voice and she was about to utter an exclamation   11.030243410817473
but the duke is our friend   7.30467874217333
the circumstances are grave and it will be necessary to act promptly   9.146685838062357
and as a proof there is a crown to drink my health   11.307008343325187
madame said debray it is nearly six months since we have been associated   15.502891814265046
this was their mutual declaration of love   10.370972942949223
yes yes replied d artagnan   10.424512027282306
inquired valentine much agitated   14.175622521661719
for you without question inflicted four upon the dear gentleman and he is still very weak having lost almost all his blood   10.340673677797186
exactly he is a quaker with the exception of the peculiar dress   9.719593843013879
certainly madame said porthos winking to himself as a gambler does who laughs at the dupe he is about to pluck   14.680085330350552
mousqueton inquired therefore the state of the case of his old friend who confirmed the statement of d artagnan   14.196184290258952
there is something horribly mysterious under all this athos   10.66551129308327
or rather back for the battle seems to be lost by the frondeurs   14.779600091026765
it was grimaud on his way to paris   6.86394576342188
so rich dear sir that your fortune resembles the pyramids   13.270698620320866
i know what i wish to know   9.132629692336764
but tell me what were you thinking about when i came in   10.81836997469727
then running to the door exclaimed help help   12.659911590976963
boisgoli tell noirmont that i have two guests   8.36331764376956
you positively recognize m   11.04984560614887
the world still speaks within you in a loud voice altisimâ voce   12.929108257081703
from this phrase d artagnan awakened planchet the reader must not suppose it was night or that day was hardly come   16.339007077736298
all you have in gold   10.600698068096566
one felt that something unusual and terrible was happening in all the streets now dark as ocean s most unfathomable caves   15.806902515875965
then why did you think of giving your daughter to him   13.205399109232165
you are right said du tremblay   12.549831162002972
it seems to me that we once rendered anne of austria a service not much less than that which to day we are trying to perform for charles i   16.32364221239034
but in the meantime well in the meantime   17.834005790071398
inform him that it is his turn to sign cried danglars to one of the floorkeepers   9.473407028891359
you are edmond dantès cried villefort seizing the count by the wrist   5.752513069466968
it was an embarrassing load for a man seeking to escape   10.424603195057157
is it my fault you have lost 700 000 francs   17.006028093984128
after dinner the play   12.354210385342324
it is quite wonderful said albert   9.255996828995219
he was moistened before and behind with a greasy liquid which the host recognized as his best olive oil   10.397565094654714
a slight moisture on his brow was the only trace of emotion that charles evinced as he learned these tidings   11.188121762830322
one minute said the young man   10.563640201155074
no one suspected i was there   16.813257837549596
i have no doubt of it said d artagnan   8.454987242763886
muttered d artagnan leaning toward aramis and whispering in his ear you have made us swear on the crucifix of a frondeuse   12.885896696676582
i am sure you are   15.467696252976403
do you wish me to lend you some   12.830579475299848
but that ring has been blessed in the chapel of the palais royal so they will never ruin me as they long to do and whilst they shout down with mazarin   11.514330678256117
without reckoning that as the bastion was not built yesterday all the rest of the building was badly shaken   13.203986307412528
the cavalier made a movement as if to follow the carriage   10.346442858228798
i understand that but i do not understand what it is that galvanizes you in this manner   11.167698709153857
badly enough   13.523518187332716
prepare yourself for every emergency   12.551402051124368
the paragraph was correct my friend   15.14553407861366
and a minister   8.132423533753375
the doctor was right   11.029230835444361
he was seeking in his mind then for the least awkward means of retreat when he remarked that aramis had let his handkerchief fall and by mistake no doubt had placed his foot upon it   16.910665604750164
yes the poor man may be expected to leave me a widow any hour continued she throwing a significant glance at porthos   15.329374025708418
on the other hand mazarin present at that audience heard very well what those deputies demanded   10.902754683942248
i did not do it intentionally and not doing it intentionally i said excuse me   10.363771660176361
then here is a handkerchief to wrap them in replied athos drawing from his pocket the one he had steeped in the king s blood   17.136989304193705
a short time since i passed through marseilles and went to see the old place which revived so many painful recollections   11.799029095002892
he felt in the pocket and drew from it a paper   13.812920519568364
marquise marquise   19.1128610763829
you do not deny it   9.14775329289186
before questioning me he said reply to my question   10.591838516925865
and truth obliges us even to confess that his chamber was just above the gutter and below the roof   13.161427998896295
it appeared however to milady that in one of the furtive glances she darted from time to time at the grating of the door she thought she saw the ardent eyes of the young man through the narrow opening   13.753379053825103
danglars stomach felt so empty that it seemed as if it would be impossible ever to fill it again   10.390806492737633
if we resolve on such a step it would be much better to take as i now do this pen dip it into this ink and write with the left hand that the writing may not be recognized the denunciation we propose   6.936544329444012
that is to say that without forfeiting the gratitude of the king he had made a friend of one on whom in case of necessity he might rely   12.113488557406308
one would say you were already in possession of your property   12.185321348823411
i am about to struggle for the last time with them   14.056345420023133
peppino picked up the louis and danglars again prepared to carve the fowl   8.086591067888623
but when i have no more money left to pay you   16.379584818685892
stop a minute   12.34112904421447
no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make his existence blessed   14.0155682580966
wait a week and i myself will give you some   10.2371874795808
after all continued d artagnan there was certainly one with aramis   10.142985545190891
upon my honor and by the holy cross   14.094297636852314
an hour before daybreak cucumetto aroused his men and gave the word to march   14.976595712031667
i have something better than that said monte cristo   14.521749560334008
monte cristo turned to albert   11.997798611842319
returned the turnkey   13.722197548425427
and how old were you at that time   9.180389594618704
if not you were an accomplice   11.569118547040508
his eyes glittered with delight   11.949654031325325
not so fast   18.244411286375197
you will bind yourself cried the king by what monsieur de la trémouille shall say   7.836962610999377
then as if appearing to have formed a resolution she said i have an enemy   11.356058986713235
turning towards athos and his friends gentlemen said he allow me to correct your words if you please   12.981533365634577
in his whole person he bore such an impress of high degree that madame de chevreuse half rose from her seat when she saw him and made him a sign to sit down near her   12.004471276338666
let m   13.44887088671137
at this moment a patrol passed by   11.054855620133624
chapter 109   14.0507595837295
or one of my friends what matters   8.986758717908145
believe me and take comfort this is better for me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds even were they not as problematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the sea which we take for terra firma and which evaporate and vanish as we draw near to them   14.824246336329914
do you accept the commission which i have intrusted to you   11.937903966692913
my god can you not remember her name   9.915968917438821
the queen entered and d artagnan remained at the door   13.955481825914584
you sent him for his education to a college in one of the provinces and now you wish him to complete his education in the parisian world   10.427531939794676
she was stone dead   13.176219106092056
through the darkness franz whose eyes were now more accustomed to it could see the looming shore along which the boat was sailing and then as they rounded a rocky point he saw the fire more brilliant than ever and about it five or six persons seated   15.593682676507143
my husband has given me his word sir said madame de villefort   11.736971386730673
asked lucien   10.104690140909195
the queen and de winter continued to converse for some time in low voices in order that the young princess should not overhear them   17.18464727540077
have you been or are you his mistress   8.595105269857392
cried athos astonished   17.436237497074345
replied signor pastrini with the air of a man perfectly well satisfied with himself   12.184924939055692
i am all attention madame said he   14.751983448994697
d artagnan knelt as well as the rest received his share of the benediction and made the sign of the cross   17.253136948975765
you like m   14.194697511411238
morrel however extended his arm and commanded silence   9.378984822787693
that proves returned the abbé that you are like those of holy writ who having eyes see not and having ears hear not   3.808978486198077
i only as you see have remained poor wretched and forgotten   8.609777318890478
the fact is said d artagnan i have always observed a great degree of intelligence and devotedness in mousqueton   9.129647191319208
yet i repeat to you albert be prudent   12.319985958271847
ah monsieur said planchet on perceiving d artagnan how glad i am to see you   12.79026532634708
athos divided them into three groups assumed the command of one gave the second to aramis and the third to porthos   7.6205765299382335
i see him very often said danglars drawing himself up   10.695726377894838
the man raised his head and the duke was about to utter a cry of surprise   10.93181678303038
let us wait by all means   8.65285900040114
wait for me here all of you   13.810655516073716
hold continued d artagnan turning toward the door which had just opened here is monsieur du vallon who comes with his coat torn   3.2814318279624626
to pluck the clerks a little by teaching them bassette passe dix and lansquenet in their utmost nicety and winning from them by way of fee for the lesson he would give them in an hour their savings of a month all this was enormously delightful to porthos   12.622701531125553
in fact milady still held the harmless weapon in her clenched hand   12.049514291822286
well cried his auditors   16.899983432738907
stop a moment   15.578538938844297
now for the tally ho   7.09163101896871
as for porthos he assaulted the foe with such violence that although his sword was thrust aside the enemy was thrown off his horse and fell about ten steps from it   12.422473265583735
athos upon a horse he owed to a woman aramis on a horse he owed to his mistress porthos on a horse he owed to his procurator s wife and d artagnan on a horse he owed to his good fortune the best mistress possible   17.294431192819477
well said he to morcerf but i think your father will not be the only angry one   13.28289163702481
i speak only of an accident you understand of a mistake but whether accident or mistake the fact is there   6.0332913575303015
does the count know what answer you received   11.634932467321708
he accepts said monte cristo   11.747270422368247
a servant wearing a livery of considerable style and richness appeared at the threshold and placing two cards in the landlord s hands who forthwith presented them to the two young men he said please to deliver these from the count of monte cristo to vicomte albert de morcerf and m   16.38368211259101
the time of the carnival was at hand   10.85458267918017
so that i am really so unhappy that i weep   12.705018409940758
but cried anne of austria tired of these vague attacks but sire you do not tell me all that you have in your heart   13.152821473105082
it struck ten   8.873410051062109
athos said d artagnan i believe that were you to fall in with the devil you would conduct yourself so well that you would take him with you to heaven   10.207938122435294
thus for instance don t you in the first place want a horse   9.859325523388412
you know that the famous waistcoat was found in his house containing the letter which stopped the signature of the marriage contract   13.1343079794689
fernand cried mercédès i believed you were good hearted and i was mistaken   13.196908264205899
this cost me on your account and mine 100 000 francs   10.390786410978343
i accuse no one sir said danglars   10.572848342217998
de villefort had this spade in his hands when he stopped close to the thicket where i was glanced round and began to dig a hole in the earth   15.59067423887921
well and what may you have to say against this name   7.8403456280327655
that renders it useless to get a pleurisy by too much haste   7.296237496965187
it looks very neat on a black coat buttoned up   10.026386805319342
my left side still pains me   14.451876299735437
the prisoner turned pale   10.38914342374717
do you think emmanuel would oblige me   11.356588626753345
balzempleu   6.490173616737108
repeated beauchamp looking with amazement at the count   15.167491419883444
come be candid said the coadjutor you have not all your life followed the trade which you do now   10.441024631159012
de villefort you have promised me have you not   9.261548355396979
return to greenwich and bring them here   16.066295802295564
what would you have me say   18.143807748622045
the queen tendered her hand to lord de winter who kissing it respectfully went out and traversed alone and unconducted those large dark and deserted apartments brushing away tears which blase as he was by fifty years spent as a courtier he could not withhold at the spectacle of royal distress so dignified yet so intense   13.268901833857045
20243m confess you have dreamed this and let us sit down to breakfast continued beauchamp   12.328073542945765
you will go to london continued the cardinal   16.095237320313153
with one word you have crushed it and i die   13.63776749559875
all is lost   12.348829829280184
stop an instant the name seems certainly familiar   12.380961926624275
and the four friends rushed out of the fort gained the field of battle picked up the four muskets of the privates and the half pike of the brigadier and convinced that the fugitives would not stop till they reached the city turned again toward the bastion bearing with them the trophies of their victory   12.688534860070568
i go sir said mordaunt advancing a few steps to the door by which he had entered   9.733322261825453
what a misfortune   21.392320326251614
these four men were therefore all standing at the same time with a menacing aspect opposite to each other   11.406907411670531
the minute hand moved on   10.395906110954616
debray was for a moment surprised but immediately recovering himself he bowed with an air which seemed to say as you please madame   16.072663646147774
beauchamp that you are more sober than he was   11.228945502418615
it was a masonic sign caderousse had taught him   8.965211573919735
to the hotel to be sure to get our baggage and horses   14.051861226238998
this lackey was my compatriot   12.86502180244798
oh yes was the ready answer   11.722248958279728
not yet replied porthos   13.439568242950704
and when the trial is ended there will be no delay in putting the sentence into execution continued d artagnan   10.937799246258681
athos repeated d artagnan s words   7.7582875963194695
finish mouston finish the work   15.302695549223547
what had especially been observed by the two friends was the little interest taken by the court of france in the terrible events which had occurred in england which they thought should have arrested the attention of all europe   9.469372087276177
and i about ten pistoles said aramis   14.666017416886955
milady sprang out of bed   12.315966085266485
ma foi spread that idea replied the count of monte cristo putting his foot on the velvet lined steps of his splendid carriage and that will be worth something to me among the ladies   8.633371420659769
i was passing close to the door of the captain s cabin which was half open and i saw him give the packet and letter to dantès   13.958847969451678
when we can t have one thing we invent another   14.656751843423647
yes my officer   11.203867452269591
it had now become a weary and almost hopeless task and had it not been for the threefold motives of honor friendship and gratitude implanted in their hearts our two travelers would have given up many a time their rides over the sand their interrogatories of the peasantry and their close inspection of faces   6.320422587471393
he kept on his way at the same rate heedless about upsetting those whom he met on the road   9.121805709953415
they sing let them pay the piper   11.265340988548246
and what does he wish   11.322063826311675
no replied dantès   14.103147908437588
i entreat you   7.703486418362301
for example you see these two fish   9.020939725931425
ali knows i generally smoke while i am taking my tea or coffee   12.300772636285297
having wished you all to witness the challenge he now wishes you to be present at the combat   12.728180777757007
as to fortune he had made he humble as he was an enemy of the cardinal   10.370280547642128
it s of no importance   13.051432519451355
the headsman of bethune   13.294813049856195
at the second turn the count stopped the carriage and requested permission to withdraw leaving the vehicle at their disposal   11.243881351675606
everything goes too well porthos   11.970694588148193
and the people in the ferryboat guided themselves as well as they were able toward the bank with the aid of a pole which chanced to be in the boat   12.598341835101305
and in that codicil he acknowledges me   10.064931533876988
he would then have about 5 050 000 francs left   8.25369135563799
alas my boy said he human knowledge is confined within very narrow limits   17.905520839825517
said the figure   16.710243356239687
i can not believe it murmured the banker   11.8896474401327
in any case said the duke his cellar and kitchen might easily excel those of monsieur de chavigny   11.427591167393661
he crossed the court ran up the two flights to athos s apartment and knocked at the door enough to break it down   9.018612821384078
the two friends went to the hotel de vendome   6.865225605396922
twas the first time d artagnan had ever refused a request from athos   14.575869213601397
he offered millions to anyone who would set him at liberty   14.123247533412531
you are going now to pay your court to her again and if this time you succeed in pleasing her in your own name and with your own face it will be much worse than before   10.564642956897387
the king danced facing the queen and every time he passed by her he devoured with his eyes those studs of which he could not ascertain the number   12.564678312013301
the two young men bowed and separated aramis ascending the street which led to the luxembourg while d artagnan perceiving the appointed hour was approaching took the road to the carmes deschaux saying to himself decidedly i can t draw back   15.864506779327957
what signifies a delay of half an hour   17.43581372678012
they were just abreast of mareciana and beyond the flat but verdant island of la pianosa   8.477974761138693
they will die before their children who will in their turn grieve for them   7.9256056353359305
blaisois and mousqueton set themselves to preparing their bed which consisted of a plank and a valise   13.727614053634221
the boudoir upstairs communicated with the bedchamber by an invisible door on the staircase   7.2763074334881805
then all the superior officers approached him to pay their compliments m   13.443700622382387
i immediately put on the saddle and bridle to which operation he lent himself with the best grace possible   12.26446316706532
night had closed in and paris seen thus by the light of lanterns flickering on the pools of water crowded with ferry boats of every kind including those that glittered with the armed patrols with the watchword passing from post to post paris presented such an aspect as to strongly seize the senses of aramis a man most susceptible to warlike impressions   10.134139569752652
i will give you an eagle with outstretched wings holding in its claws a prey which tries in vain to escape and bearing this device tenax   10.247351013265954
the conversation took a cheerful turn   13.738339623434918
but i forget this sometimes and there are even moments when my mental vision transports me beyond these walls and i fancy myself at liberty   12.499160435162723
d artagnan keeping at some distance from his friends darted a scrutinizing glance into every carriage that appeared but saw no face with which he was acquainted   18.826319139020196
have you forgotten anything   9.047232878755098
you talk of sacrilege   13.808550009044573
you seem to forget the orders i received to conduct you safe and sound to his highness the prince   15.061544338306557
when do you want your twelve hundred francs   10.248449472826987
the king parted his hair with his hands and looking at the block he said this block is very low is there no other to be had   4.8400866280714805
danglars did not answer   15.22186918671629
what still keeping up this silly jest   6.687992455268887
wait he continued renewing his fruitless search   14.47305807467181
but do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor   8.402827403372655
but at the mention of yanina and colonel fernand he turned so frightfully pale that every member shuddered and fixed his eyes upon him   7.411969131730427
my sister would be bathed in tears and fainting   9.285438547764812
no interrupted mercédès but i have seen him whom i loved on the point of murdering my son   16.116671293507896
asked d avrigny placing his hand on noirtier s shoulder   7.795938458110008
you do not madame   10.594240127256771
that is just said richelieu   14.37137993918534
which is a consolation   15.145724287857963
and who has filled your head with all this nonsense   7.417367026862123
the duke smiled   8.071929578361754
said caderousse with a voice more tipsy than ever   11.347569608973776
speak out then say what it was   11.146946658506634
the pouches contained 25 000 000 of money in gold and the barrels were filled with 30 000 pounds of gunpowder   11.380835183256524
don t waste a charge   10.077337930653108
and as d artagnan as he spoke looked at harrison the colonel imagined the toast was for himself   9.970492742144609
was it not his betrothal feast   9.211253221536507
yes replied the narrator   11.926229732187641
and in proof that he fears nothing that he counts on nothing he will restore monsieur de mazarin to your majesty without conditions   12.3181079481974
oh if so punish me as you will   7.726891053835134
and i hope to god that with our four lackeys we may be in sufficient number   10.081022444051504
and if they follow us we shall be certain they will tell nobody   10.262403326017772
i had no such contempt for men before   5.3400317440901155
we will talk italian and spanish   13.305611335887516
there were four or five more in the emerald which would contain about a dozen   11.845126059918515
so much the better i have a ray of hope left   15.38932457998163
he dismounted twenty men to make a breach in the barricade whilst he and others remaining on their horses were to protect the assailants   11.338499343801416
athos alone remained seated calm and thoughtful   13.768779062092735
grief could hardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of madame de saint méran   16.305252655190262
today all preliminaries will be arranged at my father s and tomorrow or next day at latest the wedding festival here at la réserve   9.063324870739686
has anyone besides me seen madame de saint méran   13.607447383123786
then i have only to make arrangements for the duel said beauchamp   12.903702158170637
it was rita s father who brought his daughter s ransom in person   14.368134880451862
yes madame he shall live said monte cristo surprised that without more emotion mercédès had accepted the heroic sacrifice he made for her   10.49587070349398
athos still within the inclosure of the window watched this scene with a smile of disdain on his lips   8.615672752898268
three brigands called trestaillon truphemy and graffan publicly assassinated everybody whom they suspected of bonapartism   12.027226045655494
do you wish a step or some place in the government   15.90459450807909
i thought perhaps that the king s death has only hastened their flight   9.92877183353733
the month passed and morrel made extraordinary efforts to get in all his resources   12.994101812466193
but fortunately this was not the case and the governor left him convinced that the poor madman for whom in his heart he felt a kind of affection was only troubled with a slight indisposition   18.123685857224736
he said to himself   13.026958213292652
valentine kissed the old man who looked at her with such tenderness that her eyes again filled with tears whose sources he thought must be exhausted   15.413223494902871
but soon thou dost afford thy hand to lead them on   9.055978237679552
léon d armilly twenty years of age   13.501969502380385
come dear d artagnan look up a little   16.04095348657794
but said the countess breathlessly with her eyes fixed on monte cristo whose arm she convulsively pressed with both hands we are friends are we not   15.015974066837003
my dear fellow said debray you have come in the nick of time   6.93789799211604
her mistress was mad with love intoxicated with joy   16.02517551123811
it is quite immaterial to me said monte cristo and it was very unnecessary to disturb me at the opera for such a trifle   15.980687405526037
ah my poor friends   16.494647974753782
the last raised his eyes to ascertain doubtless that neither his companions nor himself had been watched and in spite of the darkness he perceived gondy   15.389726345111605
there was a fourth gash in which a long table knife was plunged up to the handle   11.056680771597481
and so my dear count said d artagnan his eminence didn t actually insist on our attending him   12.196441019875921
no one knows what there is   16.95739896733568
he who was but half as old would sacrifice six   12.998376706712936
i can pass   14.197298723240362
perhaps with regard to you they are immaterial but i should be no artist if i had not some fancies   11.001142467897742
one last favor my lord   11.461365498691878
where then   18.827978056642877
i entreat you doctor   12.402660186563397
laugh if you will   14.544562662016066
the rest of mademoiselle eugénie s person was in perfect keeping with the head just described   10.488209216541033
d artagnan determined upon his course   15.91061495890115
i have then to inform you sir at the request of m   13.751625934534891
she is very amiable then is she not   11.888957203392108
the count with a smile of profound tenderness extended his hand and she carried it to her lips   10.186120103693007
as for you my dear lieutenant i promise you nothing   11.482193516503166
in the first place said athos let us leave this chamber   17.74026442923764
let her humble herself then and come to me first   8.007132585218091
bonacieux my punishment is drawing to a close   7.934786282844669
noirtier evidently intends making me his heir   13.71748327255402
d artagnan and the curate appeared pleased   16.072449263837512
then having riveted the eyes of his interlocutor on his own he glanced towards the door   8.798524213258116
a tear moistened the eye of the phlegmatic englishman   12.325728635715766
i have only two adversaries i will not say two conquerors for with perseverance i subdue even them they are time and distance   9.2555890861827
au revoir benedetto   9.440925385437096
and the good fortune which occurred to me monsieur might have enabled you to dispense with a duty which in its discharge confers an undoubtedly great honor   14.253069052511119
that is to say in the immediate vicinity of the chamber hired by d artagnan a circumstance which appeared to furnish a happy augury for the success of his journey   11.822086615982984
but although her voice sweet full and sonorous vibrated as harmoniously and as affectingly as ever the door remained shut   7.4902645692303
they this time embraced heartily and without retaining any malice   8.186499257012063
monte cristo bent his head   12.194304015609475
i will denounce this place of infamy   8.949470219739617
we started a stag of ten branches   13.33168432635699
he who presumed to be a rival of yours for which he was severely punished   14.28045713713215
and how he terrified them even then and made them fly before him   8.412979621938387
your doors are guarded the airholes of your cellars are guarded and i could say to you as that good la ramee said to me of the duc de beaufort you must be either bird or mouse to get out   11.626567063464345
but before setting out he reflected that for a lad of intelligence and experience he was in a singular predicament since he was proceeding toward uncertainty and leaving certainty behind him   11.694891950779505
certain   6.291736953928975
very well then   14.817675945303703
my dear count cried morcerf you are at fault you one of the most formidable logicians i know and you must see it clearly proved that instead of being an egotist you are a philanthropist   11.17905550855271
if i am an officer your fortune is certain for i shall have money enough for both and moreover a name we shall both be proud of since it will be our own   17.302353018237664
come come do not strip the latter of his just rights to bestow them on the corsican who to my mind has usurped quite enough   6.195975147562186
his musketeer s uniform became him marvelously   8.15854949338933
she passed the night thus   10.962017354861928
well returned morrel it is a cruel thing to be forced to say but already used to misfortune i must habituate myself to shame   13.484051565727416
albert and franz looked at each other fearing really to abuse the count s kindness   10.137615262981033
this time porthos received the blow right in his stomach and felt it   8.940204219550122
do not surrender egad   8.158497064930824
was there not some snare laid for her   8.989864325335434
if so you can spare yourself the trouble   9.136496953934724
while he had been absorbed in thought they had shipped their oars and hoisted sail   12.50621408676192
then let me go said maximilian or i shall think you did not love me for my own sake but for yours   13.357757951382691
said d artagnan to porthos   10.400174771109148
the two kingdoms are so near that france must be interested in our situation as we are interested in that of france   12.312134966759153
is not this true fernand   12.505957118177555
they ask my age   13.327812512704183
and i will say further the art of these chemists is capable with the utmost precision to accommodate and proportion the remedy and the bane to yearnings for love or desires for vengeance   8.893482699816133
raoul really felt tired but he was desirous of testing his strength and brought up in the principles of athos and certain of having heard him speak a thousand times of stages of twenty five leagues he did not wish to fall far short of his model   13.228552028143438
as if they had been one man as if their four hearts had pulsated in one breast   11.235464847294962
in fact the deep and crafty look giving a predominant expression to the child s face belonged rather to a boy of twelve or fourteen than to one so young   16.211022066755472
this man was surrounded by officers   13.266720921602175
upon my honor said the prince   13.24591471105574
then turning to the governor on my word the poor devil touches me   9.702805646135833
ah if you command me that s another thing said bicarat   12.857995689640635
the lady had a cavalier shut up with her said athos but as notwithstanding the noise this cavalier did not show himself it is to be presumed that he is a coward   11.03192311515501
aramis immediately complied and sang the song in a very lively manner   9.6269694838519
felton gently repulsed milady and she sank into a chair   7.198082934157823
however as he was a favorite with cucumetto as he had for three years faithfully served him and as he had saved his life by shooting a dragoon who was about to cut him down he hoped the chief would have pity on him   11.168459308846867
nevertheless you consent   12.734605057101364
monte cristo drew out his watch   12.65287828279538
and about eight o clock in the evening the time when the vapors of night begin to thicken in the streets he left the hotel de la chevrette and followed by planchet set forth from the capital by way of the saint denis gate   5.122508254180056
there is something very peculiar about this chief then   11.48720080105072
is there anything that i can do for you   12.71894489510604
but he must make me a baron   14.680387204275752
though i have had but little evidence of that good nature of which your eminence speaks   10.60018390832527
he reflected that this coalition of four young brave enterprising and active men ought to have some other object than swaggering walks fencing lessons and practical jokes more or less witty   13.882816027571462
gentlemen said morcerf it is only a quarter past ten and i expect someone else   7.352471188383501
de morcerf quick   11.665858697895864
but scarcely had the two rapiers clashed when a company of the guards of his eminence commanded by m   16.201185401662162
asked the queen of lord de winter   15.293561746250663
all remains the same then in that quarter   9.306586421595657
better study a little common prudence   13.9554927220474
in short you will find your father a very presentable person i assure you   15.126934292380486
he had realized the plan he had imagined beforehand whose picturing had produced the smiles we noted upon his face   13.460838556673234
haydée answered his remark with a melancholy smile   10.535159277960474
this was the costume that best became the king   8.891603864696172
i understand all perfectly sir replied groslow   12.885784745633451
but added he looking at d artagnan with a certain degree of uneasiness you know what has happened to me   18.97023098142453
with whom are you going to fight   9.706549723031811
the men are all infamous and i am happy to be able now to do more than detest them i despise them   13.14665493831372
that will keep us from going away from the east whither i am tempted to think i have been conveyed by some good genius   9.323782488810402
can my influence with them be of any service to you   13.391779471292212
he let the jug fall on the floor and it broke in pieces   8.725060044734818
she was also one of the greatest beauties at court   11.647136694434305
does this man know your majesty personally   13.386558934752355
once arrived at the brink of the river should we even find them three ranks deep as long as you and your regiment do your duty we will look to the rest   10.521276830948588
i pray for it said d artagnan   11.729232614617903
is it possible you were so kind   10.087422629830797
ah you have a noble heart said the count   14.036328070497273
where were we   13.671441255418324
on my word of honor said athos one must be either a mazarinist or a frondeur   9.222422468265288
the more so sir as it was men s and not god s doing   10.179567027492947
are you not going to morrow morning at six o clock louis to bathe at conflans   11.927820201072421
the poor young woman was too pure to suppose that any female could be guilty of such perfidy   11.485846027023223
oh death is in my house   12.801517169411024
for being friends of m   11.611352608194863
ferrea banker at nice and also a letter of introduction to the count of monte cristo whom i have directed to supply all your wants   13.664444851243923
here madame danglars instead of being calmed by the soft picture uttered a groan and fainted   12.668181416392096
and in passing as she was thirsty she drank what remained in the glass   11.0951999050634
blaisois was the tall youth half groom half peasant whom we saw at the chateau de bragelonne whom athos had christened by the name of his province   13.445746528626676
and what do you know about them monsieur   11.89500798270658
the concierge looked upon the count with surprise   8.110418903540582
meanwhile the president carelessly opened the letter which had been brought to him   12.377663080164456
the old servant left the room and presently returned bringing with him a small casket   9.930945486343504
it could not indeed my daughter is her only heiress valentine alone   13.048081900172841
he murmured in a low voice as he concluded his sentence   8.47076162174486
let us go down   14.068333338603718
if false let him be shot   15.179970069217052
to you also   6.60573387230627
really i never saw such an infatuation for music   14.817283767120385
d artagnan picked up two or three old sails hung on the walls and meeting nothing to suspect regained by the hatchway the deck of the vessel   12.63891499818345
the usurper s conversion   10.518815536781835
here is his receipt   14.723327318366133
make your mind easy resumed athos we are all faithful servants of his majesty   14.00174365075966
ma foi said the jeweller drenched with rain i am not destined to return to beaucaire tonight   12.62884380648329
royalty payments must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you prepare or are legally required to prepare your periodic tax returns   5.9069905064615025
i did not even know that you were the person i was sent to fetch   14.727707343621061
and pray how did you acquire all these honors   9.927373596662353
this secret which he possessed this woman whom he loved   12.347922543779598
do as i bade you cried the commissary and preserve absolute secrecy   12.580626824393713
she would not be weary thank god   15.759877667928677
aramis obeyed   9.930573589109002
athos smiled and his fine eye was dimmed by a tear   12.253854080683881
but this time our gascon saw at a glance all the advantage to be derived from the love which kitty had just confessed so innocently or so boldly the interception of letters addressed to the comte de wardes news on the spot entrance at all hours into kitty s chamber which was contiguous to her mistress s   11.802914799860893
what mother   13.650346441828958
run   12.112428042124312
then he came back to the point where perhaps he ought to have begun and that was to knock at the door against which the stranger had leaned   9.407872124626087
a magnificent cavalier remarked mazarin   7.715142016866567
said the valet in the same carriage as your majesties   11.303561921323041
project gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify do copyright research on transcribe and proofread works not protected by u   11.20978369677266
of taste continued franz gravely   11.575580870374075
yes he used to drink a great deal replied porthos   7.606916104006769
you think yourself well informed because the telegraph has told you three days after the landing the usurper has landed at cannes with several men   11.487109767763974
exactly my daughter   8.752162729011534
d artagnan could not help perceiving that something more than usual was passing in the mind of his lackey and said well monsieur planchet what is the matter with us now   14.876010698294706
my offers did not arouse him did not even tempt him   5.87077898472373
no from tréport   10.127411898818597
you might some time ago have looked upon this resolution as a vague project but today you see it was a reality and you must submit to it under penalty of breaking your word   10.834275746299598
if your majesty desires it said laporte my sons like myself are at the queen s service   15.946537474797424
i believe near marseilles   12.566201654800969
yield you yield to me do you not   10.626095221200327
perhaps he has discovered some mine said madame danglars   10.434838232552377
you have no longer a weapon   9.655807894475197
monsieur de morcerf has received a letter from franz announcing his immediate return   9.645929621924317
that of marignan just at the point where one of my forefathers is offering his sword to francis i   11.973594432633648
to my misfortune to my eternal misfortune   8.698032702673625
an extreme nervous excitement and a strangely agitated sleep   15.44883509328816
still from an artificial civilization have originated wants vices and false tastes which occasionally become so powerful as to stifle within us all good feelings and ultimately to lead us into guilt and wickedness   10.46312782123869
we ll wait for you   13.059425496191913
but lord montrose replied the queen i have heard of his great and rapid successes of battles gained   12.289031262714191
aramis aramis   11.190709630922255
if they should hear of the separation ah yes   14.402458536720046
his red hair fell in dishevelled masses like snakes around his shoulders   9.052327239922205
let us speak french my father said he to the jesuit   12.826136764902573
arrived in london you will seek buckingham   10.675734551491901
well i am in a maze said porthos   12.284952971355931
at this moment my mother seized me in her arms and hurrying noiselessly along numerous turnings and windings known only to ourselves she arrived at a private staircase of the kiosk where was a scene of frightful tumult and confusion   5.097214239355141
it shall be as you wish madame said villefort   10.5737405438816
thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard cavalcanti pronounce these words tomorrow sir i shall have the honor of waiting upon you on business   9.230872121010174
donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks online payments and credit card donations   11.410505901242026
she tried to replace the arm but it moved with a frightful rigidity which could not deceive a sick nurse   10.739327139130692
fortunately the day after tomorrow we leave paris   11.067813750952794
but now i am forced to believe in the excess of your kindness since not only your letter but your servant assures me that i have the good fortune to be beloved by you   17.259522150784857
you will thank me for what   8.594234206766288
but he with his wonted prudence had mingled with the crowd   14.483319717920974
she had married a younger brother of the family who had left her a widow with one child   11.704472441193277
monte cristo remembered that on that very spot on the same rock he had been violently dragged by the guards who forced him to ascend the slope at the points of their bayonets   12.945637785648206
the cardinal writes better than i thought   15.669311757362744
d artagnan was too good a swordsman to trifle with his opponent   11.053897609574337

the name he pronounced in a voice of tenderness amounting almost to love was that of haydée   10.228111050991613
it is not indiscreet returned morcerf with the simplicity of conviction   12.98432043339089
mazarin after this half humble half gallant attention went away   7.269167235435194
said the stranger becoming attentive he put his hand upon his pocket while pronouncing the name of monsieur de tréville   10.548307169247384
and you reply   16.110627501071036
i see that you are the friends of these gentlemen   15.714110411076998
but a reinforcement having come up the assailants had been put to flight and the leader had taken refuge in the hotel next to his lodgings   8.012944514022909
cavalcanti was evidently embarrassed   12.261014432558602
come in my lord said philip in a low tone and i will show you something droll   13.133370367801275
why should you threaten me with death cried i when i have already declared my innocence   10.372840937943039
but in returning thither last night when fortunately you did not accompany him as his carriage was crossing the rue de la ferronnerie his guards insulted the people who began to abuse them   15.143892797167496
i took a wax candle in one hand and with the other groped about for a piece of paper my match box being empty with which i proposed to get a light from the small flame still playing on the embers   8.520069011727891
ladies said the officer do not disturb yourselves   10.421657820189132
you have dukes for friends a marshal of france for godfather a prince of the blood as commander and on the day of your return you have been received by two queens   11.486310622963034
for heaven s sake where is that   9.251569469406604
yes a chef d oeuvre of the great florentine sculptor benvenuto cellini replied athos   15.82664980162588
where is it then   7.450115467928573
they stopped him at the door   11.319285181782941
see they are here   13.576295163577388
well said porthos to aramis we must do something   11.840570139928746
so we opened the bird and this time all special symptoms had disappeared there were only general symptoms   12.092545566941489
the doctor could therefore measure neither the direction nor the depth of it   6.774036522319844
i am your majesty s body and soul and however far i may be from you however inferior may be my position i believe i have discovered a means of extricating your majesty from your trouble   6.821140790846468
i have told you this good sir resumed the host in order that you may be on your guard   8.909738949195994
the chancellor reddened and stammered some words   16.260711514107136
exclaimed caderousse fifty thousand francs   14.344521946905859
how can you for an instant entertain so unworthy a thought dear valentine   15.575967644380746
said aramis smiling   10.373349329610289
and what may that be   15.99644718883468
i will do my best   14.900022666095563
remember that the queen awaits you and after the queen the cardinal and after the cardinal myself   11.96976672904101
as these ornaments were given by the king the minister persuaded his majesty to insist upon the queen s appearing in them as part of her jewels at a ball which was soon to take place   11.14028299598883
why i think there were not many intruders   13.971777006835884
should it not be found in possession of either father or son then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said dantès on board the pharaon   10.80582124134614
in two bounds he was at the louvre   9.010919985445504
and his eyes turned from the box containing the greek girl and her strange companion to watch the business of the stage   7.028286236757674
i must return to the minister s   10.879634302407702
the eight guards were at their posts   14.163338004577708
to delay it a single day would be in my eyes now to commit a fresh offense   11.170234932083796
my prince   12.889116939898
this man whom they had noticed from the first for the same reason they had themselves been remarked by others was walking in a listless way up and down the jetty   7.641578367457073
they sat down in such a manner as to turn their backs on nobody   11.160910753909766
then as in leaving the cabaret they took different directions my brother went and hid himself on the road of the catholic and i on that of the huguenot   12.115647173207122
you are madame s brother i learn be it so   15.709225999098502
the dog obeyed and jumped quickly over the cane   9.852281922277975
i could not ride behind   12.676943484821349
they were in the marvellous dining room before described where the statues had baskets on their heads always filled with fruits and flowers   12.258881471744965
where was the monk going   11.342621452404865
his thirst had abated   9.195314929158432
and that is the case observed monte cristo   11.31115860473255
patrick soon caught the sound of his master s voice calling his falcon   13.386475987202152
the count rang and a footman appeared   15.449792747870845
he remarked that a light was burning in one of the highest windows of the tower   17.350161844905987
emmanuel julie farewell   13.393036541923388
because nothing can save you   9.058431641400727
i relate and i will repeat before the count what i have said to you   12.887308450208176
there is the great the distressing truth   8.824934846119563
this order was also executed   7.41451234918209
once for all sir replied the baroness sharply i tell you i will not hear cash named   16.289328007088795
and he rushed out of the room still crying edward edward   13.754034815255205
you are like debray and yet it seems to me that when the minister is out of spirits the opposition ought to be joyous   10.558720771767739
he had become lieutenant in a regiment composed entirely of corsicans   9.480546118930503
my name is mordaunt replied the young man bowing   8.290164826084341
i see how it will be said athos we shall get into some pretty quarrel or other and we have no need of one just now   16.326924840891127
a single word had reminded her that morrel was expecting her in m   9.04866168813906
yes i insist   15.8674304697382
he was ushered into a simple and elegant drawing room and the count rose to meet him with a smiling air   11.832226127355248
we are leaving paris and when our journey is paid we shall have 5 000 francs left   12.609013046918943
by the faith of a gentleman   13.653399794952483
you are joking   8.722849750695143
well now said athos triumphantly i swear to you my friend by the god who hears us i believe that there is a power watching over us and that we shall all four see france again   10.226822358548933
my faith said aramis we are all alike   11.360686309997314
it is you who have come to me   7.833708895275974
and the guide pointed to the opening which had remained unclosed   6.513447560332764
it was necessary to separate   11.752693515703575
noirtier seated in his chair and listening to every sound was watching the door   12.038919516426033
he leaped with planchet into the boat and five minutes after they were on board   11.656448206957474
one day he was surprised in a lonely road between a huguenot and a catholic with both of whom he had before had business and who both knew him again   17.04580078556467
that which we can not obtain   14.639446968154601
sir cried parry may you and yours be blessed   11.12260069828798
possibly continued aramis came toward me accompanied by five or six men who followed about ten paces behind him   11.245131010405418
you demanded a favor   15.440538791050145
without communicating his thoughts to his companion he sat down drew out his opera glass and looked another way   9.99753610697935
as yet he could form no definite plan   10.981332433072128
oh they have a house to themselves   8.369834704398574
and d artagnan chinked the remainder of his pistoles in his pocket   7.56227834588827
at last said he i shall know with whom i have to do   11.273142030485833
they say that it is quite fair and that sowing so much red you ought to reap a little blue   12.10121379756906
when he saw his employer the worthy tar seemed much embarrassed drew on one side into the corner of the landing place passed his quid from one cheek to the other stared stupidly with his great eyes and only acknowledged the squeeze of the hand which morrel as usual gave him by a slight pressure in return   12.733799642088897
40162m rise   14.12086222105388
now bring the alicante and some biscuits   6.973165916277527
alas it shows how little notion you can have of all it has cost me to effect a purpose so unexpectedly frustrated that you talk of beginning over again   12.982388662354118
at six o clock villefort retired to his study at eight m   13.870927592855601
what matters it if you avoid them   10.173767312135153
nothing can be easier than to comply with your excellency s wish said the landlord opening the door of the chamber   10.096558273566306
i know what happiness and what despair are and i never make a jest of such feelings   13.341905034700396
i never caution my servants a second time remember that   11.42128133985107
athos took the purse and threw it into the hand of the coachman   8.42771035283321
well well my dear edmond continued the owner don t let me detain you   15.923451617813331
it was one of the results of mazarin s niggardliness   11.107235510465477
there was a stone veil between him and the firmament   14.747566012726747
silence whispered the duke she has her reasons   11.805332361858596
my friend said andrea i was coming from mortefontaine to senlis when my horse which is a troublesome creature stumbled and threw me   17.127012520642865
albert cast his eyes on the passport then raised them in astonishment to beauchamp   4.264145345240744
he then descended but it was only when he felt his foot touch the ground that he was satisfied of his safety   12.808270423466723
in all probability this time his master would not retract   11.407611923109567
you blackguard   8.760836831048728
d artagnan took upon himself that more than difficult task   15.619836674038336
totally disregarding the business of the stage he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the beauty of each pretty woman aided by a powerful opera glass   12.044246092045016
if you were to die i should die too   13.089082464336624
cried his foe   9.826224078262682
oh of the most unfortunate kind monsieur   9.522615570986414
he darted upon it as an eagle would seize upon its prey   8.738517764515391
athos made him a sign to go to d artagnan s residence and bring back some clothes   11.84456334349198
but it would have been more seemly not upon the scaffold   8.489606609005186
ah is it you count   6.39229895084316
is there any answer   15.899673732995968
no said caderousse no   16.157497197168084
on our return to france she had a young woman who was attached to one of her opponents poisoned in the convent of the augustines at bethune   16.30729166995708
d artagnan scratched his ear   12.5666221724827
thus speaking he fell back exhausted   10.508687981261708
since lord de winter left him i am distracted sirs   15.707972706394834
they may hear us   15.711580490844177
0145m no sire he replied i alighted at the hotel de madrid in the rue de tournon   17.563538854513205
but d artagnan is devoid of such weaknesses   11.714398923060568
the chairs were of ancient workmanship and materials   6.184296683630739
for more than a month past the mischievous child who knew not what to wish for had taken it into his head to have a monkey   17.455420667732405
athos drew the young man toward him and pressed his lips to his brow as he would have done to a young daughter   9.464187433010467
wait a moment said monte cristo   14.813037701257436
it was delightful weather   10.190350368857471
this gentleman asks me for information which common politeness will not permit me to refuse   12.920960323410288
valentine replied the young man deeply affected i will not say you are all i love in the world for i dearly prize my sister and brother in law   12.196329173601645
but now about the middle of the rue des petits champs they were stopped by a second patrol   12.37848273136902
you are sure of it   13.510288817425412
raoul i seem to read your future destiny as through a cloud   3.4014856358275996
the man with the torch complied although not asked in the most polite terms   19.481370496644644
besides each individual had one or two others for whom he was interested   14.972080827983794
money   15.638491284359713
cavalcanti the five hundred thousand francs you promise for my dowry   12.383336889870296
danglars i do not know by what means that man contrives to obtain intelligence as soon as we do made a million   16.739624670449324
for it is not pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his duty   12.927802014063367
go to the devil with your latin   19.102413288133555
oh if you do know him cried julie can you tell us where he is where we can find him   15.291440895168085
then tell the men to be in readiness don t tell them why now   12.665101908641923
the duke received them and they informed him that they were resolved not to pay this tax even if they were obliged to defend themselves against its collectors by force of arms   15.519989294722285
the music of william tell is so sweet   11.78078799567153
we shall be a small party only yourself my mother and i   9.403617110434109
the young man then entered the apartment of aramis   10.792862040890896
let us go repeated d artagnan   8.708339623261073
which would not perhaps have been a great misfortune in time of war seeing that it is nothing but a nest of huguenots but which is in time of peace a frightful example   12.188366120422506
the doctor closed the door after her with a gloomy air   18.794085888883696
have it examined by the governor of the port said the shipmaster and give me the preference   4.698443825280739
albert and beauchamp parted the last pressure of their hands expressing what their tongues could not before a stranger   13.57139612650955
he uttered an exclamation of delight for the large handwriting of porthos was discernible and underneath some lines traced by his worthy spouse   13.193533488959767
i will lay a wager that twas that saint christopher porthos who performed this feat   8.51726999734014
patrick let no one enter   7.523993391775879
athos turned pale and laid his hand on his heart   12.176727334622653
exploring however one of the side wings of the gallery after making a sign to porthos to explore the other he saw all at once at his left a tub containing an orange tree which had been pushed out of its place and in its place an open aperture   11.87191570291493
certainly the air of that dungeon was very provocative of appetite   9.837416470227854
the circumstances that had hastened the return of d artagnan to paris were as follows one evening when mazarin according to custom went to visit the queen in passing the guard chamber he heard loud voices   11.903116799823179
say no more of that madame said felton   14.433199474171579
milady knew the rest   9.253469046529561
cried all the witnesses of this scene   10.387087091326135
soon strange fact aramis undid two buttons of his doublet seeing which porthos unfastened his entirely   11.618536869606771
ah said valentine the thing you desire begins with the letter n   9.288309562607617
besides he understands that in my position i can not plead against the poor   8.409341539505721
i i detest i loathe it   10.542684962780447
40286m yes i need your help that is i thought like a madman that you could lend me your assistance in a case where god alone can succor me   12.441353561795596
it is without the setting which is also valuable replied the abbé as he closed the box and returned it to his pocket while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated innkeeper   8.771803911239497
why that he might not have the trouble of returning to beaucaire   11.392084660907994
in a few moments the young girl had attracted the attention of the whole house and even the occupants of the boxes leaned forward to scrutinize her magnificent diamonds   14.271262094359889
on perceiving the musketeer he uttered an exclamation that was almost a cry of despair   16.04230429580154
chapter lxxxv   11.404173919904533
one chamber alone had been respected by the magnificent bertuccio   12.792232006042534
and that is what i told the gentleman as we walked along   9.48076889644706
a very great nobleman but whether maltese or sicilian i can not exactly say   14.751406022552185
i will do better than that said albert   5.796104005273073
i did indeed charge him with a commission the result of which he must tell me   10.418347562814624
sick of the smallpox at his age   15.820708130712598
it will take a little longer time and may make a greater disturbance but you will be outside with swords and will rush in at the proper time   12.806319855212246
the boy undertook the commission promising to be in frosinone in less than an hour   8.721125651011
now climb up athos quickly said d artagnan   13.745488383346924
but parry clasped his hands and implored him and at last he agreed   10.021266270058558
does that satisfy you   9.959078437280136
they were thus perpetually employed faria that he might not see himself grow old   19.75194615676947
milady finding her thoughts betrayed dug her nails into her flesh to subdue every emotion that might give to her face any expression except agony   14.848014699440345
and on the 5th of september at eleven o clock the hand of the clock pointed to eleven i shall come to receive the money   9.269165038252224
have you anything to ask of me   15.842053608354465
at thirsk replied harrison   10.263307305474195
had ever lived and that he had perished on the scaffold   12.469512404974244
franz d épinay said the count   11.71762453195785
and for you aramis who always abstracted by your theological studies inspire your servant bazin a mild religious man with a profound respect   10.456625487401231
although he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him   16.292104360849557
then one could enjoy charming little dinners where one touches on one side the hand of a friend and on the other the foot of a mistress   14.015792464521539
what my horse   11.254444041889148
if you do you know that my hand stretches far and that you shall pay very dearly for the hundred louis you have from me   16.20303095710274
my son said the king to aramis do not take it so to heart   9.101410957884351
why she is the old wife of a procurator of the châtelet monsieur named madame coquenard who although she is at least fifty still gives herself jealous airs   11.991842339158886
7 and any additional terms imposed by the copyright holder   18.70016068785611
he thought they were fighting   8.694610088980358
and you i ve only thrown the fellow down but hark   7.087426599330116
these were the first words he had spoken   9.83378729179118
she was thinking of the despair of maximilian when he should be informed that madame de saint méran instead of being an ally was unconsciously acting as his enemy   13.2600364983049
hair black eyes black   17.91068213211775
the executioner may kill without being on that account an assassin said the man in the red cloak rapping upon his immense sword   13.165827176313794
the squall was on us and the vessel began to heel   17.063938004215583
as happy as it is permitted to a human creature to be replied maximilian   11.623822309898589
franz albert and the count continued to descend the corso   10.059315596680486
by the help of his eyes which are still full of life and as you perceive possess the power of inflicting mortal injury   12.398136653240131
inquired the guest as caderousse placed before him the bottle of wine and a glass   14.106477246372975
you ask what god is doing   19.80093016622458
groslow on the question being interpreted answered three without counting myself   13.957914528511045
has something fresh happened   15.879029705377071
his house   11.083091682850846
these are the ideas that render your nation superior to any other returned monte cristo   5.674496067323346
yes sir although i assure you the refusal is as painful for me to give as it is for you to receive for i had reckoned on the honor of your alliance and the breaking off of a marriage contract always injures the lady more than the gentleman   15.137981199632197
asked mazarin supporting his elbows on his desk and his chin on his hands   16.45462740368849
here after a short conference they proposed to separate   12.934064295744315
chapter 17   10.247833710687384
and what did you understand by what we said   7.319649942379389
guiche summoned one of his grooms and delivering the prisoner into his charge with orders to shoot him through the head if he attempted to escape he leaped from his horse and approached raoul   16.237629730293094
tell him that among these four men two only are to be feared d artagnan and athos   9.30682606367837
then you were wrong to refuse to dine with him   9.618339127752078
what a horrible face that monk has said de guiche   10.351378959885615
chance did everything   13.203264011196236
none sir replied the bandit you are as free as air   11.921196698557008
and like a serpent which folds and unfolds its rings to ascertain its strength she enveloped felton beforehand in the thousand meshes of her inventive imagination   13.675729109283868
the next day he died   13.09705360453297
sup then and make as little noise as possible said the priest for i too have been on the go all day and shall not be sorry to sleep to night   16.138989213181272
and franz himself could not resist a feeling of superstitious dread so much the stronger in him as it arose from a variety of corroborative recollections while the terror of the countess sprang from an instinctive belief originally created in her mind by the wild tales she had listened to till she believed them truths   9.994114149587443
bread and salt chapter 72   9.506779545768758
but d artagnan whose ideas had taken quite another course forgot himself like a fool and answered gallantly that it was too late to think about duels and sword thrusts   17.348336018267013
at the very moment when the queen quitted the convent to go to the palais royal a young man dismounted at the gate of this royal abode and announced to the guards that he had something of importance to communicate to cardinal mazarin   8.068731786327806
then you speak german also   9.33306461691657
what the devil are you doing here   6.058087366256252
we made signals of distress she perceived us made for us and took us all on board   10.084004615784073
the quick eager glance of la carconte followed him as he ascended while caderousse on the contrary turned his back and seemed most anxiously to avoid even glancing at him   8.491927206279424
but he simply heard the sound of the bolts sliding in their copper rings   10.250983545109783
i shall go he said to the queen   10.418611160112619
quite possible sir   17.065078425301962
the abominable creature murmured d artagnan   14.045817522477197
de salvieux who recommends him to me i entreat your majesty to receive him graciously   5.686427248971808
said milady with a last doubt   8.490769316941169
athos opened it and began by drawing forth a little note written in these terms my dear count when one travels and especially for three months one never has a superfluity of money   13.431628153841107
my dear albert said debray rising it is half past two   7.997952225605694
i did not understand   14.486742231941339
it is my mistress you love   13.288873498807142
he knew this was the last struggle   8.355988353798542
i held the horses my hands were full your honor   9.662833770546241
i don t know yet   18.720447951026664
be so good as to collect and throw us back our balls said the duke   12.813503470689245
exclaimed the englishman   16.774010954067773
this time said athos first breaking the silence d artagnan has given us an excellent program and the letter must be written at once   10.730249395299717
they were replied mordaunt   11.51644029628909
dressed as aramis had been the night before the bishop got into his carriage and the former more disguised by his pallor and sad countenance than his deacon s dress got in by his side   10.998803058997163
for not only is he our servant as you say sir but more he is one of our friends   12.120332662859745
he has followed us several times as i think when i have waited for my wife at the wicket of the louvre to escort her home   8.619811474692689
it is very well for you who risk your life every day but for me who only did so once we gather from all this baron that captain morrel saved your life   11.224884695910973
was that i saw that i heard   11.937697535364068
he gave me one great proof of his sympathy at any rate   12.356158118838254
it is clear you do not understand the nature of the courage with which i am endowed and what use i intend making of my strength   12.093715595806774
at the first word milady turned looking at the young man with astonishment   10.895144555646368
at length one by one all the noises in the neighborhood ceased   14.633323575402258
monsieur the comte de la fere he cried i supplicate you   16.0295232932582
a high wall surrounded the whole of the property surmounted at intervals by vases filled with flowers and broken in the centre by a large gate of gilded iron which served as the carriage entrance   10.385759943303277
the island of monte cristo   13.517832611789268
at the door they found the old servant   8.307659765780512
tell me his name and i will put it in the place of the name of charlotte backson   13.851787507221308
as the service was drawing to a close a boy entered the church in great excitement ran to the sacristy dressed himself quickly in the choir robes and cleaving thanks to that uniform the crowd that filled the temple approached bazin who clad in his blue robe was standing gravely in his place at the entrance to the choir   14.672035870585088
from time to time parry stopped thinking the king whose eyes were closed was really asleep but charles would open his eyes and say with a smile go on my good parry i am listening   7.8815345287411125
it is not mercy then that you are about to accord sire it is justice   10.237701658957425
the city notwithstanding the incredible perseverance of its mayor had attempted a sort of mutiny for a surrender   13.520450252059664
but this castle then   8.742774101772623
let us start then   16.787936151574947
you have the means then of touching him   11.011147660875393
d artagnan tore open the envelope of the letter   12.86418084249552
and where am i   10.448124780406705
to be obliging and polite does not necessarily make a man a coward   16.5471890575952
and is her name a secret   14.248979568654313
i really never met with one woman so ready to do justice to the charms of another as yourself responded lucien raising his lorgnette to his eye   15.483070594191165
hark ye my friend i have disobeyed my first order but i will not disobey the second   7.237872605136426
it was saddled and bridled   12.660079521731191
coquenard was not less affected by it on her part for she added my cousin will not return if he finds that we do not treat him kindly   10.30754529615029
he wished to display his authority   14.451554980280898
you are right sir said raoul   11.025604509506298
at the first words of this address d artagnan had seized porthos s arm which he pressed with gradually increasing force   10.957594686022414
i too said porthos who faithful to the instructions still held the cardinal s arm   10.103780081744889
athos took lord de winter s hand and tried to turn the conversation   12.177490962584768
and who were the others   7.421970109473968
i can pass as one of the sailors wrecked last night   10.10319911609698
for i did not even know of what i was the bearer   12.308787917505844
bertuccio is alone in the world   12.1483999174867
my resolution is irrevocable   9.45881871647623
oh repeated the young girl almost bewildered can i not leave the house   9.822273547840858
we will walk back and forth   13.918192309397504
this time as he was well attended he looked at them sternly and made a sign with his eye and hand for d artagnan to follow him   17.837862639829233
a positive feast   15.344665250109891
my lord answered de chavigny with a low bow i have on the ramparts twenty pieces of artillery and in my casemates thirty thousand guns   11.109599732478122
asked monte cristo advancing to meet the commissioner   7.111510956948703
this letter told buckingham that the city was at an extremity   10.313481420569037
orders had just been given to the royal guards and the swiss guards not only to stand firm but to send out patrols to the streets of saint denis and saint martin where the people thronged and where they were the most vociferous when the mayor of paris was announced at the palais royal   16.596751334361826
20351m i have that honor   10.599042190098732
to obey in every particular the man to whom this letter is addressed   14.244124758973385
the lantern was placed on the ground the two adversaries took their stations and the duel began   14.254925162820873
there said monte cristo placing his arms around the count and leaning with him over the front of the box just as haydée whose eyes were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian perceived his pale features close to morcerf s face   9.335663989499714
the sentinel who was relieved at six o clock in the morning remembered perfectly that just as he was taking his post a few minutes past four a young man arrived on horseback with a little boy before him   10.55543050391314
and perhaps perhaps everything is for the best   8.332072755805509
and you couldn t remember   14.727608168744673
an instant after bazin made his appearance at the door   7.217807135878529
the count went out first then albert   12.155082486441652
but you say she is english   11.140133823088474
it has been made up a long time said gondy   4.288911175854524
the notary left the room backwards and bowing down to the ground   9.392306421131831
d artagnan smiled but made no answer   8.616140621981597
said danglars he is in too much hurry it appears to me   9.857252211799597
that which was given to me assuredly   15.978168931341735
and they walked on again   9.439915038284182
he still felt the same self satisfaction which he had experienced the previous evening and which had procured him so good a night s rest   14.542979449471702
if that young man should be appointed to a regiment what would his guardian say   9.13945364889572
pursued as he was d artagnan would not have tarried here five minutes had he been pressed very closely which gives us hopes that he may have succeeded in escaping   9.07223508675499
for a dealer perhaps   8.41258761659228
there was only one person among the crew who had any feeling of ill will towards me   16.74351758292308
he drew near to the window and placing himself so that a ray of light should fall upon the letter as he held it he drew it from his pocket and read it again   8.924716687531454
for we four we once did condemn judge and slay a human being whom we had not any right to cut off from this world although apparently fitter for hell than for this life   15.551415080321405
i thank you for the warning said the count   13.036603487314212
was it with that intention you followed me   15.305112787063827
the king was seated in the same place where the duke had left him   13.568066377317912
you only wished to imprison him   12.762978903566047
i might answer sire that he is too deeply interested in the question to be a very impartial witness   13.438208248006958
are you authorized by her majesty to communicate it to me   15.08069257299744
now say if i conceal anything from you   17.269295283959345
i am captain dantès a loyal frenchman thought accused of treason   7.527889916217569
franz likes all that is eccentric   19.76633246589826
dearest exclaimed valentine with her adorable smile awake and look at me   8.999728804569024
as for albert he was busily occupied throwing bouquets at a carriage full of roman peasants that was passing near him   11.384887673127706
yes my lord said the young man with such peculiar emphasis that the cardinal felt a shudder run through every vein   9.046921370822997
that sets my mind at rest   13.615966529603252
nothing was to be heard but oaths and blasphemies   10.811144410458855
i can not comprehend what induced you to buy three   10.82853712695479
now i recollect danglars himself passed by just as captain leclere was giving me the packet for the grand marshal   15.870826631083315
follow my advice swear and do not insult   8.689078968937771
and that running footman who waited at the door and that carriage with a coachman in grand livery who sat waiting on his seat   17.08270405954785
on a court   8.17381791043362
morrel had stepped back as morcerf approached and remained at a short distance   18.798363214618508
said mazarin thoughtfully   10.116097560647805
in a few minutes laporte was at the lodge   11.689382151889786
ah then madame i was able for one instant to be alone with you   12.494347780483228
bonacieux was to get into the carriage as if to bid her adieu and she was to take away mme   6.286117937307946
two eggs and some fruit composed my repast   12.7475992682603
valentine fetched a dictionary which she placed on a desk before noirtier   13.318078247398265
the abbess looked at her for an instant with uneasiness as if a fresh thought suggested itself to her mind   6.876660484128591
it is more important than you think perhaps   14.165016485916107
that s all right said the man   10.162829881213398
i would then rather die   9.312122400372811
the more profoundly she wounded his heart the more certainly he would avenge her   13.233242441861497
well then answered aramis pray tell me a day or two beforehand that i may take that opportunity of going to paris   10.123206468723852
there he is   15.115478466363955
everyone held the accusing paper but as usual no one liked to take upon himself the responsibility of the attack   15.080903605848192
and while reclining on the banks of his highness s pieces of water i slipped a few lines into his fish ponds   9.770430452583692
but i am speaking to you   10.779035538369723
caderousse had become so gloomy that andrea feared he should be obliged to notice the change   12.177755278464403
the monk that was shut in with me   11.953724073488376
we couldn t leave our prisoners could we   14.376602563421473
danglars as well as the rest   12.868085250774422
proof of this crime will be found on arresting him for the letter will be found upon him or at his father s or in his cabin on board the pharaon   14.601322842718588
milady let one of those looks fall upon him which make a slave of a king   14.666403327756733
said de winter cunningly   12.90010367036899
that would be to charge monsieur de séguier the keeper of the seals with this mission   13.050776306078262
felton became frightfully pale and a convulsive tremor crept through his whole body   8.107588589030067
the baroness returned the salute in the most smiling and graceful manner   13.70149562832937
the child accepted joyfully   12.186873706135405
i see her now as on her knees at my feet with her head thrown back she begged for life   17.411467199593943
i ask you if you recognize him   13.848907795964244
a man like danglars was wholly inaccessible to any gentler method of correction   11.540331088781967
loud roars of laughter and sullen murmurs arose together   11.852534904778068
what to me were all the treasures in the world or all the kings of the earth   11.423667037570768
she opened her eyes looked around her with terror saw that the apartment was empty and that she was alone with her liberator   13.95999130165557
and is she gone   12.256105256117769
d artagnan offered to lower the blinds of the royal carriage but the young king stretched out his arm saying no sir   14.734368033697415
it is i shouted a voice   8.444820706860492
but immediately through this opening twenty more shots were fired and the flame rushing up like fire from the crater of a volcano soon reached the tapestry which it quickly devoured   16.243023161812587
then tell me all you know about the catalane   9.350699879145917
the only difference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated by these two men   14.007875649500674
the soldier on guard at her door stopped as if he had been changed into stone   15.252403324848292
then he saw through the whole thing   13.00820610425139
ejaculated athos   11.878559703751383
he has lost four or five vessels and suffered by three or four bankruptcies   11.937913788976394
the affair is serious and unavoidable   6.621051788764271
andrea was so surprised that he pondered the matter for a moment   8.319449250957017
julie threw herself into his arms   13.666970667588949
but you had better not have anything to say to him for he is not a very good tempered gentleman   10.421970097502832
turning back again he said i thought i saw winter move   12.294093267668165
are we going to fight perchance   9.514869272593135
the road takes a turn he is obliged to follow it while alongside of the canal there is a shorter road   11.383964033423961
if you venture again into the house in which i have met you this evening i will dare it myself   14.06672013162592
the pates were excellent the wine delicious   12.29771362795023
why should we load ourselves with a useless burden   14.208936680455292
d artagnan mounted the box having a pair of pistols in his belt a musket under his feet and a naked sword behind him   11.996012754917077
i looked at him an instant to see if there was anything to hope from further entreaty   13.162101139308694
40114m oh sir cried barrois are you going to let me die without help   11.91214887669926
i have addressed my people and i have spoken to god   12.883839500453425
dantès possessed a prodigious memory combined with an astonishing quickness and readiness of conception   9.920930763797726
yes but i thought perhaps you had worn out all your courage the first time   17.232454753658622
but i spare your life for the sake of your sister   10.928782351586326
it is for that reason perhaps that they do not quit me   7.802135010552304
40188m florentin here   13.411077500549014
barrois touched a spring the false bottom came out and they saw a bundle of papers tied with a black string   16.834501164632464
am i not right villefort   15.153480507842804
that i am forbidden to tell   6.756834098396247
has the law ears to be melted by your sweet voice   12.38250994369482
to saint peter s first and then to the colosseum returned albert   13.970356645201267
then they were both silent   13.898941898371287
sire i believe it to be most urgent but i hope by the speed i have used that it is not irreparable   13.001825299949209
he arose and the abbé accompanied him to the door   16.34698471667094
the lackeys were ordered to act as sentinels   13.136413319251295
de tréville that you should undertake so long a journey without that necessary passport the sole resource of us poor béarnese   9.610682205269304
about half a mile from this on the same road there is an inn and about a mile further on after leaving the inn you will reach the village of greney   9.517642539707058
i approached the jeweller who was not quite dead and at the sound of my footsteps and the creaking of the floor he opened his eyes fixed them on me with an anxious and inquiring gaze moved his lips as though trying to speak then overcome by the effort fell back and expired   13.668086391008721
explain yourself for i really can not tell what you mean   12.395655528339041
do not touch the axe said the king and resumed his speech   13.689372754621932
said the doctor i did not know that i had a rival   15.374122221002782
but to leave paris if i thought happiness might await you in paris morrel i would have left you there   9.534990022332073
there is her husband changing his jacket for a coat   9.553738240923181
do you know what they are saying here   13.557714293539956
as for fernand himself he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the damned   11.868699020867282
there was therefore three quarters of an hour to wait   14.31127448046486
why did you not hear all we said   9.104929310530215
have you never had the curiosity when you have landed and found this island deserted to seek for this enchanted palace   14.749597946760561
he turned towards noirtier   13.817494984411027
edmond had all the night to work in but in the darkness he could not do much and he soon felt that he was working against something very hard   9.811497041178013
ask baron franz d épinay   9.93609215436254
and you will leave me then   12.128466745690218
and i shall have succeeded in doing nothing for you in spite of all my efforts   14.21227698508718
then did you not observe the agitation in the palais royal the passing to and fro of busy people   9.706627061553835
all at once there s a noise like a cannon that s the air blowing up the deck   8.931385919506393
ah sir he exclaimed it was you   13.985128803815469
for soliloquizing aloud as very preoccupied people do he had entered the alley at the end of which were the stairs which led to his chamber   9.72374373329479
about your own height sir   11.003835455217686
for a stranger who does not know paris said athos and to whom the viscount will show the way   10.043296166066192
but our troop horses   7.259159062192307
oh you rave sir exclaimed villefort in vain endeavoring to escape the net in which he was taken   10.946521287137996
and albert followed by franz and the count descended the staircase crossed the square chamber where stood all the bandits hat in hand   7.048634947912472
thank god i have never heard his name mentioned by any person and i hope and believe he is dead   13.841610244538458
speak on madame speak on queen said buckingham   9.60670054499494
half norman half mecklenburger   11.003156747673895
pray what does that mean   14.775552521029724
doubtless doubtless athos   10.708975283118711
then he tremblingly fixed his ladder and not to lose a moment placed his foot on the first step   7.506951534871032
in the meantime the host and his wife hurried down with lamps into the cellar which had so long been interdicted to them and where a frightful spectacle awaited them   13.120672779066993
their excellencies stretched their legs along the seats   10.495704590215695
but we do not go far from this place   8.725559812034122
he rose and preceded by the host wringing his hands and followed by planchet with his musketoon ready for use he approached the scene of action   14.75989113255174
but may i beg that the greatest haste may be made for i have reasons for wishing the vicomte not to sleep longer than to morrow night in paris   14.136545046403404
the sergeant made a sign as much as to say he did not understand french and d artagnan tried to make him comprehend by signs and gestures   16.565057258857582
i know he is a gascon reflected he but he may be one for the cardinal as well as for me   10.638762103586222
the queen will ultimately decide your place of domicile   18.176887382077396
d artagnan started off for saint germain followed by porthos   9.762738209275035
as to my orders since every one gives his own commands in our party i shall end if this goes on by giving none at all   9.588993230761247
this morning we breakfasted with him   8.547966623503848
and you fancy he will not put his maxim into execution now that he has got hold of the king   15.18769156952299
as you please said athos   10.49307251109465
my present happiness equals my past misery said the count   7.4004886171366575
but you are able to have me arrested you are able to have me tortured you are able to have me hanged   14.226785990481801
but my dear love reflect a little upon what you require of me   10.716516465215534
great people only thank you for doing the impossible   14.342321029691954
have you no letter for him   11.105954340464745
that s a frightful place that bastille   11.400742594649445
faith i do not remember the name of the hotel   14.840463736179046
he must be enormously rich   12.763767310811337
mordaunt answered only by a terrible laugh threw his torch into the sea and plunged in after it   10.466438163339244
yes signified the old man   18.122470413255833
said d artagnan with his wise smile   11.998799188199122
he told him that he came from paris on an affair of life and death and that he must speak with his master instantly   11.439317302664799
while monsieur d arminges gave orders for the horses to be made ready for departure the two young men ascended to the upper windows of the house and saw in the direction of marsin and of lens a large body of infantry and cavalry   7.810820553709419
he found himself face to face with a sergeant commanding a watch patrol   11.36824141835711
the comte de la fere is not a man   17.99261672407097
this disposition visible as it was in his majesty did not prevent the courtiers from ranging themselves along his pathway   9.827746514147538
she turned towards him with a serene smile just at the moment he was bowing to her   10.853118947284361
we have something very important to say to him   14.609069784946387
a small vessel with an english crew whose captain is on my side awaits you at the mouth of charente at fort la pointe   8.872622531700149
d artagnan alone did not seem convinced   6.652706410508331
but where are you really going   8.58272642770467
his singular host evidently resided at rome   12.185583809765058
and the party must be acquainted with english in order to ask the way to london   12.118018152289952
but she is now at length a little reassured having sent her secretary away in order that nothing may happen unexpectedly   12.783957083640235
as for porthos on whom d artagnan had impressed the necessity of absolute silence and who did not even now begin to comprehend the scheme of his friend which was to follow mazarin in his visit to athos he was simply mute   13.781156137218444
but this time there really had been fighting a triumph and a complete one   10.474358980277811
suddenly the dull beating of muffled drums filled the square   11.156871431286696
but as soon as he perceived that the orifice of the barrel was motionless he threw himself upon the ground   13.659502211175255
my lord said the young officer summoning to his mild countenance all the hatred he could find in his heart my lord i swear all shall be done as you desire   8.934600982299823
some days before the return of the emperor fernand was drafted   12.74334569649154
let me go on captain   16.232905447318256
let us be neither cardinalists nor frondists   14.635380701869714
a skilful preparation of my friend s the worthy abbé adelmonte who taught me the use of it   12.820176309264252
cavalcanti s   11.6392798975533
then let us have a match in the tennis court exclaimed la ramee   10.035316542785676
the gates had opened of themselves and the king ostensibly at least had no other guard at his bed head but his mother   13.03279857267223
cried the major taking a third biscuit   10.571772391800076
the countenance of this man who possessed such extraordinary control over his feelings expressed the most perfect cordiality   11.103761462186284
she still had her rich fair hair   11.062085769291324
the discourse being finished the queen remained silent   13.367266862274688
noirtier the helpless old man at the tender mercies of the weakest creature in the household that is his grandchild valentine   9.73947681420755
for you he said   10.983839281746663
no said felton it is nothing   12.190960235711968
then this house belonged to m   8.824484413632998
but as to what had been done by porthos and d artagnan afterward they were as ignorant as all the inhabitants of the chateau   11.222342776097433
you are the son of the marchese cavalcanti and the marchesa oliva corsinari   13.605881244049348
i recognized it on your finger   15.92156238334691
reverend sir i am impelled every criminal says the same thing   9.320002020844436
the young man knew quite well that after the succession of misfortunes which had befallen his father great changes had taken place in the style of living and housekeeping   17.947480657316998
never have we incurred a greater danger than we are now encountering   12.657861120679653
albert is ten minutes after time   20.590816849624233
a porter was passing and they gave him the portmanteau   8.960713779613178
benedetto maintained the truth of what he had said and accompanied it with details that did more honor to his imagination than to his veracity   8.957579846063332
hush we are flying   12.122938387720716
27 replied the count   10.73399689719521
albert resumed his seat and beauchamp read with more attention than at first the lines denounced by his friend   6.641870920280984
i only ask you a simple question   14.624151659035057
cried the novice with enthusiasm   14.76452686560145
do you take me for a beggar   10.596274646565526
the magistrate laid emphasis on these words as if he wished to apply them to the owner himself while his eyes seemed to plunge into the heart of one who interceding for another had himself need of indulgence   13.718998137756016
she was a most atrocious woman   9.389881719576607
monarchs are only strong by the assistance of the aristocracy but aristocracy can not survive without the countenance of monarchs   9.811447795496097
let me see saturday i am to dine at my country house at auteuil on that day rue de la fontaine no   13.654195536927773
it must be on some elevated place whence a given signal may be seen in every part of paris   11.218567897706695
as for athos they believed him to be dead and left him very quiet on the field of battle not thinking it worth the trouble to carry him away   15.2982588828368
mademoiselle eugénie scarcely answers me and mademoiselle d armilly her confidant does not speak to me at all   12.22929933029771
i am dead drunk that s all and never did a man more strongly set about getting so   12.351003066094467
he therefore quickly went to the gate in the clover patch prepared to hear the result of the proceedings and very certain that valentine would hasten to him the first moment she should be set at liberty   15.734262092842389
i am sorry he does not speak french that i might tender him my compliments   14.336191710350816
who feared the dagger at his breast and whose head was cleft with a hatchet   9.716425020751544
unfortunately said villefort there are the treaties of 1814 and we can not molest napoleon without breaking those compacts   9.771776168560464
forgive me replied morrel   14.17610821024595
he was well known at the hôtel of the musketeers where everyone considered him a good comrade   12.288208791826591
the other following an opposite direction was about to round the island of corsica   11.9294200023803
did we not swear friendship   9.38595590744288
the three gentlemen took the road to picardy a road so well known to them and which recalled to athos and aramis some of the most picturesque adventures of their youth   8.303040439379526
it is in london they must be found   8.553614462082672
it is but a dream a nightmare that has disturbed you   11.152359560751233
because i have acted like queen marie de medicis who returning from her first exile treated with contempt all those who had suffered for her and being proscribed a second time died at cologne abandoned by every one even by her own son   11.813470661767331
patrick   6.249208332599644
he must sell them at whatever price   14.243814096331253
felton snatched away the knife   10.44745676369288
the duke had already begun to descend   11.175999297100233
i have told you that i was traveling on an important mission   8.324154844617944

i answered you think so   11.322038412439547
she inquired for the convent of the carmelites and went thither immediately   15.26301135956399
bonacieux s glass the contents of a ring which she opened with singular quickness   8.984609025560152
i say we have been here eighty three hours   9.190705113432871
merely to say these words i am going to send monsieur d artagnan away and i wish him to set out directly   9.676880453293947
he felt convinced of his identity but he did not venture to address him   14.168931870711802
at one o clock then behind the luxembourg   14.53121724421105
and this done she next occupied herself in arranging his supper by spreading a napkin at the end of the table and placing on it the slender remains of their dinner to which she added three or four fresh laid eggs   10.434918209238505
i sent them to carry aid to king charles and they performed prodigies to save him   16.390381336007835
he has been hanged and quartered i hope   6.350797849697273
all at once the captain stopped as if struck by a sudden suspicion   14.445684628289595
at four o clock d artagnan recommenced his journey   12.153588950619863
nearly ten minutes passed   11.035908919912337
consent then i beg you madame to write at the bottom of this schedule which has been drawn up by mazarin as you see i consent to ratify the treaty proposed by the parisians   12.173344176439555
this letter contains important news and the expression of his respect   10.791618609154808
i said aramis in his most flutelike tone i had made up my mind   12.38233543691976
that was the reason why i left my chateau du vallon near corbeil and came to my estate bracieux   8.656034183221632
forgive my servants he said for a terror i can not blame them for   11.108168171524426
muttered danglars   16.690982259272822
to the great lady she had given a heart vile and venal   10.409968288711557
porthos understood him and he and the lieutenant each drew with the left hand a pistol from their bolsters and cocked it in their turn   8.524159328582355
i have enemies   5.777638755515044
then strike boldly   18.8786782684072
there was no doubt in my look my voice my whole person that sincerity of gesture of attitude of accent which carries conviction to the most perverse minds for he paused   15.940544670137792
the eyes of the mendicant dashed with cupidity but he quickly suppressed his emotion   12.089773765437776
everything about the count seemed to have its meaning for the constant habit of thought which he had acquired had given an ease and vigor to the expression of his face and even to the most trifling gesture scarcely to be understood   9.624194061004967
did your father serve under ali pasha   11.416081157393705
and indeed since his captivity in the château d if he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be witnessed   11.716094859839197
there he saw a lengthy chain of people gliding under the walls   9.165363196580874
villefort smiled bitterly   9.614377446656825
porthos was twisting his mustache   16.884645724140668
with your brother   12.05602051134332
give him a direct invitation but do not ask me to present him   11.740515842523376
i could interpret one of your looks   10.517934084353296
the poor duke swore fell into a rage yelled and declared that they wished to starve him to death as they had starved the marechal ornano and the grand prior of vendome   12.435510186687667
caderousse sank pale and breathless into his chair   8.831843506735266
tell me mouston said porthos are my arms in good condition   14.58497987290566
porthos the second to marry an attorney s wife   8.994392915118638
they suit each other remarkably well said danglars   10.676344285678642
shall we wait breakfast for you   8.005875503159242
as to cocles he seemed completely bewildered   8.14640534247465
wait for me   13.106967582228895
this day of reunion was the same day as that on which kitty came to find d artagnan   10.588500251447254
and this important service had established between them one of those sentiments of gratitude which so easily assume a more tender character   14.183901663506793
ah monsieur hypocrite i understand how you study theology   17.41868089927152
bicarat was a gascon as d artagnan was   5.36128325251438
at the very moment when i was about to pay you i had placed my purse on the table   10.139751570462622
in fact fortune changed   12.491945314510577
he is of no earthly use to anybody   7.472050399208695
a minute after the door by which the priest had entered reopened and monte cristo appeared   9.375864908600674
there were nobles who made war against each other   12.432512438359867
i am looking at you   10.02773001204203
well i have not intercepted your confidence and yet i know all that as well as you and i have no conscientious scruples   12.936658493836603

danglars says you are rich and perfectly free   10.143280009105812
magnificent windows so beautiful so large that i believe a man of your size should pass through each frame   7.930848228000212
de villefort was a powerful protector   14.007258045660606
you will live my lord you will live   13.907394287472812
here it is replied d artagnan taking it from his finger   7.73576649229047
give me your arm and let us go   12.544427422020732
they both stood in amazement at the door   10.300905817774007
there to his great astonishment d artagnan heard the policy which made all europe tremble criticized aloud and openly as well as the private life of the cardinal which so many great nobles had been punished for trying to pry into   16.096070634111555
ah this gentleman is a hercules killing cacus a perseus freeing andromeda   17.515700318082473
what is your pleasure with me   7.970537431304232
it was planchet but so completely transformed thanks to the old clothes that the departing husband had left behind that d artagnan himself could hardly recognize him   16.214030063812952
well he told me that benedetto who is considered a serpent of subtlety and a giant of cunning is really but a very commonplace silly rascal and altogether unworthy of the experiments that will be made on his phrenological organs after his death   13.049219822239266
you have spared me till now but since you speak of it once for all i tell you madame i do not ask you to tell me said mazarin astounded by this returning courage   4.180495271374258
splendid paintings by the first masters were ranged against the walls intermingled with magnificent trophies of war while heavy curtains of costly tapestry were suspended before the different doors of the room   10.910850093692696
the next morning she found her grandmother in bed   13.092234436536547
the window yielded   12.190565653278018
so then we are all right as regards the executioner said athos   13.493278782082523
i do not like open doors when it thunders   13.378872668984389
when i ring once it is for my valet   8.752440110885534
exclaimed the king   11.476230692210667
then upon seeing my musketeers they changed their minds and forgot their private hatred for partisan hatred   12.775710047634002
and you know who she is   10.698119683560895
with him they will be gentle and docile as lambs   18.46024671362407
athos listened to his projects then shook his head and recommended prudence to him with a shade of bitterness   16.100265080813564
well cheer up   11.5679540547589
then i became a thief and lately have become an assassin   13.278098878839993
but i make an agreement with the man who pastes up the papers and he brings them to me as he would the playbills that in case any person staying at my hotel should like to witness an execution he may obtain every requisite information concerning the time and place etc   13.914533116545826
i have your word then   10.1124296847561
and i tell you freely that the comparison i draw between you and other men will ever be one of my greatest tortures   13.550123790725447
some years only   11.340509513989781
asked major cavalcanti innocently   6.8542628748265315
in thirteen throws i had lost all in thirteen throws   4.848270349533256
go pray sir one word more my lord   9.945062179255597
i m certain of it   10.055091719845844
you are to set off said the cardinal   11.34160155717664
these four virtues disputed the prize for a length of time and gave birth to magnificent speeches which we do not repeat here for fear they should be deemed too long   11.817451358533143
but d artagnan made a friendly sign to him with his head dismounted and throwing his bridle to a lackey who was passing he approached the valet de chambre with a smile on his lips   18.159449756845227
what would you have sir   9.894147557598416
noirtier at one of the open windows where the old man had been placed that he might enjoy the last rays of the sun which yet yielded some heat and was now shining upon the dying flowers and red leaves of the creeper which twined around the balcony   12.544996932952266
your eminence means monsieur d artagnan   8.861855524189615
no one answered to his first knocking   10.788636729787655
the marines were removed   9.460365719794229
i told you the day before yesterday to bring them with you   13.531215422990034
i am so unhappy   15.274915983323698
whispered planchet   12.730232323170101
well planchet how is the good monsieur de wardes   13.856445032297621
just as my mother was on the point of pushing open a small door we heard the voice of the pasha sounding in a loud and threatening tone   12.308526358684059
monte cristo took a paper from his pocket upon which were drawn three signs with numbers to indicate the order in which they were to be worked   9.838346950556241
all three agreed to meet at noon in whitehall place to see how things went on   13.018758910867678
i went too   13.850592004366074
that s porthos all over murmured d artagnan   12.048362561282318
repeated the traveller in an accent of indescribable sadness   19.774033313957684
at that moment buckingham was throwing upon a couch a rich toilet robe worked with gold in order to put on a blue velvet doublet embroidered with pearls   14.792202354206847
yes said porthos we have mousqueton but since he has been steward he has become very heavy   9.010307028706853
i bought some spanish shares   11.95519191155114
how many are they   14.191568527489355
what are my servants   15.009956529871975
said tréville not to accept the proposal i am about to make to you   9.222457201776944
yes how do you know it   9.992385910268013
has changarnier been killed   11.233854535752565
valentine sank weeping into a chair   10.836169027502796
milady s son   15.707942153651715
bravo count bravo   9.533438098143721
as long as i don t fight with him it is the same to me with whom i fight   9.767358986292354
the young king leaned toward the door   15.488342945970093
and who is this wretch   7.152035286139729
bernouin said the cardinal not turning round for having whistled he knew that it was his valet de chambre who was behind him   9.882246572390848
arrived at the foot of the bastion there were still more than a dozen of the enemy   16.841357105114305
and by the time they have found out the pleasantry we shall be out of the range of their balls   10.375405890729159
and now continued he you must change your clothes   12.042914764011494
d artagnan saw it all through an opening he had made in the curtain and in the very first man who entered he recognized planchet   10.827084712256179
all the delicacies in fact that are cast up by the wash of waters on the sandy beach and styled by the grateful fishermen fruits of the sea   12.250883066928138
fifteen thousand francs do you understand   12.545984523995331
but this secret is not mine and i can not reveal it in this manner   9.2741977358168
the cardinal s refusal to pay the pension was known about the town in half an hour and he was abused with wit and vehemence   14.219568878057949
d arminges and olivain and the two grooms then mounted their horses and all four started off at a quick trot to rejoin raoul and his companion   18.898518730460758
danglars mentioned that in a visit which i paid him   16.280491172808322
but this was not the case   8.98798281765815
you will not sign that order my lord   9.829113759928141
d avrigny which he now examined so closely   6.8693610072189415
why are not my frenchmen here   14.132508103292441
before the door the traces were yet more apparent   12.27776308828175
there was more than benevolence in this action   13.11503562316253
accustomed however as he was to the work he had to repeat most of the letters of the alphabet and to find every word in the dictionary so that it was ten minutes before the thought of the old man was translated by these words fetch the glass of water and the decanter from valentine s room   9.371121756950691
this reassures me more than all the royal signatures thought d artagnan   14.533149767293683
it was for your interest i albert does not say you are a liar signor pastrini said franz but that he will not believe what you are going to tell us but i will believe all you say   11.27429250432909
inquired d artagnan fixing his eyes on the corpse   13.790923687504606
they are going to drag her away cried d artagnan to himself springing up from the floor   12.01591669386923
but the notes did it injury   9.760938482142613
his opponent stirred not one inch   9.081170218132025
i name only the most important   10.125475157178363
he had the fiery eyes that seem to penetrate to the very soul and the haughty and disdainful upper lip that gives to the words it utters a peculiar character that impresses them on the minds of those to whom they are addressed   8.804716375918918
why did you so maladroitly restore me the handkerchief   14.753766167536481
when he arose a second time he was fifty paces from where he had first sunk   17.00688916045677
if dead to deny him the rites of christian burial   11.160690478171546
the queen smiled   11.084720009862657
he is quite unaware of them and i have but one fear which is that he should disapprove of what i have done   7.6749969366537965
besides you will strike at the throat porthos   12.426520839771737
drink and relate then   11.923324376541
and if you can bring château renaud with you   9.787763967970633
that is the least we owe her   9.725282997241566
one now and then i don t say much about   11.396294856218386
well then it appears that we are the crœsuses of the society   11.962933965497676
one terrible idea pressed upon her mind that someone existed in the world who had attempted to assassinate her and who was about to endeavor to do so again   8.709695525244683
that will give me time to pay him   14.562348202337335
he asked where their masters were and was informed that they had passed the night in the inn and were then settling their bill with the host   11.622062048194712
you are still growing athos continued with that charming and paternal interest felt by a grown man for a youth   12.260496692705845
and i have also a deep conviction that heaven would not have created two hearts harmonizing as ours do and almost miraculously brought us together to separate us at last   13.037451952949723
your mother albert knows that poor house well   10.703308764252647
i can tell you but one thing sir for the secret you wish to know is not my own   13.85097170608439
27 rue du helder paris   15.484002079733209
de tréville a thing which considering the habitual reticence of the worthy musketeer had very much astonished his captain   12.590277632126146
but what attached him to the cause   9.229143277465313
my friend said athos i have made a resolution never to draw my sword save when it is absolutely necessary   14.595358025081072
the same impression was experienced by all present and no one was deceived by the expression of his countenance   11.169112589855324
we must wait for aramis   12.759795074139566
this kind of life fatigues and oppresses me   10.639918158527715
well valentine resumed maximilian i can only say again that you are right   10.928710657512333
d artagnan was well known among the honorable corps of the king s musketeers in which it was known he would one day take his place   17.607152460270008
then he pressed the hand the baroness reluctantly gave him and led her respectfully back to the door   12.97327797396687
that is all very fine benedetto mio but i know what i am saying   13.381327288667098
for a whim   11.525213988401601
as she would not appear to be agitated by the threats of lord de winter she placed herself at the table and ate   8.422951794337596
i will offer six millions and i will content myself with the rest if they will only give me my liberty   10.926805992353371
in case of necessity i might also climb up but my two horses can not mount the ladder   5.050487384115255
i had told you that there was brucine in the mixture i give you   7.366934391529502
the deuce he is well guarded then   15.041937962736888
felton was indeed behind the door and had not lost one word of this scene   10.741275348795643
20053m maximilian my dearest brother   13.50643132032669
30 in the avenue des champs élysées that the count of monte cristo lived and who being answered by the porter in the affirmative entered closed the gate after him and began to ascend the steps   10.95714592292918
we will keep a sharp lookout for them   17.54938437654177
d artagnan has turned aside from buckingham whom she hates as she hates everyone she has loved the tempest with which richelieu threatened him in the person of the queen   13.283270308083887
ten kicks on his back   8.185168836953675
i am aware of that and i have told him a hundred times that he was wrong   17.98142530411226
but i would give you one piece of advice which you will do well to keep in mind   7.800804878621317
are you really in such a hurry that you have no time to pass the time of day with your friends   9.18611785649214
why it was won by a horse and rider utterly unknown on the course   12.790881405890044
then aloud well my dear la ramee   14.460398118890318
what a question so truly french   14.54170111396585
well said porthos this is my advice speak   9.265298496596262
my slow and stiff motions all attested that the effects of the narcotic were not yet entirely dissipated   12.19531338538306
let us make a compact   5.72845383711547
you have had three horses foundered or killed   14.48857097115528
you know wine is a deceiver   10.579249395213068
the count of monte cristo offered his arm to madame de villefort   9.231171026531559
he used to be the headsman of bethune   9.379857307472848
but fortunately the world is a sepulcher   9.771054359380372
oh exclaimed haydée is it not yet over   14.648360206224721
have you cords to bind him with and a gag to stop his mouth   7.415331145459899
ambroise and i repeat marie michon was an adorable creature   10.953926476339127
valentine in the extremity of her terror joined her hands for she felt that the moment had arrived to ask for courage and began to pray and while uttering little more than incoherent words she forgot that her white shoulders had no other covering than her long hair and that the pulsations of her heart could be seen through the lace of her nightdress   11.025356382914874
i suppose you mean continued d artagnan   11.472365638983913
however because i was prudent you must not take me for a fool   8.032750384780757
remember that i loved you   7.219031651764505
i wrote the word finis at the end of the sixty eighth strip about a week ago   8.772153338468554
but for the intention only for the information you must agree is not likely to be at all agreeable   12.770157856015878
this method was so simple that d artagnan employed it quite naturally and instinctively   12.395882161807547
lieutenant d artagnan   14.648218530860465
we are going to reach the nearest seaport unite our little resources hire a vessel and return to france   10.028405921766465
this woman is full of mysteries murmured d artagnan to himself   10.590693702500461
what do you say to it   9.800057711102706
he walked to the window and looked into the court   8.290881471314663
guitant and comminges at the head of the guards marched first   12.717672963757314
you have at some wicket of the louvre a concierge who is devoted to you and who thanks to a password would mme   14.012488913489229
oh sir in pity send for a physician   12.432391777044078
if he passes over into france his cause is lost   15.542878461337269
is he dead   5.089996549796004
you had begun to pervert my poor felton   14.610826504155792
whenever this occurred although it proceeded only from goodwill and a desire to see the king and queen anne looked at d artagnan anxiously   14.396555310378085
you know raoul grimaud is an old and zealous servant   9.053605622238814
the fusillade continued   12.439760632106163
so much the better replied monte cristo   15.871175623992261
d artagnan swore loud enough to be heard in the skies   11.006002221299822
said aramis to juxon   5.628198728975368
he himself had given a plan to bertuccio marking the spot where each tree was to be planted and the shape and extent of the lawn which was to take the place of the paving stones   11.788916091705108
when i first came here   10.0288700249297
debray and five or six other choice spirits whom you do not know even by name   12.751546617259498
now should any letters or other documents of a compromising character be found upon him will it not be taken for granted that all who uphold him are his accomplices   15.322810402661155
yet it is probable on the contrary that we shall enter because we seem to have to do with sensible people   9.074830958937465
but watch over him   10.067202322518924
because they have but fulfilled the mission confided to them by queen henrietta and we have betrayed that confided to us by mazarin   12.306868882995353
you are in prison then   12.276508007629412
look well at that man   8.466283094837879
no the change in mercédès was that her eye no longer sparkled her lips no longer smiled and there was now a hesitation in uttering the words which formerly sprang so fluently from her ready wit   7.989503525507736
you are only betrayed   10.433568305897946
tréville was one of these latter   13.618233681544439
pray excuse me madame replied monte cristo but i never eat muscatel grapes   6.3731841992957765
overcome by example grumbling to himself nevertheless porthos stretched out his hand and the four friends repeated with one voice the formula dictated by d artagnan all for one one for all   12.86464843678695
those imbeciles of magicians can only imagine things to torment honest people   15.02891546605412
thanks to the garden we yet can flee   13.283132914676862
and you are well aware that from the collision of clouds electricity is produced from electricity lightning from lightning illumination   8.5136720490693
the carriage stopped at an alley leading out of the rue saint jacques   4.690856443141582
lord de winter warned of your arrival at portsmouth   15.265384504342896
now suppose that next day one of these eels or pike or carp poisoned at the fourth remove is served up at your table   11.160876251410777
replied d artagnan recognizing athos who after the dressing performed by the doctor was returning to his own apartment   18.99428240914107
it would be unpardonable   12.63376059445672
she allowed therefore half an hour to pass away   10.629938167634602
let him come in   10.629349299960491
you will do me honor monsieur said d artagnan   19.653911922944662
have they then offered a large one   13.136229542025537
speak i am ready to obey   13.527288957475832
at the first we ran to the door and at the second forced it open   11.71525729251572
oh if you really are attached to your old mode of dress   13.133337101935817
you know the history of the saraband   8.865899536231346
will you enter this carriage and that without offering the least resistance without making the least noise   8.544263037053081
the people have seen monsieur de condé a prince of the blood royal arrested by my mother in law maria de medicis   7.605032465059671
however in an hour i shall know all   13.44807332863907
but wounded without doubt killed perhaps   12.356511961022196
who is this monsieur oliver cromwell   15.050957400130011
i hope i shall gain renée s favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on me   12.052751329955642
i am not speaking riddles and you will soon know what i mean   9.679007976933503
you will see that i had no time to learn it   9.86867140155916
he is thinking of groslow   11.186431847926595
the horse and servant belonging to de winter were waiting for him at the door   12.92003807806131
morrel turned away to conceal the confusion of his countenance   16.161750192671963
and what favor pray   13.988792725035392
once out to sea you are too good a politician not to understand the rest mordaunt   12.461064020074346
there are only said the gendarme a governor a garrison turnkeys and good thick walls   17.731664368356128
there are gendarmes who occupy themselves with such affairs judges who condemn and scaffolds which avenge   13.349331362184557
let us horsewhip the fine gentleman   14.450709289688174
but you do not know how long that arrest lasted   13.047053608094025
that is to say soldiers   11.103502099318664
it is my father who has just left his study   12.023055595191998
there was a brief silence during which the fixed searching eye of the abbé was employed in scrutinizing the agitated features of the innkeeper   9.800829543183388
certainly everyone who has come from palermo naples or rome to france by sea must know it since he has passed close to it and must have seen it   15.408891021861436
why said she you could plant one of the chestnut trees in the tuileries inside   15.896088813057473
mazarin was desirous of setting out instantly for saint germain but the queen declared that she should wait for the people whom she had appointed to meet her   13.389027923448285
cavalcanti as the count s father who highly approved of the union regretted his inability to leave parma at that time and promised a wedding gift of a hundred and fifty thousand livres   11.773683734681088
gentlemen said the duke i will thank you later   5.949399511907111
here s a rendezvous much more serious than the other   11.48551396875034
as soon as possible m   13.576726433418832
tell me their names   10.095130758140176
15 ask the porter for the key of the room on the fifth floor enter the apartment take from the corner of the mantelpiece a purse netted in red silk and give it to your father   10.822155224419308
i shall then be certain not to fail in my hospitality   15.32352035758109
noirtier having at the commencement of the discussion been attacked by a sort of apoplectic fit the affair would necessarily be deferred for some days longer   9.21139693418122
my mother has noticed him and he must therefore perforce be remarkable   11.081420719133531
gives me pain but will not prevent my walking   16.799170658307844
look at me well in your turn   10.37753063723883
you think resumed mazarin that rochefort he was cardinal richelieu s creature my lord   10.123100182818566
thus the day passed away   7.216478431948712
and will he talk thus of affairs in presence of two strangers   7.661982514517794
it is something to hit inside the ring   16.62990579645306
will you allow me father   7.672971554314811
but a mother has twofold sight   6.648757541729252
yes i have need of it   7.298370320066086
how is it that you have no friends in your prosperity when you had many in adversity   11.15168190538038
he was very successful upon that question   7.414170519932932
on the left was an old abandoned mill with its motionless wings from the ruins of which an owl threw out its shrill periodical and monotonous cry   6.697284923558187
there is the hullabaloo louder than ever   14.25972301535267
his hair cut straight in holy guise covered his forehead as far as his eyebrows   12.551738765205428
grimaud nodded   14.674811215638009
madame i never eat muscatel grapes replied monte cristo as if the subject had not been mentioned before   9.557180364560676
may i ask if you have any news of him   10.765807116761016
gentlemen continued he addressing the guardsmen i request you will be silent with regard to this adventure   13.379531536269054
her husband is only my brother in law that is a man whom the ties of social life alone attach to me   9.286627197131983
that shoots me said the swiss   10.855750928903072
replied the gascon   12.784140397968315
noirtier stopped him at the last named sum   15.17793266107195
it must have been delirium   15.511276002760102
but not before one o clock replied d artagnan   12.710094378125348
the punishment of death replied d artagnan   11.345568647764646
exclaimed porthos tis astonishing how empty violent agitation makes the stomach   12.925876019627193
the young girl trembled very much at hearing the stories   15.978163840373318
ah you have reflected   17.13941585899519
it would be a dishonor to all the nobility   10.839469382722163
the cardinal knocked three times and in a peculiar manner   10.262404074223399
allowing his head to sink upon his two hands he pretended to sleep   10.47368947369742
and who is this friend   10.956141609066751
and the steward followed the notary out of the room   10.265019779413937
what could this treachery be   10.468764637670848
d artagnan drew his sword and sprang toward the door   13.173692307321698
mouston appeared with a most piteous face   12.644728520093357
i give you his very words   14.035612345163809
the host his mind at ease about his bill placed pen ink and paper upon the table   6.7307927861451295
at this very moment the court is making overtures to me   11.27646272447193
he extended his hands and drank greedily of the rainwater that had lodged in a hollow of the rock   13.984343095644821
the deputy procureur du roi in one of the aristocratic mansions built by puget in the rue du grand cours opposite the medusa fountain a second marriage feast was being celebrated almost at the same hour with the nuptial repast given by dantès   8.51135094421632
the marshal bit his fingers   9.898536792173294
i am prepared for anything   9.75714336597883
their fathers died before them and they mourned their loss   11.993880375299103
adapt your promises to their respective characters   16.87014491629182
i am hungry that is all   10.408581761217812
that which would now be considered as disgraceful to a gentleman was at that time quite a simple and natural affair and the younger sons of the best families were frequently supported by their mistresses   14.298856585492484
then jumping on his horse with the elegance of a first rate esquire after bowing to athos and d artagnan he went off close by the door of the carriage on somebody inside of which his eyes were riveted   9.787233535855147
but worn out as i was with fatigue and fully purposing to proceed onwards directly the tempest abated i determined to obtain a few hours sleep   11.544974991340514
in fact at the end of a few minutes the belfry of st   11.34415264783151
i had thrown the body into the river and those words which my remorse repeats to me are those which i in my pride pronounced   15.213395520234037
monsieur de st   11.839168523465775
george villiers placed himself before the glass as we have said restored the undulations to his beautiful hair which the weight of his hat had disordered twisted his mustache and his heart swelling with joy happy and proud at being near the moment he had so long sighed for he smiled upon himself with pride and hope   13.293129778405685
i became very pale   11.030801597600856
still at the hotel of the great charlemagne   11.211010115947191
oh monsieur you can write as much as you like   10.47220505628857
you ought then to have a good hand   10.666818946091364
and he stepped on one side to give place to a young man of refined and dignified bearing with large and open brow piercing eyes and black moustache whom our readers have already seen at marseilles under circumstances sufficiently dramatic not to be forgotten   12.48161714714115
red and black tapestry such was the appearance of lord wilmore s drawing room   15.27834261004521
no sound was audible save that of the carriages that were carrying the maskers home   18.809223065931462
the cardinal was speaking to him in a low voice and the king was very pale   7.7647211484211045
they talk of making him an ambassador   5.438214841697527
ah sir indeed you would inspire me with pity were you not hateful in my eyes   6.604954057750753
she said i saw but i can not believe   7.207471296130461
what country does he come from   10.363721551834015
preoccupied as madame danglars had been with the object of her visit the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so insulting that she began by complaining of it   19.959983414877286
so little was it a dream that i stretched my hand towards the bell   9.347395525544359
no i said very well sir you have gained the victory   10.155923738658966
nothing for the present   13.557756172460563
in fact ten minutes had scarcely passed away when the door of the king s closet opened and m   13.410435858975745
let me see what time it is   8.753725575335455
but she exclaimed suddenly arsenic is indelible indestructible   11.034952671818623
raoul was directing his horse toward the unhappy man in danger   11.764023726575994
and where is it   8.993810365641485
undeniably   10.177114225170836
the englishman received his thanks with the phlegm peculiar to his nation   10.166141991282322
by paying for it of course as among honest folk   14.76428753144514
my clerks are honest men who earn my fortune whom i pay much below their deserts if i may value them according to what they bring in   11.402141644015709
in person and fortunately it seems for you my young friend   14.583547889224214
i create nothing   14.284990060296156
disguised as a monk he discovered the whole history in confession from the executioner of bethune and having confessed him after having learned everything from him he gave him absolution by planting this dagger into his heart   14.38434128586332
i wish i were on board already and he looked back again   13.088707984739422
i came to tell you that i hate you instinctively   8.83490333269745
upon your honor   8.874810525830181
porthos agreed to the bargain   10.61994003996984
yes yes said monte cristo   11.669983265059045
without seeing mademoiselle valentine   9.172065448300161
he examined the broken stock calculated what change it would require to adapt the gun to his shoulder and made a fresh stock so beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen or twenty piastres had he chosen to sell it   11.061516791729908
then came the question of gallantry and love affairs   15.684726117046193
do you think so sir   12.73350134118371
indeed when placed beside m   14.288644254120085
cried renée clasping her hands and looking towards her lover with piteous earnestness be merciful on this the day of our betrothal   16.222309650826368
so now i breathe again i am happy   9.51886845238965
she descended and went through the passage   13.133644263528842
but this gesture being repeated he left the ranks and advanced to receive orders   10.861007452300182
that count of monte cristo is an original who loves to look at the sky even at night   16.141970741431297
an officer as he spoke entered the apartment   14.31856421701719
then commencing a loud whistling noise he rubbed them well all over their bodies for several minutes   13.741256804894576
and besides they say that the culprit is an infamous scoundrel who killed with a log of wood a worthy canon who had brought him up like his own son   17.124257735200885
it glistened with such extraordinary joy so rich and full of thought that the physician was struck   12.84762341266656
at eleven o clock came in his turn duhallier captain of the guards bringing with him fifty archers who were distributed immediately through the hôtel de ville at the doors assigned them   12.329151225228122
monsieur de beaufort in common with many other prisoners was bent upon doing things that were prohibited   14.945196737157785
at the time when he decided on his profession his father had no desire to choose for him but had consulted young maximilian s taste   11.349042728378521
long life to his eminence   14.675639813619808
a friend of ten years standing could not have done more for us or with a more perfect courtesy   15.171632222897212
can i not escape   10.137962450520568
chapter xx   12.959920777681921
i think it is the wind   13.393929405792019
she draws only fifteen feet   11.923582579632619
his chin strongly marked denoted that strength of will which in the ordinary britannic type denotes mostly nothing but obstinacy   13.323408992610894
grimaud in fact brought back five horses   12.136043779396182
just then madame de villefort in the act of slipping on her dressing gown threw aside the drapery and for a moment stood motionless as though interrogating the occupants of the room while she endeavored to call up some rebellious tears   19.371574942822228
asked dantès with much surprise   13.06969477178825
but d artagnan had on the preceding day served his apprenticeship   5.436394633038686
but i who saw him in his dying moments i say he died of caderousse paused   10.220217451277133
after which the cardinal who had been informed that d artagnan was arrested and who was anxious to see him took leave of the king inviting him to come the next day to view the work already done upon the dyke   11.789594272952211
it closed after him with a spring   13.588540251207835
one of his guns was swung over his shoulder gaetano had the other and a sailor held his rifle   7.319625436638609
they found raoul near his tent reclining on a truss of hay of which his horse stole some mouthfuls   14.625506999651872
half past one only   11.676019850737028
said the major half aloud   13.598080905287134
now you are rich said monte cristo   12.386563789049072
yes replied aramis i am extremely careful of my appearance   13.197927437916338
franz congratulated albert who received his congratulations with the air of a man conscious that they are merited   16.661363653351625
mousqueton trembled   8.267451146479592
in the home of the witty abbé dwelt incessant laughter   13.252103242302475
ma foi my dear viscount you are fated to hear music this evening   18.879569545735702
i listen i am waiting to hear   7.701494106608015
mazarin replied only by a groan   13.535186628966807
i am admiring three magnificent horses which the stable boys are leading about   10.655898174674387
there appeared in his journal last night but wait and read for yourself   14.297647071894163
bonacieux his name age condition and abode   10.407523316111028
he must be called upon and so ascertain if the thing be true or not   9.226391649890953
instead of being astonished let me dress myself   13.27681903905182
you will find him quite enthusiastic   8.913819335774676
and d artagnan gave feature for feature a description of the comte de wardes   5.498694274634122
the doctors anxious for my lungs had prescribed the air of naples   11.873743492436425
mordaunt knelt down and fastened one end of the train to the spigot in order that he might have nothing to do but to set it on fire at the opposite end with the match   12.209641226608275
that is my condemnation thought d artagnan   15.616658323718058
the next moment he darted to the door and knocked down two of the soldiers who guarded it before they had time to cock their muskets   13.897356110326909
he therefore shaped his course toward that place and dismounted at the dauphin d or   12.535189649733098
well then it is to see a thing on which i have sometimes mused for hours together   9.866911516052589
with this needle said the abbé as opening his ragged vestments he showed dantès a long sharp fish bone with a small perforated eye for the thread a small portion of which still remained in it   6.871563556006607
that health which excellent my dear friend   11.035792479873052
oh were i not a foreigner   16.199009266988945
some of the chieftains left the ranks and broke their swords in two   15.94030841269998
the king is really very handsome said porthos   11.503656422696256
said he to himself misfortune is over my head   7.334960362908923
that which we do not understand   13.838797834381348
he opened his eyes   11.00884834542288
project gutenberg ebooks may be modified and printed and given away you may do practically anything in the united states with ebooks not protected by u   12.091585955296669
said monte cristo feigning uneasiness   12.754542810645377
his story however had over ours all the advantage of the animation of living things over the coldness of dead things   13.88941771892315
i would almost answer for planchet   11.793041156890352
we are discovered   19.428730145504147
i die after my own manner i die exhausted and broken spirited as i fall asleep when i have paced three thousand times round my cell that is thirty thousand steps or about ten leagues   17.293765944371415
was it ali asked the count of morcerf who rescued my son from the hands of bandits   7.325282951368063
because we should run straight on to the island of rion   13.331452627313073
i have always observed that they bandage people s eyes who penetrate enchanted palaces for instance those of raoul in the huguenots and really i have nothing to complain of for what i see makes me think of the wonders of the arabian nights   13.535689730017513
excuse me abbé said the envoy of the prefect of the police but the light tries my eyes very much   10.769740862298896
when he had passed one group he began to breathe more freely   10.930703640982093
and tomorrow when you awake you shall find a collection of costumes with which you will be satisfied   10.967985854528834
i bless and love you my dear son   16.433088629059874
they are young and cheerful they are tenderly attached to each other and with twenty five thousand francs a year they fancy themselves as rich as rothschild   9.559116402435405
ah said the englishman is it you my master   12.499055966974641
but beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young man and perhaps in that of the old man many repressed desires many stifled sighs which found vent when faria was left alone and when edmond returned to his cell   9.9844787875076
still more   5.291742566655833
come he said it is only a veiled lady some foreign princess perhaps the mother of cavalcanti   7.980318426761442
is there anyone in the lobby   13.802053579598091
no with a relation   11.275541516399466
acknowledge therein the receipt of the cash and i will hand you over the money   8.513488262204344
we learn this from the memoirs of a man who was concerned in some few of these defeats and in many of these victories   10.296985155209944
it seemed as if a flow of blood had ascended from the chest to the head   14.519185098559495
said d artagnan looking at aramis as he had looked at athos   5.956602527472311
cried the stranger   13.947666828169604
now leave me or i will summon my servants to throw you out at the door   14.168791384634622
alas no sir replied andrea with a sigh still more remarkable than the former ones   12.063306551353184
the four young men waited ten minutes a quarter of an hour twenty minutes   13.158257487327285
quite the contrary   6.555988886119772
gentlemen continued the stranger since you do not recognize a man who probably owes his life to you twice i must name myself   9.036651005544996
in the position of porthos d artagnan would have been perfectly happy   12.604551610244265
chapter xlviii   9.969756080471683
and although i was certain he was at home he would not make any answer   15.963578340890418
well with the five minutes grace we have only ten left   10.801917332226306
five minutes afterward the wheels of the carriage and the horses shoes were heard resounding on the pavement of the courtyard   14.780743964186048
mouston s suggestion appear to you full of sense   7.326322680151976
but you say you do not wish to kill me   13.069666540170493
and while breakfasting they held it for two hours against the enemy and have killed i don t know how many rochellais   12.209579619723263
all paris rung with the praises of madame danglars beautiful horses and i had the folly to desire to know whether they really merited the high praise given to them   11.4732702695709
he took a pencil tore a page from his tablets and wrote my dear marshal in an hour lens will be in the enemy s possession   13.650384123612623
de tréville the elegant and noble courtier athos in his most cheerful days might advantageously sustain a comparison   12.69015178334543
the very anticipations of delight to be enjoyed in his forthcoming visits the bright pure gleam of heavenly happiness it diffused over the almost deadly warfare in which he had voluntarily engaged illumined his whole countenance with a look of ineffable joy and calmness as immediately after villefort s departure his thoughts flew back to the cheering prospect before him of tasting at least a brief respite from the fierce and stormy passions of his mind   8.810294098673578
oh we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin is a glorious monument   12.44798578668798
do not believe what albert is telling you countess   12.726226244793216
i too cried mousqueton saw them also   18.674602824902365
he quietly regained his seat and wrote under the other lines i bequeath to maximilian morrel captain of spahis and son of my former patron pierre morrel shipowner at marseilles the sum of twenty millions a part of which may be offered to his sister julie and brother in law emmanuel if he does not fear this increase of fortune may mar their happiness   13.932254123200467
he simply wrote nothing to be done   9.564053391313106
you may easily imagine with what eagerness i welcomed him and how minutely i related the whole of what i had seen and heard   14.781220486453792
the sun is not shining said morrel more alarmed by noirtier s expression than by valentine s indisposition   14.760003929092989
what was   14.542847315478303
there one may learn for instance what out of regard to your nervous susceptibility i will inform you of in the drawing room namely that the credit of a banker is his physical and moral life   15.581853051545549
do i   8.093345770653414
the queen walked first every one followed her   16.02737034720069
the unfortunate barrois has been poisoned said d avrigny and i will maintain this assertion before god and man   7.988997956880882
but i must discover who pursues me with this hatred and when i have found him i shall kill him or he will kill me   11.994610277440186
well sir do as you will with me   12.24945606942343
said the banker   15.1653736636924
you said you had an idea said athos   8.6070092009544
indiscretion oh you make us happy by giving us an excuse for expatiating on this subject   11.787749193064
but though he hadn t strength to speak he had enough for action   9.17392644827879
nay said the count   16.706328310199115
he had learned that the pretended message from anne of austria upon the faith of which he had come to paris was a snare   7.311945007642521
i have nothing to do with these things why hold me responsible   10.859199255975664
there were then as now a crowd of young and pretty women who came to st   13.391494973634074
in fact night had come on during this conversation and with night the storm which had been threatening for the last half hour   11.331342979533986
that is enough   11.984060535777187
not for a stranger said debray but for a friend i might perhaps   4.6412924082122515
a gascon a match for cupid the evening so impatiently waited for by porthos and by d artagnan at last arrived   14.46968869283579
when i call you chevalier it is in presenting you to my guests that they may know who you are   11.463483804267716
ask yourself wherefore after rescuing the infant from its living grave you did not restore it to its mother   9.864245081083748
on the sea   12.565754876809539
franz continued the president then sought to make him speak more explicitly but m   10.426848861276468
and even if she were to be seriously offended i could well understand it   13.236334596555729
but what is the meaning of all these questions   13.397415901502146
and i was reflecting on what my instinct had told me in the darkest corner of the stable when a man wrapped in a cloak and followed by two other men came in   10.861284143217777
you who are accustomed to the palaces of italy can amuse yourself by calculating in how many square feet a young man who is not the worst lodged in paris can live   5.0098373381136145
dantès glanced that way as he lifted the gourd to his mouth   14.322678535606805
and who knows it   13.619253791642528
they have rarely been successful   6.39105972970805
which seems to me to leave no room for doubt since you are dressed as a cavalier and not as an officer of musketeers   14.48261778168064
de monte cristo has only shown us kindness   10.11991415327634
mazarin is better lodged said aramis   12.811913644049248
silver simply round coins with the head of some monarch or other on them   6.89646956413991
he did well   11.359254701572103
i want to know what crime i have committed to be tried   10.484842538682972
nevertheless this morning she looked handsomer than usual for her eyes had all the sparkle inward satisfaction adds to expression   12.296631620938463
ah said the priest in a marked italian accent   11.146883760000534
that house is one inhabited by my friend and that friend is aramis   12.964094976825237
thirty crowns   12.280180482417896

tell the comte de la fere to come to me said madame de chevreuse i want to speak to him   12.959010420363912
and placing in his breast the treasure he had just found which was more valuable to him than the richest jewel he rushed out of the corridor and reaching his boat cried to marseilles   11.295036626327079
i was so bewildered by your departure and so overcome with grief at our separation that i am sure i was able to but very feebly express all the affection and gratitude i feel toward you   12.312527771652205
so much the worse for thee for harm may come of it   9.811471738481181
i fear it   9.218188068533559
but the count disregarding his cry continued to wring the bandit s wrist until his arm being dislocated he fell first on his knees then flat on the floor   14.84081965003621

and the troop continued their route   15.285852273383787
that was that he should kill me   13.66157985120468
it fit his finger as if made for it   11.873279661337637

in ten minutes the masters slept   7.95438550371511
but i have not seen your father   11.41477059645763
then extending his hand towards one of the pistols he said there is one for you and one for me thanks   12.03410963289598
morrel replied villefort   15.149807943675436

all eyes were turned for a moment towards the procureur who sat as motionless as though a thunderbolt had changed him into a corpse   5.684509377773608
let us drop the subject and adopt the middle course of delay which implies neither a rupture nor an engagement   12.876456259292615
cried rochefort   11.429810858861508

then i am also a puzzle to your mother   10.976859064413912

because it has instilled a new passion in your heart that of vengeance   6.975131153379558
d artagnan is right said athos   9.966082556817264

monsieur de gondy   12.498269348389881
then perceiving for the first time the garb of the traveller he had to entertain caderousse hastily exclaimed a thousand pardons   8.02783974601883
so much the worse for you for by such conduct you have lost my esteem and my patronage   8.260528961551852
my daughter mademoiselle danglars   10.774311181048603

if you know why don t you tell   13.673755130079849
the pope therefore blesses with the fingers   11.40381560309987
well and what does it signify whether it was he or i   13.945895262595048
let me know always where to find you   18.027019006578428
however much the ballet might have claimed his attention franz was too deeply occupied with the beautiful greek to take any note of it   15.327672958812592
demanded milady with a tone of the most touching ingenuousness   15.540433330190812
do you bring me tidings of my guardian   9.518288416116839
ah true a diplomatist   13.912807464081366
i will not make a confidant of him   9.414195440659961
said porthos looking around   15.778811239643403
you marry a money bag label it is true   16.812583130275872
and i for my part have a somewhat hazardous expedition for this evening and shall not be sorry i confess to fortify myself with a few glasses of good old burgundy   12.098128533712886
did you know them   17.640121483419566
i have just received my courier from greece said danglars   19.659145535115872
a galley slave escaped from confinement at toulon   15.424551420536442
neither can we procure horses   8.240192696251741
villefort and d avrigny exchanged looks   15.218352750811883
the first movement of d artagnan was to return it but milady added no no   9.830909785108535
i admit even that in my darkest moments i find consolation in that remembrance   15.244117638939734
we have the gates   13.656707842655557
the aperture was finished and athos passed through it carrying the clothes destined for the king wrapped in black cloth and the tools with which he was to open a communication with the king s room   10.939405987841884
if on the other side it was not she which was still quite possible for the little light that remained rendered a mistake easy might it not be the commencement of some plot against him through the allurement of this woman for whom his love was known   15.302338128590602
what fault do you find with the fellow   13.347167889521078
and as to the other papers they sent a man off with the pilot to whom i gave them   12.464909995219251
cried she two thousand livres   11.55852214535823
the days of expectation are long and d artagnan in particular would have wagered that the days were forty four hours   8.01490095528073
no replied athos it is not the search of mazarin that i fear   16.97983060979906
each time you have applied to me said the doctor it has been too late   15.46572126269399
and my wife on her part has sworn to me by all that s sacred that she does not know   9.205889567664649
nevertheless sir you see i have answered your first appeal although certainly the conversation must be much more painful for me than for you   10.396207057844872
my end will be achieved before i grow old   8.003292933854006
nearly nine o clock why i shall not get back to beaucaire before midnight   10.706092116104411
have you no friends who could assist you   13.597141216858027
how had he discovered her arrival and caused her to be seized   7.329110690667951
the riot   8.525952014013331
and what is the origin of this name   8.425091129406184
and moreover my dear duke continued the minister of police we are almost assured that in a very short time the usurper will be insane   9.180247389232855
only added he with a smile i warn you i know very little   13.7344207459433
ah said morrel one quits a dungeon in a week a month or a year   11.324477629718691
you are always in the right my dear friend cried porthos   12.12761862818376
woe to them if it be so   11.601747751704188
for the countess after gazing with a puzzled look at his face burst into a fit of laughter and begged to know what had happened   12.187118529755889
you have brought me something   8.431352998461158
may i reckon on you as an auxiliary   11.085364354735088
to morrow rather said de chatillon if you will take the trouble of coming so far as the gates of charenton   12.103236520624707
the catalans chapter 4   16.49041442973352
her eyes first flashed and then swam she staggered towards the door and disappeared   9.66653761375632
still it belongs to government and i ought not to waste it   11.526440904244215
the minister of police thanked the young man by an eloquent look and villefort understood that he had succeeded in his design   8.127971544835326
d artagnan who was accustomed to his friend s manner of acting and who perceived immediately by a word a gesture or a sign from him that the circumstances were serious took athos s arm and went out without saying anything   16.292523538732873
yes replied eugénie   10.02571827221752
d artagnan in the meantime had taken the head of his detachment without a word and with that ready and profound obedience which marks the character of an old soldier   14.956891052157655
teresa was lively and gay but coquettish to excess   14.198173129534595
more than ever   7.4257668994679396
a moment later friquet went out carrying in his hand a large leather bag   12.23383969663572
i do not know if the result will be as agreeable as you describe but the thing does not appear to me as palatable as you say   15.482820293986379
sir said he with compressed lips and flashing eyes you have not the presumption to instruct the comte de la fere and myself what we ought to say here   11.255276051990013
she possesses all earthly seductions   9.524200343211367
as soon as this organization was established they set about driving the english from the isle   12.437395180545645
she was asking pardon for her sins   10.106901832210776
and heaven bless you in your wife as it has blessed me in my son   10.736104687403028
well said rochefort taking the paper from milady folding it and placing it in the lining of his hat you may be easy   11.075888105301832
lead me to him   17.355839898270755
ah to see me   11.87046976225674
you seem more than commonly thoughtful   8.342828109615176
to cours la reine   10.26033210146679
the queen attributed this joyous feeling to the beauty of the fête to the pleasure she had experienced in the ballet   9.528860493710576
flattery was at that period very current and m   11.709455265722632
this devil of a fellow he muttered shaking his head   10.798874768280648
am i not right m   17.32766248274329
he knocked and it opened immediately to admit him   8.70905093604574
that is to say you refuse to serve me monsieur said the cardinal with a tone of vexation through which however might be seen a sort of esteem   8.897159080729413
my friend aramis here has received a slight sword wound in the arm but not enough to prevent him as your eminence may see from mounting to the assault tomorrow if your eminence orders an escalade   15.341512951443242
the queen saving us her friends   13.438964930934521
bonacieux to leave the convent and to retire either into lorraine or belgium   14.097321257813238
are you fond of traveling   13.58649433461702
cried the man in the skiff   8.81526181447817
very good observed danglars after having read the paragraph   13.734924725358585
except you athos who never had one   8.798214561179886
but all was over and i arrived at aix by the side of a corpse   8.722330001296076
oh my friends said d artagnan you come once more to save my life not only mine but that of these gentlemen   14.96174867478134
it is impossible to understand the music of his country better than prince cavalcanti does   14.866362994452965
the natural messengers of the bandits are the shepherds who live between the city and the mountains between civilized and savage life   12.143248352178324
on his return his quick intelligent eye interrogated the messenger   14.270106004542487
what is that to you jacopo   11.826576173105675
good morning benedetto said bertuccio with his deep hollow voice   13.22785329438798
now that i have the word of athos i can set out   8.19407635323191
to preserve it sealed up as it is doubtless said the procureur   6.195567364606661
had he escaped we should either have seen him or have heard him spoken of   13.197029824956413
at this moment the door was opened and having questioned the servant the officer learned that master broussel was at home and at dinner   15.916332229223528
dantès turned and perceived that they had got out to sea   11.417286713052047
when left alone with bernouin mazarin was for some minutes lost in thought   14.457286553265316
there remained then no other place to fear but the traitor s cross   11.508632056842375
dantès gazed on the man who could thus philosophically resign hopes so long and ardently nourished with an astonishment mingled with admiration   14.973275181079574
you are to marry the daughter of danglars   14.150909933066917
throwing down his spit and ordering his wife to do the same with her broom handle and the servants with their sticks he set the first example of commencing an earnest search for the lost letter   7.001639695782552
answer me   12.589447959584124
dantès recoiled from the idea of so infamous a death and passed suddenly from despair to an ardent desire for life and liberty   13.467182884871738
but my lord if i allow you to escape i am a ruined man   13.468008491732801
because he has made his will in my favor   16.06864622356656
baptistin entered and remained standing at the door   6.933148786666747
cromwell is mighty mazarin is tricky but i would rather have to do with them than with the late monsieur mordaunt   8.406208008229317
murmured the monk shaking his head   11.573006115112419
from avignon to marseilles seven francs   10.94907143296259
lord winter you are not the king   13.027440523445474
one day however an emissary of the cardinal s gave him to understand that he was wrong in receiving the coadjutor so often   11.507619915807489
de villefort was not only a magistrate he was almost a diplomatist   14.858084425741545
they proposed a game of bouillotte   15.504440910474951
retired with the latter for a few minutes to a small back parlor and upon their return the jew counted out to the shipbuilder the sum of sixty thousand francs in bright gold pieces   11.372787016526337
madame de saint méran two months since   11.2380284840136
valentine reposes within the walls of paris and to leave paris is like losing her a second time   15.346948619180568
were they then so necessary   13.162176526198483
really if the house had not belonged to the father in law of the procureur one might have thought it some accursed place where a horrible crime had been committed   12.719004147423185
what do you want me for sir   9.674607621916213
said milady placing a bag full of louis in felton s hands   14.160198622761367
you will breakfast with me will you not morrel   10.929199910747808
in heaven s name   11.58828642911375
listen said the young man to the sentinel   5.085821380604736
she only witnessed the withdrawal of the arm the fair round arm of a woman but twenty five years old and who yet spread death around her   15.235046162839337
i have known you four days   15.815634921221495
ah he is not a man like that cursed d artagnan   11.737124977861239
all at once i see you pass through the barrier with a groom a tilbury and fine new clothes   14.778975336867571
oh we have three millions for our police   11.826193891464406
at the entrance of the room which led to her boudoir madame de villefort was standing erect pale her features contracted and her eyes glaring horribly   7.934613587421526
fortunately the reader may remember or may not remember fortunately we have promised not to lose sight of him   13.5568012098192
d artagnan and cahusac sprang forward at the same instant the one to recover the other to obtain the sword   15.036575952393603
she declared that she would never assent to the treaty and that she wished eternal war   8.221293430169467
but you answered porthos seem to me agitated   16.418742393917185
you can come he said and led them back to noirtier   14.325938949746071
but then athos would tell that she was branded   18.70788361133374
well then a happy and merry life to you   14.687573648822818
i am from the country   6.17562737387504
well then i appeal to m   9.36750945760328
cried selim   13.02811708449993
but i wished to have your advice   16.856521190417453
i have not the strength of mind you have or rather that which you would not have if instead of my daughter valentine your daughter madeleine were concerned   13.520326979283784
he said making a sign to the queen who was evidently going to issue a severe order   11.058314803051141
let us go and have a game at tennis la ramee   15.587042473913868
did you say he was coming   14.371445457412046
said athos to himself is it indeed possible that i hear what i hear and that i see what i see   15.218285087617534
but where the devil do you discover all the notions you put into practice   11.01013691549675
that with her permission i shall do myself the honor of paying my respects in the course of the evening   14.677828090505374
during the three weeks that he has been with me i have only had to reproach him with one thing being too severe with the prisoners   11.735655941450096
his boat had proved herself a first class sailor and had come the distance from genoa in thirty five hours   13.124750475957498
athos was seized with a kind of vertigo   9.839148490926943
although shaded by sorrow he knows everything i know said she   7.007388141832275
perfectly comprehending the meaning of the question   13.95288776035395
he arose and bowed to the four friends whose eyes were fixed on charles while harrison emptied his glass without the slightest misgiving   16.11863028094176
milady had had time during the whole day to trace her plan of conduct   11.106556649426695
soon a red streak became visible in the horizon the waves whitened a light played over them and gilded their foaming crests with gold   11.257583294828347
tis this when we escape together that i shall go everywhere and be always first   12.644158495619191
oh no replied caderousse that i can answer for you did not   11.466157032730498
certain dantès could not escape the gendarmes released him   13.07543941239539
man does not appear to me to be intended to enjoy felicity so unmixed   13.66815020620689
we have forgotten to mention that the count s coachman was attired in a bear skin exactly resembling odry s in the bear and the pasha   15.064932411536166
and yet replied d artagnan i think i recognize the writing   11.812219975645489
let us go to monsieur de beaufort   8.367883562264659
cried jussac advancing toward them and making a sign to his men to do so likewise halloo musketeers   11.162282455554228
yes said porthos twill be at least a little change from beer   10.134822960645387
yes but i know also that monsieur le comte de la fere arranged that you were to remain with me and that olivain should return to paris   13.143766875449149
cried d artagnan looking at his friend with an air of doubt   12.112551696767818
but you also know that with the help of god men have often conquered the most terrible demons   10.342365441201373
he drew up for a minute threw a rapid glance around him and then his hand fell instantly into his pocket where it began playing with a pistol   8.829584312051132
a thousand pardons gentlemen   7.523370079129542
the second a good soldier like porthos   14.682100346015172
d artagnan had passed himself upon her as de wardes for whom she had conceived one of those tigerlike fancies common to women of her character   9.468273758646175
but he stopped short and could not be made to move a step   8.746231033235368
yes i have heard that death is in that house   10.554941884952132
that word ill becomes my faded lip now but it is a memory dear to my heart and one that i would not lose for all that the world contains   12.203987031309616
but as to love there was not a single word about it in all the letter   16.20578978758303
i wish to do madame all that your majesty pleases   11.38228840134447
however we have them safe in prison and they are just sufficiently culpable for us to keep them in prison as long as we find it convenient   12.178284542308706
he did not move as he heard it open and the door keeper pronounce the words walk in madame and then reclose it   9.468339836036137
i believed your heart noble enough to enable a friendship of twenty years to overcome an affront of a quarter of an hour   10.745141487581536
i appreciate your calm reasoning   13.772169467344177
he was quite alone   13.752705572488372
but the horses were all used up   10.400376033178443
and on my part it would be a real happiness to withdraw from public affairs   6.3853843016367815
the very silence of his supporters indicates that they are at work   18.58283824284019
you will ask for the host and will repeat to him the word forward   11.069951600777486
d artagnan was a man and he would have considered it unworthy of a man to give way to his feelings   13.31093060172407
and in that case how shall i know where you are   10.316414853818117
battle   12.819458114025405
sure enough said the general   7.613122077945196
and for myself monsieur shall i saddle rustaud   13.005035520825924
athos was about to retire   14.789966346112976
halloo gentlemen   10.555062322551224
how once   13.291510439489313
one was writing and the other praying when the door opened   15.027685576340891
0151m and who told you this fine story   14.523213500623779
but i excuse it it is impossible to expect the son of a girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven   6.674527638482622
the greater the amount the more flattering it is to you   16.474778658244674
i shall gain it for the hope of the nation and the spirit of the lord are with me   10.063957729753731
she inquired   4.222390924027524
i recognize the coadjutor by his frondist hat   9.21692522675076
that she disliked the idea of being married   14.12770723082841
i shall find him there   9.522185397748196
and mazarin buried himself so far behind the two friends that he disappeared completely hidden between them   12.114322461852463
i must tell you that i have not come to any decided opinion respecting him but i think him a maltese   9.982405888991869
asked the infuriated danglars   18.010646410878543
there all the thoughts which had disturbed me during my year of constant agony came back with double force   10.110867281593828
and when you occupy monsieur de tréville s place i will come and ask your influence to secure me an abbey   12.005548119016545
that is to say madame it was he sire it was he   10.616144736749805
whom do you mean by they   11.881141675876544
the boat grounded on the fine sand   12.109677069882222
and not more than justice either you ass   14.382327002940237
yes said athos by his own nephew   12.87972728726081
my lord yes   15.232298421505536
then the pope and cæsar borgia invited the two cardinals to dinner   13.20589905944922
i am only jealous in one thing and that is that the relief i give should be entirely from my own resources   14.077401976583332
but you will not do so i hope   11.786707569938974
without doubt you will monsieur   16.57945876141289
the day passed thus   15.881812780138793
50181m the president called for the indictment revised as we know by the clever and implacable pen of villefort   11.149131019641732
on guard   15.445243504597656
but it is not that which i wish to speak of but a secret i have to reveal of the greatest importance   8.974313547769315
he will know what that means   9.87941677421896
and i am madame héloïse de villefort   10.895353249645364
some carried arms others seemed to be taking aim and the remainder appeared merely to be sword in hand   15.296817324461754

the duke had been five years in prison and now to him looking back upon them those five years which had passed so slowly seemed not so long a time as were the two days the forty eight hours which still parted him from the time fixed for his escape   8.45588715608773
too late by a minute   9.565257228760188

said athos filling his glass and that of his friend   7.996729548064382

oh madame said mazarin your majesty knows not what you ask   10.274137726019525
said caderousse who drank as he spoke and on whom the fumes of the wine began to take effect under any circumstances fernand is not the only person put out by the fortunate arrival of dantès   11.946641046113578

yes replied a gendarme   16.082960936546073
noirtier for it was indeed he who entered looked after the servant until the door was closed and then fearing no doubt that he might be overheard in the antechamber he opened the door again nor was the precaution useless as appeared from the rapid retreat of germain who proved that he was not exempt from the sin which ruined our first parents   12.963914727294451
alone in his usual room lighted by two candles the condemned monarch gazed sadly on the luxury of his past greatness just as at the last hour one sees the images of life more mildly brilliant than of yore   14.09934677735932
but d artagnan will discover one   11.462366949442094

the heart of the young gascon beat as if it would burst through his side not from fear god be thanked he had not the shade of it but with emulation   7.026566223478408
go and try   15.725344771937477

why in passing through lilliers you will send me your chaise with an order to your servant to place himself at my disposal   11.907682806571227

well he of whom i speak is the lord and master of this grain of sand of this atom   9.196399768836283
he turned away and went off to his post whistling a tune then popular among the party called the fronde whilst mazarin returned in a pensive mood toward the palais royal   6.286200110932438
a false telegraphic despatch it is almost impossible for wrong signals to be made as they were in the last two telegrams   8.79104461094234
then aloud the friend of that wretch is capable of everything   9.714372556714853
and did monsieur d artagnan come off the conqueror   9.641613338920472
but that gentleman being absent his secretary by his orders opened his letters   10.681188846259856
since i have arrived at years of discretion and become my own master i have been constantly seeking him but all in vain   12.01888381329048

madame de saint méran s last request was that the marriage might not be delayed   6.9596612057496525
albert kissed his mother s hand and drew near the count   12.566765436027824
let us do justice to d artagnan   13.166175409839335
grimaud and blaisois are holding your horses ready saddled   7.6160460550488684
the heavens were hung with black and the gigantic structure of the château d if seemed like the phantom of a mortal enemy   11.196425046057154
one has never the last word with such a man   16.830998203350788
conceal nothing gloss over nothing   10.270696303474928
yes said danglars taking it from beyond his reach   16.870347144869765
dantès employed it in manœuvring his yacht round the island studying it as a skilful horseman would the animal he destined for some important service till at the end of that time he was perfectly conversant with its good and bad qualities   11.088395018113685
allow us to observe in passing that in this fight perished the baron de chantal   10.388777845146763
come said he laughing there are all my hopes about to be destroyed   13.292590997167757
here it is i see   17.424563455030885
of course you know you can do so   13.879545296910623
do you think i am going to change the life i lead for your mode of existence my agreeable indolence for the hard and precarious toil you impose on yourself exposed to the bitter frost at night and the scorching heat by day compelled to conceal yourself and when you are perceived receive a volley of bullets all to earn a paltry sum   14.095637709203313
unfortunately it is a thing that i can t perform at any time i choose   11.583608040990175
d artagnan and planchet mounted and took the road to st   9.855312157487658
but he had not been able to catch more than a few vague syllables without any positive sense when a sonorous and short cry made him start and attracted the attention of the musketeers   13.830555979669361
wait a moment sir said he   11.620864378714362
planchet and bazin came last   7.30705540032117
answered a solemn and imperious voice accompanied by a menacing gesture   12.302710274427893
cocles went first and the stranger followed him   10.94969929142948
the count bit his lips till the blood almost started to prevent the ebullition of anger which his proud and irritable temper scarcely allowed him to restrain   10.692718429534985
but he did ward them off said de rochefort and the reason was that though he had bitter enemies he possessed also true friends   18.926450562810977
yes she said at your advice i have made the trial   13.23597729910188
i pardon you monseigneur   7.585815449082162
true but some day they do them justice   8.739670645535103
i was very far then from expecting the change you have just informed me of   10.14745565157974
what are you saying sir   10.951210926417357
and this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old jacobin noirtier   11.001555751806492
but what if i am not liberated cried he and am detained here until my death   10.252360934999196
grimaud had only to make them a sign to go away and i am convinced they would have left us in peace   15.892097933604067
comminges bowed and left   15.472558276829693
but nowadays they are not inviolable   11.246250478871259
how could this rock which weighed several tons have been lifted to this spot without the aid of many men   13.22699238930152
thought milady   11.104175648682407
he remained silent his eyes fixed upon the light   13.167791287290639
powerful memories were stirred within them by the sight of the round tower fort saint nicolas the city hall designed by puget 28 the port with its brick quays where they had both played in childhood and it was with one accord that they stopped on the canebière   11.893484417894616
but the ransom of that immense treasure buried under the gallery to which one descends on pushing a spring hidden in the wall which causes a tub to turn revealing a staircase must not one speak of that a little my lord   8.905673691728161
you have found out that there is something worth having about this large gentleman   13.086420382114948
i could not bear to see her suffer   5.818438088523372
oh sir said danglars after he had convinced himself of the authenticity of the documents he held and rising as if to salute the power of gold personified in the man before him three letters of unlimited credit   7.273853469559442
where have you come from my dear count   16.207902255180716
he is a noble of very lofty carriage black hair swarthy complexion piercing eye white teeth and has a scar on his temple   12.571154279496607
he held out his hand   7.291048880155354
orders were given that no drum should be beaten no trumpet sounded   11.903918875366706
again the abbé smiled   12.364594239676064
so you are not a mazarinist   9.827015189671632
for fifteen thousand francs   9.866953097900286
exclaimed athos turning pale   11.068628618420828
as to d artagnan who as yet knew nobody in the capital he only found one chocolate breakfast at the house of a priest of his own province and one dinner at the house of a cornet of the guards   15.467219207660492
caderousse counted and again counted the gold and the notes then handed them to his wife who counted and counted them again in her turn   9.943031943885611
oh chevalier   10.443352005661682
about six or seven and twenty years of age i should say   8.146566271359333
holà aramis   7.844183000993759
de monte cristo or m   12.139455174505578
if i am not mistaken those are citizens helmeted and mailed armed with good muskets as in the time of the league and whose eyes are so intently fixed on this window that they will see you if you raise that curtain much   12.686816576161194
he instantly began to climb up the slope of the moat on the top of which he met de rochefort   7.840815697876383
do not quit his salon until you have seen me   9.548043178307749
receive me oh my lord   11.186635128504022
and now raoul said the gascon monsieur du vallon and i are going away as ambassadors where i know not   6.073159750394799
yes had i died years ago   17.546997137522574
they were untouched   13.056562419827811
watch her arrival for she has great and terrible projects   15.632114324416936
oh father   15.369919797353166
but urge the king strongly not to stand on false generosity   14.219481454069934
de beaufort did not venture to draw the cardinal s fat face   7.495971396588216
that our sentinels have seen this movement and i have been left unacquainted with it   12.127099142730867
porthos would have found it very difficult even to make him see that he was dying of hunger   12.071473452862548
the tower contained implements such as spades rakes watering pots hung against the wall   17.364523941977374
he knew the relay to be at a distance of seven leagues   8.873677648662792
no entreaty no proposition of increased wages could induce them to remain   8.788223196412172
porthos was ruminating over an excellent dinner he had just demolished   5.120035529560635
said lord de winter to felton who was being dragged away with his eyes turned toward the sea   15.376834878001853
give him money if he is recommended to you and the recommendation seems good   5.421750194398262
yes returned aramis   5.935178061873415
what were you saying   9.45841373237575
this advice was to the jailer s taste as it spared him the necessity of making another trip   14.419232426391858
i admit the word monseigneur because it rhymes with ministre minister   15.163190132210577
you know my dear count said he the ceremony is to take place this evening   11.031939153784938
and as if acted upon by a spring she bounded toward the baron who awaited her attack with his arms crossed but nevertheless with one hand on the hilt of his sword   10.354826610043789
it is possible said milady   8.496857802559415
my sister thanks you for your good and eternal remembrance   11.6545623602878
de villefort s voice was heard calling from his study what is the matter   11.898391755613947
what do you think should be done asked athos if we have no news of them to night   16.127140668933812
i had no previous knowledge of your visit had i   10.848395907138816
then fixing his eyes upon grimaud with a singular expression the dying man uttered the last death rattle and expired   17.36070433296169
in fact said mordaunt with a calm voice and immovable countenance a single blow sufficed   12.082957788657895
the curate then entered followed by planchet   14.313016447159008
although drawn downwards by the heavy weight which hastened his rapid descent it seemed to him as if the fall lasted for a century   14.077653666577552
no gentlemen i have kept the harness said porthos   14.828239225976883
then they began to pass around the dusky piquant arlesian sausages and lobsters in their dazzling red cuirasses prawns of large size and brilliant color the echinus with its prickly outside and dainty morsel within the clovis esteemed by the epicures of the south as more than rivalling the exquisite flavor of the oyster north   13.5011164477881
they say the dead know everything   11.262012621325049
you see said danglars he fancies himself captain already upon my word   15.176258852089806
his lackey who by an unforeseen piece of ill luck had quarreled with the officers disguised as stable lads miserable scoundrel   12.230994240898722
a queen accustomed to be obeyed i am excited at the first opposition   12.995676180460723
but what of that as long as carmela was safe and uninjured   13.801098853802847
bonacieux was one of profound selfishness mixed with sordid avarice the whole seasoned with extreme cowardice   7.918734855699679
take it said she and be accursed   13.804117590157862
cried she sinking upon the shoulders of milady   13.092065431977776
i shall tell him therefore and in doing so i shall confer a personal favor on him how he is mistaken in regard to me   14.04551154445333
you remember said the count during the most profound silence that the unhappy wretch who came to rob me died at my house   13.55628174562495
the grating against the library door aroused the young girl from the stupor in which she was plunged and which almost amounted to insensibility   15.255539237881493
see said beauchamp pointing out morrel to debray   12.089321650588985
the three friends ordered breakfast and went into a room in which the host said they would not be disturbed   8.439062822511591
near the louvre the four friends met with m   12.542106611221957
the young man read valentine s letter twenty times in the course of the day   9.817318484308332
but i think i remember that there was a question between him and monsieur mazarin as to making his estate a barony   13.7104149251171
listen said he to him   13.784723767208718
the frondeurs will have a treaty and your eminence must sign it before us promising at the same time to obtain the queen s consent to it   11.63218974081884
sir said valentine i will do all i can to live for there are two beings who love me and will die if i die my grandfather and maximilian   13.054676830473767
are there any magistrates or judges at the château d if   5.880642096991567
from time to time caderousse darted on his wife keen searching glances but rapid as the lightning flash   14.410150893475997
do not fear there is our safeguard pointing to the bed   8.7008872234716
the sergeant answered that puritans never drank and put the crown piece in his pocket   15.869560968499728
if it is god s justice instead of his anger which is walking through that house maximilian turn away your face and let his justice accomplish its purpose   10.463268582905942
replied aramis in a tone of resignation   9.050293036493361
or the holy blood i will spit you all like ortolans   12.459642273442116
sebastian instead of receiving them in my humble abode in the rue du helder   9.259457638505058
a secret voice whispered to him at the bottom of his heart that he was but an instrument of vengeance that he was only caressed till he had given death   8.96366375130047
yes athos i know what you mean we shall do very well at the parpaillot   12.769579126971337
when all at once she perceived that no signature was attached to the order   10.511582577205477
d artagnan offered his arm to mme   9.747239507107745
at length with the help of his two hands he lifted himself from the bench and found himself on his feet   11.693696394973
cried maximilian   7.082507826084503
but i will know   8.815116184938741
but kings and queens are strange beings and have odd fancies   10.022807973762593
get as near to him as you can and cut off two   5.135476461698646
let eight fresh horses be in readiness on the road which will enable me to go fifty leagues in ten hours   10.735952915421914
i was about to become an abbé and all was arranged   14.365912666496488
he is your man do you say   13.643985897527735
i must speak to him about it   18.938915877324867
lord de winter will now be upon his guard if the letter should reach him   12.11585296643861
and here he comes by jupiter   19.42602952014508
repeated danglars   8.778693015154042
that is another matter   11.684013488129597
but see there is a postscript from aramis   12.188711137885619
only his hair which was too light gave his face a most singular expression and added to the vivacity of his look and the malice of his smile   13.663604934827722
and madame de villefort cried baptistin   13.089342029200404
and d artagnan rushed into athos s chamber   12.140648907668028
faria had dug his way through fifty feet dantès would dig a hundred   13.123950298358587
then having removed a plank from his floor and nothing remaining but a simple ceiling between him and the room beneath in which the interrogatories were made he heard all that passed between the inquisitors and the accused   11.706964620448973
he is worn out said debray   10.721415725371516
however he did not yield but calling up all his fortitude said i will not swear   10.604780260611614
because you have had strength because you have had trust in god and god has sustained you   11.817883804341994
danglars brightened up on beholding it fancying that it gave some promise of safety   9.161494620149385
i have loved him four years   7.940619743711765
it was la carconte   12.190852974038389
it is to these powers we should rally   9.282081020290711
the comtesse de winter with whom i had quarreled became reconciled to me at that ball   11.277160800493125
i do not know my age for i have not counted the years i have been here   8.289593418397391
yesterday his banker brought him a hundred thousand francs in gold   5.180073969810376
you had friends albert   13.653268245307267
and therefore continued athos the cardinal the true cardinal the other one determined one fine morning to arrest poor marie michon and send her to the chateau de loches   10.900843125825993
would you have given up the letter aramis   5.5211947259065575
phew   16.239480391967184
no my lord replied the impassive young man   9.380149232443383
hitherto i have repulsed them   15.198095935692141
my dear count said albert advancing to meet him permit me to repeat the poor thanks i offered last night and to assure you that the remembrance of all i owe to you will never be effaced from my memory   10.485925342836076
40080m no replied haydée he did not dare to keep us so we were sold to some slave merchants who were going to constantinople   13.956679588065864
no returned monte cristo i only guessed   13.379824299002113
valentine we may easily conceive where morrel s appointment was   11.262833776719434
no but i have just met with a terrible adventure   12.269383780174303
in the first place you have plenty of money haven t you   7.053785942144968
oh aramis   15.678832301376884
cried morcerf it is your fault   13.336334969325243
if you are attacked by day or by night fight but retreat without shame   13.163702751072814
a shudder ran through the young man s frame   8.278609555745234
by no means my dear duke   4.306179250847009
with forced composure he dipped the pen in the ink and wrote the following lines upon a sheet of paper i have no money to pay my bill but i am not a dishonest man   8.677534962211132
you do not know how much i require this assurance   9.801116686859588
at length an honorable peer morcerf s acknowledged enemy ascended the tribune with that solemnity which announced that the expected moment had arrived   11.181892341153192
all was quiet but on returning from m   10.010101211261675
i have come therefore express from rome to ask you for information   11.897949130636235
the chaplain of the château came to me yesterday to beg for leave of absence in order to take a trip to hyères for a week   9.332215043325393
cries were heard from the interior of which they could not comprehend the sense   15.505253183606357
then turning toward her daughter what do you want henrietta   9.138632682271666
a retractation is always a serious thing you know   14.776792349897965
upon what   15.008621967843112
the young man rose and took a step toward her   7.59227883478451
the brigands have never been really extirpated from the neighborhood of rome   15.804937404796929
no your enemy is conquered since we know her and you will live valentine live to be happy yourself and to confer happiness upon a noble heart   10.677136298244237
but her heart beat with joy and secret hope shone in her eyes   13.23008215968902
anne of austria alone was permitted to enter by that door   11.32325766869642
oh if my mother were still living there would be nothing to fear maximilian for i would tell her that i loved you and she would protect us   13.128062682344517
this charge was so fierce so skillfully conducted that chanleu was almost surrounded   13.226472547982716
exclaimed mousqueton smacking his lips   10.016152788876042
i don t at all understand you but i believe all you say to be true   10.800134772155221
there were three gates to open before reaching the inclosure each by a different key   11.688068112114859
on what shall i reflect   9.01584073240933
i am only a lieutenant of musketeers very poor and journeys cost money   9.91318517871969
i think it is kept a secret from grandpapa noirtier that the contract is to be signed this evening   10.359182738615711
delighted with this assurance the governor countersigned the passport and delivered it to d artagnan   12.77900575255729
this apparition was so strange and so solemn that everyone rose with the exception of carlini who remained seated and ate and drank calmly   12.89483853581749
she seems to have been taken suddenly ill   11.335513531288683
doctor do you hear them call for help   16.941185421247418
remain then sir   14.68806031651907
and as he spoke these words with a hoarse choking voice he staggered towards the door which was mechanically opened by a door keeper   7.6512251785233065
parbleau   11.306636187132092
then all the members looked at each other with terror   11.227542374450007
athos whose keen eye lost nothing perceived a faintly sly smile pass over the lips of the young gascon as he replied we had a short discussion upon dress   10.728593993058185
now said the unknown to franz i do not know if you are of my opinion but i think nothing is more annoying than to remain two or three hours together without knowing by name or appellation how to address one another   11.736225619834826
now that i see you young and with a promising future now that i think of all that may result to you in the good fortune of such a disclosure i shudder at any delay and tremble lest i should not assure to one as worthy as yourself the possession of so vast an amount of hidden wealth   12.173208440636515
no mysteries no cloak to hide one s self in no cunning policy here   10.244242845069468
he bowed with great friendship to the count   12.228820661509731
said my father to his palikares   9.773407999434479
the valet bowed and retired and albert returned to his inventory   12.208224809888563
just as you please my lord   9.554424774532098
at rome you spent fifty thousand piastres in furnishing your apartments but i presume that you are not disposed to spend a similar sum every day   11.664572489534924
avast there all hands   9.993280944560892
from 206 they have risen to 409 in three days and the prudent banker had purchased at 206   9.269237884213885
but continued danglars i find you did not even pause there insults   14.281971132654993
when landing at boulogne after a two days passage she passed for a frenchwoman whom the english persecuted at portsmouth out of their hatred for france   13.781353345104712
although i am very much afraid that your good wishes will not be of great service to me   13.446882583546824
asked porthos filling a second glass of wine   13.126467349289145
yes hell has resuscitated you continued athos   14.89922678884173
as monsieur porthos is a very boastful man he insists that nobody shall know he has received this wound except the duchess whom he endeavored to interest by an account of his adventure   12.211518962998326
asked felton with an astonishment which in spite of the empire he held over himself he could not entirely conceal   7.047216264280964
all eyes were turned towards this man for to all except athos he was unknown   11.367850279919033
in returning with the comte de la fere and monsieur d herblay our crime would be confirmed   3.3477268077102664
who wants me   8.343974987432546
that imbecile lacked but one thing to become a cardinalist   11.928644242225733
to tours   14.177297731763787
raoul was but ten yards from the shore   11.726545704406293
the horses were sent back wearing the same harness she had seen on them in the morning   12.277508974716245
the color mounted to the queen s face   8.37718857181219
how many guns gentlemen   16.22020918436337
said the priest with a show of interest glancing round as he spoke at the scanty furnishings of the apartment   14.150529183201563
morrel took the purse and started as he did so for a vague remembrance reminded him that it once belonged to himself   12.207825028734302
danglars then opened the window   12.338625068677974
and so being beautiful witty somewhat talented as the comic operas say and rich and that is happiness sir why do you call me unhappy   10.51692142690821
besides the worst that could happen to him would be the punishment of which we have already spoken and which the philanthropic french revolution has substituted for being torn to pieces by horses or broken on the wheel   13.354344542467286
he is then the same englishman whom i met at ah yes indeed   15.426558552351175
this is modesty indeed   16.724370220570442
are we alone   12.316560988342827
women a little inconvenienced by their costume as pages and whose large trousers could not entirely conceal their rounded forms   11.523367651069483
wait a moment no threats if you please m   13.144616340165836
every career is open to you   9.94314856449334
monsieur you have touched upon a tender chord   12.36843245071733
oh no it is as simple as possible replied monte cristo   15.394902481550945
but the story of the crab made a great noise through the interior of the donjon and even outside   16.187762225680917
wait madame continued athos what remains for me to tell you is even more strange than what i have narrated   13.235224483744528
the part of an honest man full of courage and real regard   13.536441730640016
i never saw more simple tastes united to greater magnificence   14.470663668156739
there is very little amusement in the cloister and the good superior was eager to make the acquaintance of her new boarder   11.317433278521072
infamous task   11.488880493458225
is your steward also a nubian   13.579259261668817
we shall have time afterward for the usual compliments   12.449568974213857
there is a weapon which despair has placed within the reach of every creature who has the courage to use it   17.066498455361796
bonacieux to the chamber of examination   11.853913625710783
cried felton covering that hand with his kisses   13.483902411176368
her hands clutched her armchair   12.02529066814466
d artagnan began to smile   9.587545575409223
at half past two in the morning morcerf was conducted to his apartments where a bath and supper were prepared   11.902258439954837
at the first glance d artagnan judged that the mind of the king was stormy   13.825470706596091
it is true that my father will be equally angry   13.943646092834655
however stupid the royalist police may be they do know one terrible thing   11.525453130960425
and you include me in the expression everyone many thanks   14.313592180740617
and on my part said d artagnan i wished to speak of you but i find you so completely detached from everything   8.006301423139952
as i know that you do not like to ask money of your friends i offer you some of my own accord   13.839494319457483
is your honor sure   12.845378447726192
how was he going to find athos   9.903459900078744
you ate it   15.279866971836078
what is the matter sir   16.236780819668756
he put in his pocket the key of the room where he had hidden them and accompanied by porthos returned to settle with mousqueton who naively and like the worthy steward that he was handed them four hundred and thirty louis and kept one hundred for himself   10.77259730191864
dantès from his rocky perch saw the shattered vessel and among the fragments the floating forms of the hapless sailors   8.154589837709329
monsieur d artagnan said the commissary addressing athos declare all that passed yesterday between you and monsieur   4.262281055565619
30147m chapter 57   12.35619068189567
hitherto i have fancied myself merely waging war against circumstances not men   14.136811388025054
your affectionate anne buckingham collected all his remaining strength to listen to the reading of the letter   9.019293094376152
to be overwhelmed with insults and ignominy   12.791185140047862
all went well till they arrived at chantilly which they reached about eight o clock in the morning   6.721589433318934
said château renaud phlegmatically   13.392124992424318
but that is not an answer   12.750324051517953
madame danglars did not see them   15.707721725709764
this soot i dissolved in a portion of the wine brought to me every sunday and i assure you a better ink can not be desired   14.65847910868757
at this moment a little boy half peasant half foot boy came to announce supper   11.389505363963806
shall we not know it   13.19793315719553
the stairs did indeed lead to the garden   13.978890312984454
but tell me my dear sister replied he what makes you come to england   11.028448699790907
planchet had followed the road   9.128030091127505
whose is that letter of your mistress   10.306993296791296
he double locked it took the key returned to the bedroom door removed the double staple of the bolt and went in   13.862669876776424
explain yourself count   8.052544113081993
the hinges of the door creaked and a man appeared in the dress of a cavalier wrapped in a brown cloak with a lantern in one hand and a large beaver hat pulled down over his eyes   10.23419114461817
they had not mistaken the gravity of this event for the moment after morrel had entered his private office with cocles julie saw the latter leave it pale trembling and his features betraying the utmost consternation   12.10538213786908
then putting forth his arm he pulled the bell   16.448838712115005
ah monsieur i have not here as i had there the ponds of monsieur le prince where i could catch those beautiful carp nor the forests of his highness to provide me with partridges   13.733189544283444
tis his custom   16.368967841497067
as he spoke he sprang into the vehicle the door was closed but not so rapidly that monte cristo failed to perceive the almost imperceptible movement which stirred the curtains of the apartment in which he had left madame de morcerf   12.793538987179353
five hours after that he passed through arras   7.953310929855098
impossible said d artagnan   13.893075774441792
at two and twenty to be thus famous   17.00918347691877
now said he the sacrifice is consummated   13.545643666866534
if by any good luck you lay your hand on a certain man named mordaunt tell porthos to take him into a corner and to wring his neck   18.75297588576783
you can see it in his eye   11.046579323590391
asked madame henrietta   10.018442419081605
what you say is perhaps true   7.762512235930933
d artagnan remembered having seen this ring on the finger of milady   8.515046965237456
i wait till i am confided in and apart from that which lord de winter has said to me before you he has confided nothing to me   14.765509094335862
said the host   9.648908094532612
by your poems   11.157681034652724
with a single glance the prince took in the extent of country that lay before him from lens as far as vimy   11.117527817724607
moreover she saw that eugénie detested debray not only because he was a source of dissension and scandal under the paternal roof but because she had at once classed him in that catalogue of bipeds whom plato endeavors to withdraw from the appellation of men and whom diogenes designated as animals upon two legs without feathers   10.873725259239702
what tenderness my sister   16.20603396892688
having said this villefort quitted the room with his wife leaving his father at liberty to do as he pleased   12.453796242152425
and i say to you one drop of water suffices to make the full vase overflow   14.400228812133886
but you must let me make my observations or the frenchman will transact his business without my knowing the sum   5.896754137378871
asked he by a gesture   15.00287952031294
milady recognized the step of lord de winter   10.877302343927509
come with us to marseilles come along   11.682313802842913
cried all present with one voice   15.64574067829642
this voice was that of athos who standing up with outstretched hand and quite out of his mind thus assailed the public accuser   15.28716343862822
oh if he knows the contents of this   13.732488669369213
petersburg to china   13.177778453950465
may god preserve you   15.882198569932982
it was on that occasion that my ancestor enguerrand de la fere was made a knight of the order of st   12.680623750600262
de tréville at a distance come here monsieur captain said he come here that i may growl at you   13.070271160299203
but it appears that this edmond dantès this dangerous man s name was edmond dantès   14.050637397281161
on the contrary said d artagnan we shall hear better   10.961509064946766
planchet who had been the first to enter was the last to leave   7.64882057067234
backhanded   8.744305697765594
behind them by another outlet a group of about twenty persons rushed into the garden with loud exclamations of delight   14.285376154988143
ah to inquire after the little la valliere   10.122436388558105
as i am of the church and the affair might injure me if i should share it with any other than a sure friend like you i write to beg that you will serve me as second   14.00614502297091
and supposing a second restoration you would then pass for a great man   8.582546832228305
a regiment of cuirassiers nearly equal as to numbers issued from behind the hill and came full gallop toward it   11.913148415813302
of the cardinal   11.432669719190168
but when he discovered what it meant he shouted it in such a voice that even the most exacting were satisfied   15.394823120530273
monte cristo motioned to ali to undress him and he then examined his dreadful wounds   11.915563768830122
a terrible fear transfixed him   11.409739436478878
fasten it to the poop with a rope   14.070065462781445
he s an old acquaintance   12.59582998636434
i accept it answered the traveller but then the obligation will be on my side for this poniard is worth more than two sequins   10.187188913036051
you are right your excellency he said   8.413309298634001
by his advice a decree from parliament summoned the citizens to lay down their arms and demolish the barricades   11.535081333951144
i was not rich   17.747797926966626
and once there to endeavor to find the wonderful caverns and search in the appointed spot the appointed spot be it remembered being the farthest angle in the second opening   11.160649158240881
bear skins from siberia fox skins from norway and so on   10.619642211805576
my lord i saw him run off from the top of the terrace   13.36457033399527
no you do not know me   13.22222415783883
the queen was standing in the room pale with anger   17.141310138525785
bertuccio you make use of heraldic terms   13.766354127650734
i also have a pious visit to pay   6.929396867593335
ten minutes later the escort stopped at ermenonville but the four friends went on with well sustained ardor guarding mazarin carefully   7.36570183507472
the fact is one can not remain thus with a sword hanging eternally over his head said athos   5.434952921627847
murmured the two young people   16.97529516790759
the party assembled the room was lighted with waxlights and the prisoner with a bit of plaster he had taken out of the wall of his room had traced a long white line representing a cord on the floor   15.199531075074335
they appear to be speaking of me   14.390530289958836
tis not a quarter of an hour since they passed this place   12.071920541250494
oh count you could assist me perhaps in researches which have been up to the present fruitless   4.6042375379649565
château renaud contented himself with tapping his boot with his flexible cane   10.53567371565544
what do you see   13.122004611622227
and he related what he had seen watching athos all the while   11.429285684939916
oh those villeforts are an accursed race   13.187394310345148
when i saw her weeping i began to cry too   16.500020443862475
degradation took away two thirds of her greatness   10.748123886936707
monte cristo left alone took three or four steps onwards and murmured here beneath this plane tree must have been where the infant s grave was dug   14.815565154131058
be kind enough madame to listen to me said danglars   9.859587619472919
he still lives   12.099919256148553
but albert had great projects to put into execution before going to the theatre   9.164045684958822
the vendetta chapter 45   9.19826949824921
and he looked down at the pretty girl with the most triumphant air imaginable   10.821066553893294
he had assumed the entire costume of cucumetto   13.84326530026317
enough sir enough   14.762492055843738
but what happened after my departure   15.389849340361362
1 you said sir you would like to help me but yes   11.805402972927956
i think returned anne of austria fixing upon him a glance which in any woman s face would have expressed disdain but in a queen s spread terror to those she looked upon nay i perceive you dare to threaten the mother of your sovereign   7.374999350307708
and he drew from his pocket a handful of gold and held it sparkling before the dazzled eyes of the innkeeper and in the other hand he held a packet of bank notes   11.88390552862723
she then turned to the right followed the course of a long corridor descended a flight went a few steps farther introduced a key into a lock opened a door and pushed the duke into an apartment lighted only by a lamp saying remain here my lord duke   12.99298091900253
and now he said when he saw that dantès had read the last line put the two fragments together and judge for yourself   12.195742843053505
there only remained three things to decide what they should write to milady s brother   13.174510823785711
he thought that voice more feeble than usual   16.341991213327347
he perceived his mistake   11.025019338158707
but her swollen tongue could utter no more than a hoarse sound which had nothing human in it and resembled the rattle of a wild beast   10.488526086918402
they had proposed his going with them to france but he had straightway declined   12.208448758153624
for it was agreed among us once for all that we should always hold together though engaged on opposing sides   22.190210640071093
alone valentine has no power   14.457888695720948
no said jacopo   6.54430748421658
at the same time couriers started in every direction over england and europe to announce that charles stuart was the prisoner of oliver cromwell   8.199434173563375
villefort quietly opened a window saying it is very warm and the heat affects m   11.873588057423863
oh athos   10.694924475992881
winter approached   13.099624034106293
and you say that monsieur d artagnan was one of those four men   11.788090059686676
come come calm yourself madame puritan or i ll remove you to a dungeon   14.393884226745858
albert my child said mercédès if i had a stronger heart that is the counsel i would have given you   14.69670004133242
she evidently interrogated him by her look   13.934815332499555
he saw my father bury something in the ground and stabbed him   12.501282078438026
oh my god i have suffered enough surely   3.8786185652614815
acknowledge then you stony heart said d artagnan that you are wrong to be so hard upon us tender hearts   7.876935552240937
and her brother   6.294569455656839
during this time the captain had thrown off his vest and shirt and secured his trousers round his waist   4.904951000748774
go on baptistin   13.4604420625076
i positively refuse   8.145059199065077
truly cried the host misfortune is coming on our house   12.662878691483007
and now said the queen addressing d artagnan what is to be done   12.98729575211465
if the abbé busoni should by any accident return think of me   13.360987287813641
like everything else with money   11.764562641784767
i am entirely at your service m   12.043025576950509
ah that s it   15.308395110685606
if he wished to go out without gloves his hands appeared too white   15.91412999495163
nor would either the one or the other believe the reports that were brought to them declaring they would rather rely on the evidence of their own eyes and ears   7.2936340580403405
and then relaxing his sentiment of pride he addressed his supplications not to god but to man   11.913062524828076
but when andrea urged his suit she betrayed an entire dislike to him   15.729892704003216
what have you got to say   8.538376039780408
and that will not be long it is to be hoped said porthos   12.884352571599035
he called out in his gascon accent what do you want   10.602698191453591
and you monsieur du vallon is that your advice   14.449518018434652
the house may be watched   14.883020716206758
the boat was built for speed   8.705944203423858
i don t insist on answering   13.877066205701672
he went before i came down   9.109664123131587
chapter 27   15.054332002691783
said the young girl with hesitation it is your opinion that i should obey this invitation   10.323339073130835
chatillon saw the motion and put his hand to his sword   12.767118186844932
dantès observed however that faria in spite of the relief his society afforded daily grew sadder   18.003751920481548
i am a great captain that i am   8.026062087151267
i am not strong enough   16.636338465211555
yes if i am killed said albert laughing   6.972161905482127
the counter was covered with a plate of pewter   9.839454359721712
is your secret of enough importance to me to spare your life for it   15.91593043399898
his costume was no less elegant than that of teresa   13.457068020352663
he quietly said what do i care if i am   14.14712428348148
athos and aramis bowed and went out   12.839074758065482
you say an exterminating angel appears to have devoted that house to god s anger well who says your supposition is not reality   12.850521243837091
be more economical   13.409559415888017
porthos received all these attentions like a man accustomed to such demonstrations only on turning the corner of the street he lifted his hat gracefully and waved it to her as a sign of adieu   12.022843937217184
think only of yourself   10.701233721532843
but this confession concerns me only   14.86125523748094
eleven o clock sounded from all the clocks of the faubourg st   14.176967165900363
who can answer for that   6.040320488062937
a pardon for peppino called rocca priori said the principal friar   13.9453993950122
now one evening when d artagnan who was in the trenches was not able to accompany them athos porthos and aramis mounted on their battle steeds enveloped in their war cloaks with their hands upon their pistol butts were returning from a drinking place called the red dovecot which athos had discovered two days before upon the route to jarrie following the road which led to the camp and quite on their guard as we have stated for fear of an ambuscade when about a quarter of a league from the village of boisnau they fancied they heard the sound of horses approaching them   11.761093103669326
he came languidly placing himself in a good situation to see all the details   7.047961778882141
and i overlooked that in italy because in italy those things are thought nothing of   10.942960956669477
i should think we did know it exclaimed albert since it is owing to that circumstance that we are packed into these small rooms like two poor students in the back streets of paris   21.07526662373528
that strength was my life   17.645419134032306
i have not slept a single instant during all this long night   12.947133255041402
we can find no fault with you for watching over yourselves when you watch so carefully over others   9.34283007603606
at last do you imagine he resumed that they mean to kill you   12.233008027605774
and now why are you here   10.472287324743032
i had no longer any wish to live for myself i have lived for him   11.41104194708873
what is this name of monte cristo   5.176333522103744
then continued the host i replied that as from the moment we seemed not likely to come to a good understanding with respect to payment i hoped that he would have at least the kindness to grant the favor of his custom to my brother host of the golden eagle   14.50787053053383
well then let me have a bottle of the least expensive   9.299920011835072
thus richard iii   7.310888758105205
then he rose and went out   13.221558044512795
the noise startled madame de villefort who shuddered and dropped the curtain   6.993168737566148
and i not at all said the prince laughing   12.73121315153413
sire replied m   12.62976026934566
if you wished to demolish them you could not and if it were possible you would not dare   12.818598652171836
so that if this resource had failed me i should have found myself very unpleasantly situated in paris   9.454453565375365
it is not because mademoiselle valentine is going to marry you that he is angry but because she will marry a union with any other would have caused him the same sorrow   13.862298385982069
the lookout has signalled her and they say she is now coming into port   18.57141271415098
i am but a minister who wants no servants being myself nothing but a servant of the queen s   13.232584774996619
there was no one like him for that   15.832248462267225
besides d artagnan passed the evening with me   21.038258995634195
i will await you at the corner of the rue du musée and if you are so long absent as to make me uneasy i will hasten to rejoin you and woe to him of whom you shall have cause to complain to me   10.572959546034962
he thanked the governor bowed and departed   11.219080534931038
his two companions were already on horseback   11.539818054731755
and then said aramis pinching his ear to make it red as he rubbed his hands to make them white and then i made a certain rondeau upon it last year which i showed to monsieur voiture and that great man paid me a thousand compliments   15.348734736028698
pale with a dull eye and heavy heart all the noble features of that face usually so calm and serene were overcast by grief   9.246251254883585
be this evening about ten o clock at st   10.601022561096263
monsieur d artagnan is in monsieur dessessart s guards and this gentleman is in the company of monsieur de tréville s musketeers   5.135214438409811
but you only asked 100 000 francs for a fowl   15.662883109052451
but at the moment mousqueton came to announce that the horses were ready and they were arising from table the stranger proposed to porthos to drink the health of the cardinal   7.547346242054431
milady held out her hand to him   12.215075603581491
and since you assure me that the cargo is all safe and sound m   7.012065469217655
those who love me follow me   10.781906911072118
it was a frightful thing to see this wretch leaving a long track of blood on the ground he passed over pale with approaching death trying to drag himself along without being seen to the body of his accomplice which lay twenty paces from him   10.218750185455704
well the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you   13.344388058599105
i should know what doctrine he leans to and i should glean from that what saint he has adopted as his patron   13.030601898935446
do you shut it   5.2571662228520255
the queen remained standing near the hangings whilst d artagnan glided behind the curtains   5.775991246778311
this time franz could contain himself no longer but sank half fainting into a seat   16.647749223203842
that s the last folly to be committed said athos seeing it is the only one for which there is no remedy   11.527973949528299
let us go to breakfast   9.716024877359667
the first was a royalist the other suspected of bonapartism   10.72075221953676
madame cried mazarin you have ruined us all the king yourself and me   8.440994860938915
said athos recovering from the instinctive fear he had at first experienced by the aid of reason   15.702967081691138
was it not this d artagnan who wounded jussac one day in that unfortunate encounter which took place near the convent of the carmes déchaussés   15.357277136068484
i was most anxious to see you   13.426114273894795
then sir i am patiently to submit to your refusal   12.33231108614803
grimaud made a sign in the affirmative and pointed to a dozen bodies which he had set up in the most picturesque attitudes   11.0891176129259
aramis smiled as one who hopes   8.408762988306371
i wish to speak to him   10.785374373397346
ah come in come in monsieur d artagnan   5.069412557587152
caderousse and his wife again interchanged a meaning look   9.20915817336132
the steward left the room with a faltering step and returned with a bundle of bank notes which the notary counted like a man who never gives a receipt for money until after he is sure it is all there   10.04339669826135
you bring me down to your own level and demand explanations   12.7030003820629
zounds my lord i don t know yet   12.426247346533783
but if we are compelled to acknowledge the superiority of another and still must retain the one that is inferior do you not know what we have to endure   9.244066968622057
countess returned franz totally unheeding her raillery i asked you a short time since if you knew any particulars respecting the albanian lady opposite   11.880891376403179
i shouted   10.47828505795758
the guests stopped formed quadrilles and danced in any part of the grounds they pleased   15.352786560502516
at the moment a great jingling of spurs was heard on the stairs   15.92035783666101
that mazarin was contemptible and that i wouldn t serve mazarin   11.313732420121177
well then it is but fair that you should be paid for your loss of time and trouble said the count   11.759478448590679
i do not understand italian   19.648887765060223
i have a dreadful headache said albert   7.866013884201063
what else   12.628438203950914
she slept as a prisoner sleeps rocked by his first hope   17.549441725231564
he was truly crying but it would have been difficult to say whether joy or the onions produced the greatest effect on the lachrymal glands of the old innkeeper of the pont du gard   19.170156958523382
they are two qualities out of the four   14.21919221266695
we should be very hard to please madam returned albert did we not think him delightful   17.58119258801686
he hastened with franz to seat himself free to recommence the discussion after dinner   13.592294243686787
be seated juxon said the king falling upon his knees   11.249864876729706
fernand s fortune was already waxing great and she developed with his growing fortune   13.062321693011938
the cardinal i believe would give the world to prevent my success   6.993140668801668
but i will take the left hand it is my custom in such circumstances   12.592273652308664
did you ever see that man before   7.0154121453019815
ah true said aramis   8.1515085657321
and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he would of the first comer   10.911297594545555
and what took place   16.141840916201655
people will come to the rescue   13.017745167732679
my first business will be to dispose of this diamond   11.028183056790624
but we are not equal to the four that you know of   16.08904922580549
this time he was both seen and heard and the tartan instantly steered towards him   14.165285741444478
and what solitude is more complete or more poetical than that of a ship floating in isolation on the sea during the obscurity of the night in the silence of immensity and under the eye of heaven   10.689245667253902
smiling is a thing very easy to meditate but more difficult to conduct to an end inasmuch as re established so recently on the throne of our ancestors we have our eyes open at once upon the past the present and the future   13.631150178682166
her woman s heart was breaking under its load of memories   12.510990833324456
has the law a memory for all those soft recollections you endeavor to recall   13.630835815730409
i will repeat them then   11.250152238127018
giovanni light a torch he added and give it to his excellency   8.808231379973321
if you go out do not go out alone   13.647634337314413
i ate some bread and some fruit   15.157095269838699
after all said the inspector if he had been rich he would not have been here   14.957913967105473
and how many were there of these linen drapers   6.6087273483136695
all at once felton stopped   11.43751423491621
why what has happened to you   15.818275982371407
d artagnan came the next day to milady s and finding her in a very ill humor had no doubt that it was lack of an answer from m   15.95611863186687
my dear franz m   5.818731433683894
but on arriving on the quai they were obliged to stop   15.582369902612635
and alone   10.405569640702128
it is already done he said   15.194556709630248
raoul gives me much uneasiness he said   6.352936764884471
repeated the count   10.746477822427327
and so he went instantly towards the waxlight and unfolded it   18.03593043670189
lean a little to the left   10.49730965254478
and morrel overwhelming him with grateful blessings conducted him to the staircase   11.27955648137936
habitually he spoke little and slowly bowed frequently laughed without noise showing his teeth which were fine and of which as the rest of his person he appeared to take great care   5.416565179158617
let us speak of nothing till we get home   12.446769940852732
no replied monte cristo   11.866093394243704
meanwhile villefort and d avrigny had made all possible haste valentine had not revived from her fainting fit on their arrival and the doctor examined the invalid with all the care the circumstances demanded and with an interest which the knowledge of the secret intensified twofold   13.990701096615176
true madame de villefort told me you lived at auteuil since it was to your house that she was taken   13.832853472157122
i will take the whole world as a witness of your crime and that until i have found an avenger   8.260476974376424
you are right valentine   9.057943454310594
she fancied that the hand not holding the phial clasped a long sharp knife   11.593333374172579
what strange means has he used to compass this blessed end   6.312570703446511
the friend of the cardinal and the famous epicure whose grace after dinner used to be good lord do me the favor to cause me to digest what i have eaten   14.101039814076298
40032m forgive me sir said franz in a resolute tone   11.237980918051353
be punctual and we shall arrive at twelve or one   15.481641602778046
for within an hour the ballet will commence   13.636405441635603
i never once doubted your doing so   9.58465512013446
it is a pleasure to work miracles before them   12.888873743189132
come when he will it shall be kept for him   8.76545941281453
i will not sign this order   16.75445214938154
these marks are regular   15.069620312813912
it is but fair said porthos and aramis hoping he would choose one of them   13.30671250821645
said albert staring   13.796854411238417
the lackey bowed to the ground and departed   13.418396936948106
the old man intimated that such was his meaning   10.038734339558777
porthos was seduced by a wine colored doublet and sea green breeches   11.847035904030111
as a punishment for having spoken without permission my friend you will please to eat this piece of paper   5.663939238312315
a silent party soon drew near to the same enclosure entered and joined the musketeers   19.032183784456475
then the tunnel will be discovered   7.603192099840535
the next morning danglars awoke late though he went to bed so early   14.170103749904762
d avrigny with an imposing calmness but i think it is now time to act   14.778343691272916
we have him   14.85554078672211
yes sire interrupted aramis raising his voice bishop juxon the faithful knight of christ obedient to your majesty s wishes   13.680486623999046
he hoped by means of loyal excuses to make a friend of athos whose lordly air and austere bearing pleased him much   12.352248199049995
eight vigorous arms lifted him up immediately and laid him in the boat where directly athos was warmed and reanimated reviving with the caresses and cares of his friends who were intoxicated with joy   7.556927209482467
then the lamp was lighted and i sat down to table   15.473579187879775
well monsieur duke said the king have you made your calculations   12.960224069115771
the half pistole is ready and he put it back again into his pocket   13.393879590634922
you shall know   19.94458937231023
that i am dependent on another i who have always gained my own livelihood honestly   9.660042565828283
be said the letter on thursday next at from six to seven o clock in the evening on the road to chaillot and look carefully into the carriages that pass   15.09584844091345
for a while nothing was heard in the room but a succession of sobs while the incense from their grateful hearts mounted to heaven   11.749506417600855
but were you not on horseback   12.73874570966867
a loud noise was heard on the stairs of people moving hastily and half stifled sobs   10.84020985952343
the officer replied in words that belonged to no language at all and the bargain was concluded   15.430919451969942
it was then upon the manifestation of this astonishment that d artagnan related to him the precaution taken and how thanks to the devotion of his three friends whom he had left scattered and bleeding on the road he had succeeded in coming off with a single sword thrust which had pierced the queen s letter and for which he had repaid m   10.77762192632203
is the officer referred to a relation of yours then   10.275333321593966
what are you meddling with stupid   13.616258127460135
athos recognized grimaud   13.57837205702427
he addressed about twelve words to him   18.662480656032194
how did the viscount albert fall into luigi s hands   8.118830533072924
my friend said he here is a proof of it   15.4371052701276
i went of course to the chief banker of the town to make inquiries   17.8852447109474
strange child murmured the baroness   18.426201725522212
what said he is it you my dear franz whose devotion and friendship are thus displayed   14.751676248951739
that is all i want interrupted dantès   6.692764455827255
but i see much that is very extraordinary in it replied d artagnan   13.767256808406968
to prove to noirtier that he was in valentine s confidence and knew all their secrets morrel took the dictionary a pen and some paper and placed them all on a table where there was a light   12.06994706610938
d artagnan was on the point of telling athos all   13.306190735768144
and your fee   11.19017122870681
now if your mistress is not dead if it is she we have just seen you will meet with her again some day or other   14.817999686780666
they proceeded silently to the centre of the place but as at this very moment the moon had just emerged from behind a cloud they thought they might be observed if they remained on that spot and therefore regained the shade of the lime trees   8.02431214324604
oh fie a quarrel between priests a duel between allies   10.996915170308649
no mother   17.440801482300557
if he defers he will find the place of honor taken   15.63302602875648
well i should hope in the first instance to have for keeper an honest fellow like you   10.623393891178617
that is he wounded in the shoulder   11.557758122467675
and the two carriages passed on towards their different destinations   12.908685484716393
for i know no one except god who can be so far above your majesty   13.015688593778034
he knew that i should arrive today at ten o clock   10.859437549896954
it is well said dantès   11.67679304736067
monte cristo examined him with the same look that at rome he had bent upon the execution of andrea and then in a tone that made a shudder pass through the veins of the poor steward the abbé busoni then told me an untruth said he when after his journey in france in 1829 he sent you to me with a letter of recommendation in which he enumerated all your valuable qualities   9.617936958031759
the supper consisted of a roast pheasant garnished with corsican blackbirds   11.954666992030027
he made a rapid and brilliant feint which mordaunt parried   11.305014225067357
the handkerchief was indeed richly embroidered and had a coronet and arms at one of its corners   11.994416114058458
fortunately she is far off said porthos for i confess she would worry me if she were here   11.10397993751986
that s right that s right dantès   10.103144142203073
you do not wish me to marry m   11.60100854175641
the day passed away without having any other influence on me than to strengthen the resolution i had formed   12.746808803705118
i have sir   10.324873404822208
athos by signs desired grimaud to bring another bottle of wine   13.7812647971539
they had all been engaged in earnest search and inquiries but had discovered nothing   5.132091405141129
some of those men sometimes die worth twenty thousand and twenty five and thirty thousand francs and sometimes more   13.913550564096072
but my fears were this time ill founded   10.30520166057042
well your publisher is very generous my dear aramis that s all i can say   17.43132410766211
it is a gift from my beautiful englishwoman or rather frenchwoman for i am convinced she was born in france though i have not questioned her   14.490625074083233
you are not joking are you   10.466405663708468
the perspiration stood in large drops on mazarin s brow   4.396317962408123
he heard the measured tread of sentinels and as they passed before the light he saw the barrels of their muskets shine   5.44945456563455
what should you know about it   14.856212534368941
i expected as i told you to reach the outer wall pierce through it and throw myself into the sea   15.596232596615794
he turned around saw the sign by the light of a reflected lamp and having dismissed the child giving him all the small coin he had about him he began knocking at the door very reasonably concluding that having now three or four hours before him he had best fortify himself against the fatigues of the morrow by a sound sleep and a good supper   13.765604601595745
then turning toward that one of the guards who had declared himself the friend of bois tracy besides continued he i have reflected my dear intimate of bois tracy that i am not less tenderly his friend than you can possibly be   10.134459519914362
the two friends saluted the duke   9.462695830305535
but the four friends were out of reach and the rochellais only fired to appease their consciences   15.399852891422979
honoré   11.859207477551282
really captain groslow you are too much in fortune s way   17.95811288825087
have you the money he demands   12.859542616328202
but his eyes raised toward heaven during this delicious occupation spoke a language which though mute was not the less expressive   10.120324939240835
he certainly did not prevent others from speaking of them before him although it was easy to perceive that this kind of conversation in which he only mingled by bitter words and misanthropic remarks was very disagreeable to him   15.176227317733492
the shoulder of athos the baldric of porthos and the handkerchief of aramis chapter v   11.79814526441367
i answered and we perfectly understood one another   9.080023806319629
i then thought of that french justice of which i had heard so much and which feared nothing and i went to the king s attorney   13.722843699119755
in her bedchamber go on   9.63591089942462
they turned the bowsprit towards sardinia where they intended to take in a cargo which was to replace what had been discharged   13.037410011356222
murmured danglars turning pale for he knew from long experience the solidity of the obstacle he had so suddenly encountered   9.601789620010697
we will go together   19.41959844019356
while his horses were impatiently pawing the ground held in by the coachman who had been seated a quarter of an hour on his box the elegant phaeton with which we are familiar rapidly turned the angle of the entrance gate and cast out on the doorsteps m   15.083099794888158
what is her name   14.294860328822226
well unfurl your wings and fly into superhuman regions   11.631550478021186
i separated the fat from the meat served to me melted it and so made oil here is my lamp   13.49957147828617
it is not either that my heart is less touched by him than any other   10.477339233399567
to the beautiful greek   13.590039984728147
as they left paris an equipage with four horses at full speed was seen to draw up suddenly   10.05552071003601
to congratulate me what for   8.340629113085182
under certain circumstances with that strong and shrewd mind your majesty possesses aided by your friends you were able to repel the attacks of that adversary   8.876107759413001
the procurator had without doubt been warned of his visit as he expressed no surprise at the sight of porthos who advanced toward him with a sufficiently easy air and saluted him courteously   15.033723844360551
did you ever meet him previously to coming hither   17.013343361493703
don t be uneasy about that   8.490632091680041
he fell into meditation   12.88057076223101
and driving the coadjutor s carriage   14.026542149502252
go then   9.585047641479024
i have none said athos   9.762807174863735
20157m chapter 35   13.8905019919646
oh monsieur le comte replied the old man had any misfortune happened to you i should never have dared to show myself to the marshal again   16.98330483957055
she will never write like monsieur de voiture   13.389114985916702
a couple of gendarmes held the muzzles of their carbines against my breast   12.432193477602794
you know that human inventions march from the complex to the simple and simplicity is always perfection   16.225599353894196
and i hate her said château renaud   12.641997250867474
milady breathed again   16.212587087435637
i rescued from the hands of mazarin s police a noble lord whom they were conducting back to the bastile where he had been for five years   14.025374973246395
then when they had passed he brought up the rear and on his face was a smile which if they could have understood it would have alarmed them much more than a visit to the room they were about to enter   15.912977730206993
it was the soul of my husband   11.580093523383447
alas returned villefort i must   14.799000559018875
the captain seemed inclined to go upon deck again but controlling himself he answered port wine   10.111216548259208
king judges spectators all turned their eyes to the bench where the four friends were seated   9.803657117518812
there is still something else said he   12.767340994139305
the voice and gesture of the man who followed danglars ordered him to do the same   8.97303231329264
well now he said it seems my dear friend that something vexes you   15.220436618450613
de tréville the third personage in the kingdom in the paternal estimation   7.400815014105364
most assuredly replied he   11.085820527393492
cried the sergeant   15.207977501647935
before grimaud had finished he rose without noise and putting his mouth to aramis s ear and at the same time touching him on the shoulder to prevent a sudden movement chevalier he said get up and don t make the least noise   13.67373125107127
heaven pardon me cried edmond falling on his knees before his father   17.967890004914185
one can hide nothing from you answered d artagnan   12.591934903920038
lead two sheep to the butcher s two oxen to the slaughterhouse and make one of them understand that his companion will not die   9.55832991073665
but dress yourself   8.269556495639108
what can i do for the son   11.410884969331311
and if the suspicions of your majesty which i still continue to doubt should prove to have any foundation what a terrible disclosure what a fearful scandal   14.595436959780601
we have   10.373115869478935
said the baroness half jesting half in earnest   13.338312541928852
cried château renaud   11.752962347594353
certainly all four   12.821301139669327
andrea cavalcanti as decked up and gay as if he were going to marry a princess   11.727310326857442
already up raoul   10.004038543383599
are you a man   12.620902608716975
it was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber for without it he would have been unable perhaps to reach the vessel certainly to return to shore should he be unsuccessful in attracting attention   13.058825989437734
rail on rail on at your ease gentlemen said morcerf somewhat piqued   14.494667322113468
you will soon not only surpass the railway which would not be very difficult in france but even the telegraph   13.60660213238034
in pronouncing these words albert had raised his voice so as to be heard by those in the adjoining boxes and in the lobby   8.362147109466388
a gesture a smile and a word from grimaud all at once were so unusual that his highness stopped short astounded   12.225584943523558
the celebrated cucumetto pursued in the abruzzo driven out of the kingdom of naples where he had carried on a regular war had crossed the garigliano like manfred and had taken refuge on the banks of the amasine between sonnino and juperno   15.02791240655478
yes but the fire ejaculated mordaunt   14.003649315952313
but as porthos on his side could not comprehend his astonishment he merely pushed him indoors saying let us go in   11.236174703314203
beauchamp uttered an exclamation of surprise on seeing his friend leap over and trample under foot all the newspapers which were strewed about the room   10.085795451541914
even his breathing seemed to be arrested   13.291118636362938
get me my purse back and keep the sixty pistoles   14.671545066200277
i see you are spoiled dear friend   5.607296630681219
de winter made the grooms who carried the arms and the porters with the luggage descend first and was about to follow them   14.97706767972254
i can scarcely credit it   14.234967677050681
the three presents of d artagnan the elder chapter ii   10.078397395642796
de villefort has been telling me   13.581132099390503
asked albert who being a constant visitor there did not understand this opposition to his entrance   10.586635817591828
he certainly likes the child but will he love me less as his affection grows for her   15.921410660537072
oh yes scoundrel   12.247282563603255
on his side d artagnan became more cautious also   14.511204055739535
for myself i will reconnoitre   8.412595369652845
this was our resolution   12.677024886458637
oh you will give me five minutes grace replied morcerf for i also expect a preserver   10.295832807603773
the traveller who was going from palestrina to tivoli had mistaken his way   11.321533121630901
it is not for me to say   10.21906569503788
that is to say replied milady driven into her entrenchment that i have not the honor of knowing her personally   13.1489905537845
ah excuse me then said d artagnan   12.67667453397767
you know that even now the king is but a child and the queen a woman weak enough   10.625595213635464
he is the best servant over whom one has the power of life and death   11.919901658516604
is that the example you set penelon   9.98834704177675
then you disapprove of duelling   13.191498567537817
and there is something in this room which reminds me forcibly of the chamber of the marquise de ganges10 or desdemona   8.913485106020852
lord de winter is ruined for the moment   11.732598669142137
yes yes i see him well enough said d artagnan   8.45536347792126
countersigned by you   10.328599346015611
the supposition is that he was stabbed by his accomplice on attempting to leave it   12.17289118366378
the pharaon can not be under weigh again in less than three months   12.86744836025321
i i return to paris   11.870490862850522
near one of the bedrooms they came to a winding staircase that led down to the garden   11.475153317588456
de laffemas chief gamekeeper of france   10.285568192760177
i will go alone in search of athos   10.275900177005044
there he bore the fainting man and laying him down upon the grass unfastened the buttons of his collar and unhooked his doublet   11.537842854321248
a gentleman who had just arrived by the route of dammartin was seated at the same table and was breakfasting   12.80116976522038
satisfied with this discovery which confirmed all his suspicions athos returned to the hôtel and found planchet impatiently waiting for him   12.363811793244983
oh it s a description you want   15.844409203985938
i really must pray you to excuse me but in truth i was not attending to the conversation   6.453386441226463
well said the coadjutor on seeing him you are in disgrace then abbé   5.441442453587596
i remember how unmercifully i laughed at what i considered your eulogistic and exaggerated praises of him   16.57088699035133
you may imagine there was something startling and ominous said haydée shaking her head and turning pale at the mere remembrance of the scene in this long file of slaves and women only half aroused from sleep or at least so they appeared to me who was myself scarcely awake   16.64976741410439
i am at the command of the committee and even claim the honor of being heard   10.90467469676075
there is nothing now to prevent my building myself a little hut on my plantation and residing not twenty yards from you   7.078968782175256
the letter is precise   12.502382678564686
oh thank you thank you edmond   15.734503694020724
i am prettily caught   8.220276862581045
after the ladies had departed for the ball whither all the entreaties of madame de villefort had failed in persuading him to accompany them the procureur had shut himself up in his study according to his custom with a heap of papers calculated to alarm anyone else but which generally scarcely satisfied his inordinate desires   15.783736684086858
in a room the walls of which are seven feet thick with grated windows each bar as thick as my arm   10.61272119143738
ah i much fear that with all your wisdom such mercy yet will prove supernal folly   16.36317758306273
i never go there   12.581013130601486
yes but they are never used   8.269829135028495
i don t like people to quiz me   10.894759371252373
i protest my dear la ramee said the duke that you are a charming fellow and that i would stay forever at vincennes to have the pleasure of your society   15.772912552881454
i am a priest sir and the secrets of confession for instance must remain between me and god and not between me and human justice   9.02724423626534
in a few minutes laporte came into the room   11.388732455630752
as she told the queen she had not seen her husband since his liberation   15.964614254327124
exclaimed gondy you speak with a certainty that gives me pleasure   14.589443126924097
but i have expected you to tell me   14.30136468186738
do you remember how he cried on d artagnan on i am taken   6.436117307249336
you have decided friend   9.901698038082085
that throw of the dice is extraordinary   12.722542477651253
raoul his hat in ribbons his face bleeding felt not only his strength but also his reason going   17.44279339817726
that concerns your majesty more than me said the cardinal   15.161636524185742
yes monsieur i know only him   15.70193603986345
chance for once seemed to favor them in sending what they were so assiduously seeking   11.113556555725692
aramis bit his lips till the blood came   17.971141818857856
indeed i should think not replied monte cristo   8.48041829221756
and even this diamond supposing that d artagnan in his projects of ambition wished to keep it to make it someday a pledge for the gratitude of the queen had not in the meanwhile since he could not part with it more value than the gravel he trod under his feet   13.904383224512209
he rose again to the surface struggled with the last desperate effort of a drowning man uttered a third cry and felt himself sinking as if the fatal cannon shot were again tied to his feet   10.893354832196406
the hinges yielded in their turn and fell still holding in their grasp fragments of the wood and the chest was open   11.190059311426705

so remain a fisherman and contented with my friendship as i can not give you more   15.902970878687935

his company was on guard at the louvre   10.214881676379616
the motive given for all the taxes summarily imposed and to which the parliament had made opposition was the necessity of sustaining the honor of france and the uncertain hope of beating the enemy   13.607334817651864
in the midst of all the compliments that awaited her on her entrance the duchess seemed to be looking for some one   8.842286366949443
dantès eyes sparkled with joy and he rubbed his hands with delight at the idea of a plan so simple yet apparently so certain to succeed   14.686685477010707
the young corsican   11.328433570525574

the remembrance of the scene at st   13.581526365701396

here it is my lord   12.438456797572464
which means that you now hesitate   8.650120532015972
even the very furniture in these moments of delirium seemed to move and this state lasted till about three o clock in the morning when a deep heavy slumber overcame the young girl from which she did not awake till daylight   15.192459390410882
but what cared i for delays or difficulties valentine as long as you confessed that you loved me and took pity on me   10.654407086066943
d artagnan sank on his knees and prayed   9.757983616226316
well let that care be mine and be at ease   6.667738428712786
you wish to ask for liberty and i give it you   14.253646791657026
do you wish him to read it   16.779339138416915
we are all four lost if by the least gesture you discover that you recognize him   6.698623232582214
i was no longer master of my senses   15.540548363722863
he s ours muttered d artagnan   14.027118457656702
we performed the usual burial service and he is at his rest sewn up in his hammock with a thirty six pound shot at his head and his heels off el giglio island   9.427642204943307

tell me now if persistence is not a virtue   10.72987256398051
as monte cristo approached she leaned upon the elbow of the arm that held the narghile and extending to him her other hand said with a smile of captivating sweetness in the sonorous language spoken by the women of athens and sparta why demand permission ere you enter   7.738068521093887
the duchess de longueville has invited me to pass a few days in normandy and has deputed me while her son is being baptized to go and prepare her residence at rouen   15.676651716144452
perhaps those prayers may soften the remorse he feels in his heart   13.626941898028626
after a few minutes of silent embarrassment athos spoke   18.44413734571672
i received the news this evening by a courier   13.10767660873585
villefort pronounced these last words with a feverish rage which gave a ferocious eloquence to his words   14.518633886179995
monte cristo opened the carriage door morrel sprang out on the pavement bertuccio was waiting on the steps   7.403446035455619

athos and he exchanged some words in a low voice then the tall man made a sign to the musketeer that he might come in   13.417095252267034
and i also said d artagnan i also   5.679605799575084
the neighbors who had opened their windows with the coolness peculiar to the inhabitants of paris in these times of perpetual riots and disturbances closed them again as soon as they saw the four men in black flee their instinct telling them that for the time all was over   13.208974261480915
but what do you think of the music   17.97834398913561

sir said aramis you speak to the point   12.123291653821603
why did he kill himself instead of you   11.424945016245413
he does not himself know the amount of his fortune   15.279789751877637
adieu count till to morrow   14.633424563948424
de villefort remained mute and cold as a statue   13.84490707923647
but perhaps you ought not to know tell us what returned d artagnan but first put a napkin against the window and draw the curtains   15.494811644746157

the prisoner was one of those military adventurers who sold their blood to whoever would buy and grew old in stratagems and spoils   12.037773087472779
during the examination of milady by the officer as may well be imagined milady on her part was not less scrutinizing in her glances   10.649417609287653
sir unless you force me i think i can effectually force you   10.649579022876788

there a post chaise was waiting for him he entered it with his valet de chambre saying that he was going to fontainebleau   13.37191123880052
ah madame said comminges hastening to d artagnan here is one who can tell you better than myself for he was my protector   11.977960802447862
but while we are speaking of business danglars added pleased to find an opportunity of changing the subject tell me what i am to do for m   11.15411550472234
two visitors who were there when the count arrived having gazed at him with all their eyes retired after that reasonable delay which politeness admits and curiosity requires   9.25812151561383
noirtier s eye continued to say read   10.925826630351883
milady sprang out of bed and opened the window   12.555602134863804
i think they have some esteem for me said the mendicant with pride and that not only will they obey me but wherever i go they will follow me   12.526523417588736
excellency said a servant opening the door a man in the dress of a penitent wishes to speak to you   11.883355400938443

how you are going soon   11.069325173866241
the noise of the door with its creaking hinges and bolts ceased and a silence more sombre than that of solitude ensued the silence of death which was all pervasive and struck its icy chill to the very soul of dantès   8.46206529086025
did you know him   8.146274619019277
it was purely and simply his removal in terms clear and precise   8.192473037006089
they never buried the dead   13.489059073465697
i do nothing else all day   13.634499240146248
a table with two covers bearing a supper ready prepared stood as if by magic in the middle of the apartment   14.43614194767136
they opened the door and the four men alighted   14.24713975924916
you do not avoid going to war by that means   15.780208536755199
it was evident that the cardinal was weighing beforehand the terms in which he was about to speak and that milady was collecting all her intellectual faculties to comprehend the things he was about to say and to engrave them in her memory when they should be spoken   12.825272195855003
and he gave him the cane again first making a semicircle from the head to the tail of pistache   10.044827454356472
morrel descended and came forth to meet it followed by the soldiers and sailors there assembled to whom he had repeated the promise already given that dantès should be the successor to the late captain leclere   11.970737615549913
the two cavalcanti bowed to the count and left the house   10.254545549470318
what has the monk to do with this milady   8.012621830373158
the rendezvous d artagnan ran home immediately and although it was three o clock in the morning and he had some of the worst quarters of paris to traverse he met with no misadventure   13.457371562036649
stormed   6.739423242484333
it was done by the romans who much esteemed them and pliny relates that they sent slaves from ostia to rome who carried on their heads fish which he calls the mulus and which from the description must probably be the goldfish   8.516089453225643
from the cardinal   9.812155338969761

you terrify me athos   9.273713026011928
yes answered maximilian but i feel sure he has an excellent heart and that he likes us   7.867976763719277
come it is worth thinking about   8.681729279527305
let us unite again not our hearts which have never been severed but our courage and our fortunes   13.146241126586721
danglars himself announced   8.99411362294359
what she had taken for confusion was a tumult   12.049790923730184
for having only arrived yesterday in paris i as yet know no one but monsieur de tréville to whom i was recommended by my father who has the honor to be in some degree one of his friends   15.741806684892598
this was before his servant came   16.43051840389979
madame de villefort who had not yet sufficiently recovered from her late emotion to allow of her entertaining visitors so immediately retired to her bedroom while the procureur who could better depend upon himself proceeded at once to the salon   13.386572688528728
do you intend to struggle against our ill fortune   11.853349494584435
she turned toward the wall to smile for there was in this smile such an expression of triumph that this smile alone would have betrayed her   15.949860298606561
no no continued the count had i to avenge myself it is not thus i would take revenge   16.307530568518747

you shall soon see him   12.891693091636045
as to that answered mousqueton puzzled how to get out of the difficulty i must confess that to me beer is as disagreeable as wine is to the english   13.365504975863077
let it be a million said caderousse   11.203145270339
ah and as if struck in the heart he let go the hook and dropped with a groan   9.492597946625988
the splendor was within   17.08516975946039
the host shook his head   11.069502468175779
permit you   14.226166730536832
beauchamp related to the young man all the facts we have just narrated   7.0454035333311165

a man between fifty five and sixty tall strong swarthy black hair and beard   13.024852005659149
see my lord said he in a deep gloomy tone here is a woman who was under my guard and who has killed herself   11.658417733424733
a moment s delay said athos   12.326846314087396
the mother retires into the country and the son enters the army   13.043987350192543
it was then in the silence of night in the dim light shed from the alabaster lamp on the chimney piece that she saw the shadows pass and repass which hover over the bed of sickness and fan the fever with their trembling wings   13.392223226892934
fernand mondego count of morcerf an old soldier who has fought in twenty battles and whose honorable scars they would denounce as badges of disgrace   15.783874067122362
there is a certain fatality in it   14.554945392109436
a concierge waited at the door to exhibit to visitors this monument of curiosity once a scene of terror   11.801641989505972
he then laid him down on the floor where d artagnan after giving him just time enough to draw his breath gagged him with his long scarf   11.811509637191623
you will not believe in him who requires but a prayer a word a tear and he will forgive   11.22193803197489
if on the contrary it is a prisoner the noise i make will alarm him he will cease and not begin again until he thinks everyone is asleep   14.202254548417372
at your service sir said planchet overwhelmed with joy   13.017671472786553
these gardeners are the most careless people in the world   6.266329000347508
there ensued a brief silence during which these two persons who at first sight recognized each other so clearly as of noble race examined each other without embarrassment on either side   11.66730451023533
thou hast done well   13.933396192679965
yes kill them   8.836433250169343
come first of all said athos to d artagnan my friend that i may shake hands with you you our rescuer you the true hero of us all   11.985860763213635
porthos drew back a step   8.314863688122747
cried jussac   13.808702103998014
noirtier looked at her with a glance of the most profound scrutiny   10.104696153226104
it is not the king   14.985802917871938
impossible for three reasons replied athos   15.622437456843832
are you sure you are more reasonable   8.088959147554398
he would crush you at a word   8.742482510735279
believe me that she who alone recognized you has been the only one to comprehend you   7.603332184452279
i am listening madame with the greatest interest said mazarin   8.440091703906251
if mazarin is an italian i am a gascon   11.901041512245246
from blois to paris was a journey of four days for ordinary travelers but d artagnan arrived on the third day at the barriere saint denis   15.07257398018296
said mercédès endeavoring in vain to restrain a tear which glistened in the corner of her eye   11.63794403453035
and had the dark and wondrous island indeed faithfully guarded its precious secret   11.676539610963575
inquired d artagnan wishing to signify to the hostess that her lamentations were superfluous and that therefore she had better spare him demonstrations of her grief   13.901811178902317
you had your portfolio with you then   12.118056138004475
she continued to look at him for nearly ten minutes and in these ten minutes the immovable guardian never turned round once   11.11185545100215
well said valentine you may approve again for grandpapa is again thinking of it   11.700895328181936
you are the pearl of brave bold men   7.480386467840376
we must play the farce to the end   10.17870373458176
who told you that my dear   8.556187561977097
midnight struck slowly and sadly   10.563802820827856
grimaud continued to climb like a cat and succeeded at last in catching hold of a hook which served to keep one of the shutters back when opened   10.7590136068543
as to lord de winter he descended the stairs rapidly and went straight to the port   13.831615812086879
the small and angular head of this man his white hair and thick gray moustaches caused him to be easily recognized by baptistin who had received an exact description of the expected visitor and who was awaiting him in the hall   7.8792562401189805
as he spoke dantès looked toward the spot where the fishing vessel had been wrecked and started   16.59417794223766
oh my former friends my former friends   16.76293679954739
then i make a sacrifice   15.990718137299778
they advanced about thirty paces and then stopped at a small esplanade surrounded with rocks in which seats had been cut not unlike sentry boxes   7.754539795257664
the next day athos leaning out of his window which looked upon the most populous part of the city heard the act of parliament which summoned the ex king charles i   12.367296357487712
pray to the almighty to spare his life and i will take upon myself to promote his happiness   10.70645469985126
and said villefort is it at your house in the champs élysées that you receive your visitors   12.025684581885777
i thank you my son   16.575042999643426
apropos continued he franz is coming soon but it will not interest you   10.492380988767932
so far well said athos i perceive you know me   12.51414876056795
remain neutral monseigneur if you find that i act as becomes a gallant man   13.183980221902377
because for instance you noticed on the evening of the ball we gave that m   9.057840735157072
and this is all   13.76934702013842
it appears that the method i have adopted with this boy is decidedly the best   16.055883837059135
yes sir replied julie with hesitation   12.106534713319457
exclaimed the novice do you know monsieur de tréville   17.055139648992096
who comes there   8.416231573799084
i should therefore be ill received here and ill regarded there if i accepted what monseigneur offers me   13.951922043564666
i know him better than he knows himself   10.581949833863707
let him come   12.145387062500747
then they saw as the felucca turned two other heads peeping those of aramis and grimaud   14.470137929757126
the general putting his hand on his sword exclaimed if you talk of honor do not begin by disavowing its laws and impose nothing by violence   14.84612902924111
the patron shook his head   16.682700848306403
but peppino did not even belong to my band   11.891089403709449
and said cavalcanti i know that lake fusaro alone supplies lampreys of that size   16.17240165726217
milady during this time continued to strike at him with horrible fury screaming in a formidable way   8.955449456482693
i am rich enough to know whatever i desire to know and i can promise you i am not wanting in curiosity   11.407765067648965
it was the island of monte cristo   12.9983720696553
but never bring him near me if you would not see me die of terror   11.347223146848016
this time the clerks evinced no inclination to laugh such a real ear clipper did porthos appear   4.44418512890727
nevertheless i promise thee thou shalt be hidden here though i risk by concealing thee neither more nor less than my lieutenancy if it was found out that i gave one rebel an asylum   15.854214514027916
and blood too   11.048777823276565
let us go then   11.701626920494812
not like you heartless creature who would be glad never to see them again   11.492039847040843
the little old man remained at the coach door   9.672843305999848
it is raoul who has worked in me the change you see   11.11968515982283
and pray asked franz where are these pistols blunderbusses and other deadly weapons with which you intend filling the carriage   15.153528391937439
i must own said aramis i am like the comte de la fere i can see nothing remarkable about it   11.748332083166789
yesterday morning madame   8.69795367955
come come continued the count complaints are unavailing be a man be strong be full of hope for i am here and will watch over you   13.032943514581799
but they will fight none the less if only to mask the conferences   12.741955511840848
exclaimed the queen   8.773092550755685
and what do you think of her personal appearance   11.315557345653085
i thought you had softened   10.214998802946635
look around you gentlemen if you doubt the fact said the duke   13.592605098059146
monte cristo did not see this second manifestation of physical exhaustion   9.571912535491144
you talk like a noodle my friend said caderousse   8.096269976959169
i have not so much as you have since i do not fly as you do   9.396417223110255
held a gourd full of rum to his mouth   8.364192654854168
thou dost exist thou art indeed man s father in heaven and his judge on earth   7.848883284470715
three days passed thus during which his prayers were frequent if not heartfelt   9.706091814197983
i have that honor your excellency   12.704547147194871
it also boasted of what in languedoc is styled a garden consisting of a small plot of ground on the side opposite to the main entrance reserved for the reception of guests   12.197813355954963
and you have seen this cavern morcerf   12.296130571178276
if i made you that present it was that you might adorn yourself therewith   8.760144414349272
around us were all my mother s servants carrying trunks bags ornaments jewels purses of gold with which they were hurrying away in the greatest distraction   11.476970137778963
and she put the glass to the lips of the young woman who drank mechanically   15.752455284638295
she opened her eyes and saw the abbess accompanied by a young woman with light hair and delicate complexion who fixed upon her a look full of benevolent curiosity   18.33869873631672
mordaunt reflected a moment and after some hesitation was about to speak when bernouin entered hastily and bending down to the ear of the cardinal whispered my lord the queen henrietta maria accompanied by an english noble is entering the palais royal at this moment   18.346332414744754
everything is paid replied the host and liberally   8.39281206928207
he has slept a long time on a hard bed so he won t object to a soft one   17.4806747344658
i have proof of it   13.653912796492703
but the boy refuses saying you are too ugly   11.987458819788593
the coachman without saying a word drove up it passed along the piazza di spagna and the rospoli palace and stopped at the door of the hotel   12.93081098783813
the duke tore open the note passed his hands over his eyes for he was dazzled and confused and read my dear duke you may entirely confide in the brave lad who will give you this note   8.910141359414656
but the case is provided for and i am come to france to seek allies   15.413586228265169
happy is he who after having watched its silent growth is permitted to gather and call it his own   18.53594251471987
he knew better than anyone else how to open that weather beaten door with the large headed nail which served to raise the latch within   15.409031713916406
while uttering these words with this expression of joy his teeth clashed together violently   12.164720417239414
a man of about forty five or fifty entered exactly resembling the smuggler who had introduced franz into the cavern   8.34270405511478
yes truly dear friend   12.286111216210768
i have during ten years considered myself the agent of thy vengeance and other wretches like morcerf danglars villefort even morcerf himself must not imagine that chance has freed them from their enemy   13.560078185170397
i am tired of hearing only of market reports of the end of the month of the rise and fall of spanish funds of haitian bonds   16.12522366929176
during the meal which was excellent and admirably served franz looked repeatedly at albert in order to observe the impressions which he doubted not had been made on him by the words of their entertainer   17.35527463816429
it appeared as if there were abysses in milady s soul whose depths were dark and unknown   15.665475130085015
but before madame de villefort could reach her friend the procureur had found time to whisper to madame danglars i must speak to you   14.167455869890958
and monsieur de nogaret de la valette what do you say of him   16.038060787426197
go on m   8.530000237838678
yes my lord answered the man   10.831153434359294
do you wish me to do so   16.066445395624687
and the abbé s plan has not even the merit of originality   21.209425017730567
and to his credit be it spoken his mind even amid the glib loquacity of the guides was duly and deeply touched with awe and enthusiastic admiration of all he saw   11.331029926959456
the night was dark snow was falling the streets were silent and deserted   13.471801236678955
athos and aramis kept themselves to their role   15.409446207473128
she had scarcely closed the door after her when monte cristo appeared at the corner of a street so that he found and lost her again almost at the same instant   7.5743370129293455
ah my friend said he it is all the better if you are in difficulties   14.236745333430655
said morrel sorrowfully   9.391510962275882
antoine mounted two horses properly equipped which a servant without livery had waiting for them   7.947704923305725
you annoyed count   11.141827352300561
he had always something or other to do   13.309281227202506
the queen stopped him   7.112697850477467
you must henceforth be admired and quoted as a model of it   16.76048331643348
a hundred writers since socrates seneca st   13.266243942035544
i am all attention   16.198336150906833
d artagnan is too good a comrade to leave his brothers in embarrassment while he wears the ransom of a king on his finger   10.028126647940377
valentine was sitting at a little distance from them timidly awaiting the moment when she should be obliged to speak   10.887465018925521
not so   10.94672981528075
then i drew another glass of water from my protecting fountain and drank it   12.20495283040185
yes doubtless i have promised to give my daughter to a man who loves her but not to one who does not   16.308018462205286
i fear valentine replied the lover that were she living i should never have had the happiness of knowing you   12.744807859627914
since then continued aramis i have lived very agreeably   13.520458601303359
has monsieur de beaufort escaped from vincennes   13.252502750285133
no replied the count   11.131153714652603
the most satisfactory part of the matter said d artagnan is that there remains no trace of it   11.014419989470808
only do not allow me to be insulted   7.470164412652255
for i think you told me it was a boy m   9.326725280332393
the count then is in the chateau   7.5847727433251375
at the noise of the door madame danglars turned round and looked upon her husband with an astonishment she took no trouble to conceal   9.974640453027146
yes sire said a voice which athos recognized as that of aramis   12.114589943055995
20333m certainly your excellency   13.997047318376332
we thought it dead he repeated   11.483868428642563
no madame contrary to most history it is true   13.239758810711402
morrel i believe   13.539122560163964
replied she   11.653897202894345
were you there then   7.329462327831653
the viscount of morcerf can only wed a marchioness   13.827640994821536
at another time added he i should have said give them besides two hundred francs over as a present   12.519015418148769
oh he was not a gentleman i ll answer for it   16.45475735513297
do not lull yourself in security or you will be lost   11.732591434642456
and porthos and aramis   9.408656976520366
the first words exchanged between the four friends on account of the ceremony which each of them mingled with their demonstration were somewhat forced and even the repast began with a kind of stiffness   8.391491651746508
the following day dantès presented jacopo with an entirely new vessel accompanying the gift by a donation of one hundred piastres that he might provide himself with a suitable crew and other requisites for his outfit upon condition that he would go at once to marseilles for the purpose of inquiring after an old man named louis dantès residing in the allées de meilhan and also a young woman called mercédès an inhabitant of the catalan village   15.16089650738234
aramis you know continued athos is naturally cold and then he is always involved in intrigues with women   10.825113902755009
it is for a consultation which will last three hours at least   6.695282998184842
on the contrary i have one but i expected the count would be tempted by one of the brilliant proposals made him yet as he has not replied to any of them i will venture to offer him a suite of apartments in a charming hotel in the pompadour style that my sister has inhabited for a year in the rue meslay   5.993072782764248
the boat that now arrived assured by the answering signal that all was well soon came in sight white and silent as a phantom and cast anchor within a cable s length of shore   14.987790650118999
de villefort left the room and valentine seated herself at the bedside of her grandmother   12.28464115008079
that is just the case precisely so   10.937796254930763
i am perfectly aware of that fact answered monte cristo calmly   16.97406772168816
and where is he going   12.471461686279296
but d artagnan took no heed of it   15.586967769229755
all very fine my lord but at the very first hint you give of such a thing i will strangle you and become frondist   14.080725071265434
and perhaps you have a preference for one boat more than another   10.51128023198827
the news of the return of don carlos was brought by telegraph   11.21283483181345
oh replied valentine with a convulsive movement oh indeed maximilian you are too timid for an officer for a soldier who they say never knows fear   11.131119962890235
and therefore added he quietly i have not confidence in every one   12.389707382269577
then i would kill him rather than let him go   13.771506456423392
i bought it from him but it belongs to d artagnan   9.748989666852824
well then let us say no more about it said d artagnan   14.863832208492013
come tell me what is the joke   12.958934757271507
it is this sir said the king angrily that general cromwell has reached newcastle   10.727338091161041
but he feared lest this mark of affection bestowed upon his lackey in the open street might appear extraordinary to passers by and he restrained himself   14.948832291942614
i can not consent that this woman should die thus   8.86666699698826
and yet that woman deserved her fate   12.546321532419796
the horse started brushed against the imprudent man who thought by his strength alone to stay the tempest and he fell against the wall   8.294115177413417
but if you don t know this woman how do you know her name   15.758688126541898
and he is in paris   11.197192910301263
she has a clear and penetrating judgment and does not smile on the proposed union   8.308627075630003
do you pity him   9.891476049388078
but since my arrest and the robbery that was committed in my house i am alarmed every time i hear a door open particularly in the night   10.187100774179967
cried planchet i ve a man behind me   15.822319158879184
well my dear friend let us approach the window and there you can match your strength against that of an iron bar   10.178914410974572
it was our captain of spahis who had arrived on médéah   9.971113782493047
of course you sent for a doctor   11.179679201723069
one was compelled to say i am the angel of the lord   10.403551731700466
noirtier had every morning and he has escaped by a miracle   14.502511044564653
did you see the president at the minister s last night   5.7610635140634825
ali made a sign in the affirmative   11.587538100118117
the person who opened it must have taken me for a madman for i rushed at once to the stable   18.20412448645741
morrel soon perceived a man standing among the rocks apparently awaiting a sign from them to advance and pointed him out to valentine   8.69893585938527
now valentine i firmly believe that he knew of my wish to possess this horse and that he lost expressly to give me the means of procuring him   14.768683418366798
sire replied the courtier laughing in order that he might seem to comprehend the quotation your majesty may be perfectly right in relying on the good feeling of france but i fear i am not altogether wrong in dreading some desperate attempt   9.47868931498618
the pont du gard inn such of my readers as have made a pedestrian excursion to the south of france may perchance have noticed about midway between the town of beaucaire and the village of bellegarde a little nearer to the former than to the latter a small roadside inn from the front of which hung creaking and flapping in the wind a sheet of tin covered with a grotesque representation of the pont du gard   8.721755661290947
but it was so carefully folded that no one could have read it and the seal was perfect   17.608566981872894
i suppose you have no more money and that they will be welcome   11.753561240784332
that madame is an official secret   4.671271265479985
gentlemen said jussac it is with great regret that i pronounce the thing impossible   12.061425774609905
monsieur d artagnan promised me his assistance   13.411572823093183
and villefort threw disdainfully on his desk the letter dantès had just given back to him   11.292890832746846
oh mother   10.88799442858588
the thin spare man   8.47025421171313
reflect upon it   10.081368971329574
love   9.63040816416419
twas too brief an enjoyment and la ramee felt that the gayety of heart he had regarded as the cause of health of which it was perhaps rather the result would not long survive such a mode of life   11.452097408045901
well answered   17.028951317793492
now it is you who are unjust maximilian cried valentine   15.8318006797962
yes where is this letter   8.387611749891231
this seemed a good augury   11.01670080163731
all would pay deference to an officer like you with a fierce moustache and a long sabre but they think they may crush a poor weeping girl with impunity   14.770029272002962
od s bodikins said groslow as the four friends entered i had almost given you up   13.358302247096232
there is yours my dear friend replied d artagnan   13.249668633542045
charles leaning on a table was gazing at a medallion of his wife and daughter   14.218553574570485
porthos and aramis drew back disappointed and drawing his sword d artagnan turned to his adversary sir i am waiting for you   7.42286047208738
he had the resolution to stop with this   12.40956393296426
the baroness knew how calm villefort naturally was and his present excitement frightened her so much that she opened her mouth to scream but the sound died in her throat   14.604589111676479
i will let you know a week beforehand   16.041620585495004
let the past be forever forgotten   14.140044121480578
yet these two noble and intelligent creatures united by the indissoluble ties of maternal and filial love had succeeded in tacitly understanding one another and economizing their stores and albert had been able to tell his mother without extorting a change of countenance mother we have no more money   11.976904050539208
you know him by what title   10.748327745465877
when she was sufficiently near for me to distinguish her features i saw she was from eighteen to nineteen tall and very fair   9.451053000414635
i hope i am not the cause   17.22941223335494
said franz then you are a smuggler occasionally gaetano   14.681468554980881
the white hair was thrown back from her yellow forehead and her eyes already sunken by the furrows of age now almost disappeared beneath the eyelids swollen with grief   11.897253038032597
go to bed planchet and sleep soundly   10.96336052420305
it was in fact a small craft from dunkirk bound for boulogne   11.080229583857006
of what use to day   13.018148273127865
what a wrist you have reverend sir   10.449395992515182
after this satisfied with the way in which he had conducted himself at meung without remorse for the past confident in the present and full of hope for the future he retired to bed and slept the sleep of the brave   15.10973659975621
ah i always thought there was some secret understanding in that quarter   13.722533358605055
and me too   12.398779185833014
danglars speeches said debray   19.541824691517704
if on the sixteenth day after your departure at eight o clock in the evening you are not here no money even if it be but five minutes past eight   12.332276388296592
he is a young man that appears scarce sixteen years of age and is called the viscount de bragelonne   11.784509153897616
dantès stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle as if he now beheld it for the first time   4.97671272989712
i think i have sprained my wrist said porthos   11.83354485185432
you will ruin us all   12.308439487028458
they came nobody knew whence   15.711725367363314
that little man in black that you upset at the corner of saint jean cemetery   13.877976091190757
a lion even   13.267670620645418
the brutal affectation with which you have enumerated and classified your crimes calls for a severe reprimand on the part of the court both in the name of morality and for the respect due to humanity   10.549646046535427
bertuccio said the count severely   11.506588461344236
mordaunt followed the carriage and when he had watched it drive beneath the sombre arches he went and stationed himself under a wall over which the shadow was extended and remained motionless amidst the moldings of jean goujon like a bas relievo representing an equestrian statue   11.155508943341715
faria at the age of fifty had devoted three years to the task   14.968574464513132
be silent madame cried felton and do not speak to me thus   11.580365578294499
yes the servant has given his description   16.42813209805209
the next day mercédès came to implore the protection of m   8.92016075729071
he was born at pampinara and entered the count s service when he was five years old   16.479935283593072
your pardon   13.625520416869579
i will do as children do for fear of losing the paper repeat the name along the route   18.503735993719793
i shouldn t wonder if he were at the head of the mob at this very moment   12.721312717742542
large valances of silk embroidered with flowers of gay colors which were rather faded fell from the wide windows   12.09136843526452
villefort pale and agitated ran to the window put aside the curtain and saw him pass cool and collected by two or three ill looking men at the corner of the street who were there perhaps to arrest a man with black whiskers and a blue frock coat and hat with broad brim   14.384630132884542
and i do not think you can regret the intended husband of your daughter   10.12917089591119
d avrigny m   18.091307245978783
planchet recognized him first   14.078286486518406
what were you saying to this youngster   8.72892497555667
i do not understand my lord said she in order to gain time and make her adversary speak out   13.794280476568169
the other two gentlemen were unknown to him   7.800180043885582
he brought him also the amount of his wages which captain gaumard had not dared to apply for   16.555932142125904
de tréville was admitted into the household of the young prince where he made such good use of his sword and was so faithful to his motto that louis xiii   8.820331650311083
villefort complied and they passed on to the dining room   10.728662766947838
eugénie bowed coldly to the count and availed herself of the first moment when the conversation became earnest to escape to her study whence very soon two cheerful and noisy voices being heard in connection with occasional notes of the piano assured monte cristo that mademoiselle danglars preferred to his society and to that of m   10.35900139783539
the chancellor advanced therefore toward anne of austria and said with a very perplexed and embarrassed air and now it remains for me to make the principal examination   6.462835075154776
they proceeded thus to peronne   9.448940536731964
said caderousse or i shall be unable to sign it   14.638998679664699
asked the king looking with admiration at these two men whose chief idea seemed to be how they could take on their shoulders all the dangers that assailed him   15.862691763720008
as usual valentine strolled for a short time among her flowers but without gathering them   11.905099909892675
moreover you are our prisoners   13.488140982505085
although general d épinay served under napoleon did he not still retain royalist sentiments   12.147645646051508
a vagabond a corsican   15.184946969939052
there was an expression on the face of her intrepid protector which commanded her veneration   15.771415939843447
d artagnan looked at the envelope   9.496588806660396
replied the young man additionally exasperated with this mixture of insolence and good manners of politeness and scorn   6.17314397250072
in that case i assure you there would very soon be a countess and viscountess of morcerf   13.707325538649568
the count bowed with the air of a person who hears a name for the first time   7.2350582838092174
you pretend not to know because government was not rich enough   4.957209292042913
it will be useless for him to find you here   14.677329046975194
are you french sir   10.596890719081328
thomson french were your bankers   11.744248068053974
through one of the windows of the bedroom on a line with that in the dressing room the count could see into the street   9.957547781307564
but a certain briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it probable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of time   12.30477147734878
albert pretended he did not hear bowed to his mother and quitted her   11.778117392977299
i swear to make you my lawful wife before my lips even shall have approached your forehead   12.455040548201254
i informed my superiors that i did not feel myself sufficiently prepared for ordination and at my request the ceremony was postponed for a year   12.952250507556379
well i will have franz and château renaud   8.280220007379185
only take care you do not break your legs in stumbling over some chain or your neck by falling in a hole   14.973255942276573
we should be hard to please if we were not   13.478520508451187
he is an original then   9.906582331976924
and athos at amiens detained by an accusation of coining   8.388516470996038
madame de villefort and i have a communication to make to you   11.257341416248055
suppose he said we roughly chalk out a career for this young man   7.764506748739461
i will go to the second after attending the first said d artagnan   11.654357316779226
for you told me your father desired the marriage   13.523718733956464
and why were you alone   10.872177763369272
will you add these twenty francs to the seven you have   7.888967606181034
and at the same time he sprang toward his sword   11.662030777484116
my father has been a jacobin more than anything else said villefort carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence   10.552150052964016
d avrigny cried villefort i can not tell you all i feel at this moment terror grief madness   15.516281490964696
on saturday   9.646124215748653
he intended to pass the day in making a small gallows and hang one of the finest of these fish in the middle of his room the red color evidently conveying an allusion to the cardinal so that he might have the pleasure of hanging mazarin in effigy without being accused of having hung anything more significant than a crawfish   9.972083327549008
having dined with his usual tranquillity and moderation the count making a signal to ali to follow him went out by the side gate and on reaching the bois de boulogne turned apparently without design towards paris and at twilight   7.4308380656934645
friend mousqueton you see that we have a reinforcement and we must have an increase of supplies   11.335190454952615
the queen breathed more freely   17.052740090696663
the halt at noyon was but brief every one there being wrapped in profound sleep   11.975111747430958
mordaunt did not reply   2.8830689646494374
the abbé with difficulty got away from the enthusiastic thanks of caderousse opened the door himself got out and mounted his horse once more saluted the innkeeper who kept uttering his loud farewells and then returned by the road he had travelled in coming   14.27945638135103
villefort while turning restlessly on the cushions felt something press against him   19.12975441583968
dantès sighed   13.467213534731231
i fear an attack myself after all these disasters   16.333136220841702
let them come in   12.442548369539418
however he obeyed and leaning out of the window he cried to the coachman rue de la fontaine no   15.263513673996748
thanks my friends thanks   16.24404681254675
oh no not at all   14.4352346531897
the two travelers consulted for a moment   10.946679145341117
the cardinal s quarters were upon the downs at the bridge of la pierre in a simple house without any entrenchment   9.948119532258591
like a patient miner i have dug deep into thy very entrails to root out evil thence   12.268366193312168
indeed sir i recognize you   18.1695056182319
i wish you would try and find me a situation with him as grandfather since he holds the money chest   8.731634984442312
ah yes most assuredly said the eyes of the paralytic for he closed them with an expression which valentine could not mistake   12.46992372572479
four of them can guard the king and the other four your prisoners   12.658993368401882
but let your vengeance fall on the culprits on him on me but not on my son   10.094069173000404
do i turn to the right or to the left hand   13.595817080821334
the young man waited in comparative darkness and listened   14.864629821515708
since the evening before he had really been the hero of one of the tales of the thousand and one nights and he was irresistibly attracted towards the grotto   15.674459408201757
the door as it opened disclosed a gloomy sky in which the moon strove vainly to struggle through a sea of clouds that covered her with billows of vapor which she illumined for an instant only to sink into obscurity   10.970359169512065
i questioned her but in vain   13.48668452150829
never to anyone   16.87272355803301
like the streams which the heat of the summer has dried up and which after the autumnal storms gradually begin oozing drop by drop so did the count feel his heart gradually fill with the bitterness which formerly nearly overwhelmed edmond dantès   6.598864197409915
but he was mistaken   15.057030962190767
there he saw the grand marshal who charged him with an oral message to a bonapartist in paris whose name i could not extract from him   18.956612109652724
sleep broken by nervous spasms excitation of the brain torpor of the nerve centres   8.175496913150724
besides this as every great action bears its recompense with it the brave exploit of d artagnan resulted in the restoration of the tranquility he had lost   14.319440435253046
cried he seizing my arm and wresting from me the weapon that had so badly served me you want to take my life do you my pretty puritan   7.830653203318617
have i discovered the truth   10.65552782339902
god has made them senseless said felton   10.921495859082775
the soldier replied by pointing out to him an officer who was conversing on foot his hand upon the neck of a horse on which the individual to whom he was talking sat   11.575850660774606
i am curious to know what work you were perusing with so much attention as we entered   8.254019920339116
their spirits live in me   20.48204732776793
château renaud bowed to the countess   15.738364463989505
withdraw then or i shall call and have you turned out as you were in london   13.19441304588194
you is it   10.711318250401712
the coadjutor whose eyes devoured her slightest movements seized the paper immediately the signature had been affixed to it returned to the window and waved it in his hand   12.5836971873752
valentine promised all that morrel required of her and certainly it was less difficult now for her to believe that she should marry maximilian than it was an hour ago to assure herself that she should not marry franz   15.66001457662449
her eyes of the same color as her hair were surmounted by well arched brows whose great defect however consisted in an almost habitual frown while her whole physiognomy wore that expression of firmness and decision so little in accordance with the gentler attributes of her sex her nose was precisely what a sculptor would have chosen for a chiselled juno   12.800165724447039
her skin was admired for its velvety softness   13.011947522855468
yes really sir you were in fact a medical man said madame de villefort since you had cured the sick   14.93837858586895
the old man assented   7.881957741334302
to begin with tell me said she how have you watched me so closely as to be aware beforehand not only of my arrival but even of the day the hour and the port at which i should arrive   12.667012198676176
you forget replied athos that we consider ourselves your prisoners and not free from the engagement we entered into   12.661592021341665
then you are called monsieur grimaud   17.07883746379698
i am to fight today   11.033545368818446
and yet i should have preferred you will have the pleasure of the surprise   13.568650473694671
what more is to be done   17.508235140113992
good caderousse   7.411649633882521
it will take quite six weeks to unload the cargo and we can not get you ready for sea until three months after that   14.529628619106141
she began to believe herself really alive and awake and the belief that her reason was this time not deceived made her shudder   12.360666686106908
and i too murmured the young lady with the velvet eyes   10.573875190265934
why do you not seek revenge   12.857770913489441
yes there is something in what you say   10.019251110432467
can i be of service to your majesty   11.511394965781534
but you did not perceive me because you had no eyes but for the pretty lady to whom you just now gave the holy water   13.996886329350328
friend he said you have been too good in pardoning me   10.47547160887306
i think i have seen him three times in my life   11.457872450037192
valentine and the old man heard this conversation and noirtier fixed his eye so earnestly on valentine that she felt bound to answer to the look   10.37543080891132
your private adventures have touched me to the quick   13.724627241243896
i was about to offer myself sir said the priest   13.165032259523759
yes yes they could not help admitting that the king for whom we sacrificed rank wealth and station was truly our louis the well beloved while their wretched usurper has been and ever will be to them their evil genius their napoleon the accursed   10.444084807283012
a great man in every country m   5.457081786830426
he never invited anybody to go up with him and no one could form an idea of what his sumptuous apartment contained in the shape of real riches   12.05110896750145
now take my horse to the nearest inn and conduct me to your vessel   10.238688400316256
the parisians always curious always affected by funereal display looked on with religious silence while the splendid procession accompanied to their last abode two of the number of the old aristocracy the greatest protectors of commerce and sincere devotees to their principles   12.386248615654468
called a joyous voice from without mercédès   8.940655442341814
the husband heard of the affair   13.489733661275746
your pardon m   9.056828262760543
dormice are bad neighbors for us who do not eat them preserved as the romans did   13.20858258828796
beauchamp it holds four very well will you accompany us   10.89809032593104
aramis rushed after the fugitive hat   19.127527388727017
a trial would make a noise and a noise would get the attention of our friends who would check the operations of monsieur de mazarin   16.332890287524105
you will accomplish what i was to have done and derive all the honor and profit from it   13.423969255453367
he will never believe that my death was suicide   15.908478579397395
madame said raoul the louvre is but the second palace this news has reached   10.351307522901475
only as our gascon was not easily intimidated or rather thanks to a great pride natural to the men of his country he did not allow one easily to see what was passing in his mind when that which was passing at all resembled fear he placed himself haughtily in front of messieurs the guards and waited with his hand on his hip in an attitude by no means deficient in majesty   17.277873978139525
some fragments of past splendor appeared here and there upon the walls of this modest lodging   14.691314285220278
but tell me dantès if you had command of the pharaon should you be glad to see danglars remain   14.528319253593976
sir said he to the priest i shall keep this cross in my hand till the last moment   9.527390637670935
well gentlemen resumed mordaunt we must set out without delay to day is the last day granted me by the cardinal   15.709568382035421
monsieur said morrel recovering his assurance as he proceeded do you recollect that a few days before the landing of his majesty the emperor i came to intercede for a young man the mate of my ship who was accused of being concerned in correspondence with the island of elba   8.133568247859298
and athos   8.82986192822796
well well said monte cristo such an innocent looking person as you are to do those things m   11.648897363865832
why should i do that   15.834965330737834
her soul lives in the body of this demon   10.706862916944825
the lock turned and the door slowly opened   20.02119026619627
i see it   10.567069124512887
no not even to my betrothed   8.810729389053762
said d artagnan monsters have only to complain to gain your sympathy   8.449281211822091
now an englishman is an enemy   18.589705612203026
then the danger was so imminent the rioters came so near uttering such threats that the chancellor thought his last hour had come and confessed himself to his brother priest so as to be all ready to die in case he was discovered   14.640921426617426
why did we not destroy the child with the mother   14.388349085238627
oh i don t doubt that replied d artagnan   12.942547093842034
planchet called out d artagnan take care of the lackey   14.94819115990026
said porthos his eyes glistening at the news   10.617052923552018
from whom is this   12.317042016844601
if you are take care for i shall never forgive you   14.65204422981311
the two assistants had borne andrea to the scaffold and there in spite of his struggles his bites and his cries had forced him to his knees   12.09547055590609
as he spoke he dismounted gave the bridle of his horse to the musketeer and placing himself by the side of the prisoner said in a voice perfectly composed to the palais royal at full trot   17.44792258672192
besides the tattoo has been sounded and we should be observed if we kept a light burning much longer than the others   9.648848424806662
come come that is not bad   8.896922645548312
so without losing time tell me have you the slightest idea whence this terrible blow proceeds   17.73947236378326
your goodness confounds me monseigneur replied d artagnan and i am conscious of a greatness of soul in your eminence that makes me mean as an earthworm   9.645267755596853
at length one evening my enemy resolved to paralyze the resistance he could not conquer   7.625724974329453
that is very easily done   15.338257513922247
it communicates with my mistress s by that door   10.489186314782247
one of the bandits rose and offered him a glass filled with orvietto saying to the health of the brave cucumetto and the fair rita   11.992548993728775
i will confess to you albert replied franz the count is a very singular person and the appointment you have made to meet him in paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions   12.455501218556254
and as if he feared doctor d avrigny would recall his promise he hurried him towards the house   13.231477038883012
madame   10.831915170737176
in the meantime anne of austria approached comminges and conversed with him in a subdued tone whilst mazarin glanced uneasily at the corner occupied by d artagnan and porthos   9.664279119854935
thus dantès who but three months before had no desire but liberty had now not liberty enough and panted for wealth   8.911229981635893
the best you could have at the present time believe me   11.441485201034578
then replied m   14.475276470469762
here is m   10.235366048618623
meantime porthos had reloaded his pistols   8.493585903689343
nothing is easier than to begin with fair promises and assurances of nothing to fear   13.571267785349981
and you aramis   14.70989822502961
all this is very sad which you tell me   10.643385700798293
and in addition to the lightness of her step which had betrayed her she emitted a little cough which denoted a sweet voice   9.524847262389033
what did you please to say sir   19.16026270521217
the weakness of a murderer   9.219474734142924
for how much   12.461728049076784
a slave does not dictate to a master   9.957649701211725
the one you bought will then become useless to you   11.788191440649252
about what time   11.592230484335762
hurry up there you rascal   15.44993789987214
the second floor a house with a balcony   11.492392506866892
very well at one o clock then replied d artagnan turning the angle of the street   14.276689950292337
d artagnan nearly jumped for joy   9.073171117152196
come come said albert do not assume so much indifference   12.256593752958624
yes betrayed by the scotch amongst whom i was born whom i have always loved better than the english   8.439290631010017
then her hair assumed successively under her skillful hands all the undulations she thought might assist the charms of her face   16.04443874226545
his brow slightly contracted like that of a man who has formed a resolution   10.03500313123449
she is perhaps a prisoner   14.879761110361594
they threatened me with torture   10.720786861241159
four hours passed by and the giant was replaced by another bandit   4.337617335883348
i thought you said you were the chief   8.197965607271486
the tree was easy to climb   14.078912671158488
but said franz the corsican bandits that were among the crew of his vessel   14.321931984964454
it was not a want of courage which rendered her poverty burdensome   12.43316936065457
bad weather   11.264116137979391
a bad reason replied danglars who reckoned on conciliating his keeper   6.833193408288353
in business sir said he one has no friends only correspondents   10.79454703388858
the judge chapter 109   6.738473755934722
it is only to poets that such things happen said athos gravely   16.40872578893336
friquet who did not expect to be let off so cheaply bounded off like a gazelle up the quai a la rue dauphine and disappeared   10.867220838068945
cried lord winter   11.51798147248893
let him run on said danglars restraining the young man   12.860988877314306
inquired mazarin   16.690344489334542
not a scintilla of these was lost on porthos   9.626310469454516
colonel bridge replied the spaniard is a retired wagoner a man of much sense who made one valuable observation whilst driving his team namely that where there happened to be a stone on the road it was much easier to remove the stone than try and make the wheel pass over it   14.994986264252244
d épinay for he came this morning to paris   12.282598352964541
finally said felton finally what did they do   13.110203724447423
in the meantime said athos i renounce my plan of seclusion and wherever you go i will go with you   11.438693159640724
bernajoux now fell and as the guardsmen were only two against four they began to cry to the rescue   14.929778992121982
he could not therefore in the solitude of his dungeon traverse in mental vision the history of the ages bring to life the nations that had perished and rebuild the ancient cities so vast and stupendous in the light of the imagination and that pass before the eye glowing with celestial colors in martin s babylonian pictures   13.604043580223621
bonacieux hesitated to continue   13.617451909452305
he was in the front row of the crowd admirably placed for seeing   14.25887059617965
yes cried milady but i shall lose that which is much dearer to me than life i shall lose my honor felton   10.51849922598807
there were a thousand ingots of gold each weighing from two to three pounds   15.809491544293731
then when she had no longer any doubt she cried in a state of stupor what my brother is it you   8.652700392858481
to this i add a certificate in the funds of 25 000 francs   12.547255806956706
what do you tell me   10.523266303390846
his life madame belongs not to him   14.26180575472016
morrel s clear eye was for the moment clouded then it shone with unusual lustre and a large tear rolled down his cheek   9.461651596344293
on these days he spoke a little   11.916043650946346
perfectly safe and sound   10.159015104634955
my mind appeared to strive in vain to shake off the heavy darkness of the sleep from which i could not rouse myself   10.905879074997168
that explains if the portrait you showed me be like the dark hue i so much admired on the visage of the noble catalan   14.719368653871902
yes but before we can kill him and he will be hard to kill that swiss he will shriek out and the whole picket will come and we shall be taken like foxes we who are lions and thrown into some dungeon where we shall not even have the consolation of seeing this frightful gray sky of rueil which no more resembles the sky of tarbes than the moon is like the sun   11.672449009627558
how beautiful it must be   8.378561183984273
but the two months expire next week   12.047619049419001
here is the key of the door so that you can go in and out as you please   19.031395664103496
madame said mazarin with a smile you may rest easy   13.199057333478018
i can not calmly say with you providence has struck the blow   10.259370425237936
it is the one my brother sends for us   11.99136976418994
what ails you my dearest father   11.236026579139624
a moment afterwards baptistin announced the count of morcerf to monte cristo and the latter leading haydée aside ordered that morcerf be asked into the drawing room   11.079752671758394
inquired franz   10.379488764220056
he votes for you for he belongs to the opposition   12.803477774153109
with anne of austria for that affair was over but he had to adjust matters for m   18.33588344345774
but young as you are and scarcely entering into the world you have powerful enemies   12.582187870247836
inspector continued the governor i can tell you the story as well as he for it has been dinned in my ears for the last four or five years   14.057527058142163
it appears to me that the news you bear is worth the trouble of a little diligence   13.403473324220187
when the count thought franz had gazed sufficiently on this picturesque tableau he raised his finger to his lips to warn him to be silent and ascending the three steps which led to the corridor of the columbarium entered the chamber by the middle arcade and advanced towards vampa who was so intent on the book before him that he did not hear the noise of his footsteps   14.63255246727353
the three friends remained mute for although the voice as well as the countenance reminded them of someone they had seen they could not remember under what circumstances   17.635514037362487
you see you were deceived murmured the magistrate   13.818034174339354
oh he is so dreadfully pale   12.771315290530671
i shall soon return said the banker to monte cristo   8.399106273989894
but it is not for me although i am a creditor myself to the amount of ten thousand francs to give any information as to the state of his finances   11.457050729142145
but in order to avenge herself she must be free   13.086844941285719
only this time it was no longer an inert body without feeling that the villain had to deal with   7.505797276630716
he did not know said the abbé   8.266741259915783
but you will be left alone   12.323645110807067
now my lord give me if you have not lost it the ball that which contained the letter   10.327608146569007
i do not dare offer to share my apartments with you as i shared yours at rome i who do not profess egotism but am yet egotist par excellence   7.637821365698743
a newly born infant repeated debray   15.848092748333041
really you were only before sparkling but now you are brilliant   18.268187207704234
nevertheless raoul you must go to blois and you must make your excuses and mine to madame de saint remy   12.08653008501097
suddenly an idea flashed across his mind   9.460097717240046
another of the number continued the abbé without seeming to notice the emotion of caderousse is called danglars   12.105352931443532
has your husband any spanish bonds   14.62459997072987
planchet with a gorget indeed   12.011962100327157
beauchamp looked at albert with a benevolent expression   13.44311236677928
said the marquise   14.314900242221437
let me tell you on one s wedding day there are more agreeable subjects of conversation than dry politics   11.268795476897047
between the court and the garden built in the heavy style of the imperial architecture was the large and fashionable dwelling of the count and countess of morcerf   15.519784833512714
antoine had been his jailer   10.57937248288674
what may that be   12.663565029521173
sometimes when monsieur de chavigny paid him a visit the duke used to ask him what he should think if he saw an army of parisians all fully armed appear at vincennes to deliver him from prison   12.940720853224558
the carriage drove on   15.572504123463355
i understand you   10.847599724287765
i love that humiliation i who am master of the universe as was augustus   10.198015699238455
but as to d artagnan gentlemen the idea of belonging to ours has driven him out of his senses   13.809668019019739
in strict accordance with the promise made to the abbé dantès spoke no more of escape   7.45144252626514
these undertakings do not suit me as you know aramis   9.733189841104329
well said he to the young girl are you willing my dear kitty that i should give you a proof of that love which you doubt   8.662626138555495
no said andrea no   10.733547622890779
cried porthos who was breathing like a blacksmith s bellows   12.058793240572193
de villefort was never known to change a determination once formed   12.505792988401009
paris   9.925807669949997
the old man remained motionless   9.378851276874949
i saw him strolling about here this morning   13.182725777083652
the major drew from his pocket a handful of gold   12.466667111317863
what i can not tell something wonderful an absurdity a miracle of what nature he alone can tell who has mingled with our reason that folly we call hope   12.4500409711461
we do   17.57770235704874
athos was happy happy as he had never been before   12.10445996619831
thank god my child was not then dead   11.973931194140937
as he approached the castle which had first attracted his eye d artagnan was convinced that it could not be there that his friend dwelt   14.7870357574431
asked the indefatigable questioner   8.305313645430479
dinner was waiting but as albert had told him that he should not return so soon franz sat down without him   7.910849712753012
your holiness   8.191695461929378
mazarin turned again to his papers   16.031833453677987
this confession said she growing paler what is this confession   7.339881660811864
but instead of following the main street he turned behind the château reached a sort of retired lane and found himself soon in front of the pavilion named   9.416223690740063
well what is it what is going on here   8.574860369076953
as he passed by m   4.442274218145832
propose mine to him and let us see if he will be more condescending to you than to me   13.636225160609143
no for venice   14.594514517866266
spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach him which he was pressed to taste   11.495167367314792
show him a white handkerchief knotted at the four corners and tell the crew to disembark and carry the powder back to the arsenal unless indeed unless   16.134908730579987
it is the first time i have had the honor of seeing you   8.951381760855028
cried d artagnan drawing his sword and taking refuge behind his horse   14.503646224121566
this letter   14.499721333470838
this is what was done   16.030250014493777
have you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait near a good fire   12.354273733501843
she seemed did she   13.552432676492009
you have hurt yourself perhaps said morrel   13.702915431403468
monsieur d artagnan he resumed do you wish to become a captain   10.216486758500283
it is so good that i have distanced m   12.872148148664534
no high sounding words   14.644214836705281
do you know her   14.782796116383768
are we quite alone my friend   10.928471566526408
that is true said porthos   12.996760699471633
is he not albert   12.82292848584418
it was from mme   11.793817862996764
then she began thoughtfully to caress the little spaniel   7.813216945706067
and i did more than that replied morcerf for i caught one   7.622908346286057
cavalcanti being left alone turned to monte cristo   18.403265956456956
yes but we have drowned monsieur mordaunt   12.938823293288351
yes but to yield   12.541242898023045
i made my report to the authorities at paris and a week after he was carried off   10.900807013033148
its agent who will in ten minutes present himself to receive the amount of a bill of 287 500 francs i will not say granted but offered me three months   11.13093618049946
then he pointed to the door   13.029697352623813
we want to see the coadjutor and instantly as we are in haste   15.152815608026856
he might by chance hear the hollow sound of his footsteps and call the attention of his officer to the circumstance   9.797431239499787
no valentine i assure you such is not the case   7.1068786774737305
ah you shall see   14.863730849509434
personally i am on bad terms with him on account of the quarrels between madame de montbazon my mother in law and madame de longueville   12.626682929988387
do not fear that you put me to inconvenience   14.72113829643934
ah my dear fellow said he to franz   11.832961081523168
there after a few days if you like the civil marriage shall be celebrated without pomp or ceremony   12.306848659141126
my god it is i i and this fellow who will help me to avenge myself   14.889434864983965
do not boast of what you have come to paris to do or have done   9.889878891440528
how is it all the better   16.248474017654807
but he paid your ransom   16.18866252304582
he is impatient   18.10082698864202
where am i and why am i here   14.04294816595279
the good wine which mousqueton had placed before them traced out in glowing drops to d artagnan a fine perspective shining with quadruples and pistoles and showed to porthos a blue ribbon and a ducal mantle   12.407060564193461
milady listened   9.87400509327927
the money you desire shall be at your house by ten o clock tomorrow morning my dear count replied danglars   12.833724227686808
is it possible exclaimed albert that you have reached your present age without visiting the finest capital in the world   10.046774986122758
he desired him also should he know in the neighborhood any doctor or chirurgeon to fetch him taking on himself the payment of the messenger   14.891098592838107
as i passed the city gates i declared that i had found the child on the road and i inquired where the asylum was   9.85932306548693
it is impossible   13.589387384659705
don t dream it athos   10.08317116724727
milady as athos had foreseen on finding the two men that awaited her made no difficulty in following them   8.17573000695735
but it was on leaving this club said he my father disappeared   12.181189670237785
it is unnecessary for them to know the service we are going to render them   14.208683555257792
he presented himself this morning with a bond of 40 000 francs payable at sight on you signed by busoni and returned by you to me with your endorsement of course i immediately counted him over the forty bank notes   11.315153595741643
the man who was with caderousse was evidently a stranger to the south of france   13.047217897963138
i have thought it no sin to bore through a wall or destroy a staircase   15.915390790769287
but vampa reassured her with a smile tapping the butt of his good fowling piece which threw its ball so well   12.999389190661795
he was an old friend of mine and if he had not so bad a memory he ought to invite me to your wedding seeing he came to mine   16.663777459453165
no monsieur i swear to you by my hopes of salvation i will tell you all for the abbé busoni himself only knew a part of my secret   11.568984412846852
the concierge went to seek the valet de chambre and returned with him in an instant   12.498172161856123
danglars knew that he was heard so he redoubled his blows   9.864700012434145
ah said buckingham god be praised   14.160234750149343
but athos had disappeared   10.792054045957558
ten pistoles   10.248470328590983
the sentence is passed and in a few hours will be executed   12.211181183983669
alas said monte cristo your words sear and embitter my heart the more so as you have every reason to hate me   10.265799432934147
do you see that street   11.786275421982268
there s a fellow who will never desert me   10.855576691978401
otherwise all the world would be poisoning each other   10.182668354802162
ah excellency you can not imagine how hard it is to rear fowls in these horrible caves   8.866992897104307
that s a settled custom   13.815194466435035
with it i might regain our horses and their harnesses and even money to pay our expenses on the road   11.310333935190101
france is large   10.672569210505568
listen felton resumed milady for by the side of base and contemptible men there are often found great and generous natures   14.22407683485849
they may do what they will with me i will never leave you   13.371042486271405
however the revolution which appeared upon his countenance was so visible that bonacieux was terrified at it and he endeavored to draw back a step or two   10.115774975998834
no doubt he is as rich as danglars as high in station as fernand   11.940707683125309
ill very ill say you   14.57309254044735
but you don t know us   8.916012691626293
not one has therefore to reproach himself   13.657405037029823
the king s friend said aramis   10.99192396926429
nothing weakens a man more than these devilish strains   9.93300770773519
although almost engaged to the leaders of the fronde he had not gone so far but that retreat was possible should the court offer him the advantages for which he was ambitious and to which the coadjutorship was but a stepping stone   9.78265507944591
it is edmond and mercédès   2.682506356410723
he staggered and supported himself against the wainscot   12.11317954233364
no distraction could come to his aid   10.842065842490356
and so i did replied caderousse   10.060244774684419
sir replied raoul bowing i am entirely at your service i assure you   12.078333971607783
oh i don t say that   16.039634763939798
sebastian encamped round a master whom our readers must have recognized as the famous luigi vampa   10.47775708862978
for my paper which gave the first information on the subject has been obliged to stop for want of proof   10.335787083676054
d avrigny reflected a moment   7.872010714672679
at the same minute one of the little windows of the hôtel de ville was thrown open and the head of a gendarme appeared   9.845293036039966
and as without knowing the cause he knew the great desire and even imperative need which his friends had of returning to paris it goes without saying that he fixed upon them to form part of the escort   12.824565374972089
and how were they treated   15.755569258555134
have you lost it   5.9367826174553535
about two hours afterwards its foundation was reported to be unsafe   10.858687026351875
d artagnan knew that although a gascon m   11.261605246052758
château renaud recounted it at the jockey club and debray detailed it at length in the salons of the minister   12.017574303829731
after living forty years with the marquis it is not grief my dear villefort said the doctor   12.111208851292515
or are you only suffering from the prostration of fatigue and the weariness of hope deferred   11.393244233165765
alas nothing can alleviate so great a sorrow the wound is too deep and too fresh   10.668141847921813
he has a daughter who was about to marry the man she loved but whose family now will not allow him to wed the daughter of a ruined man   11.991863410140093
i pardon you for the death of poor felton   12.845275448069579
one could comprehend the necessity of the cold and the urgency of the cloak   11.22792529189521
by the light of the wretched and wavering lamp of which we have spoken dantès saw the old man pale but yet erect clinging to the bedstead   15.809552974711242
asked porthos with simplicity   16.240708210963717
never see you again   11.262296330278122
yez   10.25198684936116
come my dear albert said debray confess that your cook is behindhand that the oysters have not arrived from ostend or marennes and that like madame de maintenon you are going to replace the dish by a story   12.198835471557958
just under us   9.837033462720932
but not finding it he summoned his resolution and stretched forth his hands toward the place where the queen had acknowledged the paper was to be found   12.095920746613528
straw   12.39687805449258
and you say that he has a great influence over his compeers   11.407511802170278
remember also villefort that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your fealty and strict loyalty and that at our recommendation the king consented to forget the past as i do and here she extended to him her hand as i now do at your entreaty   10.776216442553762
so cheer up and tell us if you have the strength to do so what has happened   11.543717037856702
pastels by giraud and müller representing children like angels and women with the features of a virgin   9.913498228645755
and at each side pretty medallions in crayons harmonizing well with the furnishings of this charming apartment the only one throughout the great mansion in which any distinctive taste prevailed   15.2409521452226
julie had scarcely recovered from her deep emotion when she rushed out of the room descended to the next floor ran into the drawing room with childlike joy and raised the crystal globe which covered the purse given by the unknown of the allées de meilhan   14.711492098081704
and pray what would come to pass supposing the king were five years older than he is   14.236746478227609
a gendarme was crossing the court   7.5479195047938
is it a very beautiful vessel   15.231208492310952
he had just expired with clenched hands his mouth in a spasm of agony and his hair on end in the sweat of death   10.054157209093972
we will describe the thing to him as a consequence of the affair of yesterday and the two will pass off together   10.001752188568538
absent   15.404871579436062
he resembles his mother   10.403885588940515
i have only the letters of ali tepelini which i have placed before you   10.421228610061632
said the girl   11.265469319996939
a fine name said morrel   12.122395822409768
and if you were mistaken doctor if it were not my daughter if i should come one day pale as a spectre and say to you assassin you have killed my child   8.826785738577396
for heaven s sake do not speak so loud   13.931737931727362
well well returned m   14.721219242409736
matters go but badly said athos smiling   11.880280635029392
he was however the same cocles good patient devoted but inflexible on the subject of arithmetic the only point on which he would have stood firm against the world even against m   14.237872368215912
they accepted his offer   12.99269720482452
and that letter i bought it for two hundred thousand francs madame said monte cristo   13.561614681317621
baroness said danglars give me leave to present to you the count of monte cristo who has been most warmly recommended to me by my correspondents at rome   16.327274480312994
may i venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit   12.75189676536184
there they had a bit of a skirmish in getting rid of the duties   8.14881095274966
he hoped to become one someday but the time which in his own mind he fixed upon for this happy change was still far distant   11.047379938977487
a favor from me   10.373509231034253
this time it was not a wandering troop of partisans   14.522878813373612
an italian adventurer would not dare to go such lengths with such men as ourselves   11.857569918273194
speak said the monk   13.465242435257245
that was your fault   8.599996740011829
so they united against him and hanged him on a tree   9.544076576624914
the youth approached with his charming smile and his head bare and kneeling down kissed the hand of the duchess de chevreuse   14.161909309066779
that he wouldn t swear   10.449153409250458
there is one thing only which i must request   12.197212612627133
i have performed that same distance in forty hours and by ten o clock in the morning i must be in london   11.083118402644219
my whole fortune shall not be thought too much for the recovery of my boy   9.947985985123449
and besides her personal attractions which were very great mademoiselle de saint méran s family possessed considerable political influence which they would of course exert in his favor   11.398382058909986
thanks my god said he at least thou strikest but me alone   16.905577344481685
the boat sailed on all day and all night and next morning when the sun rose they had lost sight of monte cristo   11.107768549482307
d artagnan admired mazarin s gracious manner   10.820391459642671
i don t understand was the reply   11.33506021782376
beauty has always been and always will be all powerful   14.099991973968391
on my account   10.884142629873061
yes said the king but i do not wish to be touched by any of those men   13.275910775010036
oh my dear count exclaimed danglars i never for an instant entertained such a feeling towards you   15.929825643964367
at half past three in the winter the fire was lighted by the discreet servant who had the superintendence of the little apartment and in the summer ices were placed on the table at the same hour   16.370820152655263
everyone shook off the drowsiness of night and to dispel the humid morning air came to take a drop at the inn   14.449583185626008
asked the procureur alarmed   12.364770626343107
a conjugal scene chapter 66   11.908011509044313
and if i do not give him up what think you will be the result   8.577159394190216
the principal thing is to know which loves money the best   20.224781946031463
the jailer went away shaking his head   11.646781436914022
but this annoys you   8.728784288420398
then d artagnan being alone struck a light and lighted a small bit of tinder mounted his horse and stopped at the door in the midst of the soldiers   8.01535482888158
but on the eve of my departure a vessel which i shall see depart will take you hence and convey you to our colonies in the south   8.004714000022059
and when the jeweller johannes had just paid you 45 000 francs for the diamond i had given you and you killed him to get the diamond and the money both was that also poverty   11.65515873303303
and if this muffled up individual proved as franz felt sure he would the same as the person he had just seen in the teatro argentina then he should be able to establish his identity and also to prosecute his researches respecting him with perfect facility and freedom   14.64065271738183
because i suppose it is his nature to do so for the love of robbing   13.690927199115112
it was then that the door of edward s room opened and a head we have before noticed appeared in the glass opposite   10.13056986039307
grandpapa s bottle of lemonade was standing just by his side   12.84970247307397
twenty three thousand francs said she   15.095562581374688
all goes well in this direction   10.95701093945245
that s what i call love   13.517607104624
what do you want monsieur   15.565878288080983
but the mind always remembers   12.833516310270364
here sire   8.651653719264381
a hundred crowns   11.679140739152192
but hush here comes our minister of justice   10.413182966533878
and pressing his lips on the hand of julie who rushed into his arms he extended his other hand to emmanuel   7.2019135105724175
franz felt it would be ridiculous not to follow his two companions example   17.940287155531248
toward the end of the service the queen seeing comminges standing near her waiting for a confirmation of the order she had given him before quitting the louvre said in a whisper go comminges and may god aid you   12.543571430562546
said the gendarme placing his knee on his chest   13.102580290218889
what in the devil is the matter with you my friend   20.466201672762757
said the musketeer   13.697079484702366
she had sent for me to know when you would return   11.181224772652014
two carriages were soon heard to enter the courtyard   4.582234062869684
if you have any appointment for this evening defer it till tomorrow   11.757678446899954
although apparently not noticing albert he did not however lose sight of him and when the curtain fell at the end of the second act he saw him leave the orchestra with his two friends   7.408643220069911
my lord i have in my parish a man who might be of the greatest use to you   14.345847060345706
see he is down there talking politics with that little group of great geniuses   9.93133541738227
could you incur my displeasure by having followed the orders of your superiors with more intelligence and courage than another would have done   15.880498807836167
then turning to the queen we may still hope   17.373493949368974
i can see neither heaven nor earth said the jeweller who was outside the door   7.371737287296973
an affair for the police   10.970246962039539
but after he had gone about two hundred steps d artagnan stopped short alighted threw the bridle of his horse over the arm of planchet and took the pistols from his saddle bow to fasten them to his girdle   12.059671502979759
the young man answered this invitation with a gesture of indifference and stepped out of the boat   12.874389516505603
not that i can accept it but a league off it savors of the gentleman   11.657583851219963
i attach great importance to the question i am about to put to you   5.162940036069641
he told him his birth his position his fortune and more than once when he consulted the look of the paralytic that look answered that is good proceed   16.220560479169855
the noise was caused by porthos who had just knocked down his man   14.725736097774966
the king is alone with a few gentlemen whom he fears to lose every day   10.269580247308367
in a few minutes porthos had rejoined his companions who were already in the boat   12.661838315589177
and fernand   19.055690563809755
the nubian smiled assentingly to his master s words then kneeling on one knee respectfully kissed the hand of the count   10.136291135134863
on reflection the procureur was not a merciless man   12.240571281368874
but you are a man of foresight and prudence therefore you sent your luggage on before you   11.951551843351673
which means that you know very little about the nonsense which here flows down our streets   13.465427574723316
to be sure they may   8.118379048442254
well said cried aramis   12.73172688276855
i recollect coming for my mother to look at it when m   14.768347560110819
interrogate me i entreat you   9.337467766187064
ay said porthos if we can not leave the camp our lackeys may   10.378276358483175
once there a large excavation would be made and one of the flag stones with which the gallery was paved be so completely loosened that at the desired moment it would give way beneath the feet of the soldier who stunned by his fall would be immediately bound and gagged by dantès before he had power to offer any resistance   10.239318385235306
porthos and aramis arose   8.158756427773877
cavalcanti remained master of the field   16.263004807932774
i am going to fire   15.034485050252332
i was thinking my dear old friend that when you were a musketeer you turned your thoughts incessantly to the church and now that you are an abbé you are perpetually longing to be once more a musketeer   10.60376905570368
the accused replied that his name was jacques michel bonacieux that he was fifty one years old a retired mercer and lived rue des fossoyeurs no   11.776653468229382
this was julie who had become as the clerk of the house of thomson french had predicted madame emmanuel herbault   17.84147221221575
the man said in a low voice i wish i wish you to spare me the walk back to paris   13.729528409611412
ah said villefort this seems to me the truth   14.013981988051139
cried the baron i shall never console myself   17.788385735916233
i have one remaining   12.870880502913165
the overflow of my brain would probably in a state of freedom have evaporated in a thousand follies   14.984366923383503
ali and his master conveyed the wounded man into a room   8.626655928559842
cried athos extending his hand to the lieutenant   10.972750927067757
she said that the cardinal de richelieu had drawn the duke of buckingham to paris to ruin him and to ruin the queen   10.67027950670984
i might have suspected he was poisoning us   7.0180137303865635
a ball had passed through his breast   10.446698224044114
nevertheless while acknowledging the truth of what he said i thought proper to insist   1.4670975553966858
there was a musketeer who was in love with one of my women   7.6117382117676495
we must let monsieur de beaufort come   14.370438563196366
raoul had only been at m   10.796167112337818
only you must please to remember that this is friday   11.885120465614403
however as far as ali is concerned i can assure you the interest he excites is merely from the circumstance of his being your attendant you who are at this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in paris   19.936133295969356
and just below this lamp there was laid wrapped in a flowing mantle of violet velvet worked with fleurs de lis of gold a catafalque resting on trestles of oak   11.648128419693945
there was nothing particular about it excepting that although daylight had disappeared it was not lighted and everything in it was old fashioned while the rest of the rooms had been redecorated   11.782988005340982
it is to him that the queen has been writing all the day   6.205022844733493
then he placed the gibbet in the middle of the room bursting with laughter   12.476472763798254
fernand do you mean   10.389610461098869
it was the fault of their horses not theirs   9.487721875676588
and the count burst into a laugh   12.081402160383718
then knitting his brows into a deep frown he added surely this can not be one of the morrel family who lived at marseilles and gave us so much trouble from their violent bonapartism i mean about the year 1815   17.69932486779292
he turned around and seized his new antagonist by the wrist when he started back exclaiming raoul   8.815898412128112
milady for some time examined with increasing terror that pale face framed with black hair and whiskers the only expression of which was icy impassibility   15.258469919841371
but you who have taken no such oath why are you here and what cause do you represent   11.353569800194638
are we not their majesties servants   9.380772322809655
i would be alone   13.471249627196137
the old man winked his eyes expressively which we may remember was his only way of expressing his approval   9.415260652033824
i wrote verses in the style of benserade you my lord   7.45570337746711
then they follow you   9.572425977611976
i said nothing   13.820183558760366
this important task was just completed as they arrived at the countess s box   11.393248828550725
once for all tréville had placed his stable at d artagnan s service   6.329527759541471
instead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor dantès carefully preserved it that in the event of his getting out of prison he might have wherewithal to live for the sale of such a diamond would have quite sufficed to make his fortune   2.0388142311159267
grenoble will open her gates to him with enthusiasm all lyons will hasten to welcome him   13.389612376917105
it may have arrived since i left my office   11.845032421939727
it was and the feast that began so gayly had a very sorrowful ending   8.062703077089258
and her name was do you desire to know her name   13.400384395786777
no said the count i was making a suit   18.039530046707068
in fact the blow was direct and severe   15.92402184307915
her devotion to the queen is known   12.358600941903715
on her side mme   13.800056076453787
to close the door against visitors as soon as the clock struck five replied the valet   5.524757689278031
well said morcerf impatiently what does all this mean   14.77613564595784
you are thoughtful said mazarin uneasily   19.838076238935965
accept my compliments   12.40657407769221
whom do you bring   8.91116924317863
well one can never say what may happen   12.168111973213948
we have secured him   16.51541099828967
i know that porthos was in a fair way replied d artagnan   12.455547985886776
well then said athos it is agreed   10.921339053356157
grimaud answered in four   13.350826902331905
and the nine combatants rushed upon each other with a fury which however did not exclude a certain degree of method   15.08671884864915
she is ill   10.487925267830905
villefort had secluded himself not to study but to reflect   12.292460321845633
dantès saw that he must attack the wedge   12.628164520231874
so you recommend i recommend you to be prudent   7.285245753921429
were i but of gentle birth   15.419431423277778
but a most ridiculous circumstance has occurred which is this thomson french the roman bankers have sent to me a certain person calling himself the count of monte cristo and have given him an unlimited credit with me   15.779308154172671
it was her husband who had discovered the disappearance of the moneybag and was crying thieves   11.542414245337634
at the end of an instant s observation he heard the noise of a vehicle and saw milady s carriage stop opposite to him   11.154956363303498
noble and unhappy king   8.67649999897496
it led into the park as the three fugitives perceived by the night breeze which rushed into the corridor and blew the wind into their faces   16.75582896547418
that would be much more difficult   9.74857303477428
vampa measured the distance   12.506149807665418
send your saddle then to the hôtel of the musketeers and your horse can be brought back with ours   11.07253329743549
franz rubbed his eyes in order to assure himself that this was not a dream   11.588204270272955
at the same instant the firing began on the other side and the balls penetrated the boards all round us   11.112642594415613
in short continued the cardinal as i have heard nothing of you for some time past i wished to know what you were doing   8.842267041263913
then she went to the fireplace and lit the fire and although she had just left her bed she could not resist the temptation offered by valentine s sleep so she threw herself into an armchair to snatch a little more rest   8.764452608707707
hein   11.431304623528476
i called on fernand who sent me a hundred francs by his valet de chambre   10.378516488808524
credit owing to the reports afloat was no longer to be had   9.291541720443188
you decide then nothing about me my lord   12.628244696255289
at the hour agreed upon groslow came   16.499608883198967
no yes he was   10.685559921635736
said felton with increasing exultation   16.048718590847066
the patron of la jeune amélie proposed as a place of landing the island of monte cristo which being completely deserted and having neither soldiers nor revenue officers seemed to have been placed in the midst of the ocean since the time of the heathen olympus by mercury the god of merchants and robbers classes of mankind which we in modern times have separated if not made distinct but which antiquity appears to have included in the same category   12.733563458312874
julie returned holding the silken purse in her hands while tears of joy rolled down her cheeks like dewdrops on the rose   13.181613381128306
ah you scoundrel   10.94478364739351
the young man s finger glided over the words but at each one noirtier answered by a negative sign   11.195287352132587
however monte cristo only made a sign to apprise ali who understanding that danger was approaching from the other side drew nearer to his master   8.394547744964067
at this almost brutal speech morrel turned deathly pale   15.090769515393681
this unexpected circumstance brought back richelieu s former anxiety and forced him in spite of himself once more to turn his eyes to the other side of the sea   8.255152837026476
groaned forth villefort in a paroxysm of grief which was the more terrible from the novelty of the sensation in the iron heart of that man   10.911684220431086
to some elevated spot whence i can look down on lens and the surrounding country in that case i m your man   11.640843818102859
you seem to forget that   10.322471792788297
and yet it will not be the less said we were four men   10.468658865676286
i wish his eminence to become pope on the first opportunity allowing me then the right of demanding full indulgences for myself and my friends   12.730642067367153
free to do what   10.085719913856204
you have doubtless already guessed that i was preparing a surprise for you   12.442124875414368
ah what a dreadful thing said the young musician   7.198855396437523
yes and mercédès   10.529676620598428
pardon me my dear friend said d artagnan i think you said pardieu   13.245328945389108
it is to throw ourselves into the wolf s jaws said aramis   9.792527841609287
replied raoul   17.116668818524438
lay him down here   10.456365732221194
and i will say that you are the sextus   18.27334988891619
shouted the three musketeers in chorus   10.313971910181323
and who appeared to abide on that spot that he might thus address human pride so sure to be exalted by the glories of a throne dust of the earth   15.270211149926462
i love you   15.440730833909463
but he recalled the promise he had made to valentine and kept his secret   16.00323103087577
as you please madame bonacieux said the ex mercer   11.745561291112141
and you would have done the same aramis   13.17090799162098
the king sighed deeply as if his heart would break and then buried his face in his hands   8.05731615991937
yes said the duke but take care my dear la ramee for i propose to beat you badly   14.165197859558505
i wish albert de morcerf and raoul de château renaud to be present at this signature   6.6806843806073966
i can do it said porthos   6.199055344795871
it appeared to him that something might have happened at the pavilion in his absence and that fresh information awaited him   12.745121251856133
but i swear to you before god who hears us that if you betray me and my enemies pardon me i will kill myself while accusing you of my death   9.892381526844213
dantès has no longer any occasion for assistance he is about to become a captain   10.864900768601823
moreover it is possible that the genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know nothing but what they should know and believe nothing but what they should believe   14.618547802550752
the bastion st   9.08134526090101
as for me so nervous and so subject to fainting fits i should require a doctor adelmonte to invent for me some means of breathing freely and tranquillizing my mind in the fear i have of dying some fine day of suffocation   8.97188324837244
mademoiselle valentine passed through the room to go to madame de villefort s said he   7.976312096299328
he wished to see everything   8.114918674726212
said kitty timidly   12.82702461902441
this is a beastly country this england   10.696807509257688
the reference is no doubt to the wistaria frutescens   16.43190812095368
he had foreseen all   16.069389015116634
madame danglars rose suddenly   8.422615765494223
athos alone kept away and sat in the furthest corner of the room as if determined to be merely a spectator of the proceedings   10.635050117104356
far from here   12.447317676007874
i am sure he will look like the great mogul   15.522254227423888
he is meditating by what sort of punishment he shall cause me to die said the gascon to himself   13.503948031395097
valentine he answered during my long watch over you all i have observed has been what people visited you what nourishment was prepared and what beverage was served   8.390403303087336
madame you are mistaken they are not misfortunes it is a punishment   12.774234926470108
this time there could be no doubt   10.319476523785298
and you think said aramis he will consent to appear before such a tribunal   9.5937138363476
said the queen radiant   14.016003949297964
the unhappy man uttered an exclamation of joy   11.1950014779583
milady uttered a frightful shriek and dragged herself along several paces upon her knees toward her judges   10.232763729757691
then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in the portfolio   10.457869100828576
but after all said lord de winter when the three friends had been named we do not know who you are   13.50559682164043
thank you monsieur you are not brave enough to be of any use to me whatever replied mme   13.74584321769638
we that is monsieur du vallon and i could have killed our prisoners we preferred taking them   12.517442159275948
suffer me also madame replied villefort to add my earnest request to mademoiselle de saint méran s that you will kindly allow the veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past   6.848025044913159
out of all the numerous clerks that used to fill the deserted corridor and the empty office but two remained   8.438298131251459
has the law any eyes to witness your grief   9.595304104296964
said aramis to athos does the coadjutor intend to indulge himself in the pleasure of making us cool our hearts off in his ante chamber   15.285641919376896
and i much fear she envies me the fortune i enjoy in right of my mother and which will be more than doubled at the death of m   13.87543028420989
oh i dare not she forbade my sending for you   12.510641651418535
you seem a worthy young man   13.284034371286676
oh he is the exact personification of what i have been led to expect   11.247814308448056
what in the devil does he say   13.958755898692505
cried d artagnan as he went down the steps of the hatchway preceded by the lantern what a number of barrels   11.410228925805217
it was too much for a heart furrowed by the love of heaven that burns by the hatred of men that devours   11.339080994299001
his vigilant eye watches over and penetrates to the bottom of the heart   15.018763295849888
twice he had overcome his doubts   11.557093363597948
giving me her hand to kiss   15.237316285531332
did i not tell you that she was the goddaughter of monsieur laporte the confidential man of the queen   7.104703767172694
he remembered those interesting stories so little believed in paris respecting roman bandits   7.262487702271072
you have done well to warn me   13.774358993266095
there was still that diamond left which sparkles on your finger and which i had observed yesterday   12.38842200320674
40274m morrel watched her as she left the room   13.138323842112444
his feet were naked so he had no shoes and stockings to take off   10.023479841531653
cromwell looked at him with astonishment   15.271431916862966
avenge me of that infamous de wardes said milady between her teeth and i shall soon know how to get rid of you you double idiot you animated sword blade   12.173868001681091
and will you sign the contract   12.008507592727357
there was one lying on the table   11.417581150398316
and besides even for old soldiers the evening before a battle is a serious time   11.69339734193696
it can not change unhappy man   8.528760123379051
at any rate said albert whatever disease or doctor may have killed her m   8.136564113087612
cried the king is the messenger s name m   13.908339628661803
monte cristo saw nothing but the shadow which no one else observed   12.47462413614518
but his eyes scarcely quitted the box between the columns which remained obstinately closed during the whole of the first act   6.949944407532332
this andrea was a wretch a robber an assassin and yet his manners showed the effects of a sort of education if not a complete one   12.362041194530468
her nerves gave way and she sunk on the carpet   8.155980423807808
it was evident that all was not yet over   14.226885614013442
the cousin standing at the door ushered in the guests and it was rather a relief to the indifferent to see a person as unmoved as themselves and who did not exact a mournful face or force tears as would have been the case with a father a brother or a lover   16.682358723738734
i am sorry to tell you he is perfectly well   7.954599076023733
by heaven and earth   8.50505166498056
look fernand your eyes are better than mine   16.399967448341464
no sir madame de saint remy is at blois with the duchess of orleans   13.583033456811705
on descending we saw through the lattice work several boats which were gradually becoming more distinct to our view   14.572841180151869
then you do not know who it is that attempts your life   11.820157085226937
for i wager anything it is the creditor who visits me   11.333401778015403
but the young man had begun to follow or rather to advance before the boat   6.96418646705438
he recalled his arrival on the island his presentation to a smuggler chief a subterranean palace full of splendor an excellent supper and a spoonful of hashish   15.162382382869092
said laporte   17.040837535406173
séguier keeper of the seals looks more than once for the bell it is impossible to form an idea of the impression these few words made upon louis xiii   7.478640143917159
can i have lost it   11.547292445955357
are you not a sportsman and a great wolf hunter   15.388755677138551
has she left armentières   10.91492990851626
ah really   10.758560465936842
is it to have the pleasure of insulting us that you say that my little viper   15.67474148548768
but go on what about the club in the rue saint jacques   14.10896222729227
where is the prisoner   11.669519120364097
and what of that   11.293955944484233
i know that from the gulf in which their enemies have plunged them they have risen with so much vigor and glory that in their turn they have ruled their former conquerors and have punished them   17.84147082269969
he hastened to the rendezvous found the lackeys at their posts placed them as sentinels at all the outlets of the hôtel and came to find athos who had just received this information when his friends returned   10.201307519958252
were i in her majesty s place said gondy coldly i should not hesitate   6.8284221076129
and any other love but mine would have sunk beneath this ordeal   12.591167140189334
morrel attributed penelon s embarrassment to the elegance of his attire   9.014145769503843
for ever and ever   11.64463563235916
the young man went to her and took her hands   15.418066370732795
oh it will be too great a disappointment to my father if i do not marry mademoiselle danglars   10.767240323909256
the two young men looked at each other with an air of stupefaction   11.53497062018225
dying in the arms of his children he had been by them laid by the side of his wife who had preceded him in eternity by two years   6.137956693584404
the woman had the outline of mme   14.058796334889486
what are my commands   12.541901354946567
cromwell bowed   19.036953504125943
but monsieur said mousqueton i can t swim   15.479536379887074
because in 1807 i dreamed of the very plan napoleon tried to realize in 1811   11.417961253046354
his only jewellery was a chain so fine that the slender gold thread was scarcely perceptible on his white waistcoat   15.065489684281395
do not envy me this happiness   8.01440923816962
only as you see the carnival has commenced   9.628642176839982
well this time said the cardinal it is not necessary to steal his confidence but to present yourself frankly and loyally as a negotiator   6.163323425611046
between the forest and this accursed spot a little behind the trampled ground was the same track of small feet as in the garden   10.418192196784782
but that is not the question   11.811912235014702
caderousse was thoughtful for a moment   8.233518096417122
no said d artagnan   12.400198717940382
athos was introduced and announced by name   10.547994786162803
can you see the air you breathe and yet without which you could not for a moment exist   9.455408682058959
men are so made   18.267347085732926
in the antechamber he trembled   10.036973573671949
she had to deal with a gascon who played close   6.395299951372996
danglars turned pale   14.860533032692652
in a quarter of an hour let every one be in bed and snoring   16.028190185060225
one window was lighted   14.142005074574797
by the way i have received news of franz   13.05898539410163
but the strict decorum and rigid propriety of the inhabitants of the house left no grounds for apprehending that advantage would be taken of that circumstance   12.127469723401227
along the isle of dogs   15.172583625045405
well if my husband s soul can come to me why should not my soul reappear to guard my granddaughter   9.350517181651925
it appears according to your account that if by mischance a musketeer is arrested france is in danger   11.304898066030134
porthos aramis and d artagnan followed his example   16.672024608611054
28 gaspard puget the sculptor architect was born at marseilles in 1615   13.067260924475725
whither art thou going grimaud   10.34949589662566
i swear by my honor as a sailor by my love for mercédès by the life of my father speak monsieur said villefort   17.186077945715148
porthos sucked his mustache muttering a good deal of ceremony to night about crushing an adder   16.034420483249093
said albert gazing through his tears at his mother s portrait   12.573142604222427
i respect old age but i don t much like it boiled or roasted   12.1942594736566
morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me replied dantès   15.372922534638015
well said beauchamp we shall see our friend   12.523632983759574
but if your honor knew this man   11.625034715429845
at length the poor old fellow reached the end of all he had   12.324431273683844
the abbé asked one day of dantès   10.499293515697802
at whose house you robbed and murdered did you not   10.980160027004514
the siege of la rochelle is about to be resumed monseigneur   12.468353142190036
the only sublime ideas in politics are those which bear fruit   14.351188979477877
ah said he to debray who had thrown himself into an easy chair at the farthest extremity of the salon and who held a pencil in his right hand and an account book in his left what are you doing there   19.715355311361698
so that he told me that poor monsieur maillard go find the coadjutor friquet and if you bring him to me you shall be my heir   16.964539379198065
he had only time to get his hat and throw himself breathless into the closet when the procureur s footstep was heard in the passage   12.203739696198697
a nobility of the rope   11.23758602214507
by us you mean   16.19870004576487
and as much at least in pearls diamonds and jewels said eugénie   15.570698261093224
the prisoner made no reply   13.243087829427232
thereupon she ran toward the carriage which had turned round toward the way it came jumped upon the step and the carriage drove off   7.804862708384821
emmanuel did not conceal his joy at the peaceful termination of the affair and was loud in his expressions of delight   11.681691835348477
monsieur said d artagnan on quitting tarbes and coming hither it was my intention to request of you in remembrance of the friendship which you have not forgotten the uniform of a musketeer   11.73582361451792
haste   14.636262520013256
everyone had just seen it pass   14.045226776378321
no no said noirtier s look   8.8049788192296
do said aramis   11.356646872440612
this is not a command but advice i give you   10.635936341888053
tis he past all doubt   12.482747542251497
he is reduced almost to the last extremity nay he is almost at the point of dishonor   16.656321683044055
now let us pass the orangery to the hunting lodge   11.020537432153658
and this gentleman is coming to live here   9.20075856991009
he had been down to the stables already taken a look at the horses and given the necessary orders for the day whilst athos and aramis were still in bed and porthos snoring   17.642830171435847
cried the latter like a man who has the nightmare and talks in his sleep monsieur d artagnan   12.638418594941998
that bonacieux   14.610152783614142
i met monsieur dujart in england   4.557012509502467
then take my arm and let us on   11.874665306749618
in the opposite direction to that which you said i was gone   16.450231139826947
replied d artagnan with feverish volubility   9.677611020436194
grimaud s a cunning fellow murmured mousqueton   12.36145699382812
said he to himself while the lamp and the wax lights were nearly burnt out and the servants were waiting impatiently in the anteroom   16.598163013016983
nay more he seemed greatly flattered at two or three compliments which the count very skilfully and agreeably paid him with as much ease as if he had known him these thirty years   9.199591431754747
at this instant the three friends turned in spite of themselves a last look on the rock upon the menacing figure which pursued them and now stood out with a distinctness still   12.04227931770886
is he not peculiar   10.777536277896006
you have the window that is sufficient   10.395286667560129
end of the project gutenberg ebook twenty years after updated editions will replace the previous one the old editions will be renamed   14.518951302339378
i was not thinking of that replied madame danglars quickly   16.284346774444614
tell me what it is replied monte cristo   9.285467307340957
but asked danglars in a timid tone how did you manage about the other formalities the contract the settlement   12.698259177697627
shall i swear to you sir   11.203825406555039
noirtier s room   14.743898724723259
are you going to marry mademoiselle danglars   13.113263012850172
he exclaimed when the door was shut they seem to have the greatest need of me just now   13.255435714899276
yes indeed i have often thought with a bitter joy that these riches which would make the wealth of a dozen families will be forever lost to those men who persecute me   12.752331963193361
that prohibition is not for me said d artagnan   8.32649436937579
wife wife   15.447232301123165
and why revenge   14.243255446103591
i have only heard that an emperor of china had an oven built expressly and that in this oven twelve jars like this were successively baked   10.2136637107865
i should have feared to injure both edmond and yourself had i divulged my own apprehensions to a soul   9.151588400174324
at last comminges appeared pushing broussel before him   12.260665016055619
observed the englishman as if he were slow of comprehension   9.304939971252342
his calm and serene look formed a singular contrast to albert s grief stricken face who approached also followed by the other four young men   10.449252942437806
monsieur said louis xviii   10.9046492111186
he related to him what he had heard of the projects of the cardinal with regard to buckingham and all with a tranquillity and candor of which m   10.013468149710476
once under my grandfather s roof m   13.57019708160571
well said raoul the poor man will get his priest but by heaven the penitent appears to me to have a better conscience than the confessor   10.54483793859383
athos when he reached his appointed room observed through the gratings of his window walls and roofs   12.404133485497303
yes we   12.413670583402899
i will do it captain   14.912249059184743
fernand went and mercédès remained alone   6.327184248166823
then you hope   7.226793786053862
i did not mention that because the signature seemed to me so strange   15.77311092405212
no all is over   5.235670752717587
you gave your direction to no one but your postilion yet i have your address and in proof i am here the very instant you are going to sit at table   9.364516553984298
the effect of the present revelation was stunning   6.410123478764309
athos bowed and prepared to leave   12.05808782675161
he has given you some little writing for me the least bit of paper which may show that you come in his name   10.137698749427479
you can ride you can go and come and fight for the cause of the people   11.099522451337997
replied the captain but we must warn your excellency that the island is an infected port   15.412433420139585
you remind me said the priest that the young man concerning whom i asked you was said to bear the name of edmond   14.476975003214191
they immediately all three halted closed in and waited occupying the middle of the road   12.625875986696759
with what view   11.505702553615755

he had found in m   13.321530616587497
he was a man about twenty two or twenty three years old but who appeared much older from ascetic exercises   10.452340663385273
danglars pressed his daughter s hand in his   9.845614769803834
everything is clear to me now   9.721855756182066

the dying man had signed a deposition declaring benedetto to be the assassin   9.052074158223824
these two can not have drunk all the cellar   14.418454683817068
for you might learn it from others and upon a false account believe us to be in fault   8.343510199795634
true dantès i forgot that there was at the catalans someone who expects you no less impatiently than your father the lovely mercédès   12.510262377849068
and yet you say he has sent you some as from us   9.771016401955155

the young man s eyes gradually resumed their dull and glassy appearance and he fell into a profound reverie   19.778037905865787
0069m fernand closed his eyes a burning sensation passed across his brow and he was compelled to support himself by the table to prevent his falling from his chair   13.528422787983457

i concluded that he was going to versailles and i was not deceived   12.221122103327808
only that there may be no delay i shall borrow one of your horses   13.906033319118276
much more so would be that of the king   10.954986051631153
write to him   13.731557437042113
milady therefore continued coloring her narrations more and more   12.807193459801246
always to show mercy to those i plead for   10.985979732797718
did he know my father s christian name was fernand and his family name mondego   11.74520328253852
he came to this melancholy conclusion as he entered the antechamber   10.53226714786441
but as she was only a procurator s wife she contented herself saying to the musketeer with concentrated fury eh monsieur porthos you don t offer me any holy water   8.789505264822912
athos followed the footman who led him through a long succession of apartments and paused at length before a closed door   9.581596382603259
well wife replied caderousse i don t know but what you re right   12.627161343861827
thousands of men it is true will have to pay for my happiness with their lives   12.721517503513136
of the second opening wh   14.25889945662641
the count sat down   9.265621843213264
do you know the decision we have come to mother   11.422161364338754
once in paris i shall prosecute my search for that unfortunate woman   7.2487525063363965
thank god sir they are not   12.549164710227194
the only thing the builder could oblige him in would be to contrive a sort of secret closet in the cabin at his bed s head the closet to contain three divisions so constructed as to be concealed from all but himself   12.767291596192877
franz and albert had received that morning an invitation from the celebrated roman banker   11.730059630776267
let me hear then said the count who this deeply regretted son was   13.56277344668649
that signified as clear as daylight that he still intends to make me a baron   13.21465669565185
exclaimed dantès pressing his hand to his throbbing brows   16.8831776124034
the two things agree marvelously well   12.576881574969535
you belong to all our party   9.959750713830207
rochefort bent low   18.92203762681238
and if you grant me the care of your future prospects you will redouble my strength   8.809152103590698
a lady it was said had just fainted   14.666044662288705
raoul turned and saw two faces just arrived   10.331871335601228
he has invited us in return to morrow   8.813939499371955
i can not account for it but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the danglars   12.194048316765365
you see then said albert that instead of opposing she will encourage me   12.667560715838427
but this unexpected unhoped for unheard of fortune sufficed you no longer when you once possessed it   12.32701970487579
he walked down the rue richelieu meditating how he should carry off the queen in her turn for to take her in a carriage bearing the arms of france was not to be thought of when he perceived an equipage standing at the door of the hotel belonging to madame de guemenee   19.028988378310423
we ought in our adventures never to be defeated or give any one a chance to laugh at us   11.710922744655825
all my sausages are gnawed   16.47615851225289
oh no it s only because i am tired and also because i have a little business to talk over with you   8.47301132030008
you are free to do so   10.938074117554343
she pressed her son s hand and sobbed aloud but her tears relieved her   9.754995096527981
but on my soul it looks so   10.890049719252541
sir said madame de chevreuse you must excuse me but i long to know to whom i am talking   13.11337520350915
we shall see returned the other smiling   13.088379616842136
yes as you see neighbor caderousse   11.008444280128463
said d artagnan in so firm a tone that it appeared to milady an undoubted proof of devotion   13.414272214288863
you will see danglars that it will turn out an unlucky job for both of us   14.393913214942458
at length one evening as the jailer was visiting him for the last time that night dantès with his ear for the hundredth time at the wall fancied he heard an almost imperceptible movement among the stones   10.559252663121597
he was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time when the door opened and eugénie appeared attired in a figured black satin dress her hair dressed and gloves on as if she were going to the italian opera   7.561644312182732
said he your son s life   14.880076848765516
it is well said haydée   9.537867164387496
about the papers   12.022655367775121
i knight you monsieur le comte   8.118600533445948
but as the cabin was his last resource he knocked again   17.659939023778577
or rather sir said aramis with his peculiar irritating politeness the error of the person who was with you when we met you in the guardroom   12.604678615365394
a pardon   13.51803318759883
sir i can take my pay at this moment to the full extent of my wishes   11.415086130943795
come who is my father   13.09200882845855
president   13.367115003016576
what shall i say to the cardinal   7.398148001776207
here is a man who had resigned himself to his fate who was going to the scaffold to die like a coward it is true but he was about to die without resistance   14.885694816139216
what is the matter then   9.695366189982394
but the count expecting my bachelor s revenue could not suffice for the coming month s outlay has offered me a draft for twenty thousand francs   10.477198777409008
i have lost even the knife that saved me   13.002335399701206
the cart was returning empty to paris and the two lackeys had agreed for their transport to slake the wagoner s thirst along the route   14.582018154817305
madame cried mazarin more and more moved will your majesty permit me to give you counsel   12.211207458934194
there was then amongst that crowd a moment s hesitation which looked like shame   12.251586174881217
it is needless to add that there were gold and silver fish in the basin   12.678161457790726
an hour afterwards the carriage was again ordered and this time it went to the rue fontaine saint georges and stopped at no   14.736675930391378
still annotating   14.302205442963546
a nubian   15.624781951305437
i believe these fellows have managed their business   16.34485962309204
and you to whom are you devoted now   12.560975914934007
well eugénie what is it you want with me   6.987794234902707
it was evident that she had shared the grief of the family for she was pale and looked fatigued   10.909201579397642
you would not like poor andrea to have his throat cut by albert   10.495460838814111
edmond continued she you will see that if my face is pale if my eyes are dull if my beauty is gone   14.291807513060876
asked mousqueton   12.2563438210163

here replied the gendarmes   12.818572888897574
albert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required and then avowed to franz that he would do him a great favor by allowing him to occupy the carriage alone the next day   11.657553174026791
comte de wardes not a word about the sapphire   17.81946067279781
on her side but as softly as possible kitty turned the key of the lock and then d artagnan opened the closet door   10.754777321347841
i will carry the letter in the lining of my coat said planchet   16.699599616183036
you are right welcome   11.868949835005957
not at all cried d artagnan who was anxious the matter should be accomplished   14.42525184113957
i have made up the loss of blood by nutrition   15.625164289059112
as he pronounced the two last names the count glanced at maximilian morrel   8.15697952356121
said the old lady   11.569874822870423
his eyes rested on the weapons and he pointed to them   11.509924712516957
to you   9.580524865594933
now at the moment when i left his house here aramis paused   10.625295080041067
for after having gained a victory over the spaniard it had just gained another over the people   10.885721482585064
it seems sir steward said he that you have yet to learn that all things are to be sold to such as care to pay the price   11.834617014194828
the young man continued to advance following the sailors who chose a firm footing   14.789695221998041
give me a light   8.636284385769113
but the inheritance consisted in this only a scrap of paper on which spada had written i bequeath to my beloved nephew my coffers my books and amongst others my breviary with the gold corners which i beg he will preserve in remembrance of his affectionate uncle   9.592898634026723
aramis darted at d artagnan one of those looks which inform a man that he has acquired a mortal enemy   11.198078906532377
my man was going to fire a pistol at me   13.73380517639344
you are no longer a minister my lord   13.835855202917653
it only proves how little indulgence we may expect from your sex interrupted valentine   12.789467262194364
these gentlemen read it to me and i wept for joy   8.120087705444693
but so it is   13.826024697122147
mazarin bit his lips as he spoke   13.877928992882618
so pray keep your places like athos whose calmness is entirely laudable   11.009916588229478
unluckily i hit him on the head and immediately his face was covered with blood   8.37391941997467
but why valentine do you persist in anticipating the worst why picture so gloomy a future   11.619267084472563
it may be counterfeit said athos   9.087951005681099
come come said the young man a glass of wine father will revive you   18.65500046664496
if i mistake not you are an admirer of paintings at least i judged so from the attention you appeared to be bestowing on mine when i entered the room   15.087940381530181
he remained there some time alone   3.9807058650399245
monsieur is going to marry me replied the hostess between two gasps   12.521193376629782
said eugénie   14.274203653397937
comminges returned to his post   16.817871965111223
he cried in a voice which was now changed from a baritone into a bass you ve not then forgotten me   15.081164885388436
the story first sir said caderousse you must make me a promise   14.526048291288252
the count read it   10.25060797028629
said carmela   11.46518241719862
madame said the chancellor hesitating it would be to release broussel   12.638531421817017
in short my lord said athos glancing at aramis your highness is discontented with your party   12.33424197303839
the bells tolled the chapel was open the grating of the choir was closed   13.988402712112505
he then concluded it must be an assassin   16.679122958715425
to regret the world is to regret the devil   10.050500864861313
here said he i want to show you the kind of passport which i have drawn up and which will serve you henceforward as the rule of order in the life i consent to leave you   6.127616973912131
baptistin only to be conceived by such as have occasion to study the character and disposition of french domestics   9.134963714908992
yes as you said you are indeed wretched and a miracle alone can cure you   12.093281096610525
moreover i have answered for your devotion also   8.179791389644219
the carriage in which a broussel is to be arrested ought to be able to bear ten thousand men   10.538763744485728
but his successive defeats did service to the duke in one way they killed time for him till eight o clock in the evening   17.323358934172475
on d artagnan s lips there played one of those rare and melancholy smiles which seemed to emanate from the depth of his soul the last trace of youth and happiness that had survived life s disillusions   12.185162379429284
the young king approached his mother and said why do as these people ask   11.968061045147733
i divined that you would become mine count replied morrel   9.00446559187165
what shall i do now   14.491592876388978
oh it is nothing said monte cristo   11.861979129863085
yes if the thing be possible   9.946565490517735
but they were prevented by the royal guard and the queen proceeded on her way haughtily disdainful of their entreaties   16.20630457034863
a minute   9.46658384974932
it does not   11.308320830539403
now we are getting on   10.356562848477967
has she returned   12.90036843007508
it would make very little difference to me said caderousse if i were retaken i am a poor creature to live alone and sometimes pine for my old comrades   11.701067039190798
as they entered the circle the bandits could perceive by the firelight the unearthly pallor of the young girl and of diavolaccio   8.526833323841661
it was a friend who spoke thus   9.410644968556431
replied raoul especially in expression   11.76339809247632
do you think his uncle de winter would have brought up that young viper   16.83496260602463
continued the king without directly replying to de tréville s question   12.16005697525288
upon hearing d artagnan s reply aramis seemed about to draw his sword when athos prevented him   14.295253444319266
and i m one of the king s musketeers   12.678251653382047
day for day hour for hour said albert   12.60968256215113
we have heard all it was necessary we should hear   16.795917136182943
when this speech was arranged villefort turned to dantès   14.384521809212242
no said aramis he has not seen us   14.531307693437586
the count perceived at one glance madame danglars at one end of the drawing room m   10.036048698801075
my dear fellow said athos i ride horses when i have any   9.164420021514625
pen ink and paper are my tools and without my tools i am fit for nothing   14.685560698425839
tis god who gives them into our hands answered groslow   10.785811360165281
i dare say you have not brought too large a stock of money with you   11.53093255319804
unfortunately the legs began to refuse their service to this bony machine   14.246353674119867
you must still deliver it said athos   13.979648783313271
i know something of diamonds   12.501288497268787
when i strove to speak a few inarticulate sounds alone escaped my lips   16.998633171467294
and the baroness took from her pocket a letter which she gave to debray   9.206216451956251
the young man looked bowed in obedience and then went to teresa and invited her to dance in a quadrille directed by the count s daughter   15.00276525983439
he who for so long a time had forgotten god began to think that miracles were possible that the accursed cavern might be discovered by the officers of the papal states who would release him   13.154570714565798
good said he our syndic is at his post   11.204360700247708
what induces you to think so   12.27295445265907
i know that she has written to the prince to return in haste from the army   13.880864952496465
he will indeed give us the favor of his company   12.750492254503481
the servant quitted the apartment with evident signs of astonishment   15.108025437590921
very dangerous to say the least   11.021012828597309
so many times in order to follow valentine in thought at every hour in the day had he made her describe the whole house that without having seen it he knew it all   11.829203971086752
at the sound of their steps a young woman of twenty to five and twenty dressed in a silk morning gown and busily engaged in plucking the dead leaves off a noisette rose tree raised her head   11.702769157770126
i suppose i am free to say or not to say who i am to two strangers who take a fancy to ask me   8.686223372623232
the cardinal therefore rose to open it   10.2636317961795
before doing so i must consult the trial justice   9.009461581000298
there was a moment s silence and then a voice in excellent french although with a foreign accent said welcome sir   10.940090893737585
athos laughed   14.151608951266395
i do not seek your confidence my dear friend   12.158762415419602
and at these words felton feeling that he could not long maintain his severity toward his prisoner rushed out of the room   14.121168289849322
come gentlemen your swords said the duke   11.597681759298082
i have however kept along the corridor on which your chamber opens instead of going beneath it   6.153737255956482
but the sailors seemed like the lynx to see in the dark and the pilot who steered did not evince the slightest hesitation   18.306358835880623
true my lord   7.958182746829983
mademoiselle paulet has observed you vicomte   7.557132908348249
on his track   11.124696438382928
20125m teresa was clothed from head to foot in the garb of the count of san felice s daughter   12.647160614426054
peering through the crevices of the wooden partition he soon discovered the young girl who cast aside all her usual precautions and walked at once to the barrier   12.946967737207588
sire it is something more opaque than the fog   17.5121617531122
i never was in a law court   6.373029768877894
from the former she took some greasy letters and put in their place the bank notes and from the bag took two or three crowns of six livres each which in all probability formed the entire fortune of the miserable couple   10.990236609509838
i ask no more for liberty i only ask to live   8.822084114122825
advice is worse than a service   5.95665914918907
d artagnan had a quick eye and a prompt understanding   11.330421623982733
but the name struck me because i also have known that gentleman and it appeared strange to me to meet with a person who appears to know him well   10.971184836289712
exclaimed porthos opening his great wondering eyes   12.217581434089713
i fancy i hear horses feet   11.802166861873996
a servant entered summoned by albert s ring of the bell   15.464104195858397
but the citizen declared to d artagnan that what he had to say being important and confidential he desired to be left alone with him   9.439934905020195
thus it is called by those who have wished for this demonstration and who are perhaps the cause of it   10.720796311541422
no my friend athos gently replied but de winter sought us out in france and introduced us monsieur d herblay and myself to madame henrietta   13.479326949903225
chibouques with jasmine tubes and amber mouthpieces were within reach and all prepared so that there was no need to smoke the same pipe twice   8.188053546996677
with spain no answered d artagnan   10.188248005621364
the catalans beyond a bare weather worn wall about a hundred paces from the spot where the two friends sat looking and listening as they drank their wine was the village of the catalans   12.973160912226389
on entering this holy place the poor penitent was unable to shut the door so close as to prevent the passions he fled from entering with him   11.997574094857812
morrel will have nothing to reproach us with we have tried to save the ship let us now save ourselves   9.527305149262688
you are stupid friend porthos   14.181097235939038
i demand admittance said a loud voice outside the room in the name of the law   9.947555164850659
then why did he purchase it   13.295897256332967
but madame replied the count continuing the conversation and looking by turns at madame de villefort and valentine have i not already had the honor of meeting yourself and mademoiselle before   10.98356387624045
my word said de winter rising i think the hussy is going mad   13.20414309262546
is an order for me to confine myself to a sort of prison from which he will release me by one of his satellites   14.652799491809201
will you take me away with you   14.518387637914483
continued the queen without restraining her tears it is better to fight as the king has done and to die as perhaps he will than live in beggary like me   12.647855178968952
mordaunt proceeded at a rapid pace to the nearest cavalry barracks about a quarter of a league distant   9.779393044846948
do you know modern greek asked he   13.610232996428504
andrea andrea repeated several young people who were already on sufficiently intimate terms with him to call him by his christian name   9.866678971711032
it was terrible to behold the frightful pallor of that woman the anguish of her look the trembling of her whole frame   6.14128897905214
bonacieux who was to have paid him the price of his devotedness   13.978042792223675
but at this period the title of gentleman had great influence with the citizen class and d artagnan was a gentleman   11.400293523191934
they say said aramis resuming his pious reading that the dyke which the cardinal is making drives them all out into the open sea   13.877264802501799
and why do you rush in here as if you were about to penetrate a crowded market place   12.407350484873852
your majesty wishes then you to say what you would do in her place mazarin hastened to reply   16.8454765660369
this was the last blow to the prisoner   12.13743547751526
well then madame not a day passes in which i do not suffer affronts from your princes and your lordly servants all of them automata who do not perceive that i wind up the spring that makes them move nor do they see that beneath my quiet demeanor lies the still scorn of an injured irritated man who has sworn to himself to master them one of these days   13.599133424965059
cried d artagnan loosing his hold of her dress and remaining mute motionless and frozen   13.979739317073824
but you forget replied debray laughing that we are franks by name and franks by nature as king charles said and that the moment she puts her foot in france your slave becomes free   13.968587081016938
besides to tell truth whilst d artagnan was quite disposed to adopt a subtle course against the cunning of aramis or the vanity of porthos he was ashamed to equivocate with athos true hearted open athos   11.148131113825928
he cried are the prisoners still there   12.852804935983507
0125m i do not know   19.264537821494752
planchet was in truth no vulgar companion in these new adventures   12.361130109345055
the confidence with which d artagnan spoke convinced patrick which was the name of this minister of the minister   16.015451406700365
i was executioner of the city of lille as this woman has said   8.24871244264131
a little farther a little farther said the other   13.904730060300341
50215m enough said mercédès   10.752312036574393
but d artagnan   12.36177180930443
your eminence he said might have dispensed with your attendants   15.184037574657616
the 21st of may at half past ten in the morning rue du helder no   11.27293929203233
is that what you would say   14.926605042206642
nor you to mine cried the abbé   12.242254557092394
morrel followed him and looked also for his sister and brother in law   12.762480344473898
charge   8.64509641832153
go to the stable   14.142283647985924
they both arose and while he who called himself sinbad and whom we have occasionally named so that we might like his guest have some title by which to distinguish him gave some orders to the servant franz entered still another apartment   10.518357639565382
necessity has no law   10.147096873151739
said the governor to the jailer who had charge of the abbé   13.165081897710788
the horse as if it understood these words bent its red nostrils toward the king s face and parting his lips displayed all its teeth as if with pleasure   13.651973352634013
it is probable   11.290180911750882
only with that word you would be quartered instead of being broken on the wheel   17.904194067912748
tis a noble gentleman monsieur athos   15.727199408622312
edward begged for a long while the maternal kiss probably not offering sufficient recompense for the trouble he must take to obtain it   9.817553064869687
well then said monte cristo you have all the documents with you   8.816595930956726
he gave porthos a second nudge of the knee and porthos got up as if to stretch his legs and took care at the same time to ascertain that his sword could be drawn smoothly from the scabbard   13.14247445987236
andrea said the latter with his half jesting tone   10.9273735424787
valentine remained motionless grief seeming to deprive her of all fear   16.254895252751385
it was in fact mordaunt whom d artagnan had followed without knowing it   9.740846883819886
oh the red duke   16.2827571036897
then turning to his men allow these gentlemen to pass he said   10.93789599423015
having recognized the laced hats of his companions and the golden fringe of the cardinal s cloak he waited till the horsemen had turned the angle of the road and having lost sight of them he returned at a gallop to the inn which was opened to him without hesitation   14.285695536795753
do not lose time comminges he continued   8.557856154930015
the door opened so quietly that the thief heard no sound   12.547484079834156
in order to save major cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on his banker i send him a draft for 2 000 francs to defray his travelling expenses and credit on you for the further sum of 48 000 francs which you still owe me   12.432490755409452
now that never happened to us when we were four together   11.956792532896204
this voice was that of my father   16.445401284858036
cæsar proposed to his father that they should either ask the cardinals to open the cupboard or shake hands with them   9.413061264407588
but his strength failed him and he sank into a chair   11.424371516994523
she would indeed have found it impossible to repeat what had been said the last few minutes when suddenly madame danglars hand pressed on her arm aroused her from her lethargy   9.867937213348597
villefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him   12.262252694559601
oh said villefort inexpressibly delighted to think that the inquiries were to be made by him alone oh be satisfied i can understand my father   9.575492184603878
you care about it then so much   8.512458894742528
i must start for paris again immediately   12.98519961469873
let us go to the king   15.303900567810873
with this red handkerchief on my head with scarcely any shoes no papers and ten gold napoleons in my pocket without reckoning what was there before making in all about two hundred francs why i should certainly be arrested at the barriers   15.957009254919893
they demanded who was there and recognizing the voices of their lackeys opened the shutter   17.14290191864847
my dear fellow exclaimed albert what can there possibly be in that to excite uneasiness   9.12883100157291
mordaunt remained standing near the door   12.21595755105321
have pity on valentine   5.13962761392825
he took the glass and raised it to his lips   13.359886025278863
and it is exactly because he is a bold fellow that he is the more to be feared   10.449692923788241
he has three unlimited credits one on me one on rothschild one on lafitte   11.714977261005256
and if you wish ever to leave my palace you can not   10.093787936514165
what do you say that she wanted to have her brother in law killed   13.868469614595314
edmond fancied he heard a bitter laugh resounding from the depths   16.786017881653983
the smallpox   7.82048838487271
the whole of the property consisting of an immense workshop two pavilions at the bottom of the garden and the garden itself had been purchased by emmanuel who had seen at a glance that he could make of it a profitable speculation   12.366797142542968
and by whom is this order given   8.986235643252408
in fact three or four of these unfortunate men covered with dirt and blood fled along the hollow way and at length regained the city   10.280871638648346
to the visitors room   14.863467813042105
then it is danglars   10.148640436263978
and will she be disposed to give me myself another sapphire like that which she gave me for de wardes   14.127880933436991
they are all signed by you and assigned to our house by the holders   9.792710179734115
we shall be remarked   13.190553819532374
anyone else would have hastened to receive him   13.92402468617765
then by cutting off the right angle of the street in which stands santa maria maggiore and proceeding by the via urbana and san pietro in vincoli the travellers would find themselves directly opposite the colosseum   15.778529359671012
devil take these civil wars   12.189676741717586
said i   9.716757489799726
the door yielded   13.81726118020223
i left him about five minutes ago and he is now occupied in dictating his will to two notaries   6.838185719699489
the truth was that the anticipated pleasures of the carnival with the holy week that was to succeed it so filled every fair breast as to prevent the least attention being bestowed even on the business of the stage   9.145153078843244
do you wish the notary to be sent for immediately   14.485646018947747
there is but one favor i would entreat of you   10.034534637139089
it is mademoiselle louise d armilly who is playing while mademoiselle danglars is in bed   11.882345478592583
the anjou wine after the most disheartening news of the king s health a report of his convalescence began to prevail in the camp   11.223298104676454
felton said buckingham you will withdraw and place yourself at once under arrest   13.618006034316693
albert advanced towards eugénie smiling   9.35844455998706
morrel shook his head   13.398055928763933
my officer said the sergeant it is not permitted to stop here   15.708803414211179
d artagnan saluted m   10.93768814127027
let us go and return our best thanks for his courtesy   13.883500545133245
the look of felton revealed to milady the full extent of the space she had opened for herself by this single word   15.521175284841007
and if my glass was good and i mistake not they were foremost in the fight   11.995985042952103
and being strong and vigorous he soon got him on the broad of his back and placed his knee upon his breast   14.557814580595343
replied the steward   13.54525953883052
mercédès raised herself on her feverish arm   10.986408100703315
and i know he has fought two duels said morrel   7.616032292363331
like adventurous captains about to embark on some enterprise full of danger i laid in my provisions i loaded my weapons i collected every means of attack and defence   7.932389124800567
well said he what next   8.031201815680092
isn t mousqueton there   11.4251756783659
in five days   14.413939244668871
well said andrea admitting your love why do you want me to breakfast with you   12.586103641527444
with his sixteen hundred francs you remember the sixteen hundred francs he earned at the siege of la rochelle by carrying a letter to lord de winter he has set up a little shop in the rue des lombards and is now a confectioner   12.174357634658357
porthos wouldn t have waited for it so patiently said d artagnan with a smile   9.758287663111265
aramis blushed to the eyes crammed in the letter and re buttoned his doublet   14.387713003905429
bonacieux and dwelt for an instant on the lips of d artagnan   13.64714358257471
but there must be some cause for this strange scene   18.184219796066728
don t be uneasy at anything except mistaking the signal   12.183693500220842
it was a long time before i was able to make out what place i was in or to take account of the details i describe   15.366777346299346
yet the parisian world is so strange that even all this might not have won attention had there not been connected with it a mysterious story gilded by an immense fortune   6.772758821837203
he felt the need of making a trip in the ile de france and begged us the comte de la fere and monsieur du vallon to accompany him   13.34821810955004
morrel alludes continued château renaud is an admirable one which he will tell you some day when you are better acquainted with him   8.486519516067471
athos without saying anything emptied his pockets got together all his jewels purses aiguillettes and gold chains and offered them all to porthos   6.606862033152273
the valet went out with a mute promptitude which showed him accustomed to obey blindly and without reply   16.776008325519108
said d artagnan laughing   12.501061804120663
we will leave the banker contemplating the enormous magnitude of his debt before the phantom of bankruptcy and follow the baroness who after being momentarily crushed under the weight of the blow which had struck her had gone to seek her usual adviser lucien debray   9.26275739318056
with it was effaced the last trace of the preceding night   14.683199604363411
no but i wish to have a share in my revenge   10.788868064747321
nevertheless if you wish it i am ready to go   7.929362709791512
i made them one day to calculate the age of my father that i might know whether i should find him still living and that of mercédès to know if i should find her still free   19.831893006646066
the prince monsieur de retz the duc de beaufort the duc de bouillon are talking over public affairs   6.776337099030108
the smell of a havana is disagreeable to her but the tobacco of the east is a most delicious perfume you know   9.166252017108818
de tréville who made some advances on their pay   8.886424487414677
but am i to remain always alone in this vast and dismal chamber   14.065314453989124
yes let us strive for you ought to live and to be happy albert   17.123302347414054
love is the most selfish of all the passions   14.867309098395824
and de winter glancing around him raoul quickly understood that the two friends wished to be alone and he therefore left the room unaffectedly   9.71097554526942
d artagnan and his two companions turned their backs and commenced a retreat which resembled a flight   8.81469812969776
every soldier must be ambitious must he not   14.735908846898628
the conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor man   15.048029928336906
then swallowing the contents of his glass which he put down close to him athos arose carelessly took the musket next to him and drew near to one of the loopholes   12.101123828717142
i propose to defend no one but myself and i shall defend myself vigorously i give you warning   15.209982367038219
this poire d angoisse was a famous gag in the form of a pear which being thrust into the mouth by the aid of a spring dilated so as to distend the jaws to their greatest width   12.93176789666029
i always knew you were a good son   8.658148313354916
i do not desire to do otherwise   12.061368754312356
mechanically repeated the young gentleman releasing the mane and sliding from the saddle into raoul s arms   11.658183259390208
the old man returned alone to his home folded up his wedding suit with tears in his eyes and paced up and down his chamber the whole day and would not go to bed at all for i was underneath him and heard him walking the whole night   12.6995693451602
i see you are coveting a good draught of it   11.951800641090664
the monk seemed agitated by a strange emotion   10.278593807591296
in your arms   14.26801774163435
and what is his especial talent   8.362941102488525
somewhat   7.716725441118594
the crowd opened and closed again undulating like a stormy sea and the king imagined that he saw shining in the midst of this living wave the bright eyes of athos   9.925873937763754
for he well remembered that albert particularly prided himself on the entire absence of color in his own complexion   10.895651003770702
nor upon any occasion be induced to pronounce the names of your illustrious father or ill fated mother   18.750768814867246
there was a moment of trouble and confusion in the assembly   14.118614456253315
nothing but one word   9.927332095896304
edmond continued mercédès with her arms extended towards the count since i first knew you i have adored your name have respected your memory   3.57734072217524
then i will presume to say that all my friends are in the king s musketeers and guards and that by an inconceivable fatality my enemies are in the service of your eminence   5.487950602909794
his two companions did the same thing   13.736601256164235
half in gold and the other half in bank notes if you please said the count rising from his seat   15.269853261942874
it is he who gave three desperate wounds to de wardes your emissary and who caused the affair of the diamond studs to fail   8.339711447397985
yes if they fell into infamous hands   11.292005135939686
oh villefort   9.441609731707919
decidedly he is a great man   13.071904080950834
it was a phenomenon of skill   13.53297829875669
this worthy gentleman has only to announce the confidential clerk of the house of thomson french of rome with whom your father does business   15.577722598104302
higher   13.93779548762994
your eminence means i presume the knife stab in the rue de la feronnerie   11.804197776723688
fatality chapter l   11.112684764477025
you will understand monsieur i thought there would be still time if you wish to see monsieur de cavois to contradict me by saying you were not yet gone   16.033731149175
true said la ramee   11.399708409475098
at this cry andrea raised his head   14.187356293190053
but first i will state the case to them   9.47775455557025
d artagnan concealed his face in the bosom of athos and sobbed aloud   14.722918286689138
said the voice   19.109872487204584
no it is not existence then that i regret but the ruin of projects so slowly carried out so laboriously framed   14.806845882976283
ideas and men appeared the same to him said albert   8.70441357855189
albert s attack on andrea had placed him on a different footing and he hoped this visit had another cause than that he had at first supposed   13.879623942655925
but woe to those who stood in my pathway   13.162897990414159
asked blaisois i can   11.890046692865326
kitty guessed what was passing in the mind of the young man and heaved a deep sigh   10.364628600906304
dear albert said beauchamp   15.835046326047653
and i am still mourning her loss exclaimed the major drawing from his pocket a checked handkerchief and alternately wiping first the left and then the right eye   15.284877552648457
debray because i have no friends now and i ought not to have any   5.952767588025787
then your grace knows her real name   12.480200719735883
in the middle of the street they saw grimaud and blaisois who were coming to find their masters   14.794122874445712
it is to be remembered that eleven crowns was just the sum that remained in d artagnan s purse   16.837248372833415
oh pray for mercy s sake don t fly from me   9.769403495244259
and you too said he come if you like monsieur   17.686659190052964
this lady is infamous   13.1306548517988
six of his eminence s guards arrest six of his majesty s musketeers   15.935526024439891
yes in some respects tolerably well   11.60020543961148
d artagnan be it remembered was only twenty years old and at that age sleep has its imprescriptible rights which it imperiously insists upon even with the saddest hearts   9.458146783448024
that settles it murmured franz   13.891751212295977
it was even told me that fernand especially was terrible in his vengeance   12.28626865710806
said caderousse with a shudder   8.08777610251056
from his past life from his resolution to shrink from nothing the count had acquired an inconceivable relish for the contests in which he had engaged sometimes against nature that is to say against god and sometimes against the world that is against the devil   13.902870104693925
you do wrong   15.906519556871372
who is this caderousse   14.062484663933432
it was necessary that d artagnan should find alone the staircase and the little chamber   11.673510803880017
oh thank you sir thank you monsieur broussel said friquet   9.821907738264464
but since such men as you assure me that i am wrong in doing so i ve a good mind to follow your advice and to accept a proposition made to me by the duc de chatillon just now   15.103843310018854
how will the crown which is scarce firmly set on the head of louis xiv   14.583693966192108
and who is this third person   13.332687780912368
on whose side   12.717156326307459
as i was saying last night they intend me to be ransomed   13.525183424272996
the two young persons obeyed   13.083488950595827
he expected you will remember to be here on the fifth   8.311507261324767
meantime d artagnan had thrown himself upon the other soldier attacking him with his sword   18.595695693576232
d artagnan then saw a musket barrel leveled at him   12.516783992924635
for in the course of two hours it will be dark and you will not be able to see anything   16.206408079521054
their nostrils reddened like glowing furnaces   10.755846239000746

he had friends then after five years in prison   11.34863940649031
groslow advanced to the door of the king s room replaced on his head the hat he had taken off to receive his guests looked for a moment contemptuously at this simple yet touching scene then turning to d artagnan assumed an air of triumph at what he had achieved   5.3592926866788675
it is a road your ancestors have traced for you said albert gallantly   11.049898732828492

not the first prince of the blood not the king s uncle but the base conspirator the soul of every cabal who pretends to lead the brave people who are weak enough to believe in the honor of a prince of the blood not the prince nearest to the throne not the king s uncle i repeat but the murderer of chalais of montmorency and of cinq mars who is playing now the same game he played long ago and who thinks that he will win the game because he has a new adversary instead of a man who threatened a man who smiles   16.754241416211386
i said at the time he would create a sensation here and i measure his effect by an infallible thermometer   13.684356958148978

that king who was so grand so sublime in the hour of death meeting his fate with a smile of resignation on his lips now in that gloomy hour wiped away a tear which had fallen on the table and quivered on the gold embroidered cloth   8.216884021023699

happy beyond measure   15.50388400174029
then undisturbed by the noisy crowd collected round the broken carriage ali quietly harnessed the pacified animals to the count s chariot took the reins in his hands and mounted the box when to the utter astonishment of those who had witnessed the ungovernable spirit and maddened speed of the same horses he was actually compelled to apply his whip in no very gentle manner before he could induce them to start   14.29501832632431
it was a béarn pony from twelve to fourteen years old yellow in his hide without a hair in his tail but not without windgalls on his legs which though going with his head lower than his knees rendering a martingale quite unnecessary contrived nevertheless to perform his eight leagues a day   14.907189553980086
this insolent boy chastises others cried he   10.023886184725175

another man on horseback was galloping on that side   15.03319744177351
i am afraid to do so   10.561650408076106

but this is a needless quarrel you seek with me as it seems to me   8.954302830304748
the comtesse de monsieur porthos be generous   7.904446719533649
it was however too late   17.24290758669156
besides at that moment he put his foot on the first step of the ladder and began his descent   10.814909372103056
besides your own fortune as your father assured me is almost equal to that of your betrothed   10.591114701572856

but is it the custom for the officers in the english navy to place themselves at the service of their female compatriots when they land in a port of great britain and carry their gallantry so far as to conduct them ashore   14.63164776656669
partly to drown the recollections of the past that haunted me partly to supply the wants of the poor widow i eagerly returned to my trade of smuggler which had become more easy since that relaxation of the laws which always follows a revolution   8.632186481636

his highness the prince charged eleven times in person   7.253752578135137
but pray grant me that it is acting with an ill grace to offer to the lord only that with which we are perfectly disgusted   11.645077787510573
then he informed porthos that the one intended for him was already installed in the stable of the tavern   10.547917415121287
his family will inherit fifteen thousand louis a year from him   15.625502651764954

be so kind as to reflect sire said the cardinal   12.252184560495385
blaisois found bazin donning his beadle s gown his services being required that day at notre dame   11.699588440245579
i descended the staircase step by step   13.91817281357092
replied the stranger with a coolness which was barely civil   7.861772985784678
how can you doubt it sir   7.467611368845758
it was no longer a rival who was beloved   14.653052160127148

you are in a shocking hurry to be off you forget one of my guests   8.068794101385738
a most affectionate greeting as one can well believe took place between him and lord de winter   15.464666616935894
sire i fear it is more than a plot   11.912365768643408
he had often heard that shipwrecked persons had died through having eagerly devoured too much food   13.997510512399995
the doctor then slowly poured some drops of the lemonade from the decanter into the cup and in an instant a light cloudy sediment began to form at the bottom of the cup   12.489221026769512
you can not reproach me with the slightest coquetry   10.502666164510792
it was necessary   13.683580127581394
come here   10.369816209126578
the former was confiding to the latter his grief and fear for it was the second time within a month that death had suddenly and unexpectedly entered that house which was apparently destined to destruction by some exterminating angel as an object of god s anger   12.964720474284864
nothing was wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry   8.023318939405003
she flew to the windows but they were also secured   13.13243272421007
said bazin looking uneasily around   14.243164288940653
cried the citizen swearing in order to rouse his courage   13.077766963326269
said athos since you have not a regiment we are three devoted men   11.879081066410933
and taking the letter he squeezed it up in his hands and threw it into a corner of the arbor   10.42074615849695

my mother and i traversed the gloomy passage leading to the cavern   9.968993315082939
not such as he is now represented broken down like an old man suffering like a martyr his body bent his voice failing buried in a large armchair as in an anticipated tomb   10.641464215260072
around a broken down carriage the people were uttering imprecations whilst the persons who had attempted to escape were made prisoners that is to say an old man and two women   18.020764638698466
athos do you know any inn in the whole town where one can find white sheets roast beef reasonably cooked and wine which is not made of hops and gin   12.346979353647669
his beard which was darker than his hair was turned carefully with a curling iron a practice that greatly improved it   11.874493470442548

edmond was obliged to assist him for otherwise he would not have been able to enter by the small aperture which led to dantès chamber   7.52897640276919
it is my wish that she should marry m   12.438800387567083
for in the person of him who had just entered he recognized not only the mysterious visitant to the colosseum and the occupant of the box at the teatro argentina but also his extraordinary host of monte cristo   16.98133624974382
and now now what   10.902448406723373
but i can readily tell you where he is going to and that is down below without the least doubt   11.23466047547706
silence me   14.14986616918511
but to do this he must have spoken   14.719163712208035
you came you say to see me   11.367527617944738
it was now athos s turn to take a sly look   5.486931516964445
take it from me then and so long at least as i receive my income you shall be paid yours   9.613388563437269
eugénie is to be married in a week and in three days there is to be a grand feast a betrothal festival   14.684320837492628
la carconte continued to gaze on him for some time then shrugging her shoulders she took her seat immediately opposite to him   13.688343789179344
the facchino follows the prince the transteverin the citizen everyone blowing extinguishing relighting   13.136794286311934
now the portmanteau let us make haste the portmanteau   14.961862097840378
bertuccio hid his face in his hands as he uttered these words while monte cristo fixed on him a look of inscrutable meaning   14.595638217375058
what can you expect my dear porthos   11.242663782889093
however what had you to say to me   6.9947032673581155
de tréville for they were the first to whom he communicated it   12.188266392504763
it was evident that madame danglars was suffering from that nervous irritability which women frequently can not account for even to themselves   11.546948552438701
your arm is still strong enough is it not porthos   11.890547631312161
they were about to proceed to the reading of the contract which half paris assembled was to sign   9.42605236702272
but said danglars who on his part did not perceive how soon the conversation which was at first disinterested was turning to a business transaction there is doubtless a part of your fortune your father could not refuse you   8.896412947747152
oh the frightful brute   17.18565586199867
20277m it was unexampled for a servant of the count s to dare to dispute an order of his so the steward without saying a word followed his master who got into the carriage and signed to him to follow which he did taking his place respectfully on the front seat   11.61944868620429
they fancy that their countryman is still emperor   11.198925274383344
on the contrary speak to me always in the same strain about him   11.026476342332845
perceiving m   8.165503149128412
d artagnan took some water in the hollow of his hand and threw it upon his face   11.779886435900492
welcome home again   13.64159117823907
aramis then reperused the letter and perceived a postscript ps   12.68347747314169
i can be no longer mistrustful but you must pardon me my dear count for confessing to some degree of astonishment   18.484320256803024
by thus exaggerating to his own mind the anticipated ill fortune of the next day to which he had condemned himself by promising mercédès to spare her son the count at last exclaimed folly folly folly   13.196270763777152
count count added she you know that i wait for you   9.130985880888877
my lord said d artagnan no longer able to contain himself allow me to introduce to you the chevalier d herblay who wishes as you may have heard to offer his congratulations to your eminence   12.141053985581207
petition the minister   13.006593223009004
athos curled his lip with disdain   12.251042892395748
i do not need rest gentlemen   11.976933596162205
oh well then said monte cristo i am not particular about these five notes pay me in a different form   11.284874318010012
and now gentlemen said d artagnan without stopping to explain his conduct to porthos all for one one for all that is our motto is it not   14.512712741543465
i can believe that had you been madame de chevreuse poor buckingham might have hoped   13.704156626639422
your orchestra is too noisy   13.517936752526474
i can scarcely realize so great a happiness   12.06051058354045
then opening a feather bed he had rolled in it and had thus become the most grotesque fowl it is possible to imagine   14.596183921565347
i ask it humbly of you my lord said he   8.798506458339341
my dear fellow the emperor is at this moment on the way to grenoble   10.927635701684947
the count returned to young morcerf   10.552138226151598
oh d artagnan   12.163635681992544
it was not the plain white waistcoat   17.23377164646552
well said morrel changing his expression of calmness for one of violence well and if i do intend to turn this pistol against myself who shall prevent me who will dare prevent me   14.898587524030019
it is magnetism she says and when she dreams a thing it is sure to happen she assures me   11.619944015951237
then that explains everything that is extraordinary said andrea   16.36845538831001
ah his friend is with him   13.59034278644313
then falling into a reverie she added however with an expression of joy ungrateful woman that i am for twenty years i have forgotten this man whom i ought to have made a marechal of france   14.967528264165441
he might feel perhaps annoyed but he knew monte cristo s eye was on him   8.800564328905677
all looked around   16.92208999059564
d artagnan shuddered to the marrow at hearing this suave creature reproach him with that sharp voice which she took such pains to conceal in conversation for not having killed a man whom he had seen load her with kindnesses   12.787688361403179
don t you remember said the patron i told you that among the crew there were two corsican brigands   13.929841575336752
you have not been long detained   16.36388375702992
to come in the capacity of a cousin and seat himself every day at a good table   12.265340457021123
they had repaired it completely and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hole dantès had partly filled in   12.331586680025705
and is not this daughter dead   10.419808521032044
but the spasmodic working of the nostrils showed to the practiced eye of monte cristo that the arab had been wounded to the heart   11.26132609598571
the young man hesitated and looked at athos as if seeking to read in his eyes a rule of conduct   13.345664597686092
that is why you in your turn are to die it is because your father would inherit your property and your brother his only son succeed to his   14.858594495695954
but excessive grief is like a storm at sea where the frail bark is tossed from the depths to the top of the wave   15.618092700143727
the latter retained the count s hand between his   13.413800091304829
franz and the count in their turn then advanced along the same path which at the distance of a hundred paces led them over a declivity to the bottom of a small valley   12.256001728268581
the valet de chambre appeared on the door steps   9.061151037381396
aramis received a ball which passed through his shoulder and mousqueton another ball which lodged in the fleshy part which prolongs the lower portion of the loins   9.650732568589355
i i was where d artagnan stands   8.305241067835382
two or three times a week   11.127889150822856
said athos god is great as say the followers of mohammed and the future is in his hands   13.030641444188745
luigi was jealous   15.217950939505217
they are shown to a magistrate and the evidence is taken   12.810559497664524
did parliament pass this act   8.748172954952517
however much of a jew he may be he will give you at least eight hundred pistoles   7.382848190476322
she still loves me   9.87429877709391
i know you are accustomed to assassinate people   12.87604254586152
i do not understand you said debray with freezing coldness   16.471415313162904
what do you mean my lord   10.783479970155392
that will do for us   12.897492916279537
he read them again and again and fixing his eyes on m   4.237078293917914
she is quite well replied danglars quickly   9.806225283563133
oh my brain whirls   16.021460045517863
one day the young shepherd told the count s steward that he had seen a wolf come out of the sabine mountains and prowl around his flock   10.795948681665633
this was a terrible moment for the fugitives   11.44065404029471
but we four altogether would be equal to thirty six more especially as you say the work will not be child s play   10.737805282543839
replied the prince   10.899513341580526
ghosts at first sight the exterior of the house at auteuil gave no indications of splendor nothing one would expect from the destined residence of the magnificent count of monte cristo   10.355211376021122
unless i am mistaken it has been already written   18.382503702809586
quick quick d artagnan   10.805004912261047
oh maximilian maximilian you are certainly concealing something from us   15.911916754507043
at length at the gate of the entrance court he found a carriage surrounded by four guards on horseback   11.62185074571418
grimaud bowed in thanks   12.681556753820313
at least so d artagnan declared to himself   12.906286392259068
ah you know that already said the private secretary smiling and shaking hands with him   12.453947385679726
take one step more said i and in addition to my dishonor you shall have my death to reproach yourself with   13.915627539222811
but peppino what has become of him   12.263944004815208
the wind blew violently   12.009119226184751
are you after all unconsciously in love with mademoiselle eugénie   8.098104101602118
i recognize them said morrel whose face was suffused as he thought that for the first time in his life he would be unable to honor his own signature   11.652395502901653
but said renée this letter which after all is but an anonymous scrawl is not even addressed to you but to the king s attorney   12.410659467959224
she cast her eyes upon the table saw the glittering of a knife rushed toward it and clutched it   5.7584674798285
i will wait until the very moment you are married for i will not lose the shadow of one of those unexpected chances which are sometimes reserved for us since m   11.217574157337058
i tell you that you were wrong   9.74392906343284
all i can say is continued the countess taking up the lorgnette and directing it toward the box in question that the gentleman whose history i am unable to furnish seems to me as though he had just been dug up   10.721751921759909
50125m maximilian said the count let us both lay aside the mask we have assumed   12.495535091895755
did not touch those hearts of stone   16.129316270230362
do you see that   15.007555947495298
my dear said madame de villefort who had just entered the room perhaps you exaggerate the evil   9.561064281545415
but having lost the horses i am particularly anxious to preserve the harnesses   14.954605417909423
this evening to morrow always   9.473939155326432
with the first rays of day their tongues were loosened   14.656141459603482
the matter enters completely into the duties of the post   13.705520294021227
i suffer horribly   5.6749260744077485
what do you say m   12.886884021075492
speak sir replied the queen   10.003374198435566
a leather pocketbook a purse in which was evidently a part of the sum which the bandit had received with a dice box and dice completed the possessions of the dead man   19.283602132773957
he certainly bodes us no good said athos   15.386332220977366
he then related the adventure of meung described the unknown gentleman with the greatest minuteness and all with a warmth and truthfulness that delighted m   12.143659901576488
as the town clock of newcastle struck one the sleeper awoke and with all the gestures of a man rousing himself out of deep sleep he looked attentively about him   12.036879365492581
a dead father or husband is better than a dishonored one blood washes out shame   8.740912514956179
can you imagine said monte cristo some othello or abbé de ganges one stormy dark night descending these stairs step by step carrying a load which he wishes to hide from the sight of man if not from god   10.290524955848506
these four men were not princes neither were they dukes neither were they men in power   9.672483776006171
but there is nothing which would do   9.973588983020726
monte cristo went to meet him   14.09988912388868
i have arrived from cadiz this morning   8.39973016130827
yes monseigneur enemies against whom you owe me all your support for i made them by serving your eminence   9.829558062606088
however the duke contrived to hide the ball under his bolster and as soon as the door was closed he tore off the cover of the ball with his teeth and found underneath the following letter my lord your friends are watching over you and the hour of your deliverance is at hand   10.572089521565626
d artagnan was a physiognomist   13.886274580039442

you must know that in france they are very particular on these points   11.026825198107602
franz lowered a torch and saw by the mass of cinders that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover this retreat which was doubtless one of the halting places of the wandering visitors of monte cristo   11.977476774316239
there could be no doubt that behind this little window which threw forth such friendly beams the pretty mme   14.576267121233744
have i travelled in that country   10.128275474000183
perhaps he would have sought to escape by flight had he seen any possibility of doing so   8.763245145191114
well said franz to his friend what think you of all this   13.250121282189802
it might have been said that between this man and his inferiors spoken language did not exist or had become useless   8.521205601766923
dantès appeared not to perceive him   11.013775013531555
whilst planchet was standing on the steps before the house he heard a voice say well where is this gentleman and why do they not bring him here   5.834116822551438
i shall do my duty as conscientiously as i can and fulfil my promise to the dying man   7.497181091553532
what a scandal   14.254715612444313
d artagnan following the strange custom of the times considered himself at paris as on a campaign neither more nor less than if he had been in flanders spain yonder woman here   6.3416428921111745
13 murmured he growing still paler   14.475556832014284

château renaud looked for a moment for morrel   6.259140323686449
the two oarsmen bent to their work and the little boat glided away as rapidly as possible in the midst of the thousand vessels which choke up the narrow way which leads between the two rows of ships from the mouth of the harbor to the quai d orléans   13.719893862076468
without reckoning replied monte cristo that all his fortune will come to you and justly too since mademoiselle danglars is an only daughter   10.453682392273357
it is the people who do not obey that i punish and not those who like you obey but too well   12.94004192708256
she listened panting overwhelmed crushed   9.18091141291777
and if it makes thee happy i will not tutoyer you any longer   13.653191689390193
brute   10.479940590324603
but monte cristo is not the only one i miss here   14.87396009910576
the two musketeers arrived in their turn holding the horses of d artagnan and porthos in their hands   12.924662790383064
it was in the name of comte de wardes   13.71468014549097
old dantès who was only sustained by hope lost all hope at napoleon s downfall   12.377823357050593
it is for me then to interrogate grimaud   12.612262382159162
you have a right to be unjust to them monsieur   12.878514269549333
as to d artagnan he did not budge from his apartment   10.325230152675271
command   14.698198012685035
but d artagnan was still in confusion and turned around almost mechanically when a fine young man of fifteen years of age dressed simply but in perfect taste entered the room raising as he came his hat adorned with a long plume of scarlet feathers   16.340251512774927
or as you are a corsican that you had been unable to resist the desire of making a stiff as you call it   10.78081331746038
but athos porthos and aramis quickly appeared in their turn and the moment the two guardsmen attacked their young companion drove them back   10.033041439568336
your hour   14.20241338932717
madame de villefort however reassured by the silence which was alone disturbed by the regular breathing of valentine again extended her hand and half hidden by the curtains succeeded in emptying the contents of the phial into the glass   11.379355990717285
but only on condition that you will not open it till i am gone   10.259740118080394
but that i am not ambitious i am going to prove to you   14.01188183684514
the former royal attorney at nîmes   11.50723675786909
the prince kept his gaze fixed in the direction of the sound with the steadfastness of a bird of prey   16.334252983874457
if your daughter had committed only one crime and i saw her meditating another i would say warn her punish her let her pass the remainder of her life in a convent weeping and praying   4.731023222447022
it contained a few poor articles of household furniture a bed a table two chairs a stone pitcher and some dry herbs hung up to the ceiling which the count recognized as sweet peas and of which the good man was preserving the seeds   10.446049843807202
i do not like to disturb those who pray madame said felton seriously   9.150016547350457
in half an hour we shall be on board   16.193675681338455
the young man shuddered at this strange familiarity   7.050685281814642
hullo said albert   9.132160275558816
asked the young girl with the velvet eyes   8.904653851124172
besides how do i know that this was not a political trick that the minister enraged at seeing me in the opposition and jealous of the popular sympathy i excite has not concerted with m   14.465536516816684
i have weighed all the chances calculated the time required for all the forms   12.78345923417969
bonacieux thought she recognized the sound of that voice   11.39017199143108
take it then but in exchange caderousse who touched the diamond withdrew his hand   12.547577708203026
i am rich enough forsooth to distribute his authority on this occasion   10.302417538403962
while the waiter was preparing his room the hostess arose   16.067641880875183
gendarmes i am at your service   18.059359835856633
look for on my soul it is curious   12.135975640622213
faith yes replied andrea whose hunger prevailed over every other feeling   15.710892035106891
athos and aramis entered last and locked the door behind them   16.650569860281077
he advanced several paces towards the point whence the light came and to all the excitement of his dream succeeded the calmness of reality   8.114953895671738
ah my yellow horse cried he   13.855468308422378
that is not difficult   8.373782025158409
ask d artagnan   15.324234005806543
his voyage would upset him quite   16.008157334943512
that s my room replied groslow   14.921942186887538
the count in his survey of the pit encountered a pale face and threatening eyes which evidently sought to gain his attention   14.792129428364227
de tréville s private rooms and striking his shoulder violently made him utter a cry or rather a howl   15.22282586409436
his countenance usually so pale was purple with heat and passion   13.644179558517095
he is a bold fellow said the cardinal   14.018846663676413
felton my brother my friend i conjure you   12.516983445948146

oh you are good you are great my lord   14.439130567578257
the luck had turned and groslow having won some hundred pistoles was in the merriest possible humor   12.148681231757918
what do you think d artagnan   8.750923719032794
her preserver was everywhere sought for but he did not appear   10.4229098207663
ah i am an unfortunate king monsieur de tréville   11.630241503220454
then when you have carried off the golden trophy of victory instead of setting any value on it you give it to the first handsome woman you think of   7.977461202126762
franz essayed to smile   11.729586227224273
surrounded by the scotch whom he distrusts although he be himself a scotchman   11.530679620826465
well you are right for if you indulged in such reflections you would never risk your principal which is to the speculator what the skin is to civilized man   16.364562321509087
and the king has seen the cardinal   13.82382840362413
i will go and see about that and then we shall have the honor of presenting ourselves to the general and receiving his commands for his eminence   11.73504334912915
i was obliged to sound a retreat toward the rue tiquetonne   10.952769086390703
monseigneur let your eminence be reassured   11.17421169876415
it is all as he has said   11.618876449787287
the comte de la fere is a demi god   13.33104252580291
i believe that this singular man who appears to fathom the motives of everyone has purposely arranged for me to meet m   11.404643125725332
d artagnan lifted up his head   15.079252593524057

her reason told her that all the visions she beheld were but the children of her imagination and the conviction was strengthened by the fact that in the morning no traces remained of the nocturnal phantoms who disappeared with the coming of daylight   12.37628355515125
our coachman is a member of the club said the president   13.993709707450655
ay and observe it just occurs to me that the puritans are furious against buckingham and their preachers designate him as the antichrist   15.134032130260195
he was very pale   8.506873292156833
he watched the effect of this question on the old man   8.453878911578657
well if any misfortune happen to me replied monte cristo i wish my daughter to be happy   14.464719755908183
he accepted my challenge and my faith my seventy five pistoles passed from my pocket to his without reckoning my horse which he won into the bargain   11.593546218125432
30283m yes truly   13.439780128872043
albert de morcerf entered first and i began to hope my fears were vain when after him another young man advanced and the count exclaimed ah here is the baron franz d épinay   15.560675821362231
when he had ended the perusal he folded the letter and resumed his pensive attitude   8.895089021283109
grimaud was already ahead with the basket and the dessert   12.602273790742931
the poor lad had nearly come to the pass of forgetting how to speak   8.655767751929691
20299m we never knew who had revealed this fatal secret which we had so carefully concealed from him   17.035511087594713
and that of pierrefonds in the valois   10.718094104523118
one brings a king within reach of the guillotine the other elevates the people to a level with the throne   14.682293591577757
never fear said aramis   15.189911674732643
a man can pass through that   16.312780613123184
no on the contrary they wished to assassinate him   19.34870307975909
do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen   15.18019785250298
who ignorant of what had happened followed him in astonishment foreseeing some new catastrophe   16.331123373317936
monsieur grimaud is absent from the chateau for the time being said the servitor who little used as he was to such inquiries began to examine planchet from head to foot   9.71063392474353
emmanuel embraced him as a guardian angel   9.203327320696086
if we were not forced to entertain a parcel of country boobies because they think and vote with us we should never dream of dining at home i assure you   14.49566458011336
to you the only just good and compassionate being i have met with   9.624664299300152
but nothing could be farther from his thoughts   14.548637563698616
it will be absolutely necessary that the place you may select have a small harbor creek or bay into which my corvette can enter and remain at anchor   8.79479640395199
at least when the woman is rich and the lover is not that which he can not offer she offers to herself   13.175999837949966

he will come in here and m   12.840649788878059
will you have my waistcoat or my hat   13.129161438697114
and as the young man had no reason to conceal where he was going he called aloud to the opera   3.982042985058163

i do not ask you of his origin but what he is   10.616502462958403
joy joy the sum is large   11.312874643372396
you didn t forget my purse   15.647587744361623
an hour afterwards the two friends returned to their hotel   9.970391099387697
bossuet   12.380678636559992
at the door of her apartment the baroness met mademoiselle cornélie her confidential maid   10.900152976325563
in a recess was a kind of divan surmounted with a stand of arabian swords in silver scabbards and the handles resplendent with gems   9.410788328089806
everything has succeeded as i expected   9.750667590508378

thirty five or thirty six mother   11.28188413985499
that it is nearly three years since i have seen him and that i never do see him unless i send for him   10.370155497382179
and if he had been generous seeing me sad and solitary he would have used his influence to my advantage and since as you say he resembles the sun he would have warmed my heart with one of his life giving rays   15.242065049189037
meanwhile morrel had traversed the anteroom and found the staircase which being carpeted prevented his approach being heard and he had regained that degree of confidence that the presence of m   10.473083817295091
i have already fought three duels with him said the englishman the first with the pistol the second with the sword and the third with the sabre   12.67175362704214
bertuccio left   6.976457456585246
on hearing the sound of his footsteps the two men threw themselves in each other s arms and while they were in the midst of this embrace the count entered   12.014225383282252

planchet met them hard by the shed   10.260367211223645
it unfortunately happened that our neighbor wasilio was at bastia leaving no person in his house but his wife   10.201747388857374
defend ourselves   11.708575414171223
let us go immediately   9.725887973975675

bonacieux since he has told you what he has suffered   14.210717241859385
five minutes afterward they knocked at the prince s door   9.014516882023397
my mother tried to force the door that she might go and die with him but it was fastened on the inside   16.032952407388795
you were a fool not to have pretended to accept the mission   14.399359816396569
boulogne was a strong position then almost a deserted town built entirely on the heights   7.681660034053666
he again beheld the dull light vainly endeavoring to penetrate the narrow opening   10.631305438205466
and he heaved a sigh   16.857075030301477
the rest of the furniture of this privileged apartment consisted of old cabinets filled with chinese porcelain and japanese vases lucca della robbia faïences and palissy platters   12.236494487119737
i will candidly acknowledge that i am not well   9.694467293596748
the boat replied   7.958733664890493
you are poor are you not   13.405756321982649
thus the house had become unrecognizable and bertuccio himself declared that he scarcely knew it encircled as it was by a framework of trees   11.170216047444965
16 but i being only a little child was terrified by this undaunted courage which appeared to me both ferocious and senseless and i recoiled with horror from the idea of the frightful death amidst fire and flames which probably awaited us   7.892891608600477
the will was made the day before yesterday i believe   13.288153852072158
what refreshment can i offer   14.97854201601016
no sooner had he turned his back than the officer laid himself down in it and he had scarcely crossed the threshold before his successor in his turn was snoring immoderately   8.353779635324619
because it is the air she always breathed in her youth   13.419852440909834
she is detained at the louvre this evening by her duties   10.179209316563504

they would have seen that their friend was worthy of their defense while alive and of their tears when dead   18.616690417974084
when i look at this room whence so many guilty creatures have departed trembling and ashamed when i look at that chair before which i now sit trembling and ashamed oh it requires all my reason to convince me that i am not a very guilty woman and you a menacing judge   11.846845637642165

but having some days previously seen from the top of the donjon madame de montbazon pass in her carriage and still cherishing an affection for that beautiful woman he did not wish to be to her what he wished to be to mazarin and in the hope of seeing her again had asked for a leaden comb which was allowed him   10.859940122010617

said milady in a voice broken by sobs   10.863155604062193

at the end of the breakfast franz took out his watch   13.817357086256639
man s whole life passes in doing these things and his intellect is exhausted by reflecting on them   16.097902933552962
the gentlemen had drawn their swords but they found themselves taken between two fires   8.693685003664761
d artagnan led the way through the intricate windings and narrow alleys of the city and ere long they had reached the house in question   18.313868363740223
i have heard that she met with a strange adventure in i don t know what village with i don t know what curé of whom she asked hospitality and who having but one chamber and taking her for a cavalier offered to share it with her   7.642690294064664
dantès had always entertained the greatest horror of pirates who are hung up to the yard arm   13.568991086282551
the presence of my daughter and myself in france is already irksome to him   11.008203913303927
he was considered beforehand as a comrade   14.939194614397096

these are our arms that is those of my father but they are as you see joined to another shield which has gules a silver tower which are my mother s   15.601766638218306
that reconciliation was nothing but the vengeance of a jealous woman   4.794468808664384
mazarin gave however no order of the kind but on the contrary began to be insinuating   11.333367763256586
at the sixth cabaret then as we said d artagnan stopped asked for a bottle of wine of the best quality and placing himself in the darkest corner of the room determined thus to wait till daylight   11.51507368100778

as calm as at parade radiant as at a fete   8.814413858811836
i pardon you and i weep for you   11.840927525623902

the man whom he had seen seated on a fence had got down and was still pacing the street   13.619717706896006
there is no count of monte cristo said debray   11.728673168280727
the executioner who had lifted himself up fell back upon his bed   13.073339974775026

a third pistol shot was heard aimed by d artagnan and one of his adversaries fell   11.285972170625877
and to that friend i say during the three quarters of an hour that the struggle continued i watched the convulsions and the death of madame de saint méran and am thoroughly convinced that not only did her death proceed from poison but i could also specify the poison   10.256955845161297

after walking for about ten minutes during which danglars did not exchange a single word with his guide he found himself between a hillock and a clump of high weeds   11.772302064640876
sir said the servant i have a favour to ask you   15.460687606538489
seated with folded arms in a corner of the carriage he continued to ponder over the singular history he had so lately listened to and to ask himself an interminable number of questions touching its various circumstances without however arriving at a satisfactory reply to any of them   10.203645128230551
the story sent you from yanina   6.775314800707399
and although teresa was universally allowed to be the most beautiful girl of the sabines no one had ever spoken to her of love because it was known that she was beloved by vampa   3.9211550568562377
porthos did the same   10.975479722000912
she loved porthos too dearly to allow him to part thus   8.722320954340109
villefort bowed and advancing a few steps waited until the king should interrogate him   10.332101733900664
the first thing he saw was the old man sitting in his armchair in his usual place but his eyes expressed alarm which was confirmed by the pallor which overspread his features   7.638758327807803
he was a tailor named caderousse but he was very drunk   10.411948375814315
ten leagues of wood of marsh land and valleys   10.941529179611507

with forty five thousand francs we can live like princesses for two years and comfortably for four   10.409861873479137
this last thought of love counseled her to make this last sacrifice   11.296434106030416
besides how will they know that we are doing it   14.762149983320786
you are running your heads into a very silly affair   9.865582330899365

but when a man dies he has only his skin   16.336542138168653
i would propose to you to stake planchet but as that has already been done the englishman would not perhaps be willing   16.342533436234394
yes if we can   13.429069867577146
and if you wish to know his name i will tell it he is named villefort   17.27292014285324

i had provided myself with a dark lantern   13.270900805516312
dantès pressed the gendarme s hand as though he would crush it   9.670383972289807
it was captain groslow the reader will remember who had broken parry s head   11.601883701656012
you know the proverb all roads lead to rome   12.758709503848817
they now knew that it required but one hour to take up arms again and one night to reconstruct the barricades   14.466927399710498
of what importance is this little reptile to you   7.292255021010816
well said beauchamp here is my answer my dear sir   6.440512336853797
this woman to whom we have given twenty louis may betray us for forty   9.121029714178167
in fact at one of the doors which opened into the queen s apartment appeared the pretty mme   15.076006340886622
well replied milady after a moment of silence from the present time cease to talk of impossibilities   13.314211356695507
mazarin was a cheat at the card table   13.550676865765139
she could read to the depths of the heart of this young man   8.56605750388716
we shall perhaps travel part of the night and must keep our strength up   14.22638114662493
this affirmation appeared to dispel all doubts with regard to the baldric   14.9635585201971
but in the meantime we shall part good friends i hope   11.680216210744316
but with sublime disinterestedness and confidence the young man refused to listen or to express a single doubt to the baron   11.562338726871703
that was my intention   11.778552019528894
is it my equipment   11.516909938560485
and turning to chatillon sir be so good as not to go away without giving me an opportunity to tell you something i can not say before the queen   13.071286375059675
everyone looked with astonishment on that grave and severe face whose calm expression personal griefs had been unable to disturb and the aspect of a man who was a stranger to all human emotions excited something very like terror   12.805054479756846
bonacieux once again and satisfy himself that he had not been mistaken that the appointment was at st   11.160305894831353
are you interested in the sugar question   8.933514302076137
in fact d artagnan believed that he might be tranquil as one of his two enemies was killed and the other devoted to his interests   8.770866201794625
one of the two men was peppino and the other a bandit on the lookout   8.81066936172591
but the paper nowhere identifies this fernand with your father   10.601868951284716
the king who was entirely surrounded walked alone in a great empty space   5.627278882909633
ah you think very lightly of it   11.419680109488803
i made them but you know my dear friend madame du vallon porthos in pronouncing these words seemed to gulp down something   12.06904827615186
milady replied mechanically yes that is happiness   15.844046893765082
you must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of project gutenberg™ works   6.694220419877945
they disobeyed orders   12.907286972146549
yes said villefort really count you frighten the ladies   15.24632637807183
on arriving in paris d artagnan found a letter from m   15.263995360035416

come in my braves said the king come in   11.06162418412829
you were saying sir said fernand awaiting with great anxiety the end of this interrupted remark   12.303981296872152
said the count to turn the conversation   13.97893549452763
but if his morals were shocked on the landing his respect for the cardinal was scandalized in the antechamber   9.91295096531694
but i said monte cristo rising as he spoke i am gallant enough to offer it you   11.18503372842276
we had conceded enough for them to yield us that   11.353954165606579

that is to say i guess your wishes and that is all that s necessary said madeleine   17.69109846030456
god abandons him who abandons himself said milady   10.968898822425793
athos who had till that time said nothing for fear that d artagnan interrupted in his turn should not have the time necessary from this moment declared that his name was athos and not d artagnan   12.985808662231959
30179m you are angry with us all on account of this marriage are you not   13.43605720431969
remain here   11.287788804265872
in england lately we failed we were beaten and that is a blemish on our reputation   10.822683666345219
hear me count replied d artagnan   10.954975529692849
it is a matter of indifference to me said aramis   8.96619623559214
are you an angel   15.337863257692668
then i paid the host six   6.4513322668850845
monseigneur well well said the cardinal i don t wish you any ill   15.621415974223062
i only know for a certainty that he fell   9.123384699826909
you guess aright my friend   9.20686721672292
you are madame bonacieux   8.28978923427532
and yet this nature so distinguished this creature so beautiful this essence so fine was seen to turn insensibly toward material life as old men turn toward physical and moral imbecility   11.938345031601163
at the sight of him she expected though probably not in such a costume the young woman started in terror and was about to make a hasty retreat   14.29107150182888
it is very evident that m   12.478703455420515
i said to myself something is always left in a cell inhabited by one prisoner for fifteen years so i began to sound the wall   12.78896277662741
he really had 3 000 crowns and we found them   15.82509455329285
for by this time she must have quit the shores of france   15.504653204451902
i am determined not to be content with anything short of an entire retractation   14.223641643212074
let us go said mazarin since everything must be done as you wish   12.492150612815978
what has he to do at notre dame   15.327163013262846
leave me   16.662903824276782
vanitas vanitatum   19.773129155955054
the same officer appeared   8.582371722845862
and then she added in a low voice oh heavens what will befall me   12.875638132735485
28 was situated at the extremity of the village   7.5868555005960285
we should need clothes and arms   19.53242892682879
it was a horrible thing at that period to be imprisoned by the enmity of the king   12.504469121895239
mercédès shrieked and sprang towards monte cristo but suddenly stopping edmond said she there is a god above us since you live and since i have seen you again   15.70344174239623
yes chimed in la carconte they will have a wretched night of it   14.472285025222073
do you think he suspects   15.861299020225605
we were all so happy in the chateau de pierrefonds   11.979622268766978
god gave that spectre the form of the count of monte cristo when he at length issued from his tomb enriched him with gold and diamonds and led him to you   14.584061650039944
albert s witnesses looked at each other   10.159579775628483
as soon as he took to flight every one pursued him until pressed on all sides scarron found no way of escaping his escort except by throwing himself into the river   6.871053294476702
ask his lackey how often he has had to prepare lint of him   9.5753355945039
i requested him to call and when i came to the louvre i left orders if he came to desire him to wait   10.489039798724804
exclaimed raoul joyously   10.886288900572623
by the baron himself   9.382984558465122
then turning to noirtier do you hope the assassin will be tried   10.632899668657231
but who then was this man   14.817488249533211
a long cloak of crimson velvet fell in graceful folds from his shoulders disclosing in front the splendid baldric from which was suspended a gigantic rapier   15.602953536966961
had not government better profit by it   7.146308969003417
as he raised his head the woman s face became visible   13.386874403100917
besides said dantès the various circumstances mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to him   9.977676087954173
he has but one fault he is somewhat wilful   8.646103680809055
but he must be disturbed cried the host   9.161879842231366
but fernand instead of responding to this amiable gesture remained mute and trembling   15.763945824456348
the rooms had been fitted up in strict accordance with oriental ideas   7.9425442054991535
left alone she arose   12.50712851573376
as quick as thought he tore open the letter in spite of the cry which kitty uttered on seeing what he was going to do or rather what he was doing   12.3850023314292
being naturally goodhearted and having had once a liking for athos which had grown into a sincere friendship he was delighted at thus meeting a man full of intelligence and moral strength instead of a drunkard   14.63708298312028
and now said the unknown farewell kindness humanity and gratitude   9.578524579466272
every pulse beat with feverish excitement every nerve was strained every vein swollen and every part of his body seemed to suffer distinctly from the rest thus multiplying his agony a thousand fold   14.7097245384379

these two men met at one point and that was cunning   9.159238422680504
but as for me i have been a coward   12.456075820832613
the king was not mistaken   6.315225302408935
we have still fifteen days before us said he to his friends well if at the end of a fortnight i have found nothing or rather if nothing has come to find me as i too good a catholic to kill myself with a pistol bullet i will seek a good quarrel with four of his eminence s guards or with eight englishmen and i will fight until one of them has killed me which considering the number can not fail to happen   11.034790908630754
well valentine said morrel with a sigh we will not discuss the matter further   10.978737585532157
gaetano said he to the captain you tell me monte cristo serves as a refuge for pirates who are it seems to me a very different kind of game from the goats   12.51166222290211

exclaimed an inspector   8.366882559576275
and you did not warn me   18.099736966166812
i am a faithful subject of the king madame and all that his majesty commands i shall do   11.968023328684826
for i assure you on his side he wishes you no good   8.456146360521831
how could i help being astonished when without having the least expectation of such a thing i meet you face to face you of whom we have so often spoken together you whom he loves with all his soul you whom he had taught me to love before i had seen you   12.552619450857733

friend said athos our resolution is irrevocable   13.470450192456324
then he drew his watch from his pocket that he might see how time sped   18.9842639127662
ah count she exclaimed with the delight manifested by every member of the family whenever he visited the rue meslay   14.568336022100228
and now said d artagnan to athos entertain no further doubts about me   9.113606055829052
the delighted builder then offered his services in providing a suitable crew for the little vessel but this dantès declined with many thanks saying he was accustomed to cruise about quite alone and his principal pleasure consisted in managing his yacht himself   14.268792013644024
the horses only arrived at two o clock and the cicerone did not bring the passport till three   11.071254726896338
and as napoleon has scarcely been reinstated a fortnight the letters have not yet been forwarded   13.197995509935046
she ground her teeth inwardly   15.4066527730021
but it is your real name i want to know in the midst of your hundred names that i may pronounce it when we meet to fight at the moment when i plunge my sword through your heart   11.025372520139705
that i have been singularly assisted   10.136554704307917

i will wait until you come out   10.85307554123175
my husband is on the eve of a decisive engagement   11.90902512085123
pray do not call what i consider the wisest action of my life by such a name   11.545784236681936
it was nothing but a plan of attack against the cardinal   13.714389126191488
yet continued the count becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow which mercédès had accepted yet it is impossible that so noble minded a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when i am in the prime of life and strength   13.792166238010116
you told me to wait and hope   10.361103938589581
he left the porter to ponder on these words not knowing which most to admire the master or the servant   13.289585712321427
yes you are right tréville you are right   8.579478179611378
the cardinal was left free to carry on the siege without having at least at the present anything to fear on the part of the english   12.026975143896983
a body of cavaliers is coming toward us said chatillon   14.02799943061791
my sister is happily married   10.421012316636865
the man went silently to each of the candles and blew them out one after the other   10.80564112032102
houses were no longer to be seen   12.67235824746811
dantès remained in his cell all day not daring to return to his friend thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced once for all that the abbé was mad such a conviction would be so terrible   9.65120732793257
where is haydée   16.024755388386176
and besides he considered it most expedient without exhibiting too much ill will to follow to the end his role as confessor   14.558622799168658
but you shall judge for yourself   14.312245648698827
but buckingham in vain tried to make out the writing   12.813639060682702
his majesty in full dress was accompanied by his royal highness m   13.09339351250793
but as before pride prevailed and a second kick split the door from bottom to top   11.720989655663821
well then let us go i must trust to you   15.483755570824503
but it cost me dear   5.870449073914531
i will send word to the governor   8.559300640815046
prince cavalcanti where are you   10.0735366057458
instantly said athos   17.30108946431166
i will compromise myself   9.293553713446022
and we are going to be recompensed for our diligence   8.584294649467388
debray was petrified not only to hear danglars speak so calmly and politely but because it was apparent that beneath outward politeness there really lurked a determined spirit of opposition to anything his wife might wish to do   12.117622741655156
certainly i was not the first captive that had been shut up in this splendid prison   14.180084641449374
he glanced around this second grotto   6.324398928697534
however promise me one thing   16.792409276983882
ah if you could but help me if we could both together defeat their plan   11.556307050289975
he did not see the englishman fold up and place in his pocket the accusation written by danglars under the arbor of la réserve and which had the postmark marseilles 27th february delivery 6 o clock p   10.25601380148225
on her side the lady who from time to time blushed darted with the rapidity of lightning a glance toward the inconstant porthos   14.749319734341626
red with fever while the large drops fell from his brow the man executed one after the other the three signs given by the count in spite of the frightful contortions of the right hand correspondent who not understanding the change began to think the gardener had gone mad   14.490711098879892
when i last drew my poniard   11.351712090112477
ah returned albert in his turn looking around to see what lucien was doing   13.838188911763858
monsieur d artagnan made a compact with you   7.914298911831896
as for us we were three days without anything to eat or drink so that we began to think of drawing lots who should feed the rest when we saw la gironde   10.625704354436195
i never ceased to search and to inquire   11.842171638875147
thereupon the cardinal hearing the clock strike eleven bowed low asking permission of the king to retire and supplicating him to come to a good understanding with the queen   14.348363986900731
the child put the piece of money into his pocket   14.19000765673704
the cardinal smiled as he spoke   13.188790790600436
he had fallen asleep and was in a profound slumber when d artagnan returned   11.931909962646877
it was something terrible to witness the silent agony the mute despair of noirtier whose tears silently rolled down his cheeks   12.112600208231619
your father was fortunate then   12.4510365616329
the period appointed by the testator for the disposal of these riches occurred only a short time ago and they have only been employed by me within the last few years   15.083539905492676
and he began to wander about the room like a man beside himself gesticulating and half drawing his sword out of the scabbard   10.200262816423436
he will say in that case to the king that i am determined on war and that this measure is my first act of hostility against france   12.451075248712486
poor things   15.808812253397642

the two found themselves in a small chapel covered with a tapestry of persian silk worked with gold and brilliantly lighted with a vast number of candles   16.06295077606547

you left it to me to discover the means and i have done so   14.217751428840327
the challenge then continued beauchamp i took advantage of the silence and the darkness to leave the house without being seen   9.069053092064332

the instant she appeared the door keeper rose came to her and asked her whether she was not the person with whom the procureur had made an appointment   10.926099234319029
behind this group walked the surgeon   11.744473251681091

let us visit them all said the inspector   8.908074930161131
for i have no friend but yourself upon earth who am neglected and forgotten by my father harassed and persecuted by my stepmother and left to the sole companionship of a paralyzed and speechless old man whose withered hand can no longer press mine and who can speak to me with the eye alone although there still lingers in his heart the warmest tenderness for his poor grandchild   15.942804614418828
besides here comes the confirmation of my assertion   15.5108763349164

but because she merely spoke in an undertone or my senses were dulled by sleep i did not catch a word she uttered   12.467079170275046
and the young officer shook the count s hand so warmly that monte cristo could not be mistaken as to the sincerity of his joy and he saw that he had been expected with impatience and was received with pleasure   13.751500670099563

coquenard drew the dish toward her skillfully detached the two great black feet which she placed upon her husband s plate cut off the neck which with the head she put on one side for herself raised the wing for porthos and then returned the bird otherwise intact to the servant who had brought it in who disappeared with it before the musketeer had time to examine the variations which disappointment produces upon faces according to the characters and temperaments of those who experience it   14.348272225582472
the two youths looked at each other and at this moment a pistol shot and cries for help were heard   10.87899100294071

scarcely therefore had the reflective franz walked a hundred steps beneath the interior porticoes of the ruin when abandoning albert to the guides who would by no means yield their prescriptive right of carrying their victims through the routine regularly laid down and as regularly followed by them but dragged the unconscious visitor to the various objects with a pertinacity that admitted of no appeal beginning as a matter of course with the lions den the hall of the gladiators and finishing with cæsar s podium to escape a jargon and mechanical survey of the wonders by which he was surrounded franz ascended a half dilapidated staircase and leaving them to follow their monotonous round seated himself at the foot of a column and immediately opposite a large aperture which permitted him to enjoy a full and undisturbed view of the gigantic dimensions of the majestic ruin   10.267373999988132
instead of answering me as a friend you played with me as a child   7.989398299885087
cromwell had given orders that no one was to be allowed admission   5.394043211480241
besides that does not concern the home but the financial department   6.730075935228713
it was friquet s voice   9.496983581962859
these gascons said the cardinal laughing almost beat the italians in effrontery   11.460632609059292
yes yes replied dantès eagerly   10.020692659616524
and after a reconnoissance along the entire line in company with marshal de grammont he had returned and seated himself before a table with his officers around him   12.900464950957566
they advanced silently the count guiding franz as if he had the singular faculty of seeing in the dark   14.238467789558031
now whither do you conduct me   9.069623369276862
his service does not allow him to absent himself more than two or three weeks together   12.184211993768352
porthos brought up the rear and before soldiers officers or colonel had time to recover their surprise all four were in the street   17.61017273963288
where then could he be if he had entered his mother s room and not since returned   11.563037028417758
they fear the ear that hears their orders and the eye that scrutinizes their actions   13.516848193710043
asked maximilian   16.062882331306614
neither dared for some time to speak in that room   9.281290646770966
the ordinary events took place   11.476756480494915
he abandoned the hand of this woman to kiss her feet   13.832211803567242
upon which m   6.606076192977219
come observed the countess smiling i see my vampire is only some millionaire who has taken the appearance of lara in order to avoid being confounded with m   12.75819220994491
the count inquired whether any of the ancient jailers were still there   8.915382539300762
as to porthos oh as to porthos faith that s a droll affair   15.557141991548551
the prisoner is there replied vampa pointing to the hollow space in front of which the bandit was on guard and i will go myself and tell him he is free   14.191745795271277
what if the count should have no time to run to her rescue   13.355702470978253
with regard to myself monsieur de rochefort replied mazarin i am not like monsieur de richelieu all powerful   10.090994176896444
what encouraged me not to become your surety but to patronize you   5.2025949954452475
the detachment now moved toward the town with the royal captive   12.939301132279937
in a corner almost hidden from view were three gentlemen who had preceded athos and aramis and an officer was examining their passports   11.192989238387078
and danglars uniting practice with theory wrote with his left hand and in a writing reversed from his usual style and totally unlike it the following lines which he handed to fernand and which fernand read in an undertone the honorable the king s attorney is informed by a friend of the throne and religion that one edmond dantès mate of the ship pharaon arrived this morning from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo has been intrusted by murat with a letter for the usurper and by the usurper with a letter for the bonapartist committee in paris   13.700016515063048
but never mind that will do capitally   10.985604199095516
and he disappeared   8.438238894422474
de morcerf is arrived and we are at his disposal   10.301852881305127
it was they   13.456501999351438
asked the poor woman have i said anything that has wounded you   18.696091554877817
perhaps monsieur de beaufort will try in his turn to lay hands on us   10.801442182335965
baron send for the minister of war   14.327797769525624
planchet very proud of being raised to the dignity of landlord thought he would make all ready like an intelligent man   11.847845666155946
your fellow countryman bonaparte became emperor   8.376310560678018
i thought perhaps said danglars with supreme impertinence that you had a deficiency to make up   13.524408876390893
i am not allowed to see you madame but you shall every day hear of me   11.743871633900527
d artagnan had not failed in his career but circumstances had been adverse to him   11.212056201371164
as you will replied the duke   15.085795144429774
the young woman spoke with an expression of deep tenderness while the count replied with an air of gentle gravity   6.679366880705643
death is now perhaps striking a fourth blow   13.054690377131315
i must be somewhat altered since he last saw me   9.653739775932127
believe me madame i had entirely forgotten it   15.927929656934493
we have cruelly wounded as you know that personal pride by which d artagnan is blindly governed   15.320059200999474
albert retained his calm and indifferent manner   11.950023186954107
oh my king   12.744628860217382
he was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale and trembling declaring that his son had very nearly been assassinated the day before near the palace   10.01573032583741
on the altar and beneath the portrait was the casket containing the diamond studs   11.056444342650636
was quick to see an opening for attack and won victory at a single thrust   18.169124724323005
said morrel with tearful eyes   7.582782878777683
i intend going there soon and since you allow me i will pay you a visit   9.251413202490099
replied the dying man with an accent of gratitude impossible to describe   19.11256611302968
oh had he been my own son replied bertuccio or even my nephew i would have brought him back to the right road for the knowledge that you are doing your duty gives you strength but the idea that i was striking a child whose father i had killed made it impossible for me to punish him   7.668177270793183
perhaps they bring us peace and liberty   7.155869744244706
the fourth was to return to béthune in order to inform athos and serve as a guide to the four friends   7.675074308968398
is it then that young man whom my friend the count of monte cristo has received into his house and who is going to marry mademoiselle danglars   13.747751063755041
why in the first place i gave you fifty   13.787087573620255
it is not the queen with whom the people are displeased   11.649383999404563
he exclaimed raising his hands to heaven   7.778197683354685
they again disputed the road   10.695839010308418
exactly answered the musketeer   15.564282459676296
yes such a one as would be made by the grazing of a ball   12.331379226585122
the axe an ingenious device and well worthy of those who know not what a gentleman is   17.28707280638793
planchet shook his head with the air of a man who says in that case things look ill   12.236157749741055
thank you parry   12.417102166323398
still more the light which had shone for an instant disappeared and all was again in obscurity   12.668597229112784
a presentiment instantly told d artagnan that this carriage contained the person who had appointed the rendezvous   13.164609429982233
you gave him three sword wounds in three separate engagements   8.636982827509582
these words carried a ray of hope into fernand s heart   10.294760394007767
tis a very strong post he resumed and we have forty good men tried soldiers having no connection with frondeurs nor any interest in the fronde   9.826234485275762
where is there any to be found   10.106222155128776
i am going to beauchamp in whose journal this paragraph appears and i shall insist on his retracting the assertion before two witnesses   12.035676690914972
bernajoux at your service   19.033864594687472
tell me cried danglars in a tone whose bitterness harpagon30 alone has been capable of revealing tell me that you wish to despoil me of all   7.544906926751086
i am on the point of starting on a journey replied morrel disdainfully   9.75749271414981
would it not be better to intrust one of the men to set fire to the train   8.658447398718282
no his horse   10.335574295926268
the thieves looked at one another with low murmurs and a storm gathered over the head of the aristocratic prisoner raised less by his own words than by the manner of the keeper   12.352200208599251
this was his second interview with richelieu and he afterward confessed that he felt well assured it would be his last   4.457739775589843
but who then is this assassin this murderer   5.13831057993452
yes admirable   13.68300979847983
asked athos when he had closed the letter   10.0854808739339
and as for your poor arm what difference will that make   10.325835241688814
ah said mousqueton breathing more freely you are only going then to make a visit   12.840310373401893
andrea extended his hand   10.970414622966981
divan walls ceiling floor were all covered with magnificent skins as soft and downy as the richest carpets   21.269346651447094
i do not know what reason government can assign for these useless visits   13.912463038350442
and what did your father say then valentine   18.046108664191927
cried d artagnan your leader is dead   9.977168434368615
teresa saw herself rich superbly attired and attended by a train of liveried domestics   14.634562346749192
madame replied athos i have only to ask your majesty s prayers   6.068863586695485
greet each other then   7.580805722628761
but besides these eight men you doubtless place some guard outside   15.04809896099701
i thought i did replied athos   10.377915179881496
ah sir exclaimed cocles what can it mean   8.83821105517239
at any rate tell me there s more chance of fighting in paris is there not   11.075346949398485
therefore madame i ask you to look not among your friends of to day but among those of other times   18.765486598953338
i tell you he ll go like the wind only tell me which way to drive   12.471207599167549
vampa looked at albert with a kind of admiration   11.00440811648324
but you are deceived edmond she continued   14.90305276961681
benedetto could read write and cipher perfectly for when the fit seized him he learned more in a day than others in a week   9.493126752846132
do you know him personally   14.69127234634644
the rest ordines inferiores of the ecclesiastical hierarchy bless in the name of the holy archangels and angels   9.744235568969806
while saying this he looked at his friend with an earnestness that embarrassed him   17.08863705996667
franz introduced me to her at rome replied albert   13.202146421863159
i am indeed most wretched replied mercédès   16.940717479203094
vampa then rushed towards teresa   11.311018958227788
besides courage was out of the question here   9.061656882993347
the visitor either understood the abbé s meaning or had no more questions to ask   13.547076581048401
tis well said d artagnan holding out his hand to receive the money   15.590246503343927
the executioner uttered the first cry that terrible cry which had been first heard   11.995339005047585
said he and shall i never succeed in overcoming the old leaven   11.5390966834637
yes but where   13.022526867311367
and leaving his young man compatriot in the embrasure of the window where they had talked together he seated himself at a table in order to write the promised letter of recommendation   10.402830940263419
the general appeared to be affected by a nervous tremor which prevented his answering for some moments   16.95054049237387
can you not tell me his name   16.830084161323455
there is no word though it should come from the profoundest depth of my heart that can express my gratitude   13.841945610476069
rather sir before we sit down i must demand your answer   12.610161277062788
in one of these risings the duc de beaufort pillaged the house and library of mazarin in order to give the populace as he put it something to gnaw at   10.17176382994799
there is no great merit due to me for we were informed of it   7.960847583363433
he is the son of one of my oldest friends the son of a man who served under the king your father of glorious memory in the civil war   9.475794154269888
danglars retreated a step or two   14.29781643827268
it is men who drive me to death   11.13308295455549
i beg your pardon sir said the honest fellow in almost breathless haste but i believe you made a mistake   5.434450709300091
yes said maximilian i recollect the project of which i highly approved   10.802257567913298
porthos lent him his back and d artagnan was soon on the summit of the wall where he seated himself   11.914130423880886
may i beg of you baroness to honor me with an introduction to your daughter   13.48958112149342
if d artagnan forgets his host or appears to forget him under the pretense of not knowing where he has been carried we will not forget him and we know where he is   15.013853603212887
my friend said she how came you here   14.41011514022318
do you really think so   10.664143067513088
noirtier which has become gradually accustomed to it would be sufficient to kill another person   12.217184908285224
you always say trifles my dear athos   15.110959178065833
one thing above all the rest heightened the respect nay almost the veneration of danglars for cavalcanti   8.468136372838917
almost an impossibility replied the major   10.919089608236174
oh pardon me pardon me   9.153425023189236
yes moderately so   15.133942935442178
the treasure of the spadas exists   15.192403599061846
not so the servants hungry and more thirsty than hungry   11.442531740566562
i was utterly overpowered by surprise and terror   12.866286006040685
i have but one question to ask you what do you intend to do   18.247250488057126
and yet in all this the cardinal had not yet said a word about the duke of buckingham   14.47830187874499
do you not suspect this young man of having given bad counsel   17.50846508640517
grimaud bowed   9.071370639497875
villefort could not believe his eyes he could not believe his reason   8.656972893908296
we must go out   10.44760020549801
i acted in a similar way to you and you also deceived me   12.373072993121284
that is what i hoped   10.494018819301363
he was too late   10.964151590033019
what was there in it   7.4042930136024605
then enclosing monte cristo s receipt in a little pocket book he added yes come at twelve o clock   12.304674027647053
we can not fight with such names   12.582547369831612
some evidence required from us perhaps   11.947464400718133
he stopped therefore trembling not for himself but for the poor woman who had evidently exposed herself to great danger by appointing this rendezvous   8.394173268416262
very good said groslow and opened the door of the room   9.929968555418164
and when a child i often played with the son in the timber yards   7.027787823172877
you killed my father   11.693667152584478
are you mad uncle   18.756453844424122
milady appeared to have entirely recovered   12.000349282332262
i was just beginning the soup and you will dine with me   15.03391070287423
we discoursed a long time madame on different subjects   12.8124582102077
athos threw himself into d artagnan s arms   10.99869439601065
the lease was drawn up for three six or nine years by the new tenant who according to the rule of the proprietor paid six months in advance   8.980206171488755
then of what other scourge are you afraid my dear blacas   11.824884118720686
the secret cave the sun had nearly reached the meridian and his scorching rays fell full on the rocks which seemed themselves sensible of the heat   15.737308331420252
blacas let it be your care to see that the brevet is made out and sent to m   12.692708575485545
now i thank you for the pleasure you give me in thus affording me the opportunity of thanking you as i have blessed you from the bottom of my heart   12.375741771206998
my precautions were taken   10.18802965531418
his political predecessor as he himself was the predecessor of robespierre he repeated this maxim of tristan s gossip divide in order to reign   13.15408026452825
my private ambition tends only to the profit of him who has justice on his side   11.775439933472626
i believed him still at brussels   9.968449344963563
he was captured again and conducted to the low and vaulted chamber in which ornano puylaurens and his uncle had died   13.091203506067895
take twenty five of them aramis and give me the remaining twenty five   9.723881128087005
ah that is another case   11.969059892666772
noirtier also have fallen a victim had not the treatment he has been pursuing for the last three years neutralized the effects of the poison   11.143928933690182
oh your excellency   11.924088678334408
and will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry except as a last resort   8.237068287467931
for a week since he had resolved to die and during the four days that he had been carrying out his purpose edmond had not spoken to the attendant had not answered him when he inquired what was the matter with him and turned his face to the wall when he looked too curiously at him   14.622524741221895
athos pointed to the bastion   13.08079066016332
escape chapter lix   8.178751747979407
fire upon them   12.335437661466894
i was waiting for you sir said mordaunt raising his head and casting at his opponent a look it would be impossible to describe   16.151549738893937
smiled as she advanced to meet a man she hated and despised   9.616526282547856
if you wish to know anything tell me and i will ask her   9.807687823361604
better fare if you pay for it books and leave to walk about   11.448357941065591
he knows my tastes my caprices my wants   9.849174280642789
what matters really not only to me but to officers of justice and the king is that an innocent man should languish in prison the victim of an infamous denunciation to die here cursing his executioners   6.268142718787055
and 100 000 francs for a lady and gentleman to be properly instructed in music and dancing are not too much   15.111834693686104
he exclaimed oh   13.380650581956974
before felton replied and before she should be forced to resume this conversation so difficult to be sustained in the same exalted tone she let her hands fall   11.741059582785697
but presently the exempt s face suddenly brightened   17.562269624230538
do you know who carried off your wife   10.848292967741738
d artagnan found the musketeer dressed and ready to go out   10.84733886005298
maximilian goes with me said the count in his kindest and most persuasive manner   7.6017350737708735
trust me said aramis do not expect to find anything in abbeville   8.370495325219943
who sent you   12.308187354801852
but then what can have led to the quarrel between danglars and debray   13.916910045806492
thank you i have just returned from sea   8.893271750281016
from amongst these vegetables he selected the most simple a cabbage for instance   8.68093485857338
he was a very contrary fellow and might come back on purpose to have us hanged   11.491607534759398
le chevalier dessessart thus received four instead of one when it admitted d artagnan   11.2086370964801
at his door he perceived a figure in the shadow that seemed to wait for him   14.458314382731094
the little hand was then immediately withdrawn and the young man saw valentine hurrying towards the house as though she were almost terrified at her own sensations   4.538488498316005
i shall probably kill you the fourth said he to him holding out his hand to assist him to rise   14.968023232622377
but somehow the poor old man had contracted a profound hatred for fernand the very person added caderousse with a bitter smile that you named just now as being one of dantès faithful and attached friends   8.525034776342212
yes continued the curate apparently accustomed to this tone yes we wish to know your opinion of the events of to day and what you have heard said by people going in and out of the church   11.110513754366705
that s well monsieur de tréville said the cardinal   12.659001547679075
i will do whatever is necessary   11.42374345453964
in that case i can comprehend the length of the conversation   8.390956422152403
but she reflected that she would be totally lost if she confessed having assisted in such a machination and above all that d artagnan would also be lost to her forever   14.074311043573234
some of the apartments were closed within and without   10.367923317654572
now we discover our error   15.684195137379271
bonacieux without any suspicion accompanied her   11.437218169463977
ma foi said danglars it would not be a bad speculation i fancy and you know i am a speculator   10.913678032734769
the face of the shortest of those three gentlemen   10.627626441313906
though alone against all and with a wound in his thigh bicarat wished to hold out   13.66369799869721
there seated before a walnut table he had brought with him from hartwell and to which from one of those fancies not uncommon to great people he was particularly attached the king louis xviii   16.115419198729054
a moment cried d artagnan making them a sign to replace in the scabbard their half drawn swords   11.985695536857316
we can positively assert that his majesty did not quit the pont neuf   15.69100068134151
whence then will come the help we need from chance   10.730249152221974
20203m no excellency   14.45044797086658
the year 1829 returned jacopo   19.366969953728777
they needed breakfast and alighted at the door of an auberge recommended by a sign representing st   12.29669239446334
the gig was already lowered and in it were four oarsmen and a coxswain   12.228925223122655
what are you thinking about   11.312510647545112
you do not know her replied the stranger   11.989391289830204
but albert did not know that it takes a day to see saint peter s and a month to study it   11.063664495872867
raoul mounted his horse and both leisurely took their way to the rue tiquetonne   8.976847370612468
then turning to the governor observed he will become religious he is already more gentle   8.345899429176413
perhaps not replied danglars   13.479516144630374
do you not think that i also long for forgetfulness   13.351347782352489
be assured you will not find her majesty ungrateful   16.928674546423892
does he often go to auteuil   11.321878299786047
monte cristo drew him in gently   16.215728960575696
there only remains then the question of the five shillings to be settled   11.471908306523506
at last as albert was looking at his watch for about the hundredth time at the beginning of the second act the door opened and monte cristo entered dressed in black and leaning over the front of the box looked around the pit   11.926269352913861
de la trémouille returned to his hôtel and immediately sent word to the four friends that he awaited their company at dinner   10.481516168685198
therefore in departing from this rule i should as the actors say be playing a part quite out of my line and should therefore run the risk of being hissed which would be an act of folly   6.394832182473318
badly monsieur badly   11.751412337080659
danglars intended travelling to venice where he would receive one part of his fortune and then proceeding to vienna where he would find the rest he meant to take up his residence in the latter town which he had been told was a city of pleasure   7.274993789551118
you did not see her   10.132767874451666
one was perfectly charming delicate pensive shaded by beautiful dark hair and eyes soft as velvet like those lovely flowers the heartsease in which shine out the golden petals   20.24084630147083
d artagnan and athos to the bastille   14.96333062240896
exclaimed the queen joyfully   14.12717974936999
at the bois de boulogne ennui and hunger attacked me at once two enemies who rarely accompany each other and who are yet leagued against me a sort of carlo republican alliance   12.486328713542152
on what   9.419904752309538
monsieur aramis is not an officer   12.43266009314971
the two friends having agreed to leave blaisois and grimaud at compiegne with the horses resolved to take post horses   14.713490806277765
ah ha cried danglars this fellow is more like an ogre than anything else   10.823990675000722
more rapidly than thought he darted down the rue matignon and thence to the avenue des champs élysées   17.988714645868694
and perhaps his saddle therewith   10.54564739827521
her glassy eyes had no longer their sight   12.178269714523992
as this was the height of d artagnan s worldly ambition apart be it well understood from his desire of finding mme   10.267924687467914
shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour   13.40759404790454
let them be off and return to their own country there to hide their shame if its hills are high enough   10.574713968282964
but i said d artagnan can go and inform monsieur laporte   15.82082782176953
think if i am found out here the people of the house who have not seen me enter it will take me for a thief   10.902505841535575
five minutes had sufficed to make a complete transformation in his appearance   13.894105862335312
if there was a beautiful lily or a sweet rose you had to search for it concealed in some corner behind a mother with a turban or an aunt with a bird of paradise   10.457529512922994
excuse me gentlemen said morrel but i do not see m   13.573281848013643
the look of the minister of police was turned with concentrated spite on villefort who bent his head in modest triumph   11.639767276731947
who stopped him   8.718999989465946
you here   17.426310000057345
i heard it from m   10.56204226954747
sire it is fatality   18.245313221247603
and they separated with courteous gestures   6.235206486419191
this may appear to you to be no unusual combination of circumstances   9.158566897960565
the result was that the proud look entirely failed of its purpose   11.511445281108717
be ready said porthos as he slipped through the opening   7.961210436795859
he makes a sign to the postillion and we set off at a gallop   9.714608517530781
nothing broken   7.976668875003642
but if you deliver me up to your masters i have near at hand avengers who will make you pay dearly for my death   12.433132808283547
do your excellencies still wish for a carriage from now to sunday morning   10.36150741062681
my master will go to dinner   9.070660766657921
oh as to that sir replied chatillon for it was he who with flamarens was leaving the duc de beaufort you may be assured   13.970589555443208
morrel again changed color   15.695192135810967
i can easily suppose sir that her majesty has forgotten it amid the fetes and the courtiers of the palais royal but i who have passed those years in the bastile ah   11.840590625524593
valentine screamed   11.612168895899114
the four musketeers went to work   13.571440988176578
there is not a hope replied faria shaking his head but no matter   13.077838220618723
not my own wish mother but reason necessity   15.919347104986688
mercédès sighed   15.726469549695224
he looked around for a chimney from which no smoke issued and having reached it he disappeared through the orifice without being seen by anyone   10.753251309177836
suppose that when everything was in readiness and the moment had come for god to look upon his work and see that it was good suppose he had snuffed out the sun and tossed the world back into eternal night then even then mercédès you could not imagine what i lose in sacrificing my life at this moment   11.782337814003021
i depend upon your word my lord   9.22923810884529
20075m you would accept   12.149466947104736
yes to a convent   9.257273985374155
i do not think it i am certain of it   9.656066405870355
let us hear the history said franz motioning signor pastrini to seat himself   11.699083963201732
merely because one might have died carelessly answered monte cristo   6.65708508059206
the perspiration stood in drops upon his forehead   18.439152849517225
there was the crime bertuccio that was where you became really culpable   16.573657905616066
believe me you ought now to take a rest   7.242946083878834
provisions began to fail and whenever one of the prince de conti s generals wished to gain more influence he got up a little popular tumult which he put down again and thus for the moment gained a superiority over his colleagues   11.72463315012136
no sire but i am hourly expecting one   7.2852040775944795
your note of this morning has completely bewildered me   11.460060526836314
at the expiration of a year the governor was transferred   11.27572277617468
and if betrays that hope to death we can aspire   7.227552039899782
madame said the cardinal affecting an effusive frankness of speech i shall convince your majesty i trust of my devotion to you and my desire to terminate an affair which you have so much at heart   9.365392751091221
do you not perceive that i know all your abduction from the little house at st   11.139653521466077
i never had one   6.1942459622827775
nay i know not   11.345155632018354
said athos trying to smile in his turn   9.850136052134946
de tréville if at the bottom of all this they had not felt it was the great love he bore them which made him speak thus   7.083052433138687
why did you not accept it   13.872834888683618
i can not stop a moment   13.007860507080721
de guiche might have been about eighteen years of age but he was scarcely taller than raoul who was only fifteen   9.923645127724328
athos pale as a ghost repeated these words to the man who seeing the bodeful preparations that were making put himself in an attitude of defense   12.402213512720207
here it is at last he said not without some trouble though   8.724422812533827
and despite his confidence on the paternal admonitions he felt himself carried by his tastes and led by his instincts to praise rather than to blame the unheard of things which were taking place   12.68368978112594
a brute that cardinal   11.64861747459237
felton   10.614559579055317
20121m that night a memorable event occurred due no doubt to the imprudence of some servant who had neglected to extinguish the lights   9.788527635968654
come instantly pray come   13.548490263231491
we must pursue them said groslow they can t be gone far and we will sink them passing over them   11.241944571841133
and i am to take off the first one when i have reached a certain place   9.247222444040933
and you think you are avenged because you send a ball through the head or pass a sword through the breast of that man who has planted madness in your brain and despair in your heart   12.85922668764168
from that day d artagnan felt lonely and powerless without courage to pursue a career in which he could only distinguish himself on condition that each of his three companions should endow him with one of the gifts each had received from heaven   16.57228013021688
well then athos porthos aramis and d artagnan forward   9.345068518254202
an excellent idea   12.403935711813245
from him and from my friend the comte de rochefort   10.397555673146288
yes replied maximilian an englishman who represented himself as the confidential clerk of the house of thomson french at rome   11.354552909675194
caderousse more and more astonished went toward a large oaken cupboard opened it and gave the abbé a long purse of faded red silk round which were two copper runners that had once been gilt   13.298469305204794
is she your daughter   8.985774704224864
old age is selfish sir and mademoiselle de villefort has been a faithful companion to m   7.761867746613254
he will feel obliged to make some little speech to the cousin and the three young men drew near to listen   6.955080299559814
albert was not deceived for the next evening franz saw him enter triumphantly shaking a folded paper which he held by one corner   8.473882031262105
and madame de saint méran incurred his displeasure so he poured out three drops of his elixir three drops were sufficient   12.479183513834988
i have that permission said the gentleman drawing the paper from his pocket   11.331037901899304
he knelt down just opposite the chapel in order not to lose sight of his man   12.893181102376712
debray conveyed the count s reply to the baroness   14.718941050812429
luigi vampa replied the shepherd with the same air as he would have replied alexander king of macedon   9.326910362625803
and if i did your tone is too high   17.842971317527162
in the first place let us agree that the word poison does not exist because in medicine use is made of the most violent poisons which become according as they are employed most salutary remedies   11.138464733752157
a good journey gentlemen   7.939473049824121
at one of these encounters accidentally or purposely albert s mask fell off   12.049612692944779
to no one by heaven   5.651134625828812
so then sir said morrel you hold bills of mine   15.879383641155913
where did he lodge   12.07684423700732
clearly said d artagnan we must go where they will not look for us   15.085313745678292
but all seemed unanimous in doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding condescension could possibly be intended   15.752888834985932
and lord de winter ranged himself by the side of d artagnan leaving the place free for another accuser   12.146412638614184
no no i am aware you know me   13.71185558601467
he could not distinguish her countenance but a sinister smile passed over the lips of athos   11.023492071181654
they announced to all their comrades that they had seen the king and that the queen had spoken to them   13.513715146495546
my faith said aramis i must confess i feel a great repugnance to fire on these poor devils of civilians   16.56749013042087
whereas tis very possible that between the castle and the convent we shall sleep on hard beds dying with hunger and thirst   13.189105880203524
he was alone in the darkness with sailors whom he did not know and who had no reason to be devoted to him   7.504916782599124
do you know where i shall find him   16.244619083051727
morrel hesitated to advance   11.640276387213044
how is it concealed   10.22293953719884
so that you could without trouble convert these tongs into a hoop and yonder shovel into a corkscrew   12.114747051204981
that is it   10.42170607006163
with pleasure   11.88580747493075
do you wish to go to m   4.695215731734681
as i was weeping and begging on the high road a minister from kingston took me in instructed me in the calvinistic faith taught me all he knew himself and aided me in my researches after my family   12.55603702020785
d artagnan began to be touched   9.929266534733554
don t alarm yourself my little benedetto but just point out to me some means of gaining those thirty thousand francs without your assistance and i will contrive it   12.088270693111571
oh don t let that disturb you cried mme   10.54864731144796
i only ask you to examine my position as if it were your own and then judge for yourself   14.94310695707601
if i had known that i was to have the honor of your visit i should have procured the gardener s ladder   12.897022935154824
de montbazon and mme   14.976903951627145
that night brought together all those comrades of the guards of m   12.717575869612281
it was now cromwell s turn to look fixedly at mordaunt and mordaunt to make himself impenetrable   10.220114848581906
and whilst d artagnan uttered a cry porthos raised the oar and aramis sought a place to strike a frightful shake given to the boat precipitated athos into the sea   12.57970902996165
as the clock struck eight they drove up to the place of meeting   14.124748502309298
mazarin followed the direction of his eyes and gently turned the hoop of the ring inside   14.318969323127751
speak loud very loud for they will be listening at the door   10.895401831441445
hold your tongue hypocrite said andrea   12.058827594593359
well no madame this is the terrible news i have to tell you said villefort in a hollow voice no nothing was found beneath the flowers   13.73266798402724
none of the lads of pampinara palestrina or valmontone had been able to gain any influence over him or even to become his companion   14.758148379586164
today the preliminaries tomorrow or next day the ceremony   15.992881939778954
just as he turned a hand rested on his shoulder and a voice which made him shudder exclaimed good evening maximilian   9.995169119263274
the dying man collected all his forces   10.692494031625458
well said porthos arrange the table mousqueton and while we breakfast d artagnan will relate to us what has happened to him during the ten days since he left us   11.424424881525788
40086m well baron said he here i am at last   11.646350344221547
to be sure to see you   7.990414948587068
and as to loving me much i have my own opinion as to that love   14.054452433347375
he has been sent by cromwell to mazarin and the queen guessed rightly   12.018229067951571
your excellency is perfectly right in so thinking said the man   12.877077225780466
we can therefore use up four horses as well as one   14.911380051167896
supposing this person wearied at the inefficacy of the poison should as monte cristo intimated have recourse to steel   11.13086814130841
madame de villefort was in deep thought yet listened attentively   5.75751644098848
en route monsieur d artagnan said the cardinal   13.845048136753533
you have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying sir have you   15.951862354846941
noirtier seating himself i might say the same thing to you when you announce to me your wedding for the 28th of february and on the 3rd of march you turn up here in paris   9.712693434031582
then adieu valentine   9.202048213425421
exclaimed d artagnan with a look of astonishment what danger   14.534345186518067
or rather tell him nothing   10.409633356913421
another reigns in her name   11.61351754720046
at the left of the opening was a dark and deep angle   8.667492811790297
provided he can get money out of the people that is all he wants   8.87208925758237
i thought for a long time that he was dumb   11.525209150049877
fifty thousand francs a year said porthos   11.455458687603889
gave him   11.656237552662555
they advanced fifty paces farther and then stopped to open a door then went forward again   19.336951744356266
on the other bank replied the executioner   16.419409995364425
nowadays the military profession is in abeyance and the magisterial robe is the badge of honor   13.777433172326344
there are tears in your eyes   13.459773517657908
i know he can not save my life but he may strengthen me to give my evidence   13.440750745134205
he cried no boat   14.265203374796744
said d artagnan what did i tell you   10.664765202706679
you have understood me then dear monsieur d artagnan said milady   9.576606104145178
no my boy no said caderousse   11.934602310047527
one of the sailors got down the side of the ship seized the cable and drew it   13.467152736107005
only that   17.02472857090818
doubtless they are bad since they have not determined minds so just as yours   12.642652788953782
there is a proposition almost like it in the augustinus of the heresiarch jansenius whose book will sooner or later be burned by the hands of the executioner   18.20493604804195
for i saw her where she now sits the very first night of the season and since then she has never missed a performance   14.463955754383187
d artagnan burst out laughing at the idea   15.349973615524778
in vain did he see a man start from the shadow when he was halfway down in vain did he see an arm raised as he touched the ground   11.505228829930468
murmured the old man clasping edmond s hand convulsively adieu   13.302473529164722
then the musketeers for two and twenty years staunch friends of d artagnan   9.944120670009692
some voices were heard to say that the gentleman was right   12.838266164414229
placed where he was d artagnan could not perceive the face of aramis   14.783755629428168
i am said i the little abbé who reads lives of the saints and translates judith into verse   15.929248754553697
well i hope you will make a handsome wedding present the day you marry mademoiselle danglars   9.55839593663729
the 21st of september will therefore be the conclusion of the term agreed on and till that time arrives and it is the advice of a gentleman which i am about to give you till then we will refrain from growling and barking like two dogs chained within sight of each other   13.646455895320434
it then seems as if my hand grew heavy as if the cutlass was still in its grasp as if the water had the color of blood and all the voices of nature the whispering of the trees the murmur of the wind the lapping of the wave united in a voice tearful despairing terrible crying to me place for the justice of god   18.472945668772198
we bear witness to this said porthos and aramis in the same manner as before   7.855674954291192
if they go out to day as they did yesterday we shall have the honor then of seeing them in half an hour   13.841857678767745
whilst this went on porthos arrived with a very cross look on his face and was astonished to find the lieutenant resigned and mousqueton almost merry   13.676426200555884
it is easier and less noisy than the door   13.45044047466699
noirtier and let him tell you if ever once during that time he has entertained a thought which he was unable to make me understand   12.376599679402366
say there is no need why dantès should die   10.327852119766366
i have no seconds on my part monsieur said d artagnan   12.526504449060864
for the last week m   12.155480934018794
monte cristo shrugged his shoulders   12.15531722234928
he is a soldier and obeys all constitutional authority   11.586358655399577
a glass of wine will be extremely welcome   11.797207046213252
one of your ancestors had joined the crusades and supposing it to be only that of st   15.673510728205162
the dragoon and the swiss followed him and all their comrades followed the dragoon and the swiss   12.781597834625916
if he be acknowledged as sovereign of france he should be upheld in peace and tranquillity   16.332498641618557
teresa returned it all this with the consent of the chief who was in the carriage   13.03002725196445
she is about to appoint some rendezvous of which she had not courage to speak   8.214170422154938
are you a friend of villefort s   14.42771751369756
no you will be deprived of that pleasure   11.714639249946412
there are no extravagant hopes but for fools monsieur and you are a man of understanding   6.620763354071548
was the cry in every direction   11.375828327860988
augustine and gall have made in verse and prose the comparison you have made and yet i can well understand that a father s sufferings may effect great changes in the mind of a son   6.455167824761548
then he mentally added still my unknown protector   11.172210788985662
she will advise him in the same letter to get rid of his two friends aramis and porthos at the same time   8.766491305340066
but i am really glad to have seen such a sight   16.34612712114669
the englishman was an original   8.522142398788727
the islands of tiboulen and lemaire are a league from the château d if   8.458916583261392
now madame danglars feared eugénie s sagacity and the influence of mademoiselle d armilly   10.78781375307911
returned the old man what hast thou done   13.625428537595948
but for such an expedition we surely ought to have brought our muskets   13.547316050864021
yes his death   10.708509784671513
luckily the captain understood his business   10.18649265373044
why then should it be less daring in the future   7.5480256127736585
he went away directly he saw me enter the ball room to find you   7.397129933501542
what am i to do   13.404172475127641
the next moment d artagnan was on his way to notre dame   12.909332404664536
on the contrary from a firm conviction   16.643573279544366
fortune is precarious   13.122294187254612
you are four gentlemen said athos and we are four   7.649199038496575
tomorrow for instance he is going to spend the day and night there   11.502187963736509
he now saw where the breastplate was weak and prepared the blow   9.92064683390189
d artagnan was not the man ever to cry for quarter   12.377344398499861
then in order that he might have nothing to reproach himself with he directed his steps for the last time toward the residences of his three friends   12.896386686268118
i believe not   13.105801089038374
to morrow we shall retake lens and beat the enemy   12.876425767541043
but continued aramis bazin is a well trained servant and seeing that i was not alone he discreetly retired   14.502849665011304
they might be said to be a procession of ghosts for they were all wrapped in white cloaks   12.179313591188082
on the contrary i think it very easy   12.813092987135068
he drew back the bolt of his door and almost directly an old lady entered unannounced carrying her shawl on her arm and her bonnet in her hand   9.979620627976622
aramis was saying his prayers in a charming little book of hours bound in blue velvet   5.371668593086456
while d artagnan was examining mme   12.623399825562647
can you be a coward   11.265415593168282
this is his description benedetto condemned at the age of sixteen for five years to the galleys for forgery   11.704703127464434
i have an extraordinary means which i will not employ but in the last extremity to close your mouth or at least to prevent anyone from believing a word you may utter   7.851011462049804
the two cavalcanti opened their enormous eyes but had the good sense not to say anything   10.676443859088241
you are sure he will keep his word with me   13.20892295957628
you are a lieutenant   10.842321131085468
well so much the better said the supercargo   9.596149697532477
the young lady went towards madame morrel   16.000463085808907
the instant debray had touched the ground he was at the carriage door   13.052843339472597
may i promise your custom to the successor of father marteau my lord   12.016044674730407
i have believed it was much easier to descend from the whole to a part than to ascend from a part to the whole   9.86378692779191
in one hand she held her handkerchief with which she appeared to be wiping her face and in the other a bottle of english smelling salts   12.204910480805651
you can now have confidence in me after what i have done   11.960735578577504
while porthos and mousqueton were breakfasting with the appetites of convalescents and with that brotherly cordiality which unites men in misfortune d artagnan related how aramis being wounded was obliged to stop at crèvecœur how he had left athos fighting at amiens with four men who accused him of being a coiner and how he d artagnan had been forced to run the comtes de wardes through the body in order to reach england   8.524913058350302
you have already answered the question once but so vaguely that i venture to put it a second time   15.02665980995635
well thought d artagnan poor athos is perhaps at this moment dead and dead by my fault for it was i who dragged him into this affair of which he did not know the origin of which he is ignorant of the result and from which he can derive no advantage   20.998130784062603
he appeared to foresee all to divine all to anticipate all   9.581843674128834
i desire to know what is the meaning of this   12.790820972118059
cried milady forgetting her usual presence of mind   17.750341206918012
bartolomeo cavalcanti joyfully replied the italian   13.105278009148421
upon which he offered to take cavalcanti in his carriage to the hôtel des princes if it would not be depriving him of the company of his son   11.760343628499212
you are thinking i am sure of some kind speech to console me but do not utter it to me reserve it for others more worthy of your kindness   18.763446504605056
he saw from what fountainhead the ferocious hopes of the young man arose and he put his hand to the hilt of his sword   11.362591824327032
too true too true   12.102402363078278
aramis had eight of them   8.930379138112091
i did not perceive that there were three of us   11.115553377382257
so there is no chance of my escaping   10.859374808909468
but the abbess contented herself with listening and smiling without replying a word   9.13296022527494
you are a soldier and if you remain at the catalans it is because there is no war   11.052897894992075
but in my opinion and i have a right to dictate the preliminaries as it is i who have received the provocation in my opinion the time ought not to be yet   8.848965776888246
monte cristo pressed on that pure beautiful forehead a kiss which made two hearts throb at once the one violently the other secretly   12.534201042788228
but to his great surprise carlini arrived almost as soon as himself   4.833943839711779
i will say continued the count that he followed and watched you the whole time and when he saw you leave the house ran to the angle of the wall to conceal himself   7.6690358897869295
my death then will not be to her as the death of a stranger   13.573361191503423
the count advanced to meet him   11.721831709218026
milady shuddered through her whole system   9.904270734853192
try to spend it all   10.028085172670998
how many rounds do they make a night   13.017251499415387
i should say that you were the happiest man alive at this instant   13.629041140041148
we have made a wager a wager which could not have been foreseen and of which i defy anyone to divine the true cause   8.92557159992046
certainly i will do so said the young man with a quickness which gave proof of his ready invention   11.229951659842902
namely that four years afterwards this colossus of power would be overthrown   8.251550561232436
very well said the prince   10.097009162733045
and despite the rouge with which her face was covered evidently turned pale and then and then   8.22669139480464
and there was a morrel who served in the same regiment with me when i was in garrison at valence   17.25610533307708
keep your secret young man and tell me what you wish   12.241186711988775
at the door they found the carriage   10.40418788599256
god grants me the boon of vision unrestricted by time or space   10.023341408842686
cried mercédès shuddering   16.129438404142455
let us say in passing that he had changed his baldric and relinquished his cloak   11.364992964319013
yes monsieur and it was he who taught me to lay a snare and ground a line   7.549845216504613
yes my lord and from pure devotion to the cause for monsieur de bracieux is rich   8.310457082626932
but now we must part   7.88033915961559
my sister is in the garden plucking the dead roses   9.404978400356974
at this instant the favorite attendant of madame danglars entered the boudoir   13.093491145831969
there is still hope   15.101680949802077
fortunately i have them though said monte cristo   12.909666840073616
the old man recognized his child and carlini recognized the old man   17.364043016347708
the violins began to sound with all their might but nobody listened to them   13.478256815110152
lord monsieur   11.227144075618128
yes you talk like a child i repeat the word   12.108170184937007
and this this is my fortune not chimerical but actual   10.498775035725433
i did not know that replied m   13.081042734268179
some straw they said   7.176478793640875
don t you know me   14.68356624974105
germain in company with athos porthos and aramis to whom d artagnan had often remarked this   18.72224844358273
perhaps you never before noticed him   13.345580750896511
it s the same thing cried the young woman   19.323686484731404
thought porthos casting a glance at the three hungry clerks for the errand boy as might be expected was not admitted to the honors of the magisterial table in my cousin s place i would not keep such gourmands   8.210212353618253
make use of it then whenever you think it will be most useful for my eldest son s welfare   14.438788507881219
i understand the nature of your alarms madame said the count carefully examining the child but i assure you there is not the slightest occasion for uneasiness   17.07371489067306
monte cristo gave him a glass of water   14.47884865551301
why should i risk an imprudent step   10.710953459276183
the cardinal took a key from his bureau and opening the door of a secret stair descended into the court of the palais royal   11.684329652695522
in fact at the same instant four shots were fired and the balls were flattened against the wall around athos but not one touched him   8.155109054916357
and madame de villefort and sometimes i confess i have gone so far as to try to read in his eyes whether he was in possession of the secret of our love   10.183505802302465
but since you possess that virtue why the devil don t you make use of it with respect to her majesty   12.905334408682805
de boville the inspector of prisons to whom they are due   10.15316212953534
bazin looked down and started as if he had seen a serpent   12.500211827264186
out of the twenty musketeers sixteen when this took place rejoiced greatly at this relaxation   6.831295728320868
without passports   12.548127701592705
from the count   8.295847319648319
pray do so   16.441992048518642
you appear quite aghast   8.771453660422983
without opposing their arrangements he allowed morrel château renaud and debray to leave on horseback and the ladies in m   9.502095877224791
at length she rallied drew aside the curtain and leaning over the pillow gazed intently on valentine   10.698699298240658
there s a life for you said caderousse   7.8669286684105355
you know i have already told you that if you ever call me anything but chevalier i will break every bone in your body   16.885055957714734
and if the marquis chooses to be candid he will confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to him when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of your espousing his daughter   13.775559282459533
replied the peasant with a purity of accent peculiar to the people of that district and which might have put to shame the cultured denizens of the sorbonne and the rue de l universite   9.434809293737489
i forget how but i know he used to amuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it after his return from italy   6.533803753398421
he came to offer his fortune in exchange for my love   11.749017406946544
there only they explained to them the matter in hand   8.743813748509481
asked i of my mother   8.130681390124883
but scarcely were they out of the room before they were made aware of the cause of this noise   13.491109108598371
assuredly said d avrigny   11.399604024798343
as to supper replied the landlord you shall be served immediately   8.190959867886974
i have nothing to save for your majesty   14.748219667332648
and by accustoming her to that poison you have endeavored to neutralize the effect of a similar poison   12.995743011514147
and he held out his hand   13.894597269981368
was not this murdered man an old galley slave   11.77640844166336
give us a light said the other bearer or i shall never find what i am looking for   13.33520545096133
in what year   14.442845626383946
on the eve of battle   10.811548009633215
baptiste give me yesterday s paper cried beauchamp   12.987287236894614
beauchamp took the paper and read the article to which albert pointed in an undertone   9.919765621493447
bonacieux placing her hand upon her bosom my heart beats so i can not walk   8.858068261724876
alas you who would have been such a powerful protector to me in the days of your health and strength can now only sympathize in my joys and sorrows without being able to take any active part in them   14.419910240880888
i wonder what will be talked about tonight   11.488000060396075
i have only one thing to say to you   9.830823674334335
athos found much less difficulty than he had expected in obtaining an audience of anne of austria   14.10365152762124
the peach like the grapes fell to the ground   3.3587447202232124
they won t devour us all four four lackeys horses arms and all   14.653210984234352
the first idea that occurred to milady s mind was that she had been betrayed by kitty and that she had recounted to the baron the selfish aversion toward himself of which she had imprudently allowed some marks to escape before her servant   10.42798514104382
laporte formed the idea of marrying him to his goddaughter and particularly the moment when that goddaughter had been received as lady of the linen to her majesty   9.989671394721736
château renaud returned debray you only know your dull and gloomy faubourg saint germain   11.298315395717413
i possessed a thousand francs   9.16947183990455
poor dear monsieur d artagnan said kitty in a voice full of compassion and pressing anew the young man s hand   9.839801228527184
de villefort monte cristo had paid his visit to the count of morcerf who in order to lose no time in responding to m   11.474804283759816
tomorrow i will see you again to take my leave   9.162248043536083
in italy the nobility generally marry young   13.62478905581404
va bene   13.960134200463031
is it true said the guard to the two cavaliers that the duc de beaufort has arrived in paris   7.668354705234512
he perceived then at a glance that this woman was young and beautiful   11.102967621441225
de boville the inspector of prisons no   8.846052730448715
two or three bottles fell and were broken   10.466307125674929
madame said bonacieux who had never seen his wife in a passion and who recoiled before this conjugal anger madame what do you say   9.846380043882428
with the addition of an equal division of that part intended for the elder dantès which i believe myself at liberty to divide equally with the four survivors   14.722841985775444
oh yes she cried i do love you   16.060096683678523
but on the following day the family from whom all these particulars had been asked received a handsome present consisting of an entirely new fishing boat with two seines and a tender   6.339649310569161
the french have the superiority over the spaniards that the spaniards ruminate while the french invent   7.547169728407579
the count will have his cushions of silver cloth brought there and as he smokes his chibouque see all paris pass before him   8.104788505486436
how they must be looking for monseigneur in all corners   13.025956695128347
a stepmother is never a mother sir   14.389792978138416
well then you shall have it   11.504251037558017
but it appears unfortunately that the fine girl is in love with the mate of the pharaon   9.502114519066513
which i have put on some vine leaves to please you wicked one   10.338722234273392
but that is not all there is a codicil as i said just now   11.153118252513984
returned the captain   11.534966057235666
but the king soon again became dull and indisposed   8.249673399893053
you raoul not sleep well   5.0170595826034
i like to hear you speak thus and i augur well for edmond from it   7.710962538918599
i concluded that by some singular chance the owner of the winning horse must live in the same hotel as myself   11.136821397298228
said d avrigny struck with a sudden thought has it occurred to you noirtier did not let him finish   15.412746121448814
bertuccio crouched in the corner of the carriage began to examine with a feverish anxiety every house they passed   11.597011179571934
replied la ramee your supper is ordered   12.601662323568059
at this moment the same bell that had proclaimed the beginning of the mascherata sounded the retreat   15.811790038034797
he said he was going to the catalans and he is going to the city   15.442664730678548
and this is the reason monsieur continued maximilian of my sister and brother in law having only 25 000 francs a year   14.16816622291461
and they pursued their road in mournful silence   8.812818682730864
this affair like all those in which the count of monte cristo had interfered caused a great sensation in paris   8.802254390051328
dantès himself was simply but becomingly clad in the dress peculiar to the merchant service a costume somewhat between a military and a civil garb   12.490435490058655
the bastion saint gervais on arriving at the lodgings of his three friends d artagnan found them assembled in the same chamber   9.193351637047886
he is the cause of all this misery i am quite sure of it whispered caderousse who had never taken his eyes off fernand to danglars   8.776595297213827
put your names into a hat and draw lots   14.153145703052296
i am a straightforward simple man   13.262047645082532
you need as much as we do that interior condition of repose which thanks to the energy of our government we are about to attain   15.278001826241821
0263m if they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave he would allow himself to be covered with earth and then as it was night the grave diggers could scarcely have turned their backs before he would have worked his way through the yielding soil and escaped   13.474082183429713
have i deceived myself   14.97597387455524
i would ask for six months in advance under pretence of being able to purchase a farm then with my six months i would decamp   8.194433411241041
they were ambitious and cæsar borgia soon found purchasers for their appointments   15.349407743051001
my plan   10.231294273017362
ah devil take it you speak in earnest and must have a definite answer   14.36748243563715

well if you will have the truth and me too   15.49967811899927
this was the orthodox phrase   11.01293091328333
and therefore my friends will conduct monsieur le cardinal neither to de beaufort nor to de bouillon nor to the coadjutor nor to d elbeuf   10.576414421513006
it must however be confessed in his justification that the first use he made of his influence over kitty was to try and find out what had become of mme   15.661954335807067

on looking around him however as he could perceive no threatening object as nothing indicated that he ran any real danger as the bench was comfortably covered with a well stuffed cushion as the wall was ornamented with a beautiful cordova leather and as large red damask curtains fastened back by gold clasps floated before the window he perceived by degrees that his fear was exaggerated and he began to turn his head to the right and the left upward and downward   14.058819377314972
this knife was my only hope   14.803983311983227

the three valets passed without accident   8.934374601548157
this oath was no longer a vain menace   9.682520954040507

as for me my heart is overflowing with happiness   11.725744029855939

dantès remained for a short time mute and motionless   12.073227395244825
dantès was a man of great simplicity of thought and without education   11.813886020066082
but this morning i purchased a very excellent pair of carriage horses and i do not think they were dear   13.158149090046265

last of all i speak to you   14.409994809831447
but to prevent the possibility of the tuscan government taking a fancy to his enchanted palace and thereby depriving him of the advantages naturally expected from so large an outlay of capital he has wisely enough purchased the island and taken its name   12.189978158584427

or that as debray had guessed she had experienced some secret agitation that she would not acknowledge to anyone   10.778787108295475
whichever of the three you like i have no preference   12.258731153540909
i speak of that spiteful and intriguing italian of the pedant who has tried to put on his own head a crown which he stole from under a pillow of the scoundrel who calls his party the party of the king who wants to send the princes of the blood to prison not daring to kill them as our great cardinal our cardinal did of the miser who weighs his gold pieces and keeps the clipped ones for fear though he is rich of losing them at play next morning of the impudent fellow who insults the queen as they say so much the worse for her and who is going in three months to make war upon us in order that he may retain his pensions   12.393899113733415
you shall choose the best   11.926346315670402

he wore trousers of blue cloth boots tolerably clean but not of the brightest polish and a little too thick in the soles buckskin gloves a hat somewhat resembling in shape those usually worn by the gendarmes and a black cravat striped with white which if the proprietor had not worn it of his own free will might have passed for a halter so much did it resemble one   16.329938310941102

well be it so let us part said mercédès folding around her shoulders the only shawl she had taken away and which accidentally happened to be a valuable black cashmere   10.9159009748802

in truth my dear captain i have a great mind to take away your commission and give it to mademoiselle de chemerault to whom i promised an abbey   9.455357273235673

but queen henrietta without even turning toward him who made these hypocritical pretensions crossed the cabinet opened the door for herself and passing through the midst of the cardinal s numerous guards courtiers eager to pay homage the luxurious show of a competing royalty she went and took the hand of de winter who stood apart in isolation   9.919823764629983
but it is already five o clock so make haste   14.4196784335881
said monte cristo wiping his hands on the towel which ali had brought him   12.973882660131501

raoul stayed only a few minutes near them and then mingled with the group round madame de chevreuse   13.062729844840414
madame broussel separated by the width of the table from her husband burst into tears and the young girls clung to their father s arms   13.782034012490788
and what   13.626016500059572
we are not so far gone as that replied the lieutenant   14.88250340028168
what are your excellency s orders   14.432806414095497
carlini raised her in his arms and carried her out of the circle of firelight   11.865432698764002
and i doubt as was the case with polycrates whether any fish will be sufficiently complaisant to bring it back to us   15.323125186609548
20265m albert looked on and listened with astonishment   10.778783963764015
said athos leaning down his head as if to remember who it could be   11.158210853975927
gaspard caderousse   10.019629281606
she then arose and with altered voice ladies said she wait for me ten minutes i shall soon return   12.961545478202563
are you sure we are on the right track lieutenant   5.9133715791381425
la carconte double locked the door behind the jeweller   9.699924804654117
mazarin thought for an instant   12.919074804974402
noirtier the senator   11.167235377220793
and you are certain that the queen and he did not see each other   13.162472082897333
excuse me albert sorrow on your account and delight with that noble girl thus pursuing paternal vengeance   12.436036217030647
but at all events listen well to this   13.98548026531784
the cardinal pronounced the single word hanged   16.559508544736936
although professing diametrically opposite principles from those of the editor of the other paper beauchamp as it sometimes we may say often happens was his intimate friend   13.673557178969494
he is really out sir replied baptistin   16.595930221324434
about five minutes replied the captain   12.860049810869512
i have the greatest veneration for the cardinal continued he and the most profound respect for his actions   12.12309570734123
why he is a very devil this béarnais   12.144198717399357
20181m this precaution taken they went to the theatre and installed themselves in the count s box   14.574009537893218
is that all   16.214815899652447
how did you leave the count   17.793927668295055
but as i entered my apartments i beheld the very gold cup awarded as a prize to the unknown horse and rider   11.665608875986834
for you see the bright side of everything   14.030197124878509
what could explain athos s having re entered the world and the extreme sobriety he had observed at table   14.90114302474393
i say nothing about blaisois for he is only fit to hold the horses   14.180133105306483
how will that affect you since mademoiselle danglars was not among the number here who thought of you   12.666373609416894
one word one single word more doctor   12.486201191619248
that s love or i don t know what love is   11.373937933212481
a moment said athos   13.133017867448444
bring my new saddle and carry it along with those of these gentlemen   13.843801037285022
what can she do in it   17.17527462621883
on his murderers   15.185550272692655
that is why i have filled this whole assembly with horror   14.817693234204953
and certainly no adequate notion of these stupendous ruins can be formed save by such as have visited them and more especially by moonlight at which time the vast proportions of the building appear twice as large when viewed by the mysterious beams of a southern moonlit sky whose rays are sufficiently clear and vivid to light the horizon with a glow equal to the soft twilight of a western clime   10.080043840529278
and you will leave the command to him   12.57537682985514
nothing more easy   7.32665718059055
aramis must have worn himself to a shadow of his former self by constant genuflexion   9.062332483694549
undoubtedly the call came from faria s dungeon   11.660672812453901
and the father and the lover began to dig at the foot of a huge oak beneath which the young girl was to repose   14.084187028992451
to keep away from him every pointed or cutting instrument and to prevent his conversing any length of time with the keepers   19.187985993613218
they passed close by the unhappy being who concealed behind the damask curtain almost felt mercédès dress brush past him and his son s warm breath pronouncing these words courage mother   6.511391821915371
one of them lifted the plank took out a flask of wine drank some and then passed it to his companion   9.165617327614347
what the mercer s wife of the rue des fossoyeurs   9.426025999563977
after which ebullition he departed not however without walking several times to the door of the press room as if he had half a mind to enter   10.036664531705263
the count had spoken correctly   11.091907163503638
i do not often laugh sir replied the stranger as you may perceive by the expression of my countenance   13.1124037798797
with the greatest pleasure   10.746390430010248
i shall struggle to the very last   9.332425472006616
after they got along a few paces the passage widened   13.105248865046537
unless you are blind or have never been outside the harbor you must know   10.988278635107601
and said madame de villefort i need not ask you if you share that fancy   11.272264662440971
if you forgot his features you would know him by that hand into which fell one by one the gold pieces of the merchant el kobbir   15.477240734071994
your fortune is therefore made if you remain with me and i am too good a master to allow you to miss such a chance by granting you the dismissal you require   12.400901577207335
inquired the traveller   7.300778196275782
the count however has commissioned me to assure you that two or three days rest with plenty of barley for their sole food during that time will bring them back to as fine that is as terrifying a condition as they were in yesterday   19.333139705285433
the boy found him sitting where d artagnan had left him still overwhelmed by the coolness of his adversary   15.668065463660689
and where   16.409894156544336
but your release can be managed   13.107155683567251
no but it agitates me   14.697650463805902
all said the major hastily swallowing his biscuit positively all   18.03847798072236
the delinquent had escaped to the rue des lombards and rushed into a house   8.551910116373314
at the sight of carlini cucumetto rose a pistol in each hand   12.459839345192135
chat between brother and sister chapter li   9.433416211972757
shouted d artagnan   12.585543201871335
row porthos row   14.879931314628003
d artagnan looked attentively at the building   7.694471181376376
it is not exactly that sir said the notary which makes me uneasy but the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions so as to be able to get his answers   7.05401968736107
saturday   14.43077727037327
and however well made the mask may be with a little attention we may always succeed in distinguishing it from the true face   12.723773872021145
morrel concealed himself behind a door   13.29269700668982
delacroix s arabian cavaliers with their long white burnouses their shining belts their damasked arms their horses who tore each other with their teeth while their riders contended fiercely with their maces   15.12920897093276
no more edicts no more of the cardinal s guards no more de jussacs nor other bloodhounds   13.97139977991049
well the poison brings on a cough the cough an inflammation of the lungs or some other complaint catalogued in the book of science which however by no means precludes it from being decidedly mortal   12.769285189271722
danglars shuddered at this unexpected attack and turned to caderousse whose countenance he scrutinized to try and detect whether the blow was premeditated   13.30112666512556
one might have fancied him an apparition   7.9400693488572776
morrel had not readily given up the fight   11.764863437208918
my lord i have been so long shut up that i am only of one party i am for fresh air   9.587621817094123
as for his wife he bowed to her as some husbands do to their wives but in a way that bachelors will never comprehend until a very extensive code is published on conjugal life   11.63451396779648
all at once a tall dark gentleman just like yours d artagnan   11.380421099710848
shall i write your deposition   8.851080873184817
said bazin clasping his hands supplicatingly   11.213811929358826
that is right said the old man   16.27782689882971
the siege once over we shall be able to make a tour in that direction   9.19105944356899
asked morrel arresting his hand   12.064308694342902
i find in it two poniards a ladder of rope and a gag   10.153708701600308
those on the other side had followed their example thus favoring the views of the four friends who preferred having them close at hand to chasing them about the chamber   11.758557517425686
it was indeed mousqueton mousqueton as fat as a pig rolling about with rude health puffed out with good living who recognizing d artagnan and acting very differently from the hypocrite bazin slipped off his horse and approached the officer with his hat off so that the homage of the assembled crowd was turned toward this new sun which eclipsed the former luminary   10.107951060652304
my position is like that of a person wounded in a dream   16.181704378823255
but still we are forbidden to give you any explanation   11.406356072547444
as morrel and his son embraced on the pier head in the presence and amid the applause of the whole city witnessing this event a man with his face half covered by a black beard and who concealed behind the sentry box watched the scene with delight uttered these words in a low tone be happy noble heart be blessed for all the good thou hast done and wilt do hereafter and let my gratitude remain in obscurity like your good deeds   9.976877525505024
he could do it in an hour and how many times had he for pure pastime continued in the water for more than twice as long   7.494202202979065
either i misunderstand you or you are very shameless   9.681858503612938
the physician who prepared for me the remedy i have twice successfully taken was no other than the celebrated cabanis and he predicted a similar end for me   12.67539368776125
who occupies number 3   18.028103002316143
of course of course said the prisoners   9.650335361788606
said d artagnan whom the positive tone of m   9.4994512263944
asked athos of porthos   15.672805914575353
well continued the cardinal in an indifferent tone the only thing to be sought for at this moment is some woman handsome young and clever who has cause of quarrel with the duke   13.812850116177676
as they went the citizens awakened left their doors and the street dogs followed the cavaliers barking   17.365785033007782
eugénie has left us   10.008857711151638
yes continued the cardinal   8.76194829075015
aramis uttered a cry of joy at the sight of the seal kissed the superscription with an almost religious respect and opened the epistle which contained what follows my friend it is the will of fate that we should be still for some time separated   14.53261447801484
yes let us search paris and especially inquire of planchet if he has yet heard from his former master   13.614431022208693
that is a tenacious old grandfather said beauchamp   7.85883049787956
do you absolutely think that the palais royal is the abode of gayety   12.751735625158625
i faith aramis believe me there is little left to regret   13.725976546361903
go and look for the comte de la fere   16.52657603947675
and then i swear your trial will be summary   13.47392958064153
will they dare to arrest a man in his majesty s service   3.6078863238783274
you are my own darling child valentine   17.66087635095547
the deuce you say   13.343700268494572
not out of my armory for at terracina i was plundered even of my hunting knife   9.118582015441085
they heard the cause of the disturbance   6.469530428678162
and the vessel passed as dantès had predicted twenty fathoms to windward   11.806771893288706
then you are vexed with the engagement   7.4221083872608595
you were right my lord said felton with a tone of profound disgust which sounded to the very bottom of the heart of milady you were right my lord and i was wrong   14.872232524551091
a single look at milady apprised him of all that was passing in her mind   9.935134228289865
yet i fancy as thou sayest that i see something   9.830148931018375
would it not be expecting too much to hope to succeed at your first attempt   11.23244127735073
besides your window opens immediately over the sea   13.025180836422383
tell me cried villefort fixing his eyes more steadfastly on her than he had ever done before did you ever reveal to anyone our connection   10.017952376178368
there was a solemn though momentary silence which was broken by aramis   11.738041650937548
now is the time when baron porthos would be useful   15.453759217524363
ten minutes afterwards general morcerf was seen on the steps in a black coat with a military collar black pantaloons and black gloves   12.554259432654266
i returned last night and here i am   7.224724214523346
captain said he just now carlini would not drink your health when i proposed it to him   12.226470175260884
un vent de fronde s est leve ce matin   11.28656990844785
i heard the chevalier d herblay say so   11.55022200576024
chapter 5   6.410117986606586
i eat everywhere and of everything only i eat but little   11.312771277128846
courage   6.965909559771561
morrel is in his room is he not mademoiselle julie   9.916139949579641
madame this is precaution not impertinence   14.38693878920235
it was the cardinal then who informed you of this fête   10.678427642305838
yes for in any extreme circumstance it might not only extricate us from some great embarrassment but even a great danger   7.382588248093025
but cried morrel this purse is not yours   8.709428621448241
count of morcerf said the president do not allow yourself to be cast down   12.10945963219524
i can foresee that we shall have need of it directly   12.387874412121821
and that was you   11.075779551803082
when once in the saddle grimaud reflected on two things   9.665315476351042
cried the distracted mother rushing toward villefort   6.455574523314953
they both exclaimed at once   13.49535160934851
then caderousse sat astride the coping and drawing up his ladder passed it over the wall   13.555667857779655
that is difficult replied athos   11.214235902129186
bonacieux was cowardly and avaricious but he loved his wife   9.567025238717086
before mercédès should die replied fernand with the accents of unshaken resolution i would die myself   13.74149669572421
said the cardinal in a low voice   10.324481020499213
30133m indeed   9.469995532726852
and then we shall see how the rebels will get on without either king or queen   10.7151700108116
better my lord   12.801332521874258
i have a miraculous balsam for wounds a balsam given to me by my mother and of which i have made a trial upon myself   15.83718108265248
you judge yourself with too much severity   10.460642163403582
just so gentlemen   10.281220528673156
friend he said you have worked so hard with me toward building up our fortune that at the moment when we are about to reap the fruits of our labours it would be a ridiculous piece of silliness in you to allow yourself to be controlled by aramis whose cunning you know a cunning which we may say between ourselves is not always without egotism   8.746278521860688
thanks danglars that will smooth over all difficulties   11.865239187648852
but we know that for men like these there could be no question of danger   16.924936630830704
well my husband would never live in it   16.485018002059622
by my faith i ask no better cried bonacieux   15.250386658994213
and as it is not permissible to contradict a queen whether she smile or weep everybody expatiated on the gallantry of the aldermen of the city of paris   11.195940024866823
bonacieux in a voice almost caressing and pressing the hand of d artagnan who had not relinquished hers well i will not say as much as you do   11.254334689452625
everything is possible in this affair even a miracle   12.549861164925593
i have no time to lose   10.663205953366944
chapter 56   14.522853583904226
but scarcely was it known that the taxes were to be still further increased when cries of down with mazarin   13.57100851820176
will you allow me to speak to you of her   4.008441178389928
said to bear the name   15.885697575223194
900 000 francs   13.720383252642613
de villefort has always passed for a severe but a just man   15.73812701707757
40138m you must wait for what   8.82322808094947
bonacieux pardon me for interrupting you   14.184492487300048
long ago this mysterious colony quitted spain and settled on the tongue of land on which it is to this day   17.971204305305495
and her son   10.476008051450332
and hence said villefort arose my affection for your father my dear m   18.561329520929778
it was in the rue des france bourgeois close to la force   11.48253411984793
a shove sent the boat adrift and four sturdy oarsmen impelled it rapidly towards the pilon   11.931559570903303
another the illustrious mazarin acting the part of ignatius loyola in a tragedy of that name   10.400070951665857
deuce take those italian princes   10.477512139243718
edmond looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of a man superior to his fellows   18.25796228719976
all we have got to do is to keep our own counsel and remain perfectly quiet not breathing a word to any living soul   11.70724280716425
in less than five minutes he arrived at the end of the cord   15.113996605665086
when the police is at fault it declares that it is on the track   7.48487159129993
i must positively find out who and what he is said franz rising from his seat   12.736813760636792
said mazarin whom that single word always inspired with a great respect   3.7916558103601528
but i am tired of fearing when i open a fresh bottle that the wine may come from the cellar of milady   10.725616734769629
and you say this young man behaved himself well   16.16884734091524
here is a little article on colonel fernand which if i am not mistaken would render the explanation which the comte de morcerf required of me perfectly unnecessary   11.191422051342139
what you had one   19.755089110093554
she could nevertheless make up her mind to renounce the world sir since it is only about a year ago that she herself proposed entering a convent   9.15242242397866
even ali who had hastened to obey the count s summons went forth from his master s presence in charmed amazement at the unusual animation and pleasure depicted on features ordinarily so stern and cold   9.151018275771417
as for me said porthos i will see to the supper   13.924947046146979
for as i told you i expect someone at nine   9.512297542452947
i warn you that i will never again work in the dark and that i will know not only to what i expose myself but for whom i expose myself   16.929566031723763
it was more than piety it was more than grief and i who am no canter and hate the jesuits said then to myself it is really well and i am very glad that i have not any children   13.753286604283879
well then believe me athos your mission is ended and ended nobly   12.860696568168848
i have always found them   11.067307469273178
observed valentine   11.592661835345227
beauchamp my good fellow you know i am starving said debray do not set him off on some long story   10.237202182653096
yes and for a most curious one   11.516006593724766
she snatched me from the cushions on which i was sleeping and on opening my eyes i saw hers filled with tears   15.165834723618154
said the host to himself   11.240943144881921
what says the abbé   16.299034524278788
then to admit no one except major bartolomeo cavalcanti and his son   9.986660306029545
apropos she said as if to drive away thoughts that pursued her in spite of herself how is poor voiture do you know scarron   12.75631255252393
it fills me with pride to find that thanks to a common sort of penetration with which i am endowed i am approved by a man like you fresh from the court   14.343708619839266
he had been known in the circle of the musketeers to win in one night three thousand pistoles   10.685977222829708
he passed one leg over the wall and in a moment leaped down on the other side   12.330022051977323
the noble carriage of this gentleman for whom he believed himself to be engaged had won planchet that was the name of the picard   11.218630900980841
the cardinal was acquainted with the activity and more particularly the hatred of buckingham   14.518583499655048
thirty francs   11.37166886975435
said d artagnan with great pleasure   13.44282114000712
30157m i own that your question embarrasses me valentine for i can not say that the count has rendered me any ostensible service   20.544111066506247
not in the least since there is no danger that anyone can possibly understand what we are saying   12.930089515191808
yes said aramis through an infamous act of treason   10.955054179893338
still i hesitated to wake him although i fancied that his face was flushed and that the veins of his temples throbbed more violently than usual   15.448927943238678
but we must not lose time   10.2299517126142
dear du vallon does one forget the happiest days of flowery youth one s dearest friends the dangers we have dared together   16.366908187144276
stammered dantès   15.373873202327259
and everything considered it is our lot to risk our lives   12.471522523551668
4 and he your excellency is poor peppino   7.882516126514602
do stay added la carconte in a tremulous voice   15.029444984364812
never forget me   11.051379604660823
and you have done well to conform in everything to the wishes of my friend sinbad   10.427383869735777
they are   12.897929387203687
he demands your head   11.921267944085548
was haled by a strong guard before the high court which was to judge him   11.669552932064914
porthos began to be suspicious   12.102144031290125
i shall not leave so near the queen that source of discord with which the deceased cardinal so often caused the anger of the king to rage above the boiling point   8.534696957322026
tomorrow morning at seven o clock you will be with me will you not   10.72690464372678
said d artagnan whose ears chafed terribly under the repetition of this word coiners   8.229711229674626
my horse was killed this morning my lord and i am mounted provisionally on my lackey s   14.383435570378241
we ought never to despair of softening the heart of a mother who loves her child   13.522277094798676
ah what is that   17.322162125719608
and yet said d artagnan laughing it appears to me that from time to time you must make sorties   9.423151848690107
my lord duke tis the height of ingratitude   9.005249759019886
at length a slight color tinged the livid cheeks consciousness returned to the dull open eyeballs a faint sigh issued from the lips and the sufferer made a feeble effort to move   11.941823467917516
what we are going to say does not concern your majesty   11.073268223710537
it was here that the good old man whom you saved from death and dishonor threw himself into my arms   10.84673033147558
one takes away from him all claim to good sense another robs him of his poetry a third of his originality another of his humor another of his independence of character a sixth but good heavens   11.245410357310517
just as the quaint conclusion reached by porthos was about to bring back hilarity to faces now more or less clouded hasty footsteps were heard upon the stair and some one knocked at the door   9.583375501271462
oh a day and night soon pass away   1.5513141205369312
said peppino in italian and taking danglars by the collar of his coat he dragged him to an opening resembling a door through which they entered the apartment which the captain appeared to have made his dwelling place   9.773361427055217
as to teresa her eyes sparkled when she thought of all the fine gowns and gay jewellery she could buy with this purse of gold   10.043777339059075
his granddaughter   12.558743986778692
well asked the president what is your decision   18.45168672800012
the furniture had been knocked over in the deadly struggle that had taken place there and the sheets to which the unfortunate jeweller had doubtless clung were dragged across the room   6.453343708482343
disguised   11.78556749892292
it is of no use for you to know anything about it said the young woman whom an instinctive mistrust now impelled to draw back   10.700323016703713
last february you were the first who told me of the haitian funds   3.223858852692354
the count soon heard andrea s voice singing a corsican song accompanied by the piano   7.257024317049658
i should think not indeed   15.14280977864335
at midnight my lord   8.54784393356372
in france chapter lxi   11.533304344521609
oh indeed indeed sir he is innocent   8.106896701305189
do not forget this evening do not forget that promise   17.16804920497238
he has informed me of the arrival of this ship   8.374312629711802
but those men you speak of said mazarin smiling inwardly on seeing rochefort approach the point to which he was leading him those men were not devoted to the cardinal for they contended against him   9.474847257007893
you have not played for a long time i said   12.228236862529451
de villefort was as usual unmoved   13.947304945232124
bonacieux shrugging her shoulders   10.525689800534337
well next some day you will be robbed   9.581246665341105
but she has not died of old age but of grief   17.669883400747985
being no disciple of cagliostro i was wholly unable to do this   15.101086776727481
why does my lord belonging to the church now receive me in the dress of an officer with a sword at his side and spurs to his boots   8.427457153308826
as for aramis he went off to the bishop s palace to see if he could possibly pass in with juxon to the king s presence   19.453401163506108
you will do for me what you have done for the queen   14.94693299232787
he rose gently so that his head was just above the round of the barrel and under the large hat he recognized the pale face of mordaunt   13.581411357725662
no i have never injured her   12.857320219191868
and what did he say to you   9.100923436368667
then you have but one hope   8.345439548656975
the bandit s laws are positive   9.090011099655252
and andrea gliding through the court like a black shadow rushed out through the wicket leaving his comrades and even the keeper lost in wonder   10.897020108628663
this strange chain of domestic afflictions followed by the no less strange death of his daughter strange   13.486604674071605
he is not at home and i will carry away the key after having placed you in his apartment   13.876156755128653
but i preferred having an entrance which would allow me to see the bois de boulogne over my gate   15.156276311276391
d artagnan replied   14.403332251259938
to dispute over their evening game of chess upon the merits of their servants   9.81690572383959
is my lord pleased with his escort   9.110383695572779
was going when he was assassinated   10.162152755187657
what s the manner   13.598850809744688
when the count arrived he had under his touch his books and arms his eyes rested upon his favorite pictures   14.566426634408248
and milady felt she was lost if she did not come to the assistance of the disconcerted puritan   7.29494590179794
i was hidden behind that door he said which leads into the next house which i have rented   7.856214866592534
but he was ever on the watch for it and he faithfully promised himself that he would not fail to seize it by its three hairs whenever it came within reach of his hand   10.120308623758469
the unknown waited for silence and then resumed i told you well that she would know me   14.641197707984771
was not your majesty warned that it was to take place this morning   11.758164153961852
a dull gloomy silence like that which precedes some awful phenomenon of nature pervaded the assembly who shuddered in dismay   8.80752569224735
yes it is very annoying said vampa   10.70556605287182
they knew full well that this fugitive must be a bandit   16.496210899915578
he spoke elegantly although i thought from his accent he was an englishman   14.46239158430724
he signified assent   11.803094774131164
eight or ten days afterward aramis received the following letter my dear cousin here is the authorization from my sister to withdraw our little servant from the convent of béthune the air of which you think is bad for her   9.546435452819903
i have told you that i am prepared for anything   16.737662071673874
cried the king in the highest state of choler   12.510535614088367
he is alone said grimaud   7.171337040641459
i will leave you the torch sir   14.057196768198555
the poor girl almost fainted at hearing these words   11.813640351911205
well what should i say to the king   13.486062170680665
45   13.041324504540952
the cardinal has a weakness for these men which i can not comprehend   12.42618623080132
forgive my vanity and tell me which you prefer   13.094115452529085
a murder   13.896132094066711
and do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning   21.64240709956919
and inquired dantès with some hesitation do you know how my father is   12.063661258983242
his poor mother murmured the major trying to get the lachrymal gland in operation so as to moisten the corner of his eye with a false tear   11.32980683466024
morrel disappeared down the avenue de marigny and monte cristo hastened to join bertuccio   16.32293630929199
providence appears to me to have no share in this affair   12.103352119171614
what has just happened   8.433962279012931
there that calash filled with roman peasants   12.041231002385675
but the favor of the queen was at the present time an additional cause of persecution and her protection as it was known protected badly as witness chalais and mme   11.359789980349696
it was the fever that disturbed you madame said villefort   16.21725074208023
you have only to remain in paris for about a fortnight telling the world you are abandoned and relating the details of this desertion to your best friends who will soon spread the report   15.261936179163083
for life replied porthos in the same manner   15.008934368680595
he gave orders that he should be informed as soon as madame danglars appeared   7.85972482062046
yes but with a jovial partner and dice and guineas clinking on the cloth the night passes like a dream   16.49284204453856
athos assisted by porthos who lifted him up like a feather arrived at the top   11.64692074402724
ah said valentine in a mournful tone do let me see this man maximilian   11.623899345813289
they were kneeling on the lowest of the marble steps and in that manner intended making a rampart of the three others in case of pursuit   13.305831455976017
well once returned from the country half by the protection of her cousin half through what we have personally done for her we shall obtain from the queen what we desire   5.740560066585161
where is your wife in the first place   9.586216875808907
remember that in a quarter of an hour you will be safe   15.163754937135373
why my companion   12.86491172863947
but at the same time the intonation was so soft that however strange the speech might seem it was impossible to be offended at it   17.339268800937077
the officiating priest was just finishing mass whilst d artagnan was looking at bazin   11.744516025733029
good evening valentine said a well known voice   16.96855158528851
you ask that   16.199825567953198
i shall obey the wishes of the people   12.68272196259246
danglars was disagreeable certainly but i know how much you care for his ill humor   10.271213639269698
and he saw again all he had seen before his sleep from sinbad his singular host to ali the mute attendant   15.73408502583515
i once endeavored to go down with two of my servants   14.4866354018178
i perceive that this creature will be my particular aversion he muttered   8.72997774273089
my mother uttered a cry of joy and clasped me to her bosom   14.908077676416431
you formerly lived i believe in the allées de meilhan on the fourth floor   16.083975061070788
how are they called who follow others in spite of them   13.685677679972422
reckoning still further that as long as you do me the honor to remain in my house i shall never speak to you about rent very kind   10.171789713289352
at length happier than the young man who sobbed without weeping tears glistened in the eyes of noirtier   14.464034017835196
decidedly monsieur d artagnan you are the man i have been seeking   13.296826110182977
three compartments divided the coffer   16.416731480425668
and i answered him to bring or send me that order and i would sign it   15.34466023529723
it is more difficult than i thought   12.1112279749632
madame danglars uttered a scream and fainted   9.83169301698902
but i don t know him said the countess   8.538441399089196
one of my friends one of my friends please to observe not myself said athos interrupting himself with a melancholy smile one of the counts of my province that is to say of berry noble as a dandolo or a montmorency at twenty five years of age fell in love with a girl of sixteen beautiful as fancy can paint   16.01707640847792
in italy sinbad the sailor   12.734472029213359
but why do you ask that   8.999263633018902
said andrea disappointed   11.1147000009402
i am indeed rejoiced said andrea   14.674491873883216
at that very moment grimaud drew back the cloak which hid the aperture and came in with his face livid his eyes staring wide open with terror so that the pupils were contracted almost to nothing with a large circle of white around them   6.951304868321484
the king went away enchanted   15.687312477087556
ah here you are monsieur she said in her naturally calm voice   14.644720950407594
they are firing at the corpses replied athos   14.591157395906334
but i see you have other strings to your bow   14.521008104622709
ah sir replied caderousse we can not console those who will not be consoled and he was one of these   9.545017161787104
well you guard the exterior and if he attempts to fly fire upon him   13.41007611675713
and you obeyed   14.47732137163556
said felton i doubted but now i believe   12.962946812483406
very well show him to me   8.930825543703131
oh no said porthos it does not exceed two thousand five hundred livres   7.837552472694101
de blacas returned as speedily as he had departed but in the antechamber he was forced to appeal to the king s authority   9.777820347289033
monte cristo ran down the steps and advancing towards the spot designated beheld villefort encircled by his servants with a spade in his hand and digging the earth with fury   10.63632000435547
patrick who knew lord de winter was in affairs of the service and in relations of friendship with the duke gave the preference to the one who came in his name   13.381886675522175
and when you have found you will tell me will you not   5.8872004677749095
de buckingham will be prevented from setting out by some great event   7.9414821842364365
run for help   10.575640503051295
well now she said let us see what you would do to prove this love of which you speak   12.541942002731359
by the same sign which at the same time tells my right hand correspondent that i am ready while it gives notice to my left hand correspondent to prepare in his turn   15.789640569703916
sir my right hand correspondent is signalling   13.205106641539299
d artagnan came forward and stammered out a few words of gratitude which soon expired under the gloomy looks of the cardinal   20.478369830891303
we were beginning to grow impatient said athos   13.503590329504481
i repeat it you must really be a very strange and superior man for my mother is so absorbed by the interest you have excited that when i am with her she speaks of no one else   9.91711455559981
he was a foreigner   12.642799039718989
the night was cold and still   12.628250940111247
the young man recollected his promise and was silent   12.168343779176688
musketeers   13.93959215249434
they are coming full gallop   7.024424892475514
5 scott of course the son of an ill fated sire and the father of a yet more unfortunate family bore in his looks that cast of inauspicious melancholy by which the physiognomists of that time pretended to distinguish those who were predestined to a violent and unhappy death   13.822102783151117
for third rate fortunes are never more than a fourth of what they appear to be like the locomotive on a railway the size of which is magnified by the smoke and steam surrounding it   3.272295001147665
the count s serious face was illumined by a faint smile as he noticed the portfolio which the receiver general held in his hand   8.960021745168996
my dear friend we must take people as we find them   13.362986517980833
cried dantès his eyes sparkling with animation   11.954897976342439
the doctor pressed valentine s hand and while he visited her grandmother she descended the steps   8.401325254856445
you have no right to beg at night said the groom endeavoring to rid his master of the troublesome intruder   10.365796938860607
felton obeyed   16.954740029099725
perhaps you did not know it   14.85409411629928
i pity her then   13.932451459845215
and when did he set out   10.2013967761401
it would be a still worse affair for mazarin whom he execrated for the greater offences he had committed   16.782540399603334
i do not wish to cause you any remorse   16.12526377877589
exclaimed de winter seizing the arm of athos   9.49916064075828
the day after tomorrow it will return signed by his hand and marked with his seal   9.932235567054121
ah young man young man some flirtation or other   12.10082155472867
one word more sir   9.69168003994016
he is right thought athos   10.902816912761455
as to the servant she had run away at the moment of her master s arrest   13.606426002399553
oh monsieur chevalier do you love that woman still   11.978742911255155
all cried together   7.614782434199277
this order to heat the irons made dantès shudder   12.229298791637193
and think that what you are about to do is for his sake   14.699196397757337
you see monsieur that you say it again   7.993680290587311
well what is there surprising in that   14.536291390665493
go in whatever guise you choose   12.01200672623887
the wounded man sank upon his knees to again kiss the feet of his preserver   8.654535277981832
it will only cost you a discount of 5 000 or 6 000 francs   5.98131556266103
know you again   17.388966330243807
probabilities are deceptive   14.065027334000511
d avrigny followed the invalid wrote a prescription ordered villefort to take a cabriolet go in person to a chemist s to get the prescribed medicine bring it himself and wait for him in his daughter s room   13.551795763858394
the count arose and unlocking a closet with a key suspended from his gold chain took from it a little silver casket beautifully carved and chased the corners of which represented four bending figures similar to the caryatides the forms of women symbols of the angels aspiring to heaven   8.643274739776306
tomorrow perhaps he may change you   12.702890464685659
did you ever occupy yourself said he to franz with the employment of time and the means of simplifying the summoning your servants   14.158650779768038
de jussac turned the corner of the convent   11.588100847750002
keep back my lord said d artagnan   11.881650188134092
i ventured to tell her that mazarin was the lover of anne of austria   11.115294120473623
you are right sir always right said anne of austria   5.483909758113059
the morbleus the sang dieus the morts touts les diables crossed one another in the air   12.378637828520556
come with me then   10.180364797965394
cæsar s commentaries said the bandit it is my favorite work   6.024796351664532
well that is all that i wanted and i will be guided by a counsellor such as you are said he extending his hand to monte cristo   9.212247651149514
i am d artagnan   12.5536445319458
ah stop   9.405875577261607
said eugénie with sovereign contempt smoothing her gloves out one upon the other   15.883818146568654
athos was invited four times and each time took his friends and their lackeys with him   7.5128578882828485
numberless groups paraded the streets and whatever d artagnan might think of it it was obvious that the citizens had for the night laid aside their usual forbearance in order to assume a warlike aspect   15.77601141283198
but when out of sight he turned his horse to the right made a circuit and came back within twenty paces of a high hedge to watch the passage of the little troop   10.56651812117988
but in return for a slow profound eternal torture i would give back the same were it possible   13.909036035395474
yes that s true   6.853868288378159
the sentiments you air are certainly fine so fine that they are superhuman   14.374953500790893
the next morning therefore when broussel made his entrance into paris in a large carriage having his son louvieres at his side and friquet behind the vehicle the people threw themselves in his way and cries of long live broussel   8.324149759574574
how was it that a presentiment did not warn mercédès that her lover was within three hundred yards of her   14.597405455157705
yes yes that is he   11.800995946923077
three days afterward the four musketeers were in paris   19.454322147229668
that two executions of considerable interest will take place the day after tomorrow at two o clock as is customary at rome at the commencement of all great festivals   13.375280159517398
and cooks   15.317262824190518
she was dressed that is to say in dishabille wrapped in a long warm dressing gown   7.940287368528038
will they not sign it   10.895963099726064
my god my lord i have long despised thee   9.08608052968274
this last apartment was a sort of dark room littered with papers   12.78016285028183
he had a haughty bearing a look either steady and impenetrable or insolently piercing and inquisitorial   20.951619321207914
do not be alarmed maximilian   11.508758920792125
the minutes passed   13.337708450103198
but my wife wants a gold chain and i want a pair of silver buckles   8.647402011396393
not at all prince said monte cristo laying a marked stress on the title what have i done for you   12.613324831139414
where are you come from sir   15.876746280683927
ah said cavalcanti to himself if i only had that britzka those two good post horses and above all the passport that carries them on   14.359564548219524
and where cabbages carrots radishes peas and melons had once flourished a scanty crop of lucern alone bore evidence of its being deemed worthy of cultivation   10.426558129397653
and athos bowing retired and remained leaning against the mantelpiece a spectator of the scene   10.221960794649464
but the clerks were not the dupes of this deceit and their lugubrious looks settled down into resigned countenances   9.622371703555613
provoked by a complete refusal she bit her lip and said then shall i send valentine to you   8.373404357991935
they ll be afraid and will disperse   12.583127094410099
i fell lifeless and fancied myself killed   11.701424414703865
stammered danglars   17.152171169814284
then when the officer was gone he sat down in the arm chair opposite the president and struck his boots with a little cane which he carried in his hand   8.240286336054123
if you pass before a house which is being built look up for fear a stone should fall upon your head   10.742218485115107
in fact bazin curious to know what the mendicant could want with his master kept pace with him as well as he could and arrived almost at the same time he did   9.08437550260094
monte cristo smiled with satisfaction   11.987323206677068
you have a friend monsieur du vallon whom i like much   16.95259956407119
absolution   9.729269765419819
the chief beauty of trees consists in the deep shadow of their umbrageous boughs while fancy pictures a moving multitude of shapes and forms flitting and passing beneath that shade   18.082409197003958
those barrels i saw through the door   9.079331262249053
d artagnan cast an inquiring glance at milady   6.2235545648457435
we will recommend you to him   13.98021980496467
this was in fact the worst complaint of louis xiii   6.533234307343704
on the summit of a rising ground a little in advance of the enemy appeared a short and heavy looking man   7.268124551682727
when well assured this search was superfluous he followed d artagnan wondering to himself how this young guardsman should know so well who the lady was to whom he had given hospitality and that he should know better than himself what had become of her   12.024348349455101
morrel had fully anticipated and which cocles paid as punctually as the bills which the shipowner had accepted   12.189222843166126
that man has sagacity honor and wit not to mention likewise that he is a man of undoubted resolution   11.130261760953868
morbleu said athos as soon as they were again in motion reduced to two masters and grimaud and planchet   12.798513768570722
that while the writing of different persons done with the right hand varies that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform   17.82129294497951
this was the chance at which m   5.468895530282246
i have already successfully conducted several public prosecutions and brought the offenders to merited punishment   10.858340288209362
he breakfasted heartily and caring little as he said for the beauties of the eternal city ordered post horses at noon   18.789958369841823
there were moments when looking at grimaud the duke asked himself if he was not dreaming and if that marble figure was really at his service and would grow animated when the moment came for action   6.718737612012661
the king overheard these words and turned around with tears in his eyes   7.834642203278423
danglars remained prostrate while the count withdrew   11.905776999577837
why this woman was a monster   9.737227476973912
do not try my lord you can not guess who it is   16.855174966353673
so sir you wish to see all relating to the poor abbé who really was gentleness itself   14.191265772339934
what brother   11.709053798292619
there is no need to do that said franz taking out his tablets   9.137724869786553
d épinay can have displeased your father more than any other person   11.790239659750585
d artagnan gave the open letter to kitty who at first was unable to comprehend it but who became almost wild with joy on reading it a second time   11.335968398124097
jewels diamonds gems   14.216722340336796
this however was nothing to a sculptor like vampa   13.718721386572476
replied eugénie with her usual candor   14.924461072263089
my lord said comminges i answered that to compose a ligue only one ingredient was wanting in my opinion an essential one a duc de guise   9.42306443762492
president how entirely you have read my thoughts said benedetto in his softest voice and most polite manner   14.742242021488241
broussel s son was there still furious and still bearing bloody marks of his struggle with the king s officers   6.968473058415792
why do you remember when it forgets   13.06178522653536
while his wife was speaking villefort had narrowly watched the old man s countenance   12.262403961227623
we went to take monsieur athos to the waters of forges where my friends still remain   13.497487297540207
well you see my dear d artagnan with what ill luck i play replied porthos with the most careless air in the world   10.918833824084572
and to think that i had an idea of marrying his daughter said debray   16.845822675570957
there always comes a moment when the good you have done pleads your cause before god   3.863281796747625
why just think for a moment   11.719107496680582
i wrote to her to send me fifty louis or so of which i stood absolutely in need on account of my accident   8.141639846461818
this pretended d artagnan was he not an emissary of the cardinal whom the cardinal sought to introduce into tréville s house to place near him to win his confidence and afterward to ruin him as had been done in a thousand other instances   8.181522371713625
because the person who is now in the gallery prefers being alone and never practices in the presence of anyone   14.791413486201806
de tréville what has become of your three companions   14.523830897546407
what fine words he uses   9.463517858226762
upon my word said caderousse from whose mind the friendly treatment of dantès united with the effect of the excellent wine he had partaken of had effaced every feeling of envy or jealousy at dantès good fortune upon my word dantès is a downright good fellow and when i see him sitting there beside his pretty wife that is so soon to be   17.7232038344259
my safety is now a mere question of speed   15.337701715576772
but first of all athos begged that he might go to the hotel du grand charlemagne to see raoul   10.486105918323997
i should have thought that his duchess oh porthos s duchess is dressed by her husband s clerks said d artagnan laughing   15.035293079005879
at the precise time when madame danglars dressed in black and concealed in a long veil was ascending the stairs leading to debray s apartments notwithstanding the assurances of the concierge that the young man was not at home debray was occupied in repelling the insinuations of a friend who tried to persuade him that after the terrible scene which had just taken place he ought as a friend of the family to marry mademoiselle danglars and her two millions   12.155675164314653
besides this he had seen as he called it all the remarkable sights at rome   18.094267627831318
and the house awakened from its long sleep like the sleeping beauty in the wood lived sang and bloomed like the houses we have long cherished and in which when we are forced to leave them we leave a part of our souls   8.680869546678109
it was expected by everybody that the campaign would be a severe one   11.533831811459514
upon my word monsieur said danglars with affected carelessness i attach no sort of value to such empty distinctions   14.80500587306972
but this not being so easily plucked as the orange tree pricked him dreadfully   17.780372610015103
this is the history of most men who have passed twenty years of age   11.50990319083158
the countess de winter as they rode along the duke endeavored to draw from d artagnan not all that had happened but what d artagnan himself knew   14.988247873064767
that s the advice i was about to give monsieur   16.19344313272795
this gascon is a precious fellow   12.635652468188475
do you insist on this retractation so far as to kill me if i do not make it although i have repeated more than once and affirmed on my honor that i was ignorant of the thing with which you charge me and although i still declare that it is impossible for anyone but you to recognize the count of morcerf under the name of fernand   8.663789652965875
the old executioner of bethune muttered grimaud   10.073068612398444
as for our two prisoners you can imagine that they are but little in the vein for conversation   11.9814641961239
if i am not saved i shall be avenged   11.318144695000504
does he hate his majesty as much as he does us   9.780078615548172
do not alarm yourself my dear maximilian they understand   9.6634969414193
you will find me ready to follow you   12.006302079003696
besides the provident law has deprived you of the power to disinherit me at least entirely as it has also of the power to compel me to marry monsieur this or monsieur that   12.095440829327748
de saint méran like his own could be vastly increased and the marriage be still more suitable   13.825208686816884
in fact said one of the guards who had remained in the chamber and had been kept awake by a toothache brought on by the dampness of the atmosphere my lord has had a very restless night and two or three times while dreaming he called for help   11.424105328809757
amuse yourself with milady my dear d artagnan   11.547767531447073
he still doubts thought milady   8.926372280613748
seated opposite to him monte cristo watched him in the shadow and morrel saw nothing but the bright eyes of the count   18.50812493410151
come in m   7.381083958023689
yes on the contrary they met and it was the viscount himself who conducted him to the bed of the dying man   10.435613789150135
i will kill thee on the honor of a gentleman   13.208286639264227
said aramis in his tone of raillery   10.810562285950727
his warm and fickle imagination which in gascony had rendered him formidable to young chambermaids and even sometimes their mistresses had never dreamed even in moments of delirium of half the amorous wonders or a quarter of the feats of gallantry which were here set forth in connection with names the best known and with details the least concealed   15.05430355753256
if it s parry said the bishop i have nothing to fear   6.7796294834542525
as to planchet he thought of little or nothing but was happy as a hunting hound in his old master s company   13.967676995051393
i have tony a safe if simple youth   13.271770661543277
then mazarin is still mazarin   10.540118960434837
tis then the devil that pursues   7.625359665186094
but ere they had gone many steps they perceived a group advancing towards them composed of the betrothed pair a party of young girls in attendance on the bride by whose side walked dantès father   8.398668253816027
he seemed quite overcome by my misfortune   5.779595494310969
she pretended to be descending but in reality she was waiting for him   12.475589060574839
i prefer waiting here said the messenger with a smile   11.774022653127147
you have done well to speak to me and ask for my assistance for i was about to form another plan and leave you   12.298841737807717
go on urged caderousse   10.604784027478297
my family has sought consideration in this alliance with m   11.241643919593397
the sea smooth as crystal was now and then disturbed by the leaping of fish which were pursued by some unseen enemy and sought for safety in another element   6.485096192319674
athos had even gone so far as to question m   13.111531645646476
but what are they to do   5.064471021265227
ah my dear athos i am greatly afraid i have drawn a terrible vengeance on both of us   13.476269067448488
it was morrel s turn to become pale   7.220335230282888
it was half past nine o clock and the coadjutor required half an hour to go from the archbishop s palace to the tower of st   9.944708070388025
albert nothing doubted but that the fair unknown would reply in the same manner   14.53398371142593
de tréville who had been accustomed to associate together   8.982629133553292
you would hold me in horror go on   15.042207099728095
he sent us home in his own carriage   11.140687859808947
in the meantime said tréville seek him not if i have a right to advise you   13.62210493483998
it is as yet unknown to all and i had sworn to the count de guiche to remit this letter to your majesty before even i should embrace my guardian   12.92571684836507
gentlemen said he we have been here an hour and our wager is won   13.447279313314036
i am rich   11.16282389517343
well leave them with your porter   12.959092308268751
and that house in which the plenipotentiaries are asked athos belongs to to monsieur de chanleu who commands your troops at charenton   15.721085724281581
how has this terrible past been recalled   12.111288351068174
this is the mode in which they manage these things and succeed in eastern climes where there are grave and phlegmatic persons who care very little for the questions of time in conjunctures of importance   12.876983846431452
you have scarcely seen my mother   10.439753687185748
morcerf asked leave to retire   8.081080360474358
they are perfect mother so perfect that they surpass by far all i have known in the leading aristocracy of the three proudest nobilities of europe the english the spanish and the german   15.068243247363888
listen milady said the cardinal the affair is important   14.883522044193501
the idea of thinking ministers understand anything about princes   9.20519798850258
his really sincere royalism made him youthful again   10.863233069234827
a good man a man holding religious office as does the abbé busoni could not condescend to deceive or play off a joke   15.410540709682476
you love my mistress then very dearly monsieur chevalier   11.405227657289096
whilst we thought you indifferent to our sorrows which you couldn t share without crime you alone among us have discovered what we were searching for in vain   16.887852232037112
rapid as had been villefort s glance it had served to give him an idea of the man he was about to interrogate   7.865911085785232
honoré and in the place du palais cardinal they found the twelve invited musketeers walking about in expectation of their comrades   5.864617532851974
well my good friend returned the abbé in a tone that indicated utter indifference on his part you are at liberty either to speak or be silent just as you please   13.531695561726202
that is to say yes and no   16.119727154441527
you are quite right beauchamp observed the young aristocrat   12.443566095219275
be prudent athos said aramis   6.673433218441828
that same evening upon reaching his abode in the champs élysées the count of monte cristo went over the whole building with the air of one long acquainted with each nook or corner   10.544039385899927
and have your notions changed   15.994267308426638
morrel had no particular reason for uneasiness   10.857305822532318
and this portrait had certain resemblances of lines with athos certain family likenesses which indicated that this great noble a knight of the order of the king was his ancestor   8.372229711437004
i respect your convictions and whilst we fight for opposite sides let us remain friends   11.405771394525056
and those of the first floor   12.880125902000927
thereupon he returned in a lively mood to his room and sent to the swiss the things that belonged to him   14.646359245193445
i thought the assassin having discovered the chest and supposing it to be a treasure had intended carrying it off but perceiving his error had dug another hole and deposited it there   6.594377920325804
planchet waited towel on arm   5.62487907794171
mademoiselle de villefort is not very fond of society and we very seldom go out said the young lady   9.924626064357533
because i judge it from the past   15.116026620967205
yes devotion   11.404823003066067
the count will come of that you may be satisfied   9.962053599203678
the nearest said the district doctor is a good italian abbé who lives next door to you   14.738760443453014
then when they had thus passed the day in building castles in the air they separated their flocks and descended from the elevation of their dreams to the reality of their humble position   20.515212840371163
oh be assured if the memory of my brother were not sacred to me you should rot in a state dungeon or satisfy the curiosity of sailors at tyburn   8.664270178563239
he was particularly anxious to avoid marring the freshness of the magnificent baldric we are acquainted with   8.677976502932246
age produces good sense and as i doubt not but that your master is on the road to salvation i want you to tell me where he is that he may help me to mine   10.841216014970694
to leave you   9.865589685684146
what i hate to day i adore to morrow and vice versa   15.618889498216564
might it not have been the cardinal himself who had first traced them in order that they might serve as a guide for his nephew in the event of a catastrophe which he could not foresee would have been so complete   11.144562880796355
what think you danglars said one of the party turning towards him of this event   12.23476928308818
i have two words to say to the count of monte cristo   13.649867664675146
yes honest i can certainly say that much for myself continued the innkeeper fairly sustaining the scrutiny of the abbé s gaze   10.434437017309563
but perhaps since then he has had proofs that gratitude does exist   14.85300629843648
he followed a short distance close under the wall then crossed a path hid entered a clump of trees   14.132641827230474
in that case and supposing he was at liberty he was to rejoin her in france at the convent of the carmelites at béthune   13.868246844945402
since you now know my face i wish to be remembered alone through the affection i hope you will grant me   9.740700886432103
the apparition chapter 101   16.658664628132968
madame said d artagnan the people want to see the king and they must see him   13.383670960098806
each man had stabbed him separately and intoxicated by their crime though still pale with fear they sought all over the cavern to discover if there was any fear of fire after which they amused themselves by rolling on the bags of gold   14.34474099433051
the secret cave chapter 25   12.397542115848985
at this challenge vampa rose quickly drawing at the same moment a pistol from his girdle   7.0878693335991745
i think i may aspire to that honor said danglars with a smile which reminded monte cristo of the sickly moons which bad artists are so fond of daubing into their pictures of ruins   12.472865977358133
it is frightful murmured mazarin   13.25086919186832
spain is her country replied d artagnan   13.700840094826832
then while madame de saint méran remained on her knees praying fervently villefort sent for a cab and went himself to fetch his wife and daughter from madame de morcerf s   11.663224198922192
grimaud will accompany you with his musketoon   16.355720070715652
myself excepted and again mazarin smiled   9.73948176613487
oh what agony   13.979299556250778
then turning towards ali he said let all the horses in my stables be led before the windows of your young lady that she may select those she prefers for her carriage   13.429404279283538
consider maillard said the curate that i have recommended you to this gentleman who is a powerful lord and that i have made myself responsible for you   11.152019799005279
to the study of the latter she professed to be entirely devoted following it with an indefatigable perseverance assisted by a schoolfellow a young woman without fortune whose talent promised to develop into remarkable powers as a singer   9.681872011903833
you have my promise he said after a minute s pause extending his hand to monte cristo   15.461446575875797
he then related to his friends word for word all that had passed between him and his host and how the man who had abducted the wife of his worthy landlord was the same with whom he had had the difference at the hostelry of the jolly miller   7.6632151304167655
said caderousse supported by a supernatural power and half raising himself to see more distinctly the man who had just taken the oath which all men hold sacred   8.654646792831869
in another week you will have left beaucaire remarked caderousse for the fair ends in a few days   7.908205720334076
if i may ask without indiscretion   14.398635750408067
oh the deuce   17.05806029688769
de tréville and permitted him to distribute furloughs for four days on condition that the favored parties should not appear in any public place under penalty of the bastille   12.368107862979539
conscience what hast thou to do with me   17.556207292522945
brave as they appeared to be the two english gentlemen looked at each other hesitatingly   7.127924750477494
and touching his horse with the spur he cantered back to paris   14.875765464632622
i shall be sure to find employment   9.426850677404573
penelon nearly swallowed his quid   13.045936499099618
if a king he lost   13.42154958783807
no madame something easier to grant   10.606572055629211
signor pastrini interpreted the question and answer and the horses galloped off   8.69628111953562
at this sight franz felt the perspiration start forth upon his brow   11.31802796840206
therefore i warn you and listen well to my words that they may be engraved upon your memory never to be forgotten this murder which has robbed me of everything this murder which has deprived me of my name this murder which has impoverished me this murder which has made me corrupt wicked implacable i shall summon you to account for it first and then those who were your accomplices when i discover them   16.129199684387363
that happens just lucky your excellency   14.63619640203579
now that way of joining them is not very attractive to me i confess   14.076245642417781
my friend replied porthos i leave fishing to mousqueton it is a vulgar pleasure but i shoot sometimes   12.90164610336005
oh the scoundrels   17.215960256172394
that voice also was known to grimaud   7.313780570127421
i was without a light in that room   14.383048952600486
the cardinal   13.713380103396327
said andrea throwing himself into a chair in a manner which implied that he would rather have flung it at the head of his host   11.05649000300468
the young girl herself generally passed her time in the chamber at the farther end of her apartments   15.483353229809115
it is because at your theatres by what at least i could judge by reading the pieces they play they see persons swallow the contents of a phial or suck the button of a ring and fall dead instantly   10.485450145334235
on leaving the convent he entered into the magistracy became president on the place of his uncle embraced the cardinal s party which did not prove want of sagacity became chancellor served his eminence with zeal in his hatred against the queen mother and his vengeance against anne of austria stimulated the judges in the affair of calais encouraged the attempts of m   8.009168230098748
so in reaching the walls which surrounded the palais royal the cardinal knocked at a little door and after thanking d artagnan and requesting him to wait in the court of the palais royal he made a sign to guitant to follow him   13.558015602465646
that did not come from a man without a heart   9.269113332704503
the one was ali who smiling with an expression of the most sincere joy seemed amply repaid by a mere look from monte cristo   7.9833622777112065
pardon me my friend if i disturb you said the man with the red handkerchief but i want to speak to you   12.106248024654166
a moment after those who surprised by this tumult had gone to their windows to learn the cause of it saw the door open and four men clothed in black not come out of it but fly like so many frightened crows leaving on the ground and on the corners of the furniture feathers from their wings   12.828917311212274
said d artagnan aloud   12.297362943699344
no you will not forget it because you are a man of honor morrel because you have taken an oath and are about to do so again   8.863205518250082
whispered he   18.256542437319574
but athos raised his hand   14.410132180753855
you know anne of austria   14.348783984213032
come this way   15.291668628761446
i see an abbé cuffing a man then bowing to a woman   8.903563476819338
the history of haydée recurred to him and he remembered what she had said of that message and the ring and the manner in which she had been sold and made a slave   12.96949201211598
leaving the church a woman and a young girl dressed in black the one as a widow and the other as an orphan have re entered their cell   9.78202435758094
if however your wish should be one impossible to fulfill   14.666404825545683
but though he held the cardinal s promises as of little worth he affected to be completely satisfied for he was unwilling to discourage porthos   9.444273915682015
monsieur your friend pardon for not calling him by the honorable name which no doubt he bears but we do not know that name monsieur your friend having disabled two men with his pistols retreated fighting with his sword with which he disabled one of my men and stunned me with a blow of the flat side of it   10.621353344863559
exclaimed the queen frowning   7.6157385694822946
finish the bottle and you will be completely so   10.505431603274811
you look careworn   12.909662258618123
by all means replied the governor and he signed to the turnkey to open the door   11.095358543253775
as soon as the siege is over we ll carry her off from that convent   9.251474310773006
and although her underlip like that of all princes of the house of austria protruded slightly beyond the other it was eminently lovely in its smile but as profoundly disdainful in its contempt   9.2592467893227
he serves under monsieur dessessart   14.366346174266305
every word that is uttered in one can be heard in the other   12.489336254578934
of monsieur de bouillon   11.962006823299166
what to do with him   11.444474667349937
d artagnan was in a dolorous situation which he had not foreseen   11.545617822000455
only listen to that charming finale   10.247663992911916
we will try   10.282200946820291
i took him to the rue payenne to exactly the same spot where a year before at the very same hour he had paid me the compliment i have related to you   5.739549760580337
nay perhaps you will even have a double reward   11.85515664506572
i feel a general uneasiness that is all   9.774905120721545
what he   11.305259599817647
he immediately ran in the direction of portsmouth which he saw at nearly half a league before him standing out in the haze of the morning with its houses and towers   13.620151686989718
not if it were my own brother   13.292574201564838
i never had a vocation for the bands   8.890828171418748
30239m nothing answered the baroness   8.857364095738426
my funds are deposited there and you can understand that if i draw out ten millions on the same day it will appear rather strange to the governor   18.000356832458777
he was acting but forgot to take the precaution to have a change of linen ready after the performance said the coadjutor so he took cold and is about to die   7.431496801164918
cried mordaunt come to me   13.92796009117935
the wounded man heaved a sigh   13.170441180022218
ah truly   9.394115392289153
say at once you disapprove of my proposal   13.307342167137413
by the female side i believe   9.559879409643347
will you take charge of our invitation to messieurs cavalcanti   10.527253218075698
you have guessed it answered aramis   10.853917107140889
the cardinal had him informed that he would provide for him so that he should never want for anything in future   9.376321130912277
morrel rose and advanced to the door   9.852274990638389
no i really can not   13.09060950456749
chapter 97   11.952316075861093
and how long ago was that   14.866445722550068
paradise is at noisy le sec upon the site of the archbishop s chateau   11.361215540129397
in order to meet the payments then due   16.131867918523987
he is a charming fellow i allow when his news is correct   12.786478756561248
are they spanish haitian or neapolitan bonds   15.880454777588634
the lion bit the hand thus favored and at the end of twenty four hours the bite was mortal   9.520174971819426
yes gentlemen said d artagnan we must not leave this person the slightest pretext for behaving badly which with all due respect i fancy he is anxious still to do   13.115873306665712
let him enter cried d artagnan   14.634481649858316
pardon me sir replied the valet   10.225162738109546
what will you do in a foreign land an enemy s country   7.269754691890104
does he wish to be a bishop   10.823992303517803
i think you are wrongly informed and know positively that on the contrary it is very fine weather in that direction   10.600065010294294
bertuccio sighed and went on first   9.217601225115171
but i should think the other must be dead i hanged her so effectually   13.103439757104075
de tréville s courtiers and this his first appearance in that place he was at length noticed and somebody came and asked him what he wanted   9.563861914934108
as for d artagnan he immediately repaired to the cabaret of the pomme de pin where he found porthos and aramis awaiting him   8.595127746794692
and who has punished her   9.18517270938456
in my trunks   13.371226662584395
at the name of the count de guiche a blush spread over the cheeks of the young princess and the queen glanced at her with some degree of severity   13.580455416608352
but said mazarin you did not make so many difficulties with regard to the king and queen   16.866990945019083
he was superintending the grooming of his horse and smoking his cigar at the entrance of the garden when the count s carriage stopped at the gate   18.05526621491314
i have been assiduous in attending church and those who formerly fled from me have become accustomed to seeing me   9.548491288639767
i will tell you mr   13.353086311876222
the messenger did not say   13.43557913646967
a prisoner has escaped from the château d if and they are firing the alarm gun replied dantès   15.24057154907584
the night having come they made an appointment to meet at eleven o clock at the hotel and each started out to fulfill his dangerous mission   15.87165817684844
but before he fainted he collected all his strength to challenge you and to defy you while challenging you   14.797218786159668
the aldermen did as they had done before and preceded by their sergeants advanced to receive their illustrious guest   14.922360736074788
to a parisian accustomed to silken curtains walls hung with velvet drapery and the soft perfume of burning wood the white smoke of which diffuses itself in graceful curves around the room the appearance of the whitewashed cell which greeted his eyes on awakening seemed like the continuation of some disagreeable dream   11.126690456601914
charles s heart melted within him at the sight of those two children whom he had not seen for two years and whom he now met at the moment of death   9.682982215127875
such as you see me i am a sort of philosopher and one day perhaps i shall go to paris to rival monsieur appert and the man in the little blue cloak   11.674806182852075
signor pastrini informed them that business had called him to civita vecchia   16.948957621534532
20043m there s nothing gives you so much courage as good reasons continued the sailor   12.989765258513147
yes that is a great word sir   9.949629584518762
a gleam of light shone in aramis s eyes as brief as the shadow that had passed over his face but not so brief but that it was seen by d artagnan   12.348057887526616
monsieur de tréville   11.934269870109537
albert opened the letter with fear uttered a shriek on reading the first line and seized the paper   13.144178790718705
it would be no doubt parbleu if we write to lord de winter about affairs of vast importance of the horrors of the cardinal speak lower   8.563169375963817
hardly compensated for the loss of that which he had experienced in going from time to time to visit his family   12.951619413219593
i have never understood how i could have laid low a head so beautiful with a face so pale   15.49163055427344
monsieur maillard himself   7.972805097481614
hallo catalan   10.29060598812882
he does know how to destroy and that is half the battle   12.903367822695534
but instead of obeying him the servants stood watching m   13.615618500426988
things which in the evening look dark and obscure appear but too clearly in the light of morning and sometimes the utterance of one word or the lapse of a single day will reveal the most cruel calumnies   19.440546861252038
the queen although astonished at this language to which she was not accustomed from her courtiers argued from it a happy omen of the zeal with which d artagnan would serve her in the accomplishment of her project   10.924107922868243
eh eh eh   13.039703276320912
he is neither a gentleman in manner nor in feeling but a sort of buffoon a punchinello a pantaloon   8.875750054806092
it is a fine thing to have such credit   10.104078979395887
five millions on five little scraps of paper   10.430839343415057
the porter knew him and let him pass only calling to him in his study monsieur procureur in his study   13.791846622546316
because you are not feverish or delirious tonight but thoroughly awake   12.05969423597963
de tréville had three or four times paced in silence and with a frowning brow the whole length of his cabinet passing each time before porthos and aramis who were as upright and silent as if on parade he stopped all at once full in front of them and covering them from head to foot with an angry look do you know what the king said to me cried he and that no longer ago than yesterday evening do you know gentlemen   15.209513782997387
and madness   12.691211596448879
and madame de villefort charming people m   12.344541656437347
yes i shall pay if as i hope my vessel arrives safely   12.912355160063283
for example an english prince died one day because they had put him into a butt of malmsey   9.961728178712761
you encourage me said athos i will continue then   5.6058653069294735
i expected this said felton   9.133524166242537
but as you spoke to him you must have seen him   8.605079773934914
30339m the young man seeing them approach drew back mechanically until he found himself stopped by a sycamore tree in the centre of the clump   12.997447451950901
it was then especially while conversing with madame danglars and apparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation that the count noticed m   10.412658530562652
athos kneeling down before the queen trembling and very cold drew from his bosom inclosed in the same case the order set in diamonds which the queen had given to lord de winter and the wedding ring which charles i   18.408211136588452
it was mme   13.922288793421332
in what way converted   16.89152979432941
then let me offer one more word of advice   15.567834356826886
besides what is there astonishing when you think of the grief i ought to be in that i shut myself up   13.473033981518574
whose then   11.343231437638078
give orders to the coachman   13.45895496314819
here then is a puzzle for the learned observed d artagnan until now they have never been able to agree as to the situation of paradise   11.813354828320874
he was induced to undertake this journey of which the day before he had not even thought and which had not occurred to andrea either by the arrival of bertuccio from normandy with intelligence respecting the house and sloop   14.964989578776423
now my lord he would like to have one of his three estates erected into a barony   11.332499951685264
and when he had played upon honor he always awakened his creditor by six o clock the next morning to pay the debt of the preceding evening   12.6380614415713
follow me   14.39320694187155
towards the close of the first act the door of a box which had been hitherto vacant was opened   7.408521655691584
i received orders to go and take charge of you on the sea and to conduct you to this castle   11.168432442636412
the abbé s dungeon was forty or fifty feet distant from that of one of bonaparte s emissaries one of those who had contributed the most to the return of the usurper in 1815 a very resolute and very dangerous man   10.769503011060394
what music   10.839750897717407
andrea s hand left his pocket inoffensively and was carried up to the red moustache which it played with for some time   9.48390378121536
but in spite of all his efforts he could not refrain from uttering a deep groan which however was lost amid the noisy felicitations of the company   15.926243132371688
upon my word child   11.707583076208094
de villefort bear it   15.203722752112068
then to yours monsieur what is your name   11.927189735215789
said porthos at the sight of a pale liquid abundant but entirely free from meat on the surface of which a few crusts swam about as rare as the islands of an archipelago   11.169351641116176
that is to say he is dismissed by one half of france but by intrigues and promises he makes the other half sustain him   10.1151001369244
but said mordaunt it might have been some personal enemy of the king who had made a vow of vengeance and accomplished it in this way   9.303425838510831
these two sudden deaths so quickly following each other astonished everyone but no one suspected the terrible secret which m   16.24608069357805
i saw it in the paper   10.233038151079258
cross them   16.357295115234205
for master broussel who is arrested because he has defended the people   12.936790450868447
the room of the retired baker the evening of the day on which the count of morcerf had left danglars house with feelings of shame and anger at the rejection of the projected alliance m   12.490236775721439
you are determined to leave the chateau   14.024676777336749
you are mistaken my friend replied the abbé   10.26628681363161
he has a royal heart and is essentially a soldier   12.902029313638685
suddenly he heard a cry it was his daughter s voice   13.22827219096516
we are not of the same religion   15.764706984488525
the abbé busoni and myself have a small account open between us   13.293911543201983
woe to you m   9.429600140222348
for example here is debray who reads and beauchamp who prints every day a member of the jockey club has been stopped and robbed on the boulevard   18.03982981633711
i have to weep over the grave of my father replied morrel in a broken voice   7.521100582862698
then bending as if she would have knelt and joining her hands she said with an accent of despair edmond you will not kill my son   12.665039481205662
allow me to give grimaud some indispensable orders   11.791193630691021
for at that time villars cotterets was a royal residence   16.545749385442225
the clock striking eight awoke her   12.048236843419899
let us talk of something else said he   16.033297745118276
what what   13.737050320407876
the cardinal bit his mustache and even his lips a little   10.989520519133823
one was a young man of three or four and twenty who was in love with m   9.79684498204209
then he thought he was going to die   11.892076869835996
what the devil would you have me do with that   16.83263150601691
said he in a jeering voice on seeing the prisoner sitting up and felton about to go out   11.624248969013381
but do not be alarmed on her account   8.367140630210377
when you speak i seem to have to do with a madman   15.575574016129542
to conspire no doubt with your enemies the huguenots and the spaniards   15.984666000866062
it was her first and on what an occasion   5.9089453864519434
that is well said mme   12.010253949836782
the next morning at nine o clock he entered franz s room followed by a tailor who had eight or ten roman peasant costumes on his arm   10.365994543202135
boisgoli let him send one of his best but not such a one as he made for la ramee   8.788320845285346
tis strange said aramis almost involuntarily   13.185883941672929
there was a moment s silence during which sinbad gave himself up to thoughts that seemed to occupy him incessantly even in the midst of his conversation   11.794808686756193
the prisoner did not understand or seemed not to understand what raoul said to him   8.439477500445111
ah that boy will find out some bavarian or peruvian princess   13.540510346734226
shall i drive you back to paris   15.877918781833463
noirtier looked at villefort with an almost sublime expression of contempt and pride   12.188667977130198
the second at the mansion of madame de chevreuse   16.685784060184886
he did his whole duty and even more at the siege of rochelle as at suze and perpignan   14.585225516049205
we have purchased permission to waive the usual delay   14.337957316111972
you are right d artagnan   15.725667973316135
albert led him first to his atelier which was as we have said his favorite apartment   10.76301607704669
and his predecessors   14.808545130244218
continued the false abbé   13.445652097143185
eighteen thousand men and thirty six cannon   15.090026937899037
you must not weep no you must not groan you must tremble   11.392747052571757
do you think to reassure me when you say that maximilian   11.015971039108123
you would then be tempted to believe said the abbess that this young person is innocent   13.085131038021721
he then asked with whom he played   13.309796867894152
but before he placed it in the lock he turned around to see if he was being followed   14.51227838774979
i await two persons and the instant they arrive we shall sit down to table   14.104535090030375
it is not only a valuable diamond but it is an enchanted talisman   17.72707531948122
however he added turning to porthos i should not regret dying sir were i sure that by doing so i might still be useful to you   12.494603537026729
but the duke will not yield himself without a furious battle   13.022815598561781
athos s eyes shone with joy   10.797357579115902
d artagnan no longer doubted that this was porthos s pleasant dwelling place   12.25680156280017
that may be said the count turning pale   15.534538326630418
i remember well that the slaves convinced of the precarious tenure on which they held their lives passed whole days and nights in praying crying and groaning   10.967286522914943
and this d artagnan felt no doubt was the habitation of the worthy beadle   9.250084837277393
de villefort flattered himself that to all outward view he had completely masked the feelings which were passing in his mind he did not know that the cloud was still lowering on his brow so much so that the count whose smile was radiant immediately noticed his sombre and thoughtful air   12.897573014779741
here we are at the camp   13.523891531815663
d artagnan at once perceived the ground which the vindictive creature wished to reach   16.547732442103843
thus shall all die who forget that a captive man is sacred and that a captive king doubly represents the lord   9.311960281757292
i showed it to him   10.536573276110802
grief has stunned him replied d avrigny   10.986679250120194
his eyes rested upon the spot where had stood his bed since then removed and behind the bed the new stones indicated where the breach made by the abbé faria had been   12.29710645872746
all this happened long before you came into the country where this queen reigned   13.092521312093995
do not let us do things in a hurry   9.393698645686515
d artagnan could no longer endure this conversation which had made him bewildered   8.406002788766452
these steps came on came fast   14.823735915738617
and d artagnan was forced to renew with the living voice the assurances which he had written   9.561132638760279
my strength is failing me   6.510715664078067
all my researches have been useless   7.2599995501760475
cavalcanti to him   8.775964807389464
give a ball   11.521493730744083
almost mad with grief and determined to venture everything in order to see valentine once more and be certain of the misfortune he feared morrel gained the edge of the clump of trees and was going to pass as quickly as possible through the flower garden when the sound of a voice still at some distance but which was borne upon the wind reached him   11.062518846622872
why do you stop here   13.823758660265435
the first sight that attracted the eyes of spada was that of his nephew in full costume and cæsar borgia paying him most marked attentions   13.244237183747137
if you have done nothing as yet you will do something soon replied athos   15.337195899601372
well said the marquise it seems probable that by the aid of the holy alliance we shall be rid of napoleon   15.534867548759472
the king made his entrance into paris on the twenty third of december of the same year   10.576435088198036
he yielded and contented himself with following morcerf   11.726247154293844
should we have the same presentiments if our existences did not touch at the heart   18.350959109817225
in a quarter of an hour we set off   11.664567642007674
monseigneur said marshal de grammont with a radiant face will your highness permit my son count de guiche and his traveling companion viscount de bragelonne to come in and give news of the enemy whom they have found while we were looking for him   14.115137840546616
it was worth while truly added the young man with a melancholy smile to make war against the english for ten years and to die in his bed at last like everybody else   12.794691204793514
there they found a brig ready to set sail upon the deck of which they recognized mordaunt walking up and down impatiently   13.415715919456074
your repentance is too recent to inspire confidence   11.73953867681143
but the corridor you speak of only bounds one side of my cell   8.772577488322314
he always did so at caderousse s ideas   11.48410271409661
see that now   16.171854639141692
did you think the punishment would be withheld because you are the wife of him who pronounces it   11.68741754058667
but it is well known what strikes the capricious mind of the poet is not always what affects the mass of readers   11.79272202120869
one more turn captain   7.291174509860882
i live alone   8.357816686904698
only dismount   8.408569692585186
i hasten to deposit these two objects in a safe place nor should i accept them if the resources of our ancient fortune were left to us but our estates are confiscated our ready money is exhausted and we are reduced to turn to service everything we possess   12.096171372182766
porthos and aramis remained behind to encounter the jokes of the dragoon and the swiss   12.382427897683174
worldling murmured the count   11.07065930901906
cloud opposite d estrées s pavilion   5.691997977835015
then winter took his place at the head of the first squadron and the king with athos on his right and aramis on his left at the head of the second   11.21151705028647
monte cristo was more affectionate than ever indeed his manner was so kind that several times morrel was on the point of telling him all   5.469245873771182
will you not come with me   15.419041392412439
but his temper cooled down like his friend s   11.988145940617176
de blacas taking his hand restrained him   15.316318088147806
athos must have become an idiot by this time from drinking   13.238729093810136
in those ten minutes we shall have gained the road and the king will be saved   13.982626887962777
but said franz in his turn interrupting his host s meditations you had some motive for coming here may i beg to know what it was   15.343093491342472
monte cristo suddenly struck his finger on his forehead and a smile passed over his lips   8.860856964542215
30243m i   9.38672526591242
chapter 106   14.701352361862995
to wait replied athos   12.452874365785087
the brigadier advanced to him sword in hand   14.390683546611319
a thick clump of trees and shrubs rose in the centre and masked a portion of the front   10.569332758249258
haul up the cable and draw the boat to us said groslow   10.37450905216961
then raising his head he perceived with astonishment the number of persons present   9.882771757261047
he therefore went to bed placing his pocketbook under his pillow   9.989762308501966
for an instant it remained motionless as one of the stone decorations of the building then after a long sigh of disappointment the head disappeared   6.532192205288738
like many old houses occupied by a single family the room door was panelled with glass   10.37353328812878
said caderousse putting the diamond on his little finger   6.557303823856297
when i summoned him he naturally guessed the reason of my doing so and as he comes from a country where hospitality is especially manifested through the medium of smoking he naturally concludes that we shall smoke in company and therefore brings two chibouques instead of one and now the mystery is solved   17.071204221503944
in the commandments of god or of the church i don t know which   14.229565307571052
the order was executed   9.075625825772963
grimaud was walking before him with a lantern   17.674651109034137
without answering he went out and brought in the blade of a rapier   12.83458056694237
i will give you three thousand pistoles apiece if i can have them by the day after tomorrow   9.738297401019045
but raoul was so happy that this reflection effaced everything else from the consideration of his guardian   12.104136781335187
three quarters of an hour after barrois returned bringing the notary with him   9.337687378943475
exclaimed the latter the cardinal   11.570716954003457
his eyes burned under the blue veined lids and he tottered like a drunken man   13.078203848340411
the authorities were not in a condition to cope with serious revolt   15.342515488855886
plan of campaign d artagnan went straight to m   11.406695505196245
send away that fellow raoul said the gascon   12.11008811704745
have you the keys   7.566832449865281
dantès said i wish to die and had chosen the manner of his death and fearful of changing his mind he had taken an oath to die   15.143162964418838
then with head bent down and hands clasped or rather clenched together he prepared to give his whole attention to caderousse who seated himself on the little stool exactly opposite to him   18.233469985054324
besides should it be necessary monseigneur will show him how that formality may be avoided   17.849973098818644
and then supper sinbad hashish statues all became a dream for franz   9.846286117045876
the little troop without looking behind them or exchanging a word fled at a rapid gallop fording a little stream of which none of them knew the name and leaving on their left a town which athos declared to be durham   8.768129524710599
yes i understand that but what is the quarrel   12.927025200918134
the catalogue alone of the books we read with this object would fill a whole chapter which although it might be very instructive would certainly afford our readers but little amusement   15.441432515597189
the day after to morrow is a holiday   9.579944664488501
porthos paid no attention   16.472535122809877
there s vulcan foundered   13.372843347508105
oh sir exclaimed the baroness you are without pity for others well then i tell you they will have no mercy on you   16.823803950919306
she did not invoke god we very well know but she had faith in the genius of evil that immense sovereignty which reigns in all the details of human life and by which as in the arabian fable a single pomegranate seed is sufficient to reconstruct a ruined world   14.730238360832004
come then my friend we will go forward   15.72031605960914
he turned towards the sailor who during this dialogue had sat gravely plucking the partridges with the air of a man proud of his office and asked him how these men had landed as no vessel of any kind was visible   13.050967382982002
they were indeed two elegant horsemen with figures slight and upright noble faces bright and proud looks loyal and intelligent smiles   8.221363813364722
make one   14.404132024242358
in twenty four hours d artagnan and porthos conducted mazarin to the queen   9.17381547265224
unfortunately there was one circumstance which created a powerful obstacle to the accomplishment of this threat   10.257304356116322
i love and esteem you because honest folks are so rare   15.259788807945819
what said the notary do you not intend making mademoiselle valentine de villefort your residuary legatee   12.123105789675746
he had within his reach his pistols and carbine and ali standing near him held one of the small arabian hatchets whose form has not varied since the crusades   16.139399015578295
and could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this we had better help a man who owes us nearly 300 000 francs and have those 300 000 francs at the end of three months than hasten his ruin and get only six or eight per cent of our money back again   10.54929340655545
indeed i do not know what he is   10.047557072022851
this is a means of communication   11.814744876786806
mind your own business wife replied caderousse sharply   10.97735342183449
oh your eminence knows him well cried milady carried away by her anger   13.618873021810693
d artagnan threw himself on his neck and embraced him tenderly   14.473210731860657
an instant afterward the three young men separated agreeing to meet again at four o clock with athos and leaving planchet to guard the house   12.82432680482598
and it is to this person i am bound to discharge my debt of gratitude   17.27272416080407
i thought replied the young girl with all the frankness of her nature that i would give half my life for a costume such as she wore   9.41841150921763
at least replace the diamond in the ring said la carconte sharply   10.26698238991553
yes madame replied the coadjutor gravely   8.347324606004724
how fine it is to be called condé and to be so worthy of such a name   16.680736427193796
they descended to the first floor   10.189165804070406
your family appears to be a very happy one said the count as if speaking to himself   11.83186715249689
ali reappeared   12.038397706060353
and the cardinal saw at once that he had recovered by a single blow all the ground he had lost   13.510202555460774
from the wounded man s room replied the host   15.905268260623835
i sought for a reply but could find none i was silent   10.900336935390495
i came to rome to see the carnival and i will though i see it on stilts   11.722574559069654
something in his favor   8.878056090718474
the day after tomorrow he exiles me among the infamous   11.388822616517553
and what are your feelings   9.984212813687652
where is he gone   15.19200430209868
as the mayor had foreseen the sight of the guards had exasperated the mob   9.566685863730406
bonacieux accosted him   12.2446415143008
learn to know the heart of men and henceforth make yourself less easily the instrument of their unjust vengeance   10.208629827558761
alas replied he it is dreadful thus to hear my condemnation from your own lips   12.608846411364064
you think m   10.299121326681876
said the man in the cloak   16.39205258110601
i left with mingled feelings of sorrow and delight   9.318523570878067
hold madame bonacieux said the mercer hold   8.663178901360643
a fine prize friend mordaunt   14.240913339706951
i saw him at the ministers houses   9.936987187643293
well said the count astonished at his perseverance which he could not understand and looking still more earnestly at maximilian let it begin again it is like the house of the atreidae   11.946152684158116
will they never bring that emetic   13.640570145473284
he had waited fourteen years for his liberty and now he was free he could wait at least six months or a year for wealth   7.198611659906606
repeated the king   11.71015174358254
again condemned to silence again face to face with nothingness   9.865221486477822
lord de winter believed all that was told him with so much the more ease that it was his interest to believe it   13.09490314887124
he pronounced the words of the holy sacrament and retired giving the benediction which was received by the kneeling communicants to the astonishment of d artagnan who recognized in the priest the coadjutor himself the famous jean francois gondy who at that time having a presentiment of the part he was to play was beginning to court popularity by almsgiving   12.74195607145531
quick kitty quick   14.626855910973484
i suppose had he found another additional vertebra they would have made him a commander   8.667565788736468
can he have and she stopped   10.069003125303496
oh what imprudence my lord said d artagnan   7.748127976843138
bertuccio has suitably employed the four hours and a half i have given him and that i shall find a carriage of some sort ready at the door   13.846153420838247
i don t care to be shot in a box   15.949901663630618
the president is speaking to the king   8.29186776280446
many small donations 1 to 5 000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the irs   14.781653371207222
in the morning as he was mounting his horse d artagnan who felt at the bottom of his heart a partiality for the duke took planchet aside   14.951039491837244
sir replied bazin i have been taught by the good jesuit fathers that it is permitted to tell a falsehood when it is told in a good cause   8.373196902728145
they were indeed admirably received by mazarin who paid them numerous compliments and announced that they were more than half on their way to obtain what they desired namely d artagnan his captaincy porthos his barony   6.251589635220324
0177m what is he doing there   8.111494938579524
call mr   7.525999196709863
my lord said d artagnan your eminence sees that we wish to act with all formality and due respect   8.83586645988549
does he wear them   10.697023421630636
to return after the death or disgrace of the cardinal perhaps   5.875758594744454
can it be he   12.461668871321626
i found my knife where i had placed it under my pillow and while feigning to sleep my hand grasped the handle of it convulsively   16.581848440159156
i have done all in my power to ameliorate them and yet the belief of the public you say is that they proceed from me an unhappy foreigner who has been unable to please the french   15.094255916603508
nay answered the countess i know no more of him than yourself   14.366661558205932
the young man pressed her to his heart   6.779158257432204
then as lord leven and the other chieftains recoiled before this unexpected rescue which seemed to come from heaven for the prince they already thought was their prisoner athos and aramis dragged the king from the perjured assembly into which he had so imprudently ventured and throwing themselves on horseback all three returned at full gallop to the royal tent   10.489088893988166
the tigress had a little one the tiger has roused himself   11.564808188497338
felton give me that knife   13.474130075737204
if the satellites of the cardinal you are lost   12.893230729625326
when the reading was finished he remained silent with knitted brows   12.456799487029976
let him accompany you   11.990967766031142
you are right he is worth us all and we avow it to you   13.161823048431343
the other sailor had already seated himself on the port side and was ready to row   9.746837245818003
come in gentlemen come in called d artagnan   12.762021560340166
the servant went out   13.64266057920953
bazin has read history gentlemen he knows that sixtus the fifth became pope after having kept pigs   10.976787391088667
i can not wait till tomorrow   6.3991648529571705
this traveling dress will serve to show the cardinal my haste to obey his commands   12.881688700559012
how many have you then   9.501321900794343
towns fled from them like shadows on their path and trees shaken by the first winds of autumn seemed like giants madly rushing on to meet them and retreating as rapidly when once reached   9.292685126849326
and i said the queen think that in such a case other embankments should be raised to oppose it   15.65151769313717
and so our division is made mother said the young man affecting ease of mind   10.346033068843932
grimaud tendered twenty guineas to the captain and at nine o clock in the morning having a fair wind our frenchmen set foot on their native land   10.420842526891006
and have you never tried to understand them   6.272868994606059
d artagnan seized the hands of athos with an anguish difficult to be described   10.916992015395117
what more will you say   9.12274031839879
said bertuccio in so calm a tone and with so steadfast a look that andrea was moved to the very soul   14.518259958975737
do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence   9.194914012028534
athos chose a black coat which gave him the appearance of a respectable citizen   11.037958623953816
i sold myself for more than i thought i was worth he added attempting to smile   13.404894609951256
you must not leave me   10.902476183648314
d artagnan felt inclined for an instant to pursue master friquet but not wishing to leave raoul alone he contented himself with taking a pistol from the holster and cocking it   9.228580219336953
during this time he occupied himself in making figures with his watch by his side   7.515652621556901
at once if possible nothing easier said peppino   13.827528757697923
but my affection for them is calm and tranquil in no manner resembling what i feel for you   8.683823574873381
he had been presented to the world with the appearance of an immense fortune supported by an honorable name   10.735303736126165
if he comes to france will you accord him hospitality   5.863650245928828
a man too who could boast of dante for a genealogist and could reckon back to the divina comedia   16.619388082197712
monte cristo who pretended not to be listening heard however every word that was said   4.383887541726587
it closed an old account   13.903120964483445
well never mind that neighbor caderousse   8.128743341840835
but milady stopped her   12.496361609371856
the revolt is at the door of those who think my people can rebel cried anne unable to dissimulate before the coadjutor whom she looked upon and probably with reason as the promoter of the tumult   10.013708605164707
and the sergeant who began to see that he was the victim of an artifice was almost in a frenzy of despair   15.647144434601783
indeed morrel saw with surprise that the men who had brought him had left without being paid or uttering a word   12.503196996653175
she was married   16.69074737946592
mother and son the count of monte cristo bowed to the five young men with a melancholy and dignified smile and got into his carriage with maximilian and emmanuel   10.22416247353063
all at once great cries resounded in the pavilion and a woman came to the window and opened it as if to throw herself out of it   14.612698508144014
adieu said aramis   14.820860613418642
if it was not you it was your purveyor said d artagnan   12.460725478003361
ah to be sure i have not answered you   10.075127501160658
i like a favorable reception   12.156571453822684
then patting the young girl on the head he continued haydée is very courageous and she sometimes even finds consolation in the recital of her misfortunes   11.533935993724223
i know you gentlemen said the cardinal i know you   9.052686860688738
they are no bigger than cologne flasks   13.266415753791374
the carriage proceeded rapidly towards paris   9.647232624438658
stolen   9.2790117717742
he applied his imitative powers to everything and like giotto when young he drew on his slate sheep houses and trees   14.658297791925504
you are the notary empowered to sell the country house that i wish to purchase monsieur   17.890533362119513
he has perished by the poniard   8.745334136222658
with the four hundred livres we will make the half of one for one of the unmounted and then we will give the turnings out of our pockets to d artagnan who has a steady hand and will go and play in the first gaming house we come to   10.800972607279613
take in the studding sails and stow the flying jib   8.688370207694653
you madame remained under the arbor   14.305663401695352
said the sailor   12.006351333903387
i had speedy proofs that the excellent abbé was engaged in my behalf for the rigors of my imprisonment were alleviated by many trifling though acceptable indulgences and i was told that my trial was to be postponed to the assizes following those now being held   13.300629881211036
andrea drove past the last house in the village without saying a word to his companion who smiled complacently as though well pleased to find himself travelling in so comfortable a vehicle   12.37317038396738
added he strongly interested in the route milady followed   11.178277177567672
tut tut   10.53016518492588
exclaimed the queen when the last of them had quitted the apartment you would yield to these limbs of the law these advocates   19.64815372785142
to attain such a point the blood must be heated to thirty six degrees the pulse be at least at ninety and the feelings excited beyond the ordinary limit   15.426109934055592
d artagnan had more than once related to his friends his adventure with the stranger as well as the apparition of the beautiful foreigner to whom this man had confided some important missive   10.945623561878929
that is good to see said aramis   15.458254728295577
i will remain here rush on the first person that opens the door strangle him and then they will guillotine me   9.367992802568464
my body alone suffers as you may suppose   10.912336644154905
de tréville that his young compatriot having something important to communicate solicited a private audience   16.399984645218595
the hundred louis he had reserved for his journey from rome to venice were in his trousers pocket and in that of his greatcoat he found the little note case containing his letter of credit for 5 050 000 francs   9.172533752850951
monsieur he carried on a trade which i have always thought satisfactory   20.047302498632803
the streets were crowded for it was the day of pentecost and the crowd looked in wonder at these two cavaliers   11.403806829023333
villefort thunderstruck fell upon his knees   16.025364518835634
it is with n that we have to do then   10.134018970457074
he immediately fell backward   10.779782371780211
d artagnan i am your prisoner treat me as such   15.657736040467906
there said la carconte as she placed a bottle of wine on the table supper is ready whenever you are   11.728826830724095
a banker never loses an opportunity of doubling his capital   5.68679984343879
broussel was a thing not a name   12.535265287275031
bazin appeared on the threshold dull and spiritless   12.819370424717206
you mount the step to embrace me a last time   6.516577432032325
but the latter sapiently imagined that dantès wished to conspire or attempt an escape and refused his request   15.066052229418622
descending from the cab she approached the door with trembling knees and rang the bell   9.3050846512228
he had thought the king and queen charming at the ball   8.236485928430591
at last there was waterloo and morrel came no more   10.646461104833952
you made paper pens and ink   12.74427152554683
i see that you are right logically speaking said maximilian   9.938586739991731
stammered madame de villefort   18.221415552978726
aramis rushed to the hotel de ville where madame de longueville was sojourning   11.69198052624963
why our lord ruthven the vampire of the salle argentina   11.941095727146601
be assured of that you poor spoiled monk you poor converted soldier who has cut his uniform out of a monk s frock   13.549451328253225
why you poor short sighted simpleton can you not guess who this noirtier was whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed   6.29127112170801
it wounded the pride of the parliament which supported by the citizens replied by declaring that cardinal mazarin was the cause of all the discontent   8.662831420867711
at last it became so narrow that the fugitive tried in vain to proceed   14.79916964673113
but your majesty may be assured that it is not those i do not speak of monsieur de tréville whom your majesty sees at all hours of the day that are most devoted to you   15.89380864837278
d artagnan almost leaped with joy   11.168351221408136
four wretched fares and twenty sous over making in all seven francs are all that i have earned and i ought to take ten to the owner   12.826765586658212
as all this however bore some resemblance to a duel d artagnan began to recover himself little by little   14.265552958681702
it is an axiom of criminal law and consequently you understand its full application   9.118119264487408
and still she doubted the inoffensive valentine could not imagine that anyone should desire her death   13.724173994018791
for approaching the animals who had been got upon their legs with considerable difficulty he rubbed their foreheads and nostrils with a sponge soaked in aromatic vinegar and wiped off the sweat and foam that covered their mouths   8.303163994438234
and where is this man   10.939918968536237
you my poor child suffer poverty and hunger   13.555296684364905
felton was a puritan   7.664646213152572
baptistin looked at his master who made a sign to him and he went out closing the door after him   15.03038554754329
well then to my health   9.24397716469567
the assizes the benedetto affair as it was called at the palais and by people in general had produced a tremendous sensation   17.862167841411967
like ourselves he is on his way to join the army and may prove agreeable company   9.696435879862598
de château renaud   11.800415241071432
thanks murmured the invalid extending one hand   9.475764357769375
let me see   11.577089328103135
the king then was condemned in advance   13.495813504391013
that is very true   7.271854610502735
do you think the thing possible   14.351688830593734
as your excellency pleases said vampa as he left the cell   10.90869617024905
i shall try in the latter case alas   8.75367837559248
your offer however smooths all difficulties and i have only to ask you my dear m   9.641919563957668
in another hour every light in the house was extinguished and it might have been thought that all its inmates slept   8.842285987236853
i wish to tell him replied friquet screaming with all his might that there is a whole regiment of guards coming this way   15.85682118950433
see my father see   15.98220495446325
that s the thing   10.48870091059689
descending into the grotto he lifted the stone filled his pockets with gems put the box together as well and securely as he could sprinkled fresh sand over the spot from which it had been taken and then carefully trod down the earth to give it everywhere a uniform appearance   11.46215413675794
you do not propose anything   10.995018823084525
faith my lord but indifferently   17.35228317317401
danglars have their limits   12.538242697201753
ah yes said château renaud   12.565251081156257
not more than eight or ten feet   10.894738559350065
replied mazarin so you have no money   12.9916271858981
he must then have had some reason for acting as he did this morning and confess that his conduct is more heroic than otherwise   5.785580696979984
he entered the hostelry with his hat pulled over his eyes his left hand on the pommel of the sword and cracking his whip with his right hand   14.298666900928668
bonacieux re entered   13.989843047180305
de chavigny who according to report was a son of richelieu s and had been a creature of the late cardinal s understood tyranny   10.435339478950523
for a time the delightful remembrance of madame bonancieux left on his character a certain poetic tinge perishable indeed   10.804111998548489
should your hand still be too weak to use this sword raoul so much the better   11.716109225149134
if anyone comes call me   17.178442736045255
on the other hand as the two friends approached to enter they showed them every kind of civility thinking them deserters from the royal party and wishing to bind them to their own   8.714920426537336
the ways of justice are frequently too dark and mysterious to be easily penetrated   9.281606319140696
all gascon as he was d artagnan could not bear alone the weight of that falsehood   10.296483684483709
are you a large party   16.6055900658588
now allowing for contrary winds accidents and a woman s weakness there are twelve days   12.502730055075002
what he stammered do you mean to keep that money   15.543669500821089
i can not believe such was the case   11.881091400219733
what does monsieur know this horse   13.809172251893091
and bentivoglio who were poisoned   13.667598165117841
a man is not privileged in all ways said d artagnan   16.1756743087644
then you see my good fellow with a cart and a couple of oxen our business can be managed   10.434300436288181
yes your eminence it is the same   13.993424704182202
but by the holy name of the virgin i swear that no one is more devoted to your majesty than i am   13.01254182465703
well then tell me at once what you want that i may see if any arrangement be possible   12.817028868665773
make sure of it and if they want it have them burnished up   13.603248701964775
at the same instant the gun was fired and he heard the whistling of a ball pass over his head   11.539314679627969
if caderousse had invented the story relative to the diamond and there existed no such person as the abbé busoni then indeed i was lost past redemption or at least my life hung upon the feeble chance of caderousse himself being apprehended and confessing the whole truth   15.59148621582448
barrois said valentine shut the door and let no one come in   9.154610977563411
indeed i should expect misfortunes   16.521492495331287
where is their road   11.723845140420805
the grand marshal did   13.549603545300918
this was the scene which presented itself to my view as i quitted my father after that last kiss   6.3650227995417525
there s nothing to do in paris now there s no fronde   12.122797671623808
no maximilian it is not suitors to which madame de villefort objects it is marriage itself   11.736966776776674
ah that would indeed be infamous   13.437181498382499
i am about perhaps to discover something here   14.709958770377803
but as the second turned around and placed his finger on his lips parry started back in amazement   14.01780576133536
but this is tyranny   13.997195181448845
oh that is very easily arranged   12.266280830977745
yes go go   12.042878289501681
but as his occupation is sanctioned by the governor he will soon resume it   14.083602849941942
at what period can that have been   12.368583625057623
tréville understood admirably the war method of that period in which he who could not live at the expense of the enemy must live at the expense of his compatriots   10.89042032300088
chapter 75   11.592504676728762
even an executioner is not exempted   13.685899295063964
well sir said morrel sinking into a chair you have heard all and i have nothing further to tell you   11.154159598986583
well i will avenge you of this wretch replied d artagnan giving himself the airs of don japhet of armenia   13.521134177726386
oh no for when i had taken out the thread i required i hemmed the edges over again   5.104277869709291
when she arrived at that letter the paralytic made her understand that she had spoken the initial letter of the thing he wanted   10.582028304038632
though it certainly does cost france somewhat dear to assert her rights in that uncivilized country   12.101548599644376
i feel quite sure of it now   11.779189253809928
hearing the noise of the fight resumed the duke i fancied you had about twenty men with you so i came back with those around me tired of always running away and wishing to draw my sword in my own cause   16.50267320201197
while waiting the occupant of the carriage surveyed the house the garden as far as he could distinguish it and the livery of servants who passed to and fro with an attention so close as to be somewhat impertinent   11.33000583444396
in the street facing your window in the embrasure of that door a man wrapped in a cloak   9.54109655073717
the brigadier had put his eye to the keyhole and had discovered andrea in a posture of entreaty   7.354899338096777
bonacieux in the convent of the carmelites at béthune the trial in the isolated house and the execution on the banks of the lys   7.118868641988223
she has sprained her foot you know   11.463882330554776
that perhaps might not be considered a large sum in paris especially said the count   8.844577748156686
may i give you a friendly counsel   14.56268965659996
proper names are not in the dictionary   15.77224023708132
with the assistance of blaisois and grimaud the friends succeeded in turning the stone over   8.813388788938918
your son shall be happy mercédès repeated the count   20.626455703243238
my dear sir said château renaud allow me to tell you that you do not understand that manœuvre with the eye glass half so well as debray   9.029104726398227
one of my bitterest enemies the faithful friend of cardinal richelieu   8.573237913596047
no he cried they have not wounded but perhaps they have robbed me   10.208267490749478
well are you coming   9.34324140534816
i was as i told him resolved to die of hunger   14.238312614793784
how inscrutable are the ways of providence for what great and mysterious purpose has it pleased heaven to abase the man once so elevated and raise up him who was so abased   9.944198471334538
well would you believe it   11.9392829308407
at this appeal d artagnan drew kitty quietly away and slipped into the chamber   13.156347607108566
how can i if her husband fails in controlling her   11.38440301160132
and what can we do there   14.254857235890515
still the idea of seeing our dear valentine again inspired him with courage and notwithstanding his illness he would leave   15.83794164426697
had not villefort in his presence destroyed the fatal letter the only proof against him   12.225649687816071
albert at this moment ran in   9.844511432212784
and how would you habituate yourself for instance or rather how did you habituate yourself to it   8.197032976524781
he had advanced at first but stopped at the sight of this display of force   11.419603433432387
fernand would have been court martialed if napoleon had remained on the throne but his action was rewarded by the bourbons   9.39581718429708
she ran lightly upstairs and with an aching heart entered her apartment contiguous as we know to that of eugénie   16.148936191983445
alas sir said monte cristo this spectacle is neither strange to my eye nor my thought   15.326943490177428
said he does not the count know where the house he purchases is situated   8.237859547916631
let monsieur grimaud go in monsieur mouston   13.647154928525419
it was only a deep affection that could make me take root again and drag me back to life   16.104707882068425
today is the 30th   13.26307810918396
the duke saluted and retired   13.62215580667209
at that moment a man appeared in the doorway almost as pale as those in the chamber   7.723877692501443
so you renounce the world then forever   5.722345540331647
the cry of terror which was stopped on noirtier s lips seemed to start from his eyes   13.669182538249897
no sir he died of brain fever in dreadful agony   15.74885048461295
oh it is very well as a finish to the toilet   11.634004349422815
d artagnan advanced   11.736368235077142
but for the moment let us separate   12.47665409710922
the horse and cabriolet were concealed behind a small ruin where morrel had often waited   7.073703466118765
their demand was fair and the chief inclined his head in sign of acquiescence   10.040568668428719
but the reverse is the case   14.956039936948304
yes but they will make you then sign your declaration and confront you with him you have denounced   13.17272089153125
the door is locked   13.695369650680137
a priest can understand a father s grief   16.102221891027433
prince or not said the man open   16.857179425939837
the pickaxe descended or rather fell   14.946407712798717
well i will do better mercédès   9.203282779738561
you have continued your course of villany   13.256033599885892
without reckoning that he dresses as nobody else can said porthos   7.80518694281582
i am sick of it my mind preys on itself   15.897540709155514
ah you see well what does that prove   11.760231490451918
you are at your journey s end   10.941932699813645
ah noble fellow   11.909038392147346
commissary   10.64616653437341
well said felton only promise till you have seen me again   15.905388753942399
said others   7.692260554726937
monsieur you act wrongly in endeavoring to mortify me said d artagnan in whom the natural quarrelsome spirit began to speak more loudly than his pacific resolutions   10.921430899223477
the count of morcerf alone was ignorant of the news   15.201919688133966
said athos do you regret you have not shed our blood   12.93188892921422
like the gulf between me and the past there is an abyss between you edmond and the rest of mankind   12.503999804650334
determined to bear it no longer she arose and left the room   8.723548874632078
it was because you loved me was it not count   10.317919543830651
well said athos when aramis and he were in the boat again are you beginning to be convinced that we should have done a bad turn to all these people in arresting mazarin   10.51261290800737
or if she did it was only in the same way in which i think of her   14.348463698554884
i did not even draw my sword but i took him who offended me round the body and threw him out of the window   11.874011315325676
noirtier even she would have been constrained to pity him   7.232633871043169
these were his own words of that i am certain   16.121294807785002
you can not go wrong the road is bordered by trees on both sides   6.562937976292565
why for heaven s sake are your eyes like cats that you can see to work in the dark   7.511831035851886
certainly continued danglars the sacrifice was no trifling one when the beauty of the bride is concerned   10.080556258760064
his first idea was to breathe that he might know whether he was wounded   13.876296150583515
monsieur has promised me not to open his mouth about the procurator s wife and not to say a word of the wound   15.872775821774628
by an incredible effort of will i even raised myself up but only to sink down again immediately and to fall into the arms of my persecutor   11.40930753005731
the soldiers you believe to be dying with hunger worn out with fatigue ready to desert gather like atoms of snow about the rolling ball as it hastens onward   13.847775414090624
antoinette is very well he said and madeleine tolerably so   12.139427964867867
said the astonished athos   7.86688695838125
one of the gates began to yield   11.368415007977003
as she was coming down she thought she recognized the french officer who had been sent to constantinople and in whom my father placed so much confidence   10.643042521462212
there was a brief silence   6.16114480934405
he did not wish to hear from another what he had himself said to planchet   7.9305467852254665
i shall be at your orders said monte cristo bowing   16.75903328701346
he invited me to a hunting party on his property in the month of september 1646   13.16306814332573
the banker saw the carriage of the count enter the courtyard and advanced to meet him with a sad though affable smile   18.07080628428889
but cried the bandit that is only another way of killing me   8.904743063516861
this speech was heard by porthos in the same sense as if it had still been in the year 1640 and related to the true cardinal   9.687280119525095
hunting for the equipments the most preoccupied of the four friends was certainly d artagnan although he in his quality of guardsman would be much more easily equipped than messieurs the musketeers who were all of high rank   16.458353816165573
at his first coming he had not said a word of love to mercédès   18.121052750510565
is the young guardsman at home   10.710592399515548
the parisian army had organized with the promptness characteristic of the bourgeois whenever they are moved by any sentiment whatever to disguise themselves as soldiers   12.404970916934554
but he one day opened it before porthos and porthos was convinced that this coffer contained nothing but letters and papers love letters and family papers no doubt   11.694832248264948
and so much the more readily as a letter received this morning from my father summons me to paris in consequence of a treaty of marriage my dear franz do not smile i beg of you with a family of high standing and connected with the very cream of parisian society   11.112197394664832
0341m i understand you allowed matters to take their course that was all   11.855689928635952
we might say that was his dream   12.69991190726125
you know madame how suddenly i snatched him from those phials which he so imprudently touched   12.2330424461729
meanwhile madame danglars veiled and uneasy awaited the return of debray in the little green room seated between two baskets of flowers which she had that morning sent and which it must be confessed debray had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his absence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman   10.868206074043012
but read this paper today   15.932065409743444
in his time they armed gentlemen not disarmed them   13.97973474458678
dantès went and cut the strongest olive tree he could find stripped off its branches inserted it in the hole and used it as a lever   16.82077724421228
milady pale as a corpse endeavored to cry out   9.153203780172145
has anyone shown the mercy towards me that you now ask at my hands   13.120274854805867
all right all right said the jailer   9.724151193159909
one of them is trembling with fever having failed to adapt himself to this charming country of yours and the other is a knight of malta as timid as a young girl   10.47983167529395
my friend said he one never has too much money   13.36187050141111
villefort astonished at this reply which he by no means expected started like a soldier who feels the blow levelled at him over the armor he wears and a curl of his disdainful lip indicated that from that moment he noted in the tablets of his brain that the count of monte cristo was by no means a highly bred gentleman   12.702124697687843
he hopes so maximilian   15.622499495770988
i will no longer detain you m   11.517257093032516
why yes replied the count   14.793767012859897
he asked himself   6.773807759335655
danglars was a coward but did not wish to appear so   11.702608827587701
and in whose behalf are you looking for them   11.702916974334311
eugénie ordered the porter to put down the portmanteau gave him some pieces of money and having rapped at the shutter sent him away   14.484820964150018
ah sir said he tell me what is the matter with me   8.980070568286523
then the cardinal whatever he said very well knew that the horror of bloodshed in this encounter in which frenchman would combat against frenchman was a retrograde movement of sixty years impressed upon his policy   12.86543203574312
she listened and she heard nothing   5.6709973932889195
i my lord answered the gascon i differ from monsieur d herblay entirely as to the last point though i agree with him on the first   14.742506606413372
and in the evening i took a spade and dug in the corner of the garden where i had concealed my treasure   5.808505476267564
caderousse s hands still grasped the gold and bank notes and la carconte called up her sweetest smiles while welcoming the reappearance of their guest   11.12022129768052
the monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious foundation and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground   12.835918900465025
without divulging his secret dantès could not give sufficiently clear instructions to an agent   16.990666496535788
morrel a sailor is attached to his ship but still more to his life so we did not wait to be told twice   11.44980465934675
did you ever see anything more perfect than her acting   11.74118344318392
replied the swiss   10.038306728159416
but will you not go up   11.146069450951984
ridiculous   11.165471876195314
you noticed that i didn t breathe a word as to the purpose of our visit   16.611056862326976
act prudently   4.15837051643455
noirtier made a sign that they did   7.760867805138793
on the first story do you see there is the anteroom and the drawing room   13.517618042900784
these gentlemen are with me said winter   16.91728630253353
but exclaimed the abbé suddenly you were there yourself   12.843601941881415
i m hit in the other side   13.784025196266223
now sir i am listening go on   18.74373357655102
bonacieux throwing herself between the combatants and seizing the swords with her hands   10.834179923486378
the breakfast hour arrived but m   16.5645319607676
i pretended to pour out water from the jug but i only drank that which i had saved in my glass   12.764334125287537
well then said groslow bring them with you   16.75013737544302
i only await one thing before following your advice   12.044592753956204
i thought that calumny was stifled or extinct   4.38896585038426
and these two mortal enemies were in as close an embrace as if they had been brothers   8.650254124309013
and it was no bad one i believe since here we are   10.459029563096465
well then   6.927513414155263
i sometimes dream that s all   11.483619744419236
ah the young rascal stealing in a garden he does not know where that may lead him to   10.207345734485028
danglars any reason   6.961217771553539
but whence did these impediments arise   11.938738266128656
i hope at least that you may be mistaken   12.35801644349755
i will take all the consequences upon myself   12.81006370183029
then resuming his mild air you are deceived gentlemen said he this handkerchief is not mine and i can not fancy why monsieur has taken it into his head to offer it to me rather than to one of you   13.847707215556452
but scarcely had he expressed his request when the unknown who remained standing before the musketeer drew back with signs of terror and refused   11.163567253723157
porthos i doubt if you can wear it   16.15792216347165
scarcely had i finished my repast when i felt myself sink by degrees into a strange torpor   8.906554557026217
the falsehood would then lie at my door and as i am not a gentleman i may be allowed to lie   16.07562680651256
then you don t believe me   10.207722383723244
then you accept his offer   9.699951560885534
it was nearly eight o clock when they set out again   14.55317342712595
morrel does not know my name   10.090020223127924
but d artagnan confined himself to telling them that m   11.254361415239066
but all three reflected upon the youth of d artagnan and dreaded his inexperience   2.957338530651187
i am for you not only a protector but a friend   12.924893759432866
the part she plays pardieu   11.246338649429998
anne blushed and buried her face in her hands   12.154572308307259
every minute she had expected that it would vanish and give place to another vision   10.955197585271666
cardinal mazarin   16.150156290829372
it is through my grandfather s room   12.005613443736761
chastised monsieur   9.04556565319292
good thought d artagnan   17.362985441126305
his companions followed his example   12.852433572460498
i believe if she had not been laden and i had been her master he would have bought her   12.1853287953981
alas to many the path is traced by tears   13.803386511102952
when landing at portsmouth milady was an englishwoman whom the persecutions of the french drove from la rochelle   12.270047265138913
noirtier has received without any detriment to his mental faculties   12.585432294739272
still as he was the very perfection of a door keeper he made up his mind not to tell his wife   9.989092290266278
40212m sir replied danglars pale with anger and fear i warn you when i have the misfortune to meet with a mad dog i kill it   15.615841603836493
i have already told you father that woman under that angelic appearance had an infernal soul and when i saw her when i recalled all the evil she had done to me to you   13.701323056557884
sinbad started and looked fixedly at him as he replied what makes you suppose so   11.59853555532945
oh what a magnificent jewel   9.751452930147684
when you have finished your story god and i will judge   16.95549863795479
milady uttered a cry of terror and sank upon her knees   10.635346040483599
albert appeared not to notice this remark which was however so rude that madame danglars blushed   10.156330365058523
i play with monsieur du vallon every night   10.368054353729745
they are names of shepherds   8.640396628934072
i should like however to know what this letter addressed to tréville contains   7.624363607492927
and how is your wrist   5.786033330229558
yours is a noble nature   18.07636587767321
light me m   9.886002976759976
no with the baron   13.58440311041443
he acknowledged the extreme kindness which had been shown him by the banker s family in which he had been received as a son and where besides his warmest affections had found an object on which to centre in mademoiselle danglars   8.94526049089579
dantès had exhausted all human resources and he then turned to god   7.716373932753916
but your host behaves very well toward you as it appears my dear porthos said d artagnan directing the sick man s attention to the full stewpans and the empty bottles   8.549443741135537
i am a gentleman born and my blood is warm as you may have remarked my dear d artagnan   13.179824952261347
d artagnan had calculated that in not going at once to the palais royal he would give comminges time to arrive before him and consequently to make the cardinal acquainted with the eminent services which he d artagnan and his friend had rendered to the queen s party in the morning   16.65767376875384
they had passed the tête de mort were now off the anse du pharo and about to double the battery   13.665387724715655
but which i must impart to you monsieur for you alone can assist me in the mission i have just received from her majesty   15.5695303013153
now when i am an abbé i say as few masses as i can   10.813432211791179
dear friend said porthos you appear to be in a somewhat better humor to day than you were yesterday   15.877191455115929
albert remained quite bewildered with all that he had seen and heard   12.993426772076589
there may be spies about   11.117425380542338
i knew a man who like you had fixed all his hopes of happiness upon a woman   7.908301936672198
but on taking this knife felton a terrible idea occurred to me   12.271512982138992
that evening the three musketeers were informed of the honor accorded them   11.974774641049
that she might not appear to fail in her promise to maximilian she proposed to mademoiselle danglars that they should take a walk in the garden being anxious to show that the delay which was doubtless a cause of vexation to him was not occasioned by any neglect on her part   10.2601961265777
it was noirtier the lemonade was intended for it is noirtier logically speaking who drank it   16.461572612116058
sire they are the results of an examination which i have made of a man of marseilles whom i have watched for some time and arrested on the day of my departure   12.167043564733355
i am sorry to have had anything to do with this matter   14.803907774405808
what troubles me is the idea of defeat   10.276686655375277
he told me to watch you   11.413326185374128
mazarin rose   9.607384139361692
and now madame till i see you again   13.821306263171847
to take my orders from the coadjutor and to see if we can not wake up mazarin a little   6.713928814755828
the queen shook her head despairingly   12.977733748513527
that is another thing he was recommended to me by a good abbé who may be deceived   12.062358148210027
i have promised to escort to the académie a greek princess of my acquaintance who has never seen your grand opera and who relies on me to conduct her thither   10.898159787376954
come count said raoul who seemed instinctively to dislike the vicinity of the augustine   8.987276533630407
fortunately he recovered   13.558746335808436
now said d artagnan you wouldn t be sorry to understand the plot would you porthos   12.069701181691784
asked the groom   8.757915859660516
therefore my dear mr   12.274442001907634
the whole of the next day was spent in preparations for departure   10.140906884170453
but as regards poor unfortunate creatures whose only crime consists in having mixed themselves up in political intrigues why that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit   7.4323400203866505
remember my words if you return home safely i shall believe god has forgiven you and i will forgive you also   6.89179311757169
if they kill you english justice will be under an obligation to me for having saved it trouble   9.202004342804386
but said the englishman this looks very much like a suspension of payment   17.924278062832418
come haydée come   7.490425518073758
i succeeded in deciphering your name under the blood with which the letter was stained replied monte cristo amid the general outburst of amazement   13.22930305653227
cried he springing up is it really you   9.42907584067474
raoul turned toward the side whence the cry had sounded and shaded his eyes from the glare of the setting sun with his hand   13.220587590764952
it happened that on this particular night the minister s box was placed at the disposal of lucien debray who offered it to the comte de morcerf who again upon his rejection of it by mercédès sent it to danglars with an intimation that he should probably do himself the honor of joining the baroness and her daughter during the evening in the event of their accepting the box in question   16.207577438267826
i shall know if you lie   15.699724493822169
twenty minutes afterwards a carriage stopped at the house a lady alighted in a black or dark blue dress and always thickly veiled   8.549779069840927
meddle with your musketeers and do not annoy me in this way   13.056274849238786
this woman entered and approaching milady s bed offered her services   15.40051998172696
on arriving at its gates they were astounded to see the threatening aspect of the capital   13.61237358755477
well i think andrea stopped and looked around   12.639737247318205
the epithet as may be easily understood resounded to the very bottom of d artagnan s heart   9.424638451308882
i think she wants to ride on horseback   11.275210247484917
it is no business of mine   13.953245090997694
during the last hour his own crime had alone been presented to his mind   12.195411918880007
mousqueton opened his great round eyes to the utmost astonished to find in blaisois qualities for which he did not give him credit   13.353786292724758
well said interrupted château renaud   7.543545696924501
to be sure i do furiously   11.991646024222332
thank you monseigneur he said drawing back   12.685670369556874
what shall i promise   13.857765472572684
a visitor   9.430026835636411
you are of my opinion are you not viscount   13.809812048021513
he found pleasure in feeling the water trickle over his burning brow and over his body agitated by feverish shudders   11.801104010067144
yes replied beauchamp   13.269628849190115
then he drew from his breast a little cross set in diamonds which like the order had been the gift of henrietta maria   13.205893229611611
that is true monsieur replied d artagnan and whether drawn by myself or another i assure you i shall always view with regret the blood of so brave a gentleman   10.447730256812164
as for my wife i must tell you she lowered herself by marrying me for she belongs to one of the most ancient families in france   12.486700573093056
good morning emmanuel   16.52847044505241
i acknowledge myself guilty of all the young man has brought against me and from this hour hold myself under the authority of the procureur who will succeed me   13.677616005654567
30309m never   15.059793383632861
you sent for me   8.741965531529976
you who love and are beloved   15.720000403765146
porthos is wounded then   10.121954390909924
you raised the whole district so they told me   8.347826840321932
it was about four o clock in the afternoon when raoul arrived at compiegne   15.963224513087097
france has already received queen henrietta and unintentionally doubtless has maintained a centre of inextinguishable civil war in my country   6.663117535039106
scarcely ever   8.829696028375956
ah ha that s it is it   14.494356520167337
and your majesty has in him so firm a champion that it was he who gave jussac the terrible sword thrust which has made the cardinal so angry   9.428456173846335
what is to happen   11.010172432556597
i can not tell you monsieur   8.897144375164705
she was charming   6.395110818346642
do i speculate   13.167485484589497
though the lord owes them this miracle in recompense for the manner in which they supported the pretensions of the king your father   10.810938169324425
at the same time i felt inclined to learn dancing of the danseuse who acquired such a reputation in london   15.292185238474012
the ring a token of his good will which is here   10.62777953771204
madame danglars seldom allowed remarks of this kind to pass unnoticed but to the surprise of the young people she pretended not to hear it and said nothing   12.072904872883992
he would have been discovered by the beating of his heart if by any mischance the jailers had entered at that moment   13.447495070596576
dandré himself   10.060391642378198
this person a sailor of turbulent character and whom i suspected of bonapartism has been secretly to the island of elba   10.223126055367615
these things always come on us more severely when they come suddenly   14.408819607791852
and her eyes gazing on vacancy indicated that she was mentally contemplating the green summit of the pindus and the blue waters of the lake of yanina which like a magic mirror seemed to reflect the sombre picture which she sketched   6.949554809208957
must you know all   12.063487024918917
by my father s tomb said he extending his hand over the head of the young girl i swear to you haydée that if any misfortune happens it will not be to me   9.726078859462628
de saint méran madame de saint méran barrois all fall   11.597796811945768
do you recollect the words in which the information against you was formulated   11.229238475609678
bonacieux was   10.921390738023558
at the rospoli palace   8.89618119420328
is it not true that you only bought this house five or six days ago   14.15176962565761
de busigny the dragoon the swiss and the fourth bettor   9.587625279689483
said aramis the rule of the convent is very severe   16.86427350883283
the two young men bowed   8.403896594754443
i will reflect   17.453293155605998
no one at villefort s doubted that a duel would ensue from it   9.07420670471662
get on it   7.738298661931323
by count de fuonsaldagna general beck and the archduke   13.468752735326309
then that is agreed said the king and that is all i had to say to you   8.185303923606421
there is an excellent tavern at compiègne well remembered by those who have ever been there   11.468291293375488
you understand that you are in no way obliged to go with me   16.205436352453077
morrel reddened for his own conscience was not quite clear on politics   7.87327597546593
assuredly   5.513582016303067
zaccone son of a shipowner of malta discoverer of a mine in thessaly now visiting paris for the first time what interest i say can he take in discovering a gloomy mysterious and useless fact like this   11.469764799275126
i indeed   11.167450080014751
this letter is not in your table nor in your secretary   8.643428317861936
i have however a wish to go and pass a day at blois   9.659920794287196
sire the kindness your majesty deigns to evince towards me is a recompense which so far surpasses my utmost ambition that i have nothing more to ask for   11.59174378187774
chapter lxxx   10.08415418193684
they told you then that m   13.515729099076406
see aramis as i have told you d artagnan is first amongst us all said athos   7.8703509185758325
it must be done said athos   11.49816892400377
dantès examined the various articles shown to him with the same attention that he had bestowed on the curiosities and strange tools exhibited in the shops at marseilles as the works of the savages in the south seas from whence they had been brought by the different trading vessels   10.87519367197279
but you are not the men to allow sword wounds to be inflicted upon you thus said the cardinal   14.421324868474617
cried d artagnan who was afraid of disheartening his friend by telling him that the cardinal had not breathed a word about him   7.023029286583185
porthos left the service and in the course of the following year married mme   14.85457979462752
you can come and dine three times a week said mme   12.41769252867834
nortier resumed villefort that what he demands is impossible   10.31327316367222
execution it was near midnight   14.49385732683034
what is now called the lower town did not then exist   6.413081438116313
it is worth something you see to have been brought up somewhere   19.085342257576382
so that i am here something in the fashion of a conqueror holding my position as it were my conquest   9.211095626285909
we had been to lucca to take in oil to leghorn for english cottons and we ran our cargo without opposition and returned home full of joy   10.671643971900075
the four millions i promise you will produce ten or twelve   12.146628715815307
and what did you do   9.93512021102165
the comte de la fere lodges in the rue guenegaud hotel du grand roi charlemagne   14.037274917110839
you ask me why i have requested this interview   10.743754349846542
so saying the abbé exhibited a sort of torch very similar to those used in public illuminations   12.67274383730723
how sir   10.718349361987368
disappeared said caderousse yes as the sun disappears to rise the next day with still more splendor   10.207378742077621
the door had never been painted or varnished so great cracks yawned in it during the dry season to close again when the rains came on   11.980389505006851
still he dared not to enter as they might have left some turnkey to watch the dead   11.210744050843322
this caused so rapid and complete a diversion from the attack that d artagnan s adversary while the latter turned round to face this shower of blows sheathed his sword with the same precision and instead of an actor which he had nearly been became a spectator of the fight a part in which he acquitted himself with his usual impassiveness muttering nevertheless a plague upon these gascons   14.422747941973025
and you asked porthos haven t you still in your service your old lackey that good that brave that intelligent what then is his name   14.26779616603713
we will grow old together and talk of our companions   12.489694470146885
the irony with which these words were uttered did not escape the marechal   13.929044596055064
he attempted to ride over those gray cloaks but the gray cloaks held their ground and the marshal retired toward the rue saint honore leaving four of his guards dead on the field of battle   14.982324231285112
there are no italian banditti said debray   10.712938788532435
you should furnish him with some of course replied monte cristo   15.312727972190533
well then it is a settled thing   8.419451224556383
you were with her then   16.954750142885857
surely the diamond was as large as a nut to be worth all that   13.278323350884312
and does she try to make you dislike me   11.699899017936506
the master was to get all this out of leghorn free of duties and land it on the shores of corsica where certain speculators undertook to forward the cargo to france   14.99236436745634
and pray how do you know that   8.636857099812996
well where is he sir   9.865290927111554
there are situations which the heart of a father or a mother can not be made to understand   15.75471725703639
cried albert whose courage revolted at the idea of being plundered tamely not make any resistance   12.032329033132592
poor queen already fallen   11.39312200289051
he quickly saw two heads appear above an abandoned work within thirty paces of him   8.053592471055705
i have seen he said many dreadful things but nothing that ever agitated me so much as what i have just witnessed   12.07848672512636
morrel muttered albert morrel who is he   8.494596038054848
you want something   17.056224267051128
almost opposite to us with that profusion of beautiful light hair   11.933127838882227
he sat down without saying a word to anybody and began to reflect   11.134521967565517
in truth at that moment a terrible murmur was wafted to them by the night breeze   9.392451709876791
there was no more to be had in saint germain   15.7998833090393
before he could be possibly set free the cardinal would be dead   9.75027916152283
he added in a low tone to porthos   13.931872260702319
and taking leave of albert he returned into the house and struck the gong three times   10.66414623163604
she met with judges whom her hideous crimes had evoked   9.591388823374803
at the moment he opened the door the three musketeers and d artagnan conducted by la chesnaye appeared at the top of the staircase   10.93785664789159
look there said maximilian laughing   8.932870791594066
no don t be alarmed although it is to a lady that i am going to present you and i am anxious that you should love her the young man looked at the count with a certain uneasiness but at a smile from athos he was quickly reassured   9.611413812615593
how happy you are in being exempt from all this   9.902367854622394
and you would arrest him   16.43270559494288
now madame continued debray first opening the closet then the chest   11.724810911580064
that is to say replied d artagnan that you will wait until i have proved myself worthy of it   16.133220063585618
and knowing everything he had advised danglars to write to yanina   13.522084460180979
who wrote to yanina   12.524798654324918
it was towards this kiosk that we were rowing   10.60319609664608
what do you mean by that you idiot   9.29456171992085
it was one of those events which decide the life of a man   7.838118743559877
said mordaunt to d artagnan and porthos   16.908647887517674
at this strange and unexpected demand m   10.854467281851655
he is but not willingly   14.129487404188662
bonacieux wore a mask and likewise that that mask was most disagreeable to look upon   9.817044310777597
then d artagnan who had never seriously thought of this impossible duel endeavored to turn the conversation   14.093269006791457
and one by one he sent away the guards on various pretexts   11.72110293540328
well said he to me have you made your mind up to take the oath i requested of you   13.77444889216234
that is precisely the fault of the age   12.590768380350251
what do you wish   16.1186413293933
if not why there would be no promotion   14.46154136352091
30139m if you wish it my son said the major   12.486091139065708
what would my good father say who so strongly pointed out to me the respect due to the cardinal if he knew i was in the society of such pagans   14.529450474685039
he glanced around looked in the bed shook the curtains opened the closets and finally stopped at the chimney   10.737583648550503
i have seen a ghost   12.092744138653343
not locked he cried   10.863261595504074
he rushed toward d artagnan with eyes fixed upon him and clasped him in his arms   10.274664679241141
anne of austria had never appeared more brilliant than on that day radiant with grace and wit   11.68177370587419
then who loads his pistol   13.22160602062259
they traced her to châlons and there they lost her   10.837107228562159
had fernand really meant to kill himself he would have done so when he parted from mercédès   13.658002977106065
nay your excellency it is you who should tell us what you want   10.719345312244627
madame de chevreuse was not queen murmured anne of austria overcome in spite of herself by the expression of so profound a passion   8.264678994977729
you have suspicions nevertheless   14.136590937164781
and so continued the englishman who first gained his composure he was drowned   9.600966753066693
how grateful will m   14.072884472391001
haydée turned her eyes towards monte cristo who making at the same time some imperceptible sign murmured εἰπέ speak   12.633708947488609
the eyes of noirtier lighted up with rage and d avrigny prepared to speak   7.68922564977169
be quiet you rascal   8.771963837925654
no felton no my brother said she   9.480434757524137
we will divide our regiments into two squadrons   8.86032457841786
my dear madame bonacieux you are charming   11.513606107462266
as to losing a day and a half off the island of elba he was wrong unless the vessel needed repairs   16.26299857858102
at last d artagnan thought it was time to try one of his favorite feints in fencing   17.719060943254455
40204m then remarked the president the count of monte cristo knows nothing of your present proceedings   8.812528879768092
i know an inn little frequented but of which the host is entirely devoted to me   17.375896413786986
then he took off cavalcanti s hat which he placed upon his own head and finally he assumed the careless attitude of a servant whose master drives himself   11.22033351059503
it was written and signed by albert   8.014272177120613
mademoiselle valentine   12.61304703865368
but what do you require of me then   11.46453514077903
but the eye of love had already seen even through the narrow chinks of the wooden palisades the movement of the white robe and observed the fluttering of the blue sash   12.164029505446747
that is true that is true my child said the queen you are right   16.5634301472264
pardon you   3.956491386941316
can it be on account of the amours of madame de bois tracy   9.152414061663324
tis only because monsieur de la fere has spoken of friendship that i question your conduct   15.423630773684788
the visitor was introduced into the drawing room which was like all other furnished drawing rooms   16.00876292410912
it was villefort who seemed to entreat and the prisoner who reassured him   12.209619231980751
if it were nothing but a sword thrust why then i have counted upon you on this occasion monsieur   6.827006927026643
i don t remember him   6.528964449150637
no said monte cristo   11.390948661146155
never till then had a more brutal accusation or meaner insults tarnished kingly majesty   13.238386882997855
be satisfied said the procurator s wife   16.6442392856932
escape had never once occurred to him   12.754572238935065
the first arrivals wore long cloaks in whose drapery they were carefully enveloped   5.869134224477661
and if you can find another employer enter his service   13.927418027178259
in spite of the gross flattery and coarseness of this address madame danglars could not forbear gazing with considerable interest on a man capable of expending six millions in twelve months and who had selected paris for the scene of his princely extravagance   11.385423068169848
in a few words porthos and aramis were posted as to the situation   8.093171330612783
now as we are wont to complete ourselves each by all the rest and to depend on one another for assistance as one calls his other hand to aid the first i looked around instinctively to see if porthos was there   11.875652268895605
oliva corsinari   15.024602184716297
nor was that surprising   11.025296915085315
danglars reflected for a moment   10.853774056191835
i did not send for you i think   12.360272945091408
there will be in all times and in all countries particularly if religious divisions exist in those countries fanatics who ask nothing better than to become martyrs   11.971038360451667
the order was obeyed   11.123353484520559
i have no fear of ghosts and i have never heard it said that so much harm had been done by the dead during six thousand years as is wrought by the living in a single day   11.350724275614919
why the man must owe me a fearful grudge   12.065563761743162
i have barely escaped   11.032780167231916
pardon for whom   10.14255933489128
said aramis with a grimace of disgust   12.155782840048781
and yet it appears in spite of all your diligence you have arrived too late   11.257682672486972
20079m alas   13.062251460732101
he did not take in the paper containing the defamatory article and had passed the morning in writing letters and in trying a horse   13.507958554644386
said milady to herself at the height of joy at having obtained so quickly such a great result   14.18426718178485
all the world has not the secret of the medicis or the borgias   12.921680815290408
at midnight my dear monsieur louvieres   11.389792105283053
milady trembled   7.635843234928092
nothing is impossible replied milady to true love   11.963480331629274
go on sir i see what you wish to get at   7.945842318135515
resounded   13.618833381842949
as soon as the two friends met they began a conversation which was emphasized by frequent gesticulation   8.058630572533156
asked his lordship   12.645643008190632
a gendarme is one of the most striking objects in the world even to a man void of uneasiness   13.82059921929531
at these words uttered with the most exquisite sweetness and politeness madame de morcerf replied it is very fortunate for my son monsieur that he found such a friend and i thank god that things are thus   16.508028660925167
the count of monte cristo i believe   7.923026555489628
you desire to fathom this horrible secret   9.247903570800425
asked jussac   14.538989147242797
then you comprehend it would be only a question of time a sort of race which should arrive first   12.250208316793058
sometimes he hoped it could not be mme   8.179676875761093
doubtless although less evident monte cristo s joy was not less intense   11.658480761370935
it appeared that i was surrounded with unknown dangers into which i was about to fall at every instant   15.994074268871138
the opinion of all the commercial men was that under the reverses which had successively weighed down morrel it was impossible for him to remain solvent   13.819158089611994
he said looking at the stone this is the work of either hercules or porthos   11.266724941556287
15 rue de nouailles   13.12999521570301
you have restored my courage by a single word   10.802998455377098
but enough of this here is my card take it to your master   12.869493998615404
athos took the letter from the hands of d artagnan approached the lamp set fire to the paper and did not let go till it was reduced to a cinder   13.104710121093776
albert was soon deeply engrossed in discoursing upon paris and parisian matters speaking to the countess of the various persons they both knew there   12.595905805188893
all gazed at him searchingly   15.462155987079583
you do not know these men monsieur comminges but i know them first personally also by hearsay   11.688730779698139
i passed the night on a chair starting at the least noise for toward midnight the lamp went out and i was again in darkness   8.396034688948738
foreigner   16.087234688424473
morrel looked at noirtier who had recovered his self command and with a glance indicated the closet where once before under somewhat similar circumstances he had taken refuge   9.51821286240343
i knew a lord wilmore who was constantly doing actions of this kind   8.001673596586311
i do not know the young man   6.082903219497767
see what they have done   11.763562961142641
thy treasure for his widow   7.99522316846424
wait it ought to be there in my pocket   14.010920800454933
sire said aramis will not your majesty acquaint some of your friends of this   14.66051932410417
besides she had a thousand precautions to take a thousand counsels to give to her defender in order that he might avoid explanations with the count before witnesses   11.493361713827742
0037m worthy caderousse   12.20158808078169
had he better deny everything or tell everything   11.876725381795156
it would be very kind of you   8.79452789287674
i see that you require someone to answer for me   10.686350475027773
the king had not yet returned from hunting   13.557082223135263
alas said d avrigny she is indeed dead poor child   15.119389886284587
come and see her and on her bed of agony entreat her pardon for having suspected her   13.87355646060949
to troyes in champagne i answered   9.711020568064415
who are they   16.0979849760104
no door gave entrance to the room   11.93515129148323
i have taught you how to handle a sword   15.347383762029049
aramis smiled as he remembered the tale he had told his friends on a certain evening   5.490786756267822
i carried the infection of crime with me and she has caught it as she would the typhus fever the cholera the plague   15.40061267221476
inquired eugénie   15.31751813040879
you can occupy haydée s apartment and my daughter will at least be replaced by my son   9.8628790652694
but nevertheless he instinctively felt not to be despised   15.234350225967754
the king looked at aramis with astonishment   11.501922231480743
i will go and discuss the matter with the queen   15.184484374435488
i will retire madame   15.277457953210764
thus from fondi to perusia everyone trembles at the name of cucumetto   13.28546429676225
grimaud obeyed   11.475022902857804
he was even paler than mercédès   15.137851678032597
behold for what end the wretched mazarin has made use of you   12.20798467160457
teresa and luigi reached the summit and all at once found themselves in the presence of twenty bandits   15.335659265409312
to monsieur noirtier rue coq héron paris   10.191042318032995
and perhaps my god   8.021760195207047
faith said aramis laughing we have praised the dead enough let us revile the living a little   15.533544074494273
but pardon me are you free   9.705848318504163
corpo di dio   15.389222065919121
as to porthos all his attention was concentrated on the allurements of the breakfast table   15.497728872769573
de boville despairingly   12.009436712752224
yet he considered you the cause of his father s dishonor the cause of the fearful ruin which has fallen on my house   13.464082853221136
d artagnan looked with surprise at his friend   9.103925241629316
the old man sank into a chair   11.456393538896538
you must not confide in anyone not even in your father   17.4430867870741
well then said the host your young master was here a quarter of an hour ago   10.923048907514202
i forgot to mention to you said the count that i lay yearly aside a certain sum for each servant in my establishment   13.370709718973645
inquired the innkeeper   6.500196122779848
said louise going to listen at madame danglars door   7.741412096241629
john lateran   11.56844046316141
there is no compliment in what i say to you then you are attached to me   9.5611080111339

10 elisabeth de rossan marquise de ganges was one of the famous women of the court of louis xiv   16.832514217598927
he took the papers and presented himself here as the emissary of the cardinal and in an hour or two a carriage will come to take me away by the orders of his eminence   16.009673419010912
he described the youth of monte cristo who he said at ten years of age entered the service of one of the petty sovereigns of india who make war on the english   13.289853648639864
who then has counselled you to take this step one for which the court is deeply indebted to you and which is perfectly natural considering your birth and your misfortunes   17.100315295423194
and the two englishmen who were nearest to them fell mortally wounded   13.372170848203083
o peccato   13.952361282304004
that was the reason of your running away from us   15.164248426318359
i know nothing about it continued aramis but the cleverest the bravest the most devoted of us four said to me when i left him tell the king that to morrow at ten o clock at night we shall carry him off   11.396537262981727
nevertheless believe that i heartily pray that i may not become to him a father however much i might be proud of such a son   16.996473715311406
noirtier was sentenced the day he made you his heir   13.735087306711105
all this was said with such exceeding rapidity that there was something in the conversation that seemed like the beginning of delirium   18.233998432433253
but let us see your plan   9.27304321559978
that is i   12.801085343883548
villefort became livid   7.805737787844738
de villefort s house and a long file of mourning coaches and private carriages extended along the faubourg saint honoré and the rue de la pépinière   16.680586004543528
and the angel with a flaming sword who guards this elysium seems to have changed his celestial name of gabriel into that of the more terrestrial one of the prince de marsillac   6.879109084623909
the pickaxe that had seemed so heavy was now like a feather in his grasp   13.86985660070254
i had the honor of asking you why you altered your costume   15.874481962519424
true remorse   14.455864379463597
my own service   14.38058738715522
when de winter perceived them in his turn he advanced toward them with surprising rapidity   13.590880357174022
how strong one feels here   14.384579253004308
i had left bearn when it arrived and i never received it until the month of april 1647   8.552331145945153
toward midday lord de winter entered   12.209931952664444
you look there for your outfit i think you said   15.903828882849366
raoul put his hand in his pocket   12.660317740397414
and at the four corners of this apartment which was oblong were four magnificent statues having baskets in their hands   11.978689776036507
gentlemen said mazarin i join with you in supplicating the queen to put an end to the miseries of her subjects   10.932964335898786
she thought felton had told all   8.848910744711631
this was in case of ill fortune a means of temporizing and obtaining good conditions   9.551420236324798
and his eminence the cardinal   7.992148221960395
at the door the count was met by the two notaries who had just completed the act which was to disinherit valentine and who were leaving under the conviction of having done a thing which could not fail of redounding considerably to their credit   9.887030522514632
this village constructed in a singular and picturesque manner half moorish half spanish still remains and is inhabited by descendants of the first comers who speak the language of their fathers   13.426618852445545
and he entered the grotto amidst continued strains of most delicious melody   11.378451291755878
comminges smiled   12.684632699379572
you speak first   11.456076771572937
lord de winter himself could scarcely recognize the tigress who a minute before prepared apparently for a fight   9.819193999771297
here is a letter i have just received on the subject   13.466208237285564
exclaimed the baroness   7.992155262810649
if i am not yet a musketeer said he to his new friends as he passed through the gateway of m   11.803073545767155
listen there were in truth at that epoch four devoted hearts four loyal spirits four faithful swords who saved more than my life my honor ah   17.65757576107015
we can talk while performing that necessary task   9.76619052163116
thanks said the poor abbé shivering as though his veins were filled with ice   12.649243033449622
reassure yourself then and say to yourself at this moment a friend a father who lives for my happiness and that of maximilian watches over me   14.517781371678925
madame bonacieux is not at liberty this evening replied the husband seriously   12.200033672039059
it was not difficult for him to overtake a woman embarrassed with her cloak   13.454159707361878
maximilian s avowal chapter 95   13.046156589197599
the attack which has just passed away condemns me forever to the walls of a prison   14.887281299786274
to whom did he give up his sword   12.539587730046712
but monsieur commissary said he calmly believe that i know and appreciate more than anybody the merit of the incomparable eminence by whom we have the honor to be governed   7.97325445307167
fine spoil captain fine spoil   15.21606139298672
the officer leaped to the pier and offered his hand to milady   13.95742101273299
there are many stories related of him and among them this   9.417094074527153
she is still in her chamber   7.709507397763335
just then the carriage rolled on something harder than gravel road   12.88843392770739
give me anything you like it is of little consequence   10.669122095178908
set your mind at rest replied athos   9.885592999607713
when he reached the threshold of the door the prisoner stopped   14.542050845742196
it is astonishing said he   8.81485561218996
well listen to me then monsieur the abbé   14.708362553046346
for pity for mercy s sake do not deliver me up   11.66147859448421
have patience but one day longer   12.052468356860974
tobias took the angel who restored him to light for an ordinary young man   12.030188042759702
but why mother   14.302857957213917
both the great king and the great poet ought to have known woman s nature well   13.392680318475088
if he were minister and i were his d artagnan instead of belonging to that beast of a mazarin mordieu   13.898820606274167
is it the custom in marseilles for sons to keep their fathers waiting in their anterooms   12.025272837723087
then came a skirmish the more terrible because it had no definite object   8.664651573104202
demanded the lieutenant   12.00582550308952
and yet he said i must admit that i sent for you to appoint you to quiet service   9.529036523486868
then you pity me   14.453331121787224
i am on the point of marrying a young girl i have been attached to for three years   10.455049207558071
you pushed me upon a heap which rolled down   13.892902822279014
yes i own it   15.956345886414185
very well only do not give me false information as you did the other day   12.603566575446209
then it became the turn of athos porthos and aramis to mount guard with d artagnan when he was on duty   16.05165787777569
he is not a gossip i hope   7.397151852851072
so i put it off until the next occasion and in order that nothing should escape me i took a chamber looking into the street bordered by the wall of the garden   8.354231905861662
i did not like to go to him without first seeing you   11.893530868050163
well said he extending his hand to monte cristo i suppose you have come to sympathize with me for indeed misfortune has taken possession of my house   10.315426781942595
if we go from this place we shall never find another so suitable   11.852264030408294
and he disappeared without anyone seeing whither he went   14.643664878046302
to lose them even to the gold embroidered belt for gala days win all this again with the addition of a hundred louis without his beautiful eyebrow being heightened or lowered half a line without his hands losing their pearly hue without his conversation which was cheerful that evening ceasing to be calm and agreeable   11.297545426553546
the chief s mistress   11.484141359389234
well i swear to you all three that had the executioner of bethune was he not of bethune   13.93739442275567
oh your excellency your excellency   12.585454133110895
the brigadier calm and dignified as the law he represented passed through the crowd without answering the thousand questions addressed to him and re entered the hotel   12.20609018629442
one day your father equally desperate wished to kill himself too   11.049903809807342
unfortunately said monte cristo one s title to a millionaire does not last for life like that of baron peer of france or academician   7.228213498197184
we have experienced the ingratitude of the great as you well know   13.375715053970916
do not attempt it   10.747622980173345
monsieur the cardinal   9.403701923413095
the young man stamped impatiently and ordered all sail to be spread   9.815014434842437
i would fain fix the source of it on man that i may no longer vent reproaches upon heaven   13.570922380231963
they re entered the drawing room which valentine and madame de villefort had just quitted   11.257161563480015
i have punished him for his injustice that is all   12.9046589573064
while you are fighting if there is a fight he must flee   16.498174372653693
of milady de winter replied d artagnan yes of milady de winter of whose crimes your eminence is doubtless ignorant since you have honored her with your confidence   12.350513843973296
seven thousand livres in louis of twelve francs   7.19899212767388
milady therefore continued her voyage and on the very day that planchet embarked at portsmouth for france the messenger of his eminence entered the port in triumph   10.929823893755072
but you know you will be captain and who could refuse you then   12.439284362229992
larboard your helm cried the captain to the steersman   18.235169407757773
come then and take it friend said the gascon   5.7741817737493495
i am much obliged to monsieur for the crown he has given me and i promise him to follow his instructions exactly   12.366293112218571
if you have any preference you can point it out to me   10.557010058037942
we are not come here sir to exchange hypocritical expressions of politeness or false professions of friendship said albert but to demand an explanation   9.581909939403502
changing our clothes   14.145549006854669
if he is a prince he is wrong not to maintain his rank   14.95362830145842
he had forgotten that   14.04461122933182
patience   8.138064117003301
asked the inspector   12.250716106525964
but it must be admitted upon something widely different from ambition   10.833712063372557
the plan adopted by d artagnan was soon perfected   9.153703936742023
not exceeding a few thousand crowns in plate and about the same in ready money   10.628484176481981
oh sir said villefort arresting maximilian by the arm if my father the inflexible man makes this request it is because he knows be assured that valentine will be terribly revenged   16.995567439058988
i traveled in england when i was young i speak english like an englishman and aramis too knows something of the language   12.999534725244228
with an instinctive hatred of matrimony she suffered andrea s attentions in order to get rid of morcerf   13.752373690464617
will your lordship do me the honor to sup with me   11.968122678190806
do you find the means i will execute it provided it is not to kill the man for mercédès has declared she will kill herself if dantès is killed   13.2428118570678
as soon as she was seated in the vehicle she drew from her pocket a very thick black veil which she tied on to her straw bonnet   11.429538119718734
let him be interred in holy ground   10.969397108964657
for to me there is but one   14.159145739450484
bonacieux was in the greatest perplexity possible   8.430468343337616
this reckoning his loss and what he had missed gaining made the difference of a million to danglars   12.478117169179058
but unfortunately i have very little time to spare having an appointment at twelve precisely   12.763599037896324
nothing replied de winter   12.644818529209637
then the count knelt down by the side of the bed which death had converted into an altar   11.680572724140657
it would be but an unsafe retreat   11.148166355668959
the judges themselves appeared to be stupefied and the jury manifested tokens of disgust for a cynicism so unexpected in a man of fashion   6.568600877975965
it will be too late   9.50294437677068
at the sight of the little letter the heart of d artagnan bounded for he believed he recognized the handwriting and although he had seen that writing but once the memory of it remained at the bottom of his heart   17.290259122296582
i who have a seraglio at cairo one at smyrna and one at constantinople preside at a wedding   8.124918886548143
ah said morrel falling from the height of excitement to the abyss of despair ah you are playing with me like those good or rather selfish mothers who soothe their children with honeyed words because their screams annoy them   11.375751472418418
is there nobody from whose house monsieur laporte can come and fetch you   9.438769337288818
you know i have the right of giving absolution   12.506103795320536
i merely suspend my decision that is all   11.554875786260505
the owner did not wait for a second invitation   13.236536029464766
if we were to make ourselves known we should be sent to rejoin our friends in some deep ditch from which the devil himself could not take us out   14.4610362159606
at last he determined to discover the cause of this stillness   16.507957701492156
a puritan yet disguised as a monk he travels alone in france   14.653688390437658
i will not be caught like a fool at a first disclosure by a rendezvous under the clock as they say at the opera balls   11.35417722618585
i am brave when i set about it   10.545081426713804
upon my word said monte cristo paris is a strange city and the parisians a very singular people   12.911928914154343
she told d artagnan that lord de winter was her brother in law and not her brother   11.31430717415403
i have already signed two will you allow me to do the same to the others   9.24769233108607
meanwhile let me take these men away   14.965585291392943
it is true they might have taken others but there was a great forest to pass through and planchet as we have seen had no liking for forests after dark   13.984106258151558
do you wish to see her   7.637983275612384
nothing else than i say search   15.998336000309486
the frenchman entered leaving in the anteroom his guide who immediately entered into conversation with two or three of the industrious idlers who are always to be found in rome at the doors of banking houses churches museums or theatres   15.017650561916742
it was a dull foggy night   9.384488168189282
replied d artagnan for my part i am eating veal garnished with shrimps and vegetables   10.48036989411085
did you observe that man s eyes while he was speaking to us   18.20579408034029
20105m a girl of six or seven that is a little younger than vampa tended sheep on a farm near palestrina   14.230082873310138
it is the way of weakened minds to see everything through a black cloud   15.299306921228213
i think i should like the siege of rochelle better than this war then   9.660192261413018
i have worn my cuirass these twenty years kept down in this inferior rank without going forward or backward hardly half living   14.159179543071026

this was the name given the cuirassiers whom cromwell had made his body guard   9.591937543556528
so long as he was surrounded by his friends he retained his youth and the poetry of his character   12.406479250006221
would to heaven   9.740043114366886
therefore you love me a little i hope replied athos in a tone of emotion   18.52151083704601
when they were within ten paces of him d artagnan who in falling had taken care not to let go his sword sprang up close to them   13.07485155285099
that she is called so   10.578508316739747
be assured answered mazarin that i shall attempt nothing   10.093003088238543
but oh how i passed that time   11.385609107145003
but how about our prisoners   18.516431498246703
this order i believe i have accomplished with all the exactness of a soldier but also with the courtesy of a gentleman   13.479606825470599
place the hands repeated the curate with a gesture   8.673845605086532
he found beauchamp pacing the room   11.394730732755507
porthos has an excellent disposition but is easily influenced   6.625366164601811
the squares were broken to shivers   10.703138373400824
the letter from the executioner s assistant satisfied the master carpenter that those were the men he expected   12.097054748774122
now it remains for me to tell you the motives of a father like me who has decided that his daughter shall marry   15.07436729299043
i do not despise bankruptcies believe me but they must be those which enrich not those which ruin   11.148957735573253
then suddenly in order not to give too uncomfortable an importance to this observation see raoul   8.170561618357306
the opinion of a swordsman can have very little weight replied d artagnan who began to be uneasy at the turn things were taking and you had better be satisfied believe me with the knowledge of these gentlemen   14.664400724405855
this second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of terrified silence on the part of those who were left behind   14.30077162811033
i think i have seen you and known you formerly   7.839339236437263
i would have done it for half that for twenty thousand for fifteen thousand   9.93856658394993
i am called said andrea   12.773592811144592
but the poor girl swore upon the crucifix to d artagnan that she was entirely ignorant on that head her mistress never admitting her into half her secrets only she believed she could say she was not dead   18.663700879637762
milady during the passage had contrived to untie the cord which fastened her feet   10.340702667794037
and rather than not recognize the guilty purchaser they will recognize twenty   11.778629331689396
he had entered villefort s office expecting that the magistrate would tremble at the sight of him   5.7148059099881605
and there upon the sand following the light steps of this woman who left sharp tracks wherever she went he advanced toward the gate which led into the wood and causing it to be opened he went out into the forest   4.692104036287727
she could not comprehend how a man could conceive such an enterprise and still less how he could have the audacity to disclose it to her whose interest and almost duty it was to punish him   13.117309198829561
cried the novice   13.581676338184518
and the queen at what time is it her wish to start   11.33740188536249
there were sentinels a guard in the court stacks of arms and horses saddled   11.843093618664213
this one will not oppress you by his dignity   15.16703769924829
arrived at the bank of the river the three men perceived that they were followed turned around and looking insolently at the frenchmen passed some jests from one to another   12.112664649183866
yes appearances were against me and i was about to suffer dishonor   12.087758311168956
you to be sure   14.875619430018762
on the landing d artagnan blushed   13.485012268718894
if you succeed i do not say that you will save a king   10.479468382032183
he never spoke to him except under the most extraordinary occasions   10.813225936531353
do you think it will be long before he comes in   17.893315265701208
and taking out his handkerchief he gagged him   14.446163140460541
what say you duke   13.670107596531746
you wish to destroy yourself said the count   15.94328995134297
i must go to the chamber for our life is not an idle one   15.405979962958297
i have great power   13.61286792515683
de tréville after meditating a minute   10.390336515547927
oh my god my god cried mme   8.808299302738819
asked gaston d orleans with a forced smile   11.222035276461378
perhaps i am   8.925001435303233
i have been heaven s substitute to recompense the good now the god of vengeance yields to me his power to punish the wicked   8.774205335421446
the lackey bowed and let them pass   10.759219787540491
the keeper retired   8.058125532002084
the executioner searched his face with the quick glance peculiar to those who are about to die and have no time to lose   13.336889375342166
eugénie looked at danglars much surprised that one flower of her crown of pride with which she had so superbly decked herself should be disputed   14.750503183020856

why what ails you   13.413823661068596
he then saw that he must make another struggle against the grief of his friend and taking the hands of emmanuel and julie which he pressed within his own he said with the mild authority of a father my kind friends leave me alone with maximilian   12.52548255951319
what now remains to do is in the department of the minister of war   17.520103179820058

and must i lose the one to save the other   17.26274081140374
at this moment the screams and ringing were redoubled   8.12665805625844
la jeune amélie left it three quarters of a league to the larboard and kept on for corsica   12.086611865980096
or rather take horse and ride immediately yourself   8.049683508567131
de tréville i was so confident of your loyalty that i required no other defender before his majesty than yourself   15.48539938333995
and if you can find them bring them to me   13.90984787986759
i do sometimes soldier though i am   14.408649022697876
and although debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the impressive look and manner of the count consequently the description given by lucien to the baroness bore the highly colored tinge of his own heated imagination   10.066064423037263
they then came to a massive door which after the introduction into the lock of a key which the young man carried with him turned heavily upon its hinges and disclosed the chamber destined for milady   12.360903230345848
sir i am ready   10.498268150566965
the poor girl promised all her lover desired   9.737044069421325
the two friends turned off into a side street to avoid meeting the prince and so reached the saint denis gate   11.17386931001365
water water   21.383255075800996
simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand   9.365635986403387
why count exclaimed eugénie what has happened to your ward   15.150273446661103
he was thereupon constrained to admit that he was indeed awake and that his bloody dream was real   17.03823808275451
at a short distance a group of two men and three horses appeared in the shade   10.398276816493008
do you not recollect morcerf his telling us so at your breakfast   13.664528336860583
they appear to be numerous   12.84345783557602
holà mousqueton seats and order double the bottles   14.243011385994475
but what if this rendezvous had some hidden purpose   14.92590749293299
the sounds of wind and wave the frightful movements of the vessel   12.699976801710328
you are only responsible for my body is it not so   15.98316848448071
leaning against the tree he gazed thoughtfully for a time at the upper stories of the shabby little house   9.563338519487008
well he sold his business a week ago to a confectioner from paris an invalid ordered country air for his health   12.832210216310058
you must be mad   9.74386482151093
d artagnan turned around and saw the unfortunate man upon his back about four paces off   16.34187250048738
his disturbed mind told him so   14.792691000260959
henceforth dispose of it   14.253562112646366
i see that i shall not only go alone to the duke of bracciano s but also return to florence alone   11.807829977065655
certainly it is not mine   13.959906936970338
mordaunt completely deceived by the wordy civility of d artagnan smiled like a man who understands perfectly the reasons given him and said i shall have the order signed directly sir and with it two thousand pistoles   12.810983692750773
fernand mondego vicomte de morcerf   10.951617152386156
i am fatigued with reading and all this latin confuses me   9.785766481442659
for in the midst of this obscurity franz was not without uneasiness corsica had long since disappeared and monte cristo itself was invisible   11.860459192003296
there is a god said monte cristo of whom you are a striking proof as you lie in utter despair denying him while i stand before you rich happy safe and entreating that god in whom you endeavor not to believe while in your heart you still believe in him   14.497724495853753
oh no dear count   10.110013293176497
asked he after a moment of silence   12.929884156916348
my first visit was to the thicket   9.929315570147946
in truth madame do you think that can be possible   9.587313075961585
i am a stranger and a stranger to such a degree that this is the first time i have ever been at paris   17.85509642749725
at yanina   8.778247891491993
this cavalier is my attendant   9.496278938222602
pass on your way then   8.918727742425489
d artagnan found his advice prudent   6.454806463223489
a felon named caderousse   7.011856415985687
but his son came in   11.290989879524187
morrel to come and claim me at my own hands   14.466493355477086
himself captain himself   12.791205311002319
i do not like anyone to deny his origin   12.628834960144554
therefore sire your majesty sees that they are come quite contrite and repentant to offer you their excuses   15.081040024808733
la ramee carried off all his clothes in order to be certain that the duke would not stir   6.665775366988965

who is in command here   13.400561018674278
and if you fail   12.727975412579847
it was expected that this wedding would shortly take place as the young man was received at the banker s as the betrothed   5.773164697694867
why the good god sends him back again   10.007884744871426
rely upon it   10.807596425310662
i will tell him what i have seen and we will consult together and examine the body   4.718755681458488
four shots replied to them almost instantaneously but much better aimed than those of the aggressors   14.448641546093373
monsieur aramis does me the honor to share my opinions   16.10692408094339
but he knows it all now interrupted caderousse   12.150222691294886
the young count witty and caustic passed all the world in review   10.126362430731195
days even months passed by unheeded in one rapid and instructive course   14.627256393428546
the idea that her strength had failed her in attempting to escape and that she had fainted in one of the paths was the one that most impressed itself upon his mind   12.77861946902304
she opened noirtier s door ran to a window in the passage and returned hastily   16.21514320557031
why you knew it porthos said aramis   13.235145486701844
must i not be prepared for everything dear friend   15.674143206257359
we have made ourselves the constant guardians of our men and while i sleep monsieur du vallon watches   11.432728998771216
the military part of the company talked unreservedly of moscow and leipsic while the women commented on the divorce of josephine   12.407398947361184
morrel seven   11.744950452146439
what is the prisoner doing   7.414985459626747
at the same time they saw the reflection of a torch on a carbine barrel   12.509546066900453
are there not some places where we seem to breathe sadness   12.17440061987007
he brings an irreproachable name which maximilian is likely to render glorious since at thirty years of age he is a captain an officer of the legion of honor   14.776223061122602
besides it were better to die than to continue to lead this low and wretched life   16.315635623188555
mousqueton thy pistols said d artagnan   14.026792550713317
then with a hasty movement he tore open his coat which seemed to stifle him and flew from the room like a madman   11.360696146249893
but god has supplied man with the intelligence that enables him to overcome the limitations of natural conditions   19.40563637269227
love me then haydée   15.187747053158379
he stretched forth his hand and touched stone   16.68563891482288
i wished to see what villefort was going to do there and i remained motionless holding my breath   15.626680514592842
the clerks who as it appeared had smelled unusual perfumes in the house were of military punctuality and held their stools in hand quite ready to sit down   10.952676769070687
how is it possible for a poor mercer who detests huguenots and who abhors spaniards to be accused of high treason   13.777900182583569
one might believe the queen was about to speak   13.751725735410457
if the reality corresponds with appearances i am lost   15.621281671525617
you have selected a most unfavorable moment for your first visit   7.0908317228891224
he replied however in a tone of deep interest i entreat you m   10.615757915905874
he said falling on his knees   13.05014459614935
oh excellency   14.272427791473273
he had not tasted food for forty hours   16.325781245604656
beauchamp was breakfasting when he read the paragraph   10.274698664273387
then the door of the closet in which d artagnan was was opened and mme   11.952967158272745
and who charges me with this monseigneur   10.307704248564955
the old man gave no answer   11.335458679977092
it is true that every step in our lives is like the course of an insect on the sands   12.265115136346783
come and roll me to bed   6.296091054728556
mazarin hesitated for one instant but d artagnan was firm   12.409225282276648
standing well at court whether the king regnant was of the older or younger branch whether the government was doctrinaire liberal or conservative   17.037662670962767
i am about to tell you wretched man   14.161458472488533
i once bore another which you knew but you have certainly forgotten it   14.246284018043394
is it you aramis   10.978028251819996
grimaud showed his closed hand with two fingers spread out   14.681843570660796
i knew there were smugglers but i thought that since the capture of algiers and the destruction of the regency pirates existed only in the romances of cooper and captain marryat   9.625922572742956
have you seen the woman you loved giving her hand to your rival while you were perishing at the bottom of a dungeon   12.49368529944763
monsieur d artagnan said the cardinal sitting down on a fauteuil you have always seemed to me to be a brave and honorable man   8.691782108024062
the latter had received most peremptory instructions from monte cristo to treat haydée with all the deference they would observe to a queen   9.928282968133658
you do not believe in god when he is striking you dead   15.999178298606154
in which the equipment of aramis and porthos is treated of since the four friends had been each in search of his equipments there had been no fixed meeting between them   11.612762720712277
sire said athos this is not a moment for recrimination but a time to show yourself a king and a gentleman   14.367655712494976
at first on arriving at the door through which mazarin had passed d artagnan tried in vain to open it but on the powerful shoulder of porthos being applied to one of the panels which gave way d artagnan introduced the point of his sword between the bolt and the staple of the lock   7.652714184023529
your mother your sister   10.167180111653693
luigi pushed the stone behind her for on the crest of a small adjacent hill which cut off the view toward palestrina he saw a traveller on horseback stopping a moment as if uncertain of his road and thus presenting against the blue sky that perfect outline which is peculiar to distant objects in southern climes   11.691692495496719
compression is needed to explode gunpowder   8.490871953763357
i should dread some disagreeable encounter if i were to go home   11.387712814860244
ah you knew that   14.230042257019182
but you told me the island was uninhabited   5.0363885483155055
well said monte cristo what do you see in that to annoy you   13.686316003901108
cried the young woman falling on her knees   10.159431294637836
they had a youth with them   12.314855896567503
might not this young man be sent by his eminence   8.866146710689105
which you please monsieur   15.852743190612433
aramis confiding in the address of bazin made a pompous eulogium on his candidate   11.745937975851119
will this promise be fulfilled m   12.503604044160074
he has heard that i ordered tea and he also knows that i brought you home with me   10.517127303352392
and a thousand francs a year   11.686403068310515
the goldsmith has heard nothing of it   8.757968651517531
then in the evening i shall go to the theatre   17.359668451170926
because while you were talking with him i watched you without listening to you   14.636032180528508
he he   9.231631381192498
utterly impossible   12.699652445072392
she was a perfect linguist a first rate artist wrote poetry and composed music   13.572786403620906
having said this the abbé bowed to imply he wished to pursue his studies   12.129797939742916
but get in fearlessly for i myself will drive you   19.66117231478694
inquired she   9.853415581356714
so that decidedly this handkerchief is as likely to have fallen from your pocket as mine   9.631955635820972
i am in your opinion a lara a manfred a lord ruthven   14.010131155500947
the latter his heart palpitating more than ever entered the courtyard without dismounting   6.612825094528608
mordaunt one of my secretaries will remit this letter of introduction to his eminence the cardinal mazarin in paris   12.995909217806869
de morcerf even wished to take him to the chamber to hear the speakers   16.004197884125663
not at least till the day after tomorrow thought the young man   9.509162077201143
for shame m   12.012122044934715
not only was the first gendarme still there but the young man now perceived a second yellow blue and white uniform at the foot of the staircase the only one by which he could descend while a third on horseback holding a musket in his fist was posted as a sentinel at the great street door which alone afforded the means of egress   14.251096921443658
unfortunately they are well mounted   12.718313449983885
i will consent to share this dreadful secret with you but i will not allow shame and remorse to grow and increase in my conscience as crime and misery will in your house   10.756719736667941
then your excellency is going to the hotel   16.520547027852306
make yourself at home   8.384937125937931
and dame nanette sprang to the window threw it open and in such a piercing voice that it might have been heard in the square of notre dame help   5.423842652285748
the young man standing up before her gazed upon her with that filial affection which is so tender and endearing with children whose mothers are still young and handsome   13.320509773676704
he labored and toiled until he had amassed 250 000 francs   9.542278577282787
i will not answer for them   11.432714561758901
he s the son of one of the wealthiest merchants in london   18.61920319672961
you are a worthy fellow   7.700882012097511
noirtier again made an affirmative sign   14.857365381497644
i swear it was time for you to come back la ramee and i was eager to see you again   12.924821993658291
said the queen ironically   15.194159560089517
now asked athos what are we to do with ourselves till evening   10.627967178799874
is this the reason why grandpapa has made me share all his beverages during the last month   11.118294128687827
poet as i am i am intimate with sarazin who is devoted to the prince de conti and with monsieur de bois robert who since the death of cardinal richelieu is of all parties or any party   12.608402021512926
that is true said mousqueton glancing at his friend s long and thin body you will pass easily   8.492234298070425
the door at length was opened and a man appeared of high stature pale complexion and black hair and beard   13.614446033763842
how did these letters come   16.843665692132852
not at all my young man   11.160794454031846
during the reading of this which was long the public attention was continually drawn towards andrea who bore the inspection with spartan unconcern   21.00617704858894
the next day m   14.09053962367071
yes it is i   13.251918274472828
i am at least fearful of it   11.818989270034944
you suit me very well   16.809535512790376
but when it becomes known that he has been for eighteen years in the austrian service all that will be pardoned   8.807435168117244
and he pointed upwards   13.707993943950846
oh he won t return   6.991814466770089
be prudent in any event said the countess   13.465695799839997
thou art no longer a choir boy nor a tavern boy   12.667867530181262
join the escort   9.41793689754674
at length arrived at the last step he let himself hang by the strength of his wrists and touched the ground   12.095213412575422
he had asked for crawfish for his breakfast on the following morning   7.262138972487299
we shall then have six months before us   11.285483183373412
chapter lxxxvii   9.630742922253912
she blushed and that she might not answer clasped her beautiful hands till her sharp nails almost pierced them   11.448695159642835
i am going to take the waters you will accompany me   13.087597589184236
at last one day when for the hundredth time i took up my spade i asked myself again and again what the corsican could have done with the child   12.451653875935385
with every three shots at least two men fell   12.128723842824138
morrel to aid dantès he had shut himself up with two bottles of black currant brandy in the hope of drowning reflection   15.882780853695905
aramis resumed his own attire and left juxon with the assurance that he might again have recourse to him   14.147794065006032
in the meanwhile franz was considering the singular shudder that had passed over the count of monte cristo at the moment when he had been in some sort forced to give his hand to albert   14.55432706950565
on his part the cardinal was not behind the king in this respect   14.390309708949983
it was mousqueton who having no straw to lie upon had helped himself to that of the horses   10.260535133851167
ah my god my god   17.584008826826334
i not only permit i desire   10.245933907111468
if you go accompanied by any other person or should anyone else go in your place the porter will reply that he does not know anything about it   8.832040868145645
and what shall i say to the people   16.609169324653962
cried olivain the rope which holds the ferryboat has broken and the boat is drifting   8.30504057306344
faults or crimes responded monte cristo with a negligent air   12.930428026136017
doubtless answer me   12.400774558597519
monsieur said i does it still displease you that i should frequent a certain house of la rue payenne   8.280838893225127
well i will teach you how to behave yourself   17.67254908886695
poor queen   14.825832353361417
porthos fancied they were mystifying him and began to curl his mustache and knit his eyebrows   9.810653493571433
you seem to reverse ordinary customs and come home at the hour when other people are going out   15.429048857879483
he will guess at least   16.42426440981203
when he came up again the light had disappeared   3.354277559057964
you have kissed the queen s hand   6.08881539257052
morrel seemed as calm as ever went into his office as usual came to his breakfast punctually and then after dinner he placed his daughter beside him took her head in his arms and held her for a long time against his bosom   15.595903912992576
the evening at amiens   10.993672541528557
i have during those five and twenty years spared no pains to understand the people of france and the interests which were confided to me   6.436976709878246
d artagnan would have remonstrated at this   13.78651442126139
the night gradually drew on and the foliage in the garden assumed a deeper hue   8.201401169040832
i think he is either a dull provincial person or a spy in search of information   16.078953529793466
20211m well said the count turning towards franz i told you there was some mistake in this   9.56543869030525
a rogue does not laugh in the same way that an honest man does   15.74352729056832
danglars who never had possessed any patrimony both laid the foundations of their different fortunes   12.26728489183841
these three others fenced against him with their agile swords   15.725744186048185
d artagnan who understood that it was to him this compliment was addressed approached assuming a most deprecating air   8.719478118325851
come come you are going on quickly m   13.480110941906918
said the young girl passing her hand across her burning forehead   15.099282573715984
besides the scriptures say confess yourselves to one another and i confess to you d artagnan   11.295631740794231
humph   13.90411539329235
the blow was sped by d artagnan   9.552280694490525
this is all very fine dear aramis murmured d artagnan   11.78286475595245
he described the death of the other soldier and the perils they had encountered   16.08570585055437
you have taken your revenge for the rue férou and even exceeded it   13.155813422694749
he stood watch day and night with a lance provided with a lighted slowmatch in his hand and he had orders to blow up everything kiosk guards women gold and ali tepelini himself at the first signal given by my father   14.3700304539892
that s kitty   12.25171985076463
monsieur said the baron to the duke all the servants of his majesty must approve of the latest intelligence which we have from the island of elba   13.944608358814838
no you will not die   9.711292664662807
we traversed greece and arrived half dead at the imperial gates   12.59364383834428
i remember too well   15.230928961597439
i don t very well know what but still something   17.331730394237155
they obtained information at ablain and a statement of their route was left for grimaud   9.543318092440918
there is no god   12.064195210239166
all foreign artists for as you may perceive i think but very indifferently of our french sculptors   15.147097710407031
it is my mother who dissents   10.303377345574347
baptistin said the count have the other fish brought in the sterlet and the lamprey which came in the other casks and which are yet alive   7.083470186464267
if you mean to buy any horses get them of devedeux and if you purchase a phaeton go to baptiste for it   8.560505190249494
he is a man of from fifty to fifty two years of age dark with black eyes covered with shaggy eyebrows and a thick moustache   13.115355992457747
one only chance was left me that of beseeching the magistrate before whom i was taken to cause every inquiry to be made for the abbé busoni who had stopped at the inn of the pont du gard on that morning   13.51094153149452
in the name of heaven sir cried she what means all that is passing   16.260624716647428
the abbé s chamber chapter 18   13.196026446306986
pretend to sleep louis said she   10.035437240756263
all the events we have described had taken place within a half hour   7.547020935858222
and tell her i shall have the honor of seeing her about three o clock and that i request permission to introduce someone to her   13.239438113318107
but perhaps you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses   12.582963346437616
you had never spoken of them yourself to anyone   10.542708853910156
and he returned d artagnan the ring without however ceasing to look at it   12.782814440541218
40276m listen said the baroness smiling   9.528289447471016
what diamond are you talking about   15.520427012499777
the whole army talked of this expedition for a day and monsieur paid him his compliments upon it   10.711927539480948
the sentinel was unwilling to leave his post but allowed parry to pass   7.801751054857094
there can be no more doubt on that head   10.944657009483844
mind aramis d artagnan smiled as he spoke since we are together again let us agree on one point what age shall we be in future   11.152333230045587
cried the crowd   12.869631859651557
all these corsicans are mad on my honor replied m   12.969247772531055
d artagnan mute with anger and anxiety took a seat in the threatening attitude of a judge   9.586853656323456
my people could tell me nothing on that head   12.159422204125715
he had sent away his carriage with orders for it to fetch him at two o clock   11.736377914039855
ah my dear friend said madame danglars with the same simplicity we before noticed it is a fact   7.367265469738504
50231m maximilian said the count you should not look on the graves but there   15.730893958432617
go on go on said he between his teeth expend your ardor the first day   10.382085017167519
besides said aramis what prevents our being distrustful and going aboard at the same time   10.415694513264288
i wish you may my lord replied de rochefort   9.76171627701224
and look too though he is a prisoner how carefully he is dressed   8.319557794358358
the latter seemed to have resigned himself   10.489334558490087
ah madame danglars had risen and stood before the procureur whose hands she wrung in her feeble grasp   11.97923796137285
tell the count that i am well   13.294489094599843
that s true   10.86381147250663
albert bowed with a smile to mademoiselle danglars who did not appear in the least disturbed and returned his bow with her usual coolness   5.986146882482587
a barrier had been placed between dantès and his old friend   10.336423215419478
they did not dare to ask him how he had slept   16.697177225561788
the box taken by albert was in the first circle   16.56440427335797
less quickly than the women it seems to me replied porthos   16.15386809694519
the ranks closed firmly in and a kind of majestic tremor ran from man to man   10.163673110707027
i do not know for i have never had it madame   14.870086753101507
wait till that time arrives and find out your friends   9.869465707100417
well said he i will ask you the same question which charles ix   15.343244131678755
d artagnan raised her by passing his arm round her waist   14.07584335058897
then tis something else   10.391696019528124
then he remembered that these caves might have been filled up by some accident or even stopped up for the sake of greater security by cardinal spada   10.491159013891023
but remember i only allow you half an hour   13.124786181895532
the moon lessened by its decline and reddened by the last traces of the storm arose behind the little town of armentières which showed against its pale light the dark outline of its houses and the skeleton of its high belfry   13.038794663067572
yes there are and most hideous or rather most admirable ones for i found them ugly enough to frighten me   7.397672653545304
to be sure i remember it all now   8.036793839570059
and even for all day to morrow if you want it   16.542255060089865
it is evident he has been brought up in a good school   14.492020946755193
dantès house you will be at rest   9.769835197870828
she screamed my master is being arrested   13.495240838551767
there you see exclaimed danglars   12.31868121324819
my only fear is the chance of dantès being released   11.535393081858894
his visits were tolerably regular though occasionally he appeared a little before or after his time but generally both in summer and winter he took possession of his apartment about four o clock though he never spent the night there   10.569125389840544
adieu chevalier   7.793644510870571
chapter lv   6.783559812993664
men of the robe and men of the sword chapter xvi   20.402702918610874
but i hope that you will do us the honor to tell us added aramis in his politest tone and with his most graceful bow   9.393695469463053
unfortunately no   14.941634827119794
matrimonial projects chapter 67   18.262989036235027
can i trust in you   7.594088172324464
steel is for gentlemen   9.818821110550076
d artagnan entered behind him   11.290280898488236
your quarrels with the parliament your noisy dissensions with the princes who fight for you to day and to morrow will fight against you the popular following directed by the coadjutor president blancmesnil and councillor broussel all that disorder in short which pervades the several departments of the state must lead you to view with uneasiness the possibility of a foreign war   12.261473739872887
it is now noon   5.565636179911467
noirtier made a sign that it did   10.288197038151594
she was pale and looked fatigued either from tears or want of sleep   9.059568877866276
the guard obeyed   10.357415547130412
your child your son your andrea   16.732978941569066
they are in the hands of the concierge who takes care of the house but here is the order i have given him to install the count in his new possessions   14.16606507168117
40221m château renaud was at his post   11.147669302067372
so that if this fail i am ruined completely ruined   17.35887444466625
andrea paid no attention to the successive charges which were brought against him   12.028348028959742
i understood that i had nothing to fear that i should neither be seen nor heard so i decided upon descending to the garden   14.620261614921908
you know i take but little sleep and i do not suppose you are very much inclined for it either   8.71267469668004
before we proceed further someone must be informed that you know the ravisher of your wife   9.382400385450968
then i have nothing more to do here   12.035230630315317
no said bonacieux but yesterday i went to st   12.499724945194156
why do you not join our party my dear beauchamp   5.0242578183236155
but supplicants for favor know how to accommodate the expression of their features and the daughter of henry iv   7.257988946409047
and ready to be agreeable to you in any and every way replied dantès but ill concealing his coldness under this cloak of civility   11.97844332191258
and now gentlemen said planchet who had not heard what they were saying what do you intend to do   12.45136266563633
chapter 7   10.297763145248089
haydée is a very uncommon name in france but is common enough in albania and epirus   13.072642939035394
in the alcove of this chamber was a door concealed in the tapestry which the duke opened with a little gold key which he wore suspended from his neck by a chain of the same metal   7.749551287636137
you must advise me what to do   10.091155881058214
you are speaking you scoundrel   7.844991703334891
grimaud had heard all this if he had not understood it   10.655801316290578
and she resumed her seat as if plunged in reflections entirely personal   8.349784504104578
and what name does the young man bear meanwhile   8.7168713654536
asked the marquise   12.4314703585613
i have now been six years with m   9.0072730885801
doubtless too the horses on their part appreciated the eight hours of repose and the abundant stabling which was granted them   10.910011722217364
she is speaking said porthos   12.177570230370456
we have a precious fellow here   7.511235773071694
do not forget for a single instant that we are watching over your safety   13.346129142722294
i dance   13.194337470646998
i did not lose sight of him for an instant   7.608348961290023
but sir said planchet with a look of shrewdness i know where bazin is   12.274034655564888
what does he ask   11.215310701726056
how long   13.177252006593655
and she remained in bed with her eyes fixed   7.785894898506448
but mazarin notwithstanding this permission instead of reading the letters took the knife which the dying buckingham had snatched out of the wound and sent by laporte to the queen   14.611646732593782
continued caderousse   12.631928859331898
d artagnan put his hand to his sword motioning to porthos to follow his example   11.829965716479471
she asked with a nervous shudder   13.204759154993486
beppo has taken in plenty of others   12.112016525145135
the two serving men waited without   14.78421702428647
it was then that ali tepelini after having sent to the sultan a french officer in whom he reposed great confidence resolved to retire to the asylum which he had long before prepared for himself and which he called kataphygion or the refuge   8.913783286948469
but the words you have just spoken the hope you have almost given me will have richly paid all were it my life   14.959115440483052
he looked to me but tis impossible   12.342057989057382
everyone is free to ask what he pleases   12.2269199503615
bonacieux and that the man was aramis   12.621499587239049
but since you go out with haydée and sometimes even take her to the opera well   16.369311678728394
he led the way toward the hill of saint roche   18.801802964530353
aramis read the letter and passed it to athos   14.455560144089729
but you pay the score   13.000406317781373
peppino passed lighted his torch and turned to see if they came after him   12.977790028293237
d artagnan on the contrary remained concealed behind them   17.056098753442853
i never play for i am not rich enough to afford to lose or sufficiently poor to desire to gain   14.664302829576823
ah things go on gaily then said porthos   11.056269226846664
wild dreams had disturbed his repose   9.040747336232617
the king again shook hands with all three exchanged hats with winter and went out   14.55055393350818
a wild goat had passed before the mouth of the cave and was feeding at a little distance   13.120158019156847
some of those liquids are not only dangerous to taste but even to inhale   13.942509104695795
50271m then he said aloud listen morrel i see your grief is great but still you do not like to risk your soul   6.663879885510326
the point was then to discover the hidden entrance   11.011372186502653
and i can picture her approaching your pillow with her hypocritical smiles and her sweet exhortations   9.490495789932297
i then was ready to dismount but it was too late   17.079258831051558
the woman s hood was pulled down and the man held a handkerchief to his face   16.746687521365157
he has come then as they told me   14.84940418579997
but i think that god has not pardoned me for the memory of that execution pursues me constantly and every night i see that woman s ghost rising before me   9.913255373474598
at the hour agreed upon aramis arrived   8.830965266159373
whatever command she had over herself milady could not help starting   13.26678026550602
ah pardon   5.518290657568497
and when he shall know what you have done he will advise what you have to do   5.8894058573495105
and every time he passed and repassed he heard a murmur of words which at length fixed his attention   10.431450048152941
but the first was repugnant to him   12.540599688102656
i don t call those friends who betray and ruin you murmured the wife in her turn in a low muttering voice   12.476031940441366
the king and his escort were no longer there   11.418758305727527
you have been preparing long enough my lord for it to be welcome to you now   13.875649757764995
and madame danglars will think me a very ill mannered person   9.45299016012606
not so mademoiselle eugénie danglars   13.775483791569684
upon my word cried albert you must have been a very entertaining companion alone or all but alone with a beautiful woman in such a place of sentiment as the colosseum and yet to find nothing better to talk about than the dead   7.783673024645782
what do you think of this counsel winter   10.52786889983238
the moment the hand of bonacieux sounded on the door the two young people felt their hearts bound within them   11.348426389462364
descend my lord said the man in the moat   10.174687337536017
i am not in any want thank god my living is suited to my means   13.615633068472661
but consider the matter seriously eugénie   7.56136236788073
this fortress was his post as king s attorney all the advantages of which he exploited with marvellous skill and which he would not have resigned but to be made deputy and thus to replace neutrality by opposition   9.463356755039634
only to our host   9.194501626264541
i may be found here therefore help me back to my room while i have the strength to drag myself along   16.29284279791259
the count is in fashion   4.743963064895066
it is immediately and by a thunderbolt that i must repel the flash of lightning which for a moment startled me   7.675354966205593
my dear athos said aramis you speak like nestor who was as everyone knows the wisest among the greeks   7.650643505099008
of five millions and a half   11.617327738522869
well that s something for i have not the shadow of one said athos coolly   9.135990007347042
his back was turned towards me so that i could not see the expression of his countenance neither should i have been able to do so had he been placed differently as his head was buried between his two hands   16.607552822750154
what i have heard then from our good mother is true   14.507007063122078
the monk entered the chamber and approached the bed of the wounded man   15.362016156531297
how did this happen   10.024235839847016
it was through haydée that the chamber was informed of his father s treason   6.912383546229502
but it is not they who taunt me with the most wounding reproaches but i understand   11.552785781524138
in the month of july   13.632237418227582
the story interests you does it not sir   8.866770526987327
franz and promise you the punishment shall not fall on him   5.932160768208464
mazarin took the letter and read it thus mr   10.272667465199234
chapter lii   11.233763841044425
tis done   11.22081872083473
oh i have been base cowardly i tell you   16.724397925043636
what on earth are you talking of   7.349324283799774
the bandit raised his head   5.652852630605281
oh we have so often spoken of you that he knows exactly how i talk to you   16.637643603063367
you will do much better to open the window and let down some bread a chicken and a bottle of wine to your friend planchet who has been this last hour killing himself clapping his hands   11.597190336758771
yes my brother was her first lover and she caused his death   15.564297960408913
do you recognize the carriage   13.94628589967213
laugh at the chance which has brought your friend near to you and monsieur du vallon instead of being in the depths of despair about it   14.428408372291747
so that in the last dose i ordered for him there were six grains   6.269051730689484
that i believe   11.611616897295562
wake madame de villefort   13.00365379015466
as thou seest planchet said aramis whilst athos smiled on seeing what important rank was held in the city militia by the former comrade of mousqueton bazin and grimaud   11.325412827354914
albert held his head between his hands   14.095022209218907
idiot that i am though i have been trying to find it out for five years i never found it out   11.554347052619008
in the first place he had made rough work of it   16.370800033622487
no i would wish you to reflect   13.693539177599721
the telegraph m   14.930857189351354
cucumetto   14.533729065476649
they will be gone   13.028012701860044
said felton passing his hands over his brow covered with sweat as if to remove his last doubt   15.749843199532602
he saw that the duke was searching for a means of making him accept something and the idea that the blood of his friends and himself was about to be paid for with english gold was strangely repugnant to him   11.05617305132549
yes you will much oblige me   9.772673561906577
the light of day reassured me   8.295129223879048
then turning to grimaud very good my friend very good   11.484626072912757
what he is   9.649949951802558
madame danglars looked at her husband with an expression which at any other time would have indicated a storm but for the second time she controlled herself   11.756270168655941
d artagnan thought it was some gossip who wanted news from the capital   8.624864779580761
the scotch army stood motionless and silent seized with shame at sight of these preparations   12.401045886414273
i will call salvieux and make him write the letter   11.38053750978857
but the queen would never forgive us and it is she whom we have to consider   10.284148595382607

cried morrel in such a paroxysm of terror that monte cristo started he whom the falling heavens would have found unmoved   11.159387585242806
yes said danglars but i confess i didn t quite comprehend its meaning   10.422246546079712

i am come to fetch you monsieur d artagnan   13.137715065827225
i only say they cost a load of money to hang and what is the use of them i should like to know   15.335031332037541
we should presume too much on our own strength and like others perhaps be led astray by our blind confidence in each other s prudence   12.936770091310553
well go quickly   13.592782122895464
they gave all their fortune to the hospitals   17.671487135300445

i saw the citizens in order of battle on the place of the hotel de ville   7.226420835364911

come take the lantern and let us visit the garden   12.23645868133701
he however arrived without accident in the camp established before la rochelle on the tenth of the month of september of the year 1627   14.442493972194303
you are going sir   12.25205983638658
here we shall be alone and can talk   10.574860053091829
they had no plan ready they must think of one   15.602573334689897
but at length became afraid that the duke if exasperated would commit some folly   12.915895006574992
yes i heard it spoken of but i did not know the details and then no one can be more ignorant than i am of the affairs in the bourse   13.03784050786649
thank you she said   6.626110348921515
when the three persons he expected had entered he looked at the door which his valet immediately closed   7.444407298143522
at the same time the door of the study was burst open and a man covered with dust rushed into it exclaiming my lord the cardinal   9.097036644261824
the war with spain being ended fernand s career was checked by the long peace which seemed likely to endure throughout europe   6.8088424376286145
i will tell you my lord on the day when you are willing to hear my confession   10.517939572802021
said gaetano with a smile   15.182000176593764
besides we can be on our guard   9.280631546883296
at last they lost sight of each other   10.196053637081246
i fear he may have been an ancestor of your eminence   17.3668119966235
it is well sir replied villefort from below it is well   17.410051668434107
in his mother s laboratory   11.602017291493587
however if i am not mistaken i must be close to tiboulen   8.300211737680918
and do you like him   11.371560050486787
d artagnan swept up the money that he and porthos had lost and buried it in his huge pocket   13.063685419761434
i am only curious to unravel the mystery to which she is attached   11.409309203110215
bravo athos   12.230895582125488
the marquis de saint méran i think the concierge said   12.033218419949092
mother he said turning towards mercédès this is m   11.805490749134053
but these four men must be now at the siege of la rochelle   9.735570882623822
said d artagnan planchet s recital agreeing with his own observations   13.469704155580832
this young girl is charming and does credit to your taste   9.411307790126763
cried athos at the end of five hundred paces   6.7791449287314345
i am finishing the most execrable morning s work   12.823611927847313
i think i can see him now mounted upon his superb animal and seated in his handsome saddle   14.875322324433057
d artagnan had already strode down three or four stairs but at athos s last remark he stopped short   10.456593416440981
before god and before men said he i accuse this woman of having poisoned constance bonacieux who died yesterday evening   16.388447707760015
i scarcely know him   11.112072831876059
you have a good memory said mazarin   11.370872640623409
as to d artagnan scarcely on his side was he out of sight when he drew from his pocket a letter which he read over again return immediately to paris   13.086640085898562
tis a very expensive wine said blaisois shaking his head   8.35738884819873
i go out   9.216772436264066
having delivered himself of this pompous address uttered with a degree of energy that left the baron almost out of breath he bowed to the assembled party and withdrew to his drawing room whose sumptuous furnishings of white and gold had caused a great sensation in the chaussée d antin   12.919463187895285
the major was about to speak when andrea continued in a low voice nonsense i am going to set you an example of confidence they give me 50 000 francs a year to be your son   16.38361877012991
chapter 69   13.67508191587889
there are here no procurators who regulate successions beforehand   13.104958655279802
the sign of the red dovecot meanwhile the king who with more reason than the cardinal showed his hatred for buckingham although scarcely arrived was in such a haste to meet the enemy that he commanded every disposition to be made to drive the english from the isle of ré and afterward to press the siege of la rochelle   8.345396827488848
in the meantime porthos had come up waved his hand to athos and then turning toward d artagnan stood quite astonished   15.786947201841704
then sight returned and with it feeling and grief   4.809286872322881
bertuccio left enraptured so great so powerful and real was the influence exercised by this man over all who surrounded him   15.53834015313518
the carriage went off at a quick pace escorted by the three horsemen and all was over   13.153036411626307
i have engaged the three lower windows at the café rospoli   13.341857303003037
at times the state into which i had fallen appeared so strange that i believed myself dreaming   7.992020046931132
that is quite another thing   8.541150749947667
through you i again take hold on life through you i shall suffer through you rejoice   11.26659208255205
aramis blushed excessively and snatched rather than took the handkerchief from the hand of the gascon   9.97207320070174
she has experienced much anxiety   11.38520528776891
what is the use of going to day to learn something else   9.095161119630415
this was more than poor bonacieux could endure depressed as he was by the successive emotions which he had experienced   11.978334697258944
this look of porthos s made the gascon regret that he had summoned the brute force of his friend to aid him in an affair which seemed to require chiefly cunning   13.200540843748072
although weakened the young man s brain instantly responded to the idea that haunts all prisoners liberty   11.294765247826493
but tell me i pray what has become of poor edmond   10.30479544176829
having kings and better still queens to protect parties to unite elections to direct   16.219055462938982
how is there still time   10.844919449832588
my chaise broke down coming into lilliers   12.169736604410751
and d artagnan answered having first asked the word of the cardinal louis and rocroy   6.750666407783276
yes we will wait   8.99632314611373
but would you believe it he was not receiving   14.204980329272612
in order doubtless that he might not be disturbed while fulfilling his sacred mission the priest rose as soon as d avrigny departed and not only bolted the door through which the doctor had just left but also that leading to madame de villefort s room   12.393157573417334
no cried porthos   12.420387059702096
as these secrets may have an influence over your life these secrets must become mine   11.26756861190249
please follow me and he went on before followed by athos and aramis   10.729511329317692
a soldier of the french army   12.29407914890879
besides this he had drawn upon himself two good duels with two men each capable of killing three d artagnans with two musketeers in short with two of those beings whom he esteemed so greatly that he placed them in his mind and heart above all other men   16.190383383408744
however i had better find him out first since he can t want money   18.026344471735896
yes continued mme   12.110697443018818
he took her to his château and made her the first lady in the province   12.020584410250063
truth compelled franz in spite of the dislike he seemed to have taken to the count to confess that the advantage was not on pastrini s side   10.738579663659946
what friends   8.820894962863594
presented to whom   6.683176713182761
i enjoy beforehand the face the cardinal will make   13.278578777404817
let us return to m   12.616314650156442
a fine thing indeed   12.050295090346818
on the contrary you were in excellent spirits when you arrived at the count s   7.622067269512259
but they are on the track   9.166835154854763
then a window was opened and when they saw and heard they were convinced   10.304208338746028
good day monsieur d artagnan said planchet proudly   13.35176632137247
i have then about fifty pistoles   11.771564500981931
dearest dearest valentine exclaimed he forgive me if i have offended you and forget the words i spoke if they have unwittingly caused you pain   9.459563215349533
then de wardes to whom i have given three sword wounds   9.23201338182162
my lord do you remember the little goat pasture of the luxembourg   10.675653609600843
that i have suffered as much as himself more than he has obliged as i am to eat the bread of exile and to ask hospitality from false friends who smile at my tears   10.343668800464776
he is a great commander bragelonne   12.338912916970278
the count made a gesture of satisfaction descended the terrace steps and sprang into his carriage which was whirled along swiftly to the banker s house   17.420629923156465
madame de villefort has nothing of her own and hates me for being so richly endowed   15.535937994607073
see there now   17.774676303355125
if i am not mistaken we have to do with a gentleman   10.412551077347374
and you have seen her   19.436567041053017
it was not he then you came to seek   9.919905991138858
who went out this morning   16.225651695330328
you see i have been a soldier ever since i attained manhood   17.14563450660694
around this kind of rolling tent pressed a crowd of gentlemen and ladies   13.513046269544413
but cried felton that is a fleur de lis which i see there   11.536582815314766
another i disarmed or wounded i don t remember which   14.78873399715292
then why did you smile   5.8978860847703185
you can not tell me   10.855991549190419
i will read you the first canto   14.2109119772439
one arm was hanging out of the bed   12.618103770857426
he knew the abbé de gondy only by report   10.285480302416241
i fancy i perceive around us faces of different officers in the royal army   17.674940006600053
not so bad said beauchamp   10.366677729296896
i have not seen such a one four times in my life   15.547365079004447
in two hours time said he these persons will depart richer by fifty piastres each to go and risk their lives again by endeavoring to gain fifty more   11.666562238474679
porthos gave a start that shook the room   14.328905554550124
do you know why   11.426700124477286
well my dear mouston he said rest satisfied   8.584635478398933
ah haitians that is quite another thing   12.171575554411444
ah fie   12.411927071484541
who are you sir asked she who has the kindness to trouble yourself so particularly on my account   10.355070953136751
still by one of your forty methods your highness   11.70823362257951
and two or three heads carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment appeared through the openings of the tapestry   13.488343835698538
d artagnan blushed with pleasure and bowed a sign of assent   10.247089529434344
i would make your fortune   10.251461941604497
please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses   10.197236565294315
at the moment caderousse quitted his sentry like watch before the door the road on which he so eagerly strained his sight was void and lonely as a desert at midday   8.712834232112108
let us see the watch said albert   10.114957504961238
yet one wants some one besides you for that my fine king s cockatoo   14.962064534695127
in truth what albert has just done is either very despicable or very noble replied the baron   12.06522363219065
the sentinel opened the door   6.9481881192864545
lock and padlock were fastened   12.801393374201583
ex major in the austrian service   13.464348491445982
wait quietly then   11.526397718075106
and i he said i feel that my place is not in the judge s seat but on the prisoner s bench   12.290710654235877
as he spoke two horsemen advanced at full speed   11.650593022233402
the clear and vigorous intellect of athos would render him more open to conviction than a less able man would be   6.533293271432074
at the noise of m   15.986215144107767
the captain glanced at him but he had lifted the rum to his lips and was drinking it with so much composure that suspicions if the captain had any died away   10.142176017089803
but she made an affirmative sign with her head as she lay on her father s breast   13.046390025734937
but you will not be dead   15.193696504122256
i can not take you however to the siege of la rochelle said d artagnan   10.298577158171623
i am going to give you a proof replied the count and he rang the bell   15.889639419780057
you are in a hurry   12.678513687376451
the cardinal had listened without permitting a single fibre of his face to betray what he felt and his smile remained as it ever was false and flattering   11.887442874715347
now continued penelon you see m   17.844822412825813
why is not grimaud the taciturn grimaud here   13.375153260739365
i am not a priest   9.148410102046284
i could drink four more such bottles   11.99453813303279
almost directly afterwards without the usual interval of time a cab arrived and the veiled lady ran hastily upstairs   9.799084543736178
the latter leaving the shore abandoned themselves gaily to the current   12.195846875076642
he s a fine looking fellow said another   6.941453107546842
her hair was raven black but its natural waves seemed somewhat rebellious   7.145353754883715
and i did not recognize them   7.40737132222375
perhaps by the time you return to paris i shall be quite a sober staid father of a family   9.258828723867811
do not fear i will bury my grief so deep in my heart i will disguise it so that you shall not even care to sympathize with me   11.49073334614151
we want men of talent   14.02260453900434
he seemed to fulfil the duties of a host by sitting down with his guests and awaited their departure to be served with some strange or more delicate food   8.92711793666749
they proceeded to the rue saint denis   10.58050111888052
imagine to yourself a don quixote of eighteen   12.356840537120947
and when do you set out   9.056880379081486
50197m and then he moved farther on and began again to dig   12.308946628169451
each was anxious to gain admission before the other   7.562474347421255
it is a casket of wood bound with iron thought he   10.23072056552264
go and lose not a moment   11.728540733688419
well at twenty nine i saw valentine   10.958734343537833
d artagnan departed scarcely knowing what to think but as he was a youth who did not easily lose his head while continuing to pay his court to milady he had framed a little plan in his mind   9.32683549553427
full dress   15.007630594668267
the lackeys had been ordered to saddle eight horses and to wait keeping together and without dismounting at the corner of a street about twenty steps from the house where the king was lodged   16.13602422964496
i can recognize the flavor of the alcohol in which it has been dissolved   8.781224363117344
i have made a mistake owing to an error in my plans   10.154765083850492
yes replied all the members of the committee of inquiry with a unanimous voice   9.28911464360618
he had retired at one o clock under the pretense of being indisposed   11.248088486745266
the king and his escort have gone this way   15.98818873498456
and du vallon   15.695486028539253
but in what then shall we place confidence if not in the most beautiful work of the lord   8.191122398137232
here is my bed replied planchet producing a bundle of straw   13.365502748961084
meantime his eminence continued his melancholy ride murmuring between his mustaches these four men must positively be mine   10.662881474002175
de boville s countenance yet he made an effort at self control and said sir i ought to tell you that in all probability you will not realize six per cent of this sum   4.555020891680471
the sentinels had been relieved at eight and captain groslow had been on guard for an hour   12.428239570746024
but you know how the theologians in their collegiate chairs and philosophers in their controversies occasionally say cruel truths   13.049963219943184
then tell me who you are and get along with you upon your journey replied the duchess with the gayety which made her so charming for i am sufficiently in bad odor already without compromising myself still more   15.322586441678475
i made the tenant sign the deed of resilition and when i had obtained what i so much wanted i galloped to auteuil   17.033575175780317
may not barrois the old servant have made a mistake and have given madame de saint méran a dose prepared for his master   11.092473179161043
he remembers that i saved his life and as he has a regard for his head he feels some gratitude towards me for having kept it on his shoulders   11.848696778348607
asked he of edmond   10.487584984108118
murmured the woman from her seat on the stairs mind what you are saying   14.266999877011315
sir returned the young man with a reassurance of manner make your mind easy on this score   16.308927035195758
the least that can be expected is that you will be arrested   13.703311695710383
what did the cardinal say about me   8.840506637908515
of course complete ones   13.585283605043752
you are a demon escaped from hell whither we send you back again   12.651323220049678
horror   9.207321556387608
those in whom the king has confided lord leven s highlanders   14.02956794074446
d artagnan watched over the youth as if he had been his own son   15.529146789386687
the idea of resisting her father her grandmother and all the family had never occurred to her   11.654129044478609
then monsieur said planchet you must buy me a watch   7.937580661802247
he seemed moved by this last remark   10.440048311577712
but who is she   18.674215450238933
but alas this attempt to attract notice wholly failed   10.23890373082121
they wished to take planchet with them but he could not leave his troop who at five o clock returned home saying that they were returning from the battle whereas they had never lost sight of the bronze equestrian statue of louis xiii   14.155241703042922
have i not told you already that i had nothing to do with that   13.991740070058379

look at monsieur mouston see the honorable wounds he has received observe how his habitual valor has given dignity to his countenance   12.39052093493154
he stopped at the end of the corridor and said i can count upon you gentlemen can i not   10.789683549261195
to this preoccupation of his vanity d artagnan at this moment joined an uneasiness much less selfish   12.332932097640434
it s true though said porthos   7.92736698901912
oh that coat is not his own idea   5.7556576220131115

you have wounded me to the heart   12.124213174017221
a door that communicated with the palais de justice was opened and they went through a long range of gloomy corridors whose appearance might have made even the boldest shudder   10.601919296169523
listen then lord winter   13.358046691964043

he stepped forward   14.904821679717266
monsieur i followed them from curiosity so that i saw the combat without the combatants seeing me   14.263056232463423
you will need it this evening perhaps   11.884296316232838
moreover he reckoned much on the interest of the danglars to hush up the rumor of their own misadventures   7.0149379351853405
peace brought her abdication   11.20582489354734
he wouldn t listen put his foot on the spur to get down the spur broke he fell with a broken leg and instead of keeping quiet took to crying out like a gallows bird   17.530151992111577
swear to be united in spite of everything and forever and may this oath bind us to each other and even also our descendants   12.347864816509496

his eyes dilated and a shudder ran through his body   7.634158083881151
monte cristo became pale at this horrible sight   11.96427909301654
d artagnan looked for some tapestry behind which he might hide himself and felt an immense inclination to crawl under the table   10.176760678660953
kitty came in but milady was very cross with her   13.26109246852896

the animal uttered a cry during the transit but arrived at its destination it crouched behind the cushions and stupefied at such unusual treatment remained silent and motionless   14.122167066596678

as far as you yourself are concerned i see but one point in which you are really guilty   11.381560632491874
at this moment danglars who had been incessantly observing every change in fernand s look and manner saw him stagger and fall back with an almost convulsive spasm against a seat placed near one of the open windows   6.781303179906119
i am going on a journey dear child said monte cristo with an expression of infinite tenderness and melancholy   10.372591736261013

and now said d artagnan as there is no longer any fear of being overheard i hope you are going to let me into your secret   14.485448828343445
the breakfast and what sort of persons do you expect to breakfast   11.812168196651822
asked dantès of himself   10.943477694288783
your majesty continued the coadjutor pitilessly is about to take such measures as seem good to you but i foresee that they will be violent and such as will still further exasperate the rioters   12.392096657222334
do not put yourself to the slightest inconvenience   16.694938318127676
said rochefort you are right   16.291672127664235
to place yourself under his protection   14.154342653780317
i must refer again to the club in the rue saint jacques   8.24875001945428
the gnawing pain at his stomach had ceased   8.988810745321274
they found him up less pale than when d artagnan left him after his first visit and seated at a table on which though he was alone was spread enough for four persons   10.205173970456622
a paltry piece of business   8.497330583485269

he is dead my lord   11.03005775145487
i must live henceforth without rank and fortune and to begin this hard apprenticeship i must borrow from a friend the loaf i shall eat until i have earned one   10.346721635700678
athos remained alone in the vast chamber where according to the cardinal s directions he was treated with all the courtesy due to a nobleman   13.638132662651921
said villefort with a sneer   13.445080848558547
and we too added beauchamp and château renaud   7.141577699038186
my arm and my life belong to you like my love   11.880653157776532
you refuse me my liberty   11.057053065414035
faria smiled encouragingly on him and the young man retired to his task in the spirit of obedience and respect which he had sworn to show towards his aged friend   11.600602908314402
think it   16.2464909664836

instead of following the knot of prisoners that were being taken into the town mordaunt turned his steps toward the rising ground from whence cromwell had witnessed the battle and on which he had just had his tent pitched   8.234589888199324
now as i dislike him and hope his railway his electric telegraph or his search for baths will ruin him i am watching for his discomfiture which must soon take place   11.4413045798373
however insignificant i am i am sure that his majesty is concerned for me and blames himself for my death   8.325869037925628
then turning to faria i inquired if you are well fed   15.779338981203914
porthos and aramis regarded each other not understanding this assurance of athos   8.669374799731784
asked anne of austria with a movement of impatience   13.365317744582455
the king and the queen are my king and queen replied the musketeer my life is theirs and i must give it for them   11.04987820966525

woman is sacred   9.25502546543984
and whoever serves in a french corps serves the king   6.912092306202975
interrupted porthos   12.929862291150094
you see that we are very humble monarchs sir   11.83128055352929
extraordinary did you say   14.093482437296377
everyone from the highest to the lowest degree has his place on the social ladder and is beset by stormy passions and conflicting interests as in descartes theory of pressure and impulsion   14.592764507823794
0133m sire i listen said de blacas biting his nails with impatience   5.889570073804634

for athos whose great courage alone supported him sank upon his knee   11.092710462196493
never fear   14.221052602026056
since you demand my resignation i retire   11.506968658530683
oh it was not on him monsieur   6.107514172387173
you are indeed the most beautiful and most noble woman i ever saw   7.99057505241924
well have you tied the knot   14.586025737103435
and with this view called in the assistance of the lackey of one of his master s guests named fourreau and the false soldier who had tried to kill d artagnan and who belonging to no corps had entered into the service of d artagnan or rather of planchet after d artagnan had saved his life   16.932559476040883
we want to ask something else of you   16.194420640734002
i am not obliged to read any breviary   14.1492218386088

as to monte cristo the result had surpassed his utmost expectations   13.29499806114381
the shot had frightfully lacerated her throat leaving two gaping wounds from which as well as the mouth the blood was pouring in floods   13.63070229057122
ah i know her by name   12.149987584683142
the musketeer was introduced to m   13.631505633086261
is he still one of the seventeen peers of france   12.232298011511238
we may like bouillotte delight in whist be enraptured with boston and yet grow tired of them all   18.852781168349544
behind the luxembourg   15.782730731676484
my steward transacts all this business for me   11.91340453863001
de beaufort is he still in prison   8.221021357899186
she did not please   9.091636675596554
the beautiful supplicant pretended not to hear the noise and in a voice broken by tears she continued god of vengeance   8.271372931564258
you are coming my boy   15.32693138325429
but he was continually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion and anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy   15.340598880455818
she was mad   12.551428805550104
he cried with a smile of satisfaction   12.973967085884137
not even for fifteen years wages   13.126174741769415
recollect our only desire is to carry out in a fitting manner the last wishes of our friend   13.315978469545604
but they appear to speak french with a very pure accent said danglars   14.968769775737654
let us take our precautions athos   14.436049873410006
from whom may the letter be you bear to his eminence   12.420717831331268
but you will not leave me   11.760017694313543
then they drew near to each other and smilingly exchanged their letters   12.757638543587364
that is the misfortune   9.863471342765415
those beer drinkers are too clumsy and awkward   7.868262584245999
really all you have related to me is exceedingly interesting said monte cristo observing the young man with a gloomy satisfaction   16.435548882375873
the king took advantage of this favorable moment to tell her that he had the intention of shortly giving a fête   15.107585917952214
d artagnan when he gave way to his own feelings which were in accordance with those of the queen had accomplished more than the most astute diplomacy could have attempted   11.27242380541527
asked the count impatiently   17.25582188425088
i want to be enlightened on a subject   13.164214426868217
you would not have me marry under such sad auspices   11.729957285135018
and the edicts   12.339848094839702
he is quite right returned beauchamp   7.826685620360784
i had been told that i should see you today at seven o clock   11.363599026131913
which proved that the general measure which drove the english from france did not affect her   11.465149648906626
this is all i know but i know not count how you contrived to inspire so much respect in the bandits of rome who ordinarily have so little respect for anything   8.034518944785175
the soldiers interposed their bayonets for they thought that he was about to attack the inspector and the latter recoiled two or three steps   8.955425922000433
only he begged his former master to set out in the evening for greater security to himself   11.97420407039227
the marechal de grammont and the comte de guiche had returned to paris and he was quite lonely   12.0088522208879
i will tell him my gloomy story   14.921024295451982
i have returned guitant   18.53194454254603
a dungeon   16.95737133751115
danglars lost five hundred thousand francs   6.626083662121761
do you think of escaping in the same way   14.626057998727385
but thanks to this diamond replied the young man   10.667200306428207
such learning is very rare among ladies   12.837262141568077
while he was doing this d artagnan having no better employment amused himself with beating a march upon the window and with looking at the musketeers who went away one after another following them with his eyes until they disappeared   10.426730731334823
for my own part i protest that should i ever go to corsica my first visit ere even i presented myself to the mayor or prefect should be to the bandits of colomba if i could only manage to find them   11.169217491430118
the sea immediately rose to his waist   7.199182161779197
the abbé replaced the large spectacles which covered not only his eyes but his temples and sitting down motioned to his visitor to do the same   11.549907081660931
and he left the chamber without once looking behind him   8.59713152346183
plan of campaign chapter xx   12.734873995301145
and every branch of oak every gilded weathercock on roof of slates reminded him that instead of returning to the friends of his childhood every instant estranged him further and that perhaps he had even left them forever   11.460781677302215
it is unpardonable   12.027096354674697
de tréville which proved to be in the rue du vieux colombier   14.217676372354438
thank you la ramee said the prisoner   10.295006283710137
your lordship may be assured that it requires more than the tricks and coquetry of a woman to corrupt me   13.215825800144522
and setting the example he plowed his oar into the sea   10.642660055893996
at these cries all who were in the hôtel rushed out and fell upon the four companions who on their side cried aloud to the rescue musketeers   13.595969000703398
you must be blessed indeed to possess the knowledge you have   19.745536729859502
now said monte cristo that you have fortified yourself against all painful excitement prepare yourself my dear m   11.744584224857553
cried the procurator s wife raising her eyes toward heaven   15.391763147653649
well sire the usurper left elba on the 26th february and landed on the 1st of march   14.714575229040266
dantès whole attention was riveted on a man who could thus forget his own misfortunes while occupying himself with the destinies of others   14.347802157220233
both laid themselves down on the divan   14.430828634748009
but i understand that she is going to italy   13.475883348369374
a dreadful silence followed the reading of this document   10.11591978145205
what do you want of me   12.81822929452041
when mordaunt finds himself discovered he will destroy all friends and foes   11.085649629998171
i have been looking for him but without success   7.861775044444437
for i believe if he does not pay us we shall be well enough paid by another party   9.77301672157896
then ring at his door if you please and request him to be so kind as to give me an audience   13.232687740916107
de tréville launched it with knowledge of his cause   8.799079647893628
indeed do not be alarmed if i do not come at all   14.170963089864804
i will undertake that   15.802187072987603
one word more said monte cristo   6.030611653766603

de tréville announced that it was time to go to the louvre   7.987715777534996
grimaud meantime undid the means of escape   11.694012506714271
what do you mean monsieur   11.950756444704318
do you not know that we italians have eyes only for the man we love   8.778789748984545
but it appeared we had chosen an unlucky moment for at the first word on the subject he sent us to all the devils   9.42259856555771
it will be sooner over than devouring me piecemeal   14.189824489880412
save me gentlemen for the love of heaven save me   7.751211976136562
going along d artagnan shaking his head said i know that my going to athos is useless and absurd   12.479031557728634
d artagnan continued athos bequeaths to you raoul and i bequeath to you my revenge   9.28733072155768
you saw the person   11.094234634908243

if that is the case i warn you i shall have you put in a lunatic asylum   12.89687262239287
oh my king said parry with tears in his eyes and in a tone of supplication do not look to the left as we leave the hall   11.89812311287524
he pretends the air of the faubourg saint honoré is not good for me   6.664886671256218
as night closed in they arrived at thirsk   12.538244767902961
five answered groslow one every two hours   11.542348651328219
cavalcanti and gives him fifty thousand francs for it   11.536168013258616
you only know that this money exists   12.55096431264007
this was the abbé scarron always laughing joking complimenting yet suffering and toying nervously with a small switch   9.873642944256567
but as for me by holy truth i did not know it and i thought i would give you good advice   8.056097333203919
such was the count s yes   13.128693487264147
matters are going all right   18.39757134897058
in fact a man who believed himself like you one of the envoys not of god but of a supreme being   12.10586091793104
what took place at armentieres has no connection whatever with the present occasion   10.882344877343048
in that case we are as well off as we wish   13.26784061402201
when we observed this to him he told us all to trouble ourselves about our own business as this horse belonged to him   12.11335728422955
when they entered the port it was already night   13.138634397965607
there is quite a style about them   13.867435778977892
then she suddenly cried oh no no   12.109259796429855
when ali was wanted one stroke was given two summoned baptistin and three bertuccio   9.724611563428864
the young men looked at each other   13.006828141148222
the timely arrival of d artagnan in paris   13.145911478152453
i will do more than i promise said dantès   17.05558203132774
they say joy never hurts and so i came to you without any warning   16.56188248619512
meanwhile barrois had returned for the first time to old noirtier who having heard the noise in the house had as we have said sent his old servant to inquire the cause   10.250092354894974
let us try him   9.120265683042724
not so loud father i entreat of you for your own sake as well as mine   14.15435264800119
bring in the monsieur d artagnan said the commissary to the guards   9.957211190355032
i carried it in my hand   16.805102504598445
what influence can i possibly have over a bandit   9.492964312877097
sir let me see my right hand correspondent   8.669517275224011
perhaps you may not have to retract   10.23344028839317
asked monsieur de cavois   6.204438152744372
but pray sit down   15.090156930620736
nothing nothing   10.891043419740326
and as though he feared that the walls of the accursed house would crumble around him he rushed into the street for the first time doubting whether he had the right to do as he had done   8.527041198701339
at this speech of aramis the brow of athos became clouded and he bit his lips   5.98766322808254
milady frowned slightly   13.93744114533795
i will tell you in two words sir   13.798813612786233
he clung to one idea that of his happiness destroyed without apparent cause by an unheard of fatality   7.363404175723975
the baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt while her husband affecting not to observe this unconjugal gesture turned towards monte cristo and said upon my word count i am quite sorry not to have met you sooner   13.862811720054266
the blood rose to her head and her little foot worked with impatience beneath her robe   8.52298536600837
and one of the great military enterprises of the cardinal   12.844572891145248
inquired the priest   12.698999976000325
my faith monsieur with great pleasure   11.378915805773131
it will be the surest plan   14.438967045173941
it is well for albert he is not in the army said morrel   15.450111676577105
ah monsieur bonacieux i never did love you much but now it is worse than ever   13.623710853951163
i want to carry off my son from them with yourself   15.101878634968642
d artagnan and the englishman chapter xxxi   14.456485481413665
pronounce one single word muttered d artagnan and you are a dead man   9.568397720986816
but the father has the greatest regard possible for you said monte cristo   11.283424462680971
the carriage was taking the direct road to it   13.981573368080088
well then instead of pitying me you would do much better to assist me in avenging myself on your mistress   14.205710605830404
are we then to go to war   6.954592640880775
are you hungry   11.680253405055963
what more   12.375822010007791
the sobriquet of la carconte had been bestowed on madeleine radelle from the fact that she had been born in a village so called situated between salon and lambesc   10.134085477024195
but the partition was so thin that one could hear nearly all that passed between the two women   10.604026753192933
de tréville s hôtel at least i have entered upon my apprenticeship haven t i   9.488492317675416
d artagnan believing she might have means of flight and fearing she should escape drew a pistol from his belt   9.65267655304958
danglars and you caderousse   17.80746527528834
the rest concerns myself   10.290209143052031
i can not resist doing so   14.53861978711182
a charming little seamstress whom i love dearly and from whose hand i requested a few lines as a sort of keepsake   12.993833576083127
it soon appeared to him that he heard a slight noise within a timid noise which seemed to tremble lest it should be heard   11.34951461530034
it was this that while you had related to me all the particulars of your past life you were perfectly unacquainted with mine   14.195273627398743
they mounted again at once whilst looks of admiration passed between them   9.31746098823073
the very animals we were speaking of harnessed to the count s carriage   6.760772933071459
we may well pity the poor fellows   12.305224110665861
monte cristo took the pistols he held in his hand when mercédès entered and fixing an ace of clubs against the iron plate with four shots he successively shot off the four sides of the club   16.985033634250325
alas said valentine restraining her tears my grandfather is dead   8.464328430251822
here they found only one inn in which was consumed a liqueur which preserves its reputation to our time and which is still made in that town   10.278067459421973
felton then had spoken in her favor since lord de winter had not been willing to listen to him   6.099870480471502
and yet i have punished her i have dared to tell her i have repent and die   7.777886549870514
they passed to the third story   8.280245045848446
asked athos of d artagnan   13.900818736032164
then d avrigny spoke   7.744398996939964
and were it not for the windows at the palazzo rospoli by way of recompense for the loss of our beautiful scheme i don t know but what i should have held on by my original plan   9.754408878784576
nobody knows him   12.461724049380027
the count s tutor was well acquainted with the country   12.4053541733534
bertuccio said the count i am very glad to tell you that while you gesticulate you wring your hands and roll your eyes like a man possessed by a devil who will not leave him   9.018621260494655
to saddle   13.414063062434941
we will be his guards monsieur upon our word as gentlemen   9.457765881749934
monte cristo watched him till he disappeared and then touched a spring in a panel made to look like a picture which in sliding partly from the frame discovered to view a small opening so cleverly contrived that it revealed all that was passing in the drawing room now occupied by cavalcanti and andrea   12.341922438354702
and they all laughed so heartily that the host appeared in order to inquire whether the gentlemen wanted anything   11.885893592064223
the blood no longer flowed from his wounds   10.944692975684035
18 lake maggiore   15.220779227433368
ah said d artagnan i did not see that   9.303794593367575
i fancy i have seen him before   15.400538103430891
it was said that she had poisoned her second husband   10.4538638274287
it is an unheard of fatality   14.75076070802881
and aramis sprang into the saddle with his usual grace and agility but after a few vaults and curvets of the noble animal his rider felt his pains come on so insupportably that he turned pale and became unsteady in his seat   14.038478845113236
in contrast with the old man who is dragging his way to the tomb are two children just entering into life valentine the daughter by my first wife mademoiselle renée de saint méran and edward the boy whose life you have this day saved   15.907402120223207
i think so forsooth said rochefort and when you find any of them you march them off to the bastile   12.156825320566787
she takes a pleasure in my conversation   12.787722853007145
it is to be to morrow said aramis hastily   15.336754011480958
he returned thus formidable and implacable advancing with his arms crossed on his breast towards the general who could not understand why he had disappeared but who on seeing him again and feeling his teeth chatter and his legs sink under him drew back and only stopped when he found a table to support his clenched hand   9.797598643476823
he took you for buckingham   12.331535735167657
one of them stationed upon the top stair naked sword in hand prevented or at least endeavored to prevent the three others from ascending   10.576538444301512
monsieur de tréville said the cardinal with the greatest phlegm does not tell your majesty that this innocent musketeer this gallant man had only an hour before attacked sword in hand four commissaries of inquiry who were delegated by myself to examine into an affair of the highest importance   8.82675936705092
i am not a fighting man at all monsieur and i am afraid of the bastille   12.150383150306684
everything conspired to prove to d artagnan that his presentiments had not deceived him and that a great misfortune had happened   12.475948493005689
she dreamed don carlos had returned to spain   12.904458173488852
but i do not say it was the cause of your imprisonment   18.976369842303527
cried she is it you   9.78753957260345
de tréville felt himself something like samson before the philistines   17.15834734046514
tis well said athos i will take care of that   13.659226341326857
caderousse still evaded all pursuit and i had resigned myself to what seemed my inevitable fate   6.776887112044252
but he found athos quite himself again that is to say the most shrewd and impenetrable of men   19.572498273662433
and he hastened to the door   11.06479123578354
but sir you spoke of vigilance and protection   9.752990716268823
yes yes said he   11.750633875260391
he therefore mounted his horse and disappeared   7.526371091000921
d artagnan nodded his head and bazin retired after placing on the table the spanish wine   13.544179296922255
the worthy man restored to perfect health was tasting the fine fruit which madame de longueville had sent to him   16.844794660836257
he followed him   8.160159735413089
suppose any one came into the room   9.967943593333622
turned around astonished that any one should dare to address him   10.609296049344092
take him alive   12.558956901595288
well you can do better   13.369968216834915
ah that would be a great pity said villefort   12.258293933038205
only some said he was worth millions and others that he did not possess a farthing   18.12205245220786
no said morcerf attempting to rise it is a base plot contrived by my enemies   7.839570771917908
firstly i wish to communicate   15.7906332744802
it turned out as d artagnan had foreseen   6.384525287771437
then as the half hour had already glided by he crossed the gallery and knocked at the cardinal s door   11.239799268158173
and the duke pointing his pistol at aramis fired   14.737811333140023
we had forgotten to say that jacopo was a corsican   8.452309601082458
a violent convulsion shook his whole frame his eyes started from their sockets his mouth was drawn on one side his cheeks became purple he struggled foamed dashed himself about and uttered the most dreadful cries which however dantès prevented from being heard by covering his head with the blanket   11.101780245978834
why you know i told you replied danglars that i considered the circumstance of his having anchored at the island of elba as a very suspicious circumstance   6.403705828827978
then who are you   13.186397616602855
but who are those others   13.509043201292606
what has become of them   16.672848009653233
yes said debray but then ostia is only a few leagues from rome   9.614777530564623
the young girl kissed her grandmother and left with her handkerchief to her eyes   11.176687516881763
it really must be doomed   13.70178628724753
the count s brow became clouded   12.744237406214175
it does not concern me the more so as i have not a livre left   15.048786646565517
then i suppose asked caderousse with eager glowing looks that it was a stone of immense value   15.909890890267183
the novice sat down   17.357899042094626
twenty pistoles on one throw only one the last   9.970731834152089
yes said the prince if you will serve me as guide   12.045923838858286
felton in his turn a suppliant clasped his hands   13.862709328599045
do you hear the guns pray   8.016806753921053
no cardinal   13.110097760620452
but the well oiled hinges and locks told quite another story   7.515669426887994
then your father ought to have met with you on the road for it is exactly the same route which he himself took and that is how we have been able to trace your journey to this place   5.008517482057908
for as he came in i remarked that it was but half past nine by the clock although i had believed it to be later   12.048902241772023
so your majesty must perceive there is no time to lose   12.825773160781326
while thinking and walking athos passed and repassed before the pipe of the stove broken in halves the other extremity passing into the chamber above   12.369302819568322
his presentiments were realized as we shall see and his uneasy forebodings had goaded him pale and trembling to the gate under the chestnut trees   13.481277859528598
then those who dwelt in bonacieux s unfortunate house together with the nearest neighbors heard loud cries stamping of feet clashing of swords and breaking of furniture   13.514028305136083
nor did they terminate at any grotto   11.360477313367008
let us withdraw   9.372620805263548
the count in return for his gentlemanly bow received a formal though graceful courtesy while lucien exchanged with the count a sort of distant recognition and with danglars a free and easy nod   11.628724387855973
i am brother to parry his majesty s lackey   11.014727810062112
i wished to know the detail said she because having many relatives in business i was almost sure of obtaining things at a hundred per cent less than you would pay yourself   13.144055416050888
but the voyage was not ended   12.94241293157546
they were passed by a sort of courier covered with dust the bearer of a letter from the duke to the cardinal giving testimony to the valor of d artagnan and porthos   8.412315122431309
madame i have pledged my word and unless you order me to be arrested i shall be forced to return   11.18609325098734
it is for me to give orders here and not you   11.40730152832605
i have therefore chosen this drawing room where you see smiling and happy in their magnificent frames your portrait mine my mother s and all sorts of rural landscapes and touching pastorals   10.152775221186612
the marshal made no attempt to force that barrier and returned up the quay   11.702378141519253
d artagnan offered his friend a part of his share which he should return when convenient   12.77556292726982
the carriage awaited them at the door filled with sweetmeats and bouquets   12.375515687204908
d artagnan related how he had found porthos in bed with a strained knee and aramis at a table between two theologians   10.880644019519446
we shall then be matched four against the remaining five   9.846538692295479
if we are so it is because we generally judge under the influence of excitement   6.8792318823706164
in the next place you are in trouble of which i am very glad as it gives me an opportunity of placing myself at your service and god knows i am ready to throw myself into the fire for you   10.319710349798832
400340m a note was in consequence addressed to general de quesnel begging him to be present at the meeting next day the 5th   11.568611402563567
the night after that battle he was sentry at the door of a general who carried on a secret correspondence with the enemy   8.305621475837945
that when my coachman was about to harness the horses to my carriage he discovered that they had been removed from the stables without his knowledge   14.25381136771168
i am glad to see said d artagnan that you have still that honest lad with you   13.608913607873212
it was a pledge a remembrance   6.938784074456443
madame danglars was carried into the adjoining room   6.324619553016923
i will forget even your name and be happy   7.757116281321419
and yet at the very door the musketeer began to entertain some doubts   13.832224692895796
in this apartment a continued buzzing prevailed from morning till night while m   14.979540349363273
i do not offer you a million because i have it not   13.8903670089139
i say sir that with the eyes fixed on the social organization of nations you see only the springs of the machine and lose sight of the sublime workman who makes them act   12.790593528006129
i registered their deed of gift yesterday   9.954538840763647
it was by always offering a million of francs to the governor for his liberty that an abbé became mad who was in this chamber before you   8.654921826765001
there were in all six thousand piastres but of these six thousand albert had already expended three thousand   13.064199870542492
that monsieur d artagnan is a very brave man mother said the young king   13.332531360239297
his father   5.190483277494568
and he bowed profoundly before the cardinal like a man who says lord thy will be done   13.730940993509215
the mathematical turn of his mind rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation while his naturally poetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality of arithmetical computation or the rigid severity of geometry   10.821221777313776
then the porter raised some difficulties but the count of monte cristo produced a permit from the governor of rome allowing him to leave or enter the city at any hour of the day or night   12.663200665811639
never shall i forget your sublime courage when having returned to consciousness i dragged myself to the foot of the stairs and you almost dying yourself came to meet me   15.558677338418274
did you not tell him just now that you wanted money   11.2797532911401
the queen entered her oratory which was lighted by a single lamp of venetian crystal she saw d artagnan who stood expecting her   7.312850504323742
adieu my friend adieu my father   10.979229854687947
she will receive five shillings per day for lodging and food   7.738777619986611
but why not address yourself to your sister the queen   9.474984384039038
said athos that s a proposition that pleases me   14.052046123642683
and she placed her hands on her brow as if to force the fugitive ideas it contained to concentration in a moment   11.156350111932742
everything answered franz your voice your look your pallid complexion and even the life you lead   11.508493379401438
it appears that in falling continued athos with some hesitation he broke his thigh   11.949859454863013
that is the usual way is it not   9.201579457162982
he will be a dead man in a month   14.241105508423322
i will turn abbé   14.695125204318092
why they induced general quesnel to go there and general quesnel who quitted his own house at nine o clock in the evening was found the next day in the seine   12.954792495695688
come my friend said danglars seeing that he made no impression on peppino you will not refuse me a glass of wine   9.381314309108904
your arms my lord what arms   14.139290351012935
she felt by intuition the flame of the opposing passions which burned with the blood in the veins of the young fanatic   16.116633534995955
said d artagnan who as we have often said never stumbled at anything   12.892066357874356
the king s room   14.072690114885255
yes but you have at least this consolation that you can say to yourself she has not quit you voluntarily that if you learn no news of her it is because all communication with you is interdicted   15.671147337085301
to a look of interrogation which they made milady replied by a sign that it was he   13.142412910605623
that s what i wanted to know   9.397835540030552
such are my reasons for not liking to marry mademoiselle danglars   16.083998759955335
where is that armentières   15.36292442824054
he will of course have an escort   7.854798117406602
at this moment a shadow passed rapidly before the opening   7.234052837028278
but should you want anything write to madame turquaine at la chevrette rue tiquetonne and draw upon her purse as on a banker with economy   9.450385533964813
and this said monte cristo is your opinion of your intended spouse   10.094187066800394
i am quite happy for i am the oldest and of course shall see him first   9.997247374353238
standing on the prow was a tall man of a dark complexion who saw with dilating eyes that they were approaching a dark mass of land in the shape of a cone which rose from the midst of the waves like the hat of a catalan   12.23670006531863
yes said noirtier   15.735341016490011
we have princes who set up a personal and egotistic opposition who will draw from mazarin s hands only a few ingots of gold or some shreds of power granted as bribes   14.11070973833031
noirtier the redoubtable was the next morning poor m   14.646010773648278
it is however impossible that this should end as they have decreed   7.812896938828211
he remembered that all the first part of his life had been embittered by a woman and he thought with alarm of the influence love might assume over so fine and at the same time so vigorous an organization as that of raoul   10.583805518114541
asked the girl   11.338322878038268
the officer opened the door which was locked and without speaking a word answered dantès question   11.510374498109424
how in the wrong   9.712181668761557
she found m   13.327486142728372
they fled together into berry and there he obtained a little curacy   9.21625222191275
there was neither dining nor playing at cards nor dancing in that house   16.672974080769727
athos and aramis suppressed as well as they could the disgust they felt in the presence of such coarseness and brutality   14.120647341275589
laporte obeyed   9.25427341194441
he said to the executioner raising his long locks   13.930879587122877
my dear count said morcerf i beg of you not to apply that title so prematurely   12.383254837225874
the dominions of kings are limited either by mountains or rivers or a change of manners or an alteration of language   12.176440503407358
de château renaud asked beauchamp how is morrel   10.848710546966709
noirtier de villefort one of the most fiery jacobins of the french revolution   12.791226903544345
but unfortunately the thing is impossible monsieur de tréville has forbidden it   10.740892628456372
the marchioness drained the glass at a single draught and then turned on her pillow repeating the notary the notary   18.09471083634225
happiness comes to meet him does it not monsieur bonacieux   5.609334610328245
but not mine mother replied albert   7.568140413418049
oh morrel pray love him for all his goodness to us   15.471272925198894
the cardinal said so   11.392954030748362
everyone hastened to purchase moccoletti franz and albert among the rest   7.535295970275361
andrea cavalcanti s solicitude his manner of listening to the music at the door he dared not pass and of manifesting his admiration   13.702841443452996
no matter observed caderousse replacing the box in his pocket someone else will purchase it   9.62207555534238
well then you ll build some   12.366491457999846
the young people uttered a cry of joy while maximilian raised his head but let it fall again immediately   9.481126898316173
and suppose you can not pass through them   14.0218444570901
he removed his seat into a corner of the room where he himself would be in deep shadow while the light would be fully thrown on the narrator   17.05390533034304
true said monte cristo the loss of a sum of money becomes almost immaterial with a fortune such as you possess and to one of your philosophic spirit   14.874066915524825
notwithstanding his commission in the musketeers d artagnan felt completely solitary   12.601076199494216
i now repeat that i was born at auteuil on the night of the 27th of september 1817 and that i am the son of the procureur m   9.936721523761353
but what astonished franz who had treated gaetano s description as a fable was the splendor of the apartment in which he found himself   14.519318385854945
trousers said grimaud still squaring his accounts   15.823729671888271
at these words he raised his hand above his head to show the token   11.868041748975143
for a thousand pistoles just that amount the beggar   17.601255730917256
my father is not engaged in this fearful plot is he sir   15.507476709855446
there was yet no one to be seen   8.612306549382668
debray stepped forward and cordially pressed the hand of his interlocutor   15.933373870416638
a private room had been prepared for the king and another for monsieur   17.705615790608526
it was that of a man from five to eight and thirty in the uniform of a general officer wearing the double epaulet of heavy bullion that indicates superior rank the ribbon of the legion of honor around his neck which showed he was a commander and on the right breast the star of a grand officer of the order of the saviour and on the left that of the grand cross of charles iii   13.355344490860526
well then i am your servant monsieur baron said d artagnan though you have names rather difficult to recollect   11.794294559922523
he stopped at a short distance from the house and alighted   11.854221966219308
this posing at the piano and over the album was only a little ruse adopted by way of precaution   16.17007648423975
du vallon next me   13.889507404103282
the only thing that was pleasant to him in that odious tableau such is the instability of the human mind was the sullen face of grimaud for whom he had at first conceived such a hatred and who now was all his hope   16.09385373871992
this time the blow was so well aimed and hit so directly that lucien and the baroness were staggered and they interrogated each other with their eyes as if to seek help against this aggression but the irresistible will of the master of the house prevailed and the husband was victorious   18.38873224330701
i love him   18.0936267176543
upon my honor   13.942378346676698
my son said anne of austria pointing to the musketeer calm standing uncovered here is monsieur d artagnan who is as brave as one of those ancient heroes of whom you like so much to hear from my women   11.616440161168967
the queen made a sign for every one except mazarin to quit the room   8.685352739214746
good said mazarin i am glad to see that his majesty has been brought up with a hatred of dissimulation   19.192708350987793
you laugh d artagnan   10.78266775132723
villefort as we have seen belonged to the aristocratic party at marseilles morrel to the plebeian   9.695852450974206
valentine had approached or rather had placed her lips so near the fence that they nearly touched those of morrel which were pressed against the other side of the cold and inexorable barrier   16.296672694312637
said caderousse astonished   14.234851886713694
the usher who had introduced me was waiting for me at the door and he conducted me through the corridors to a private entrance opening into the rue de vaugirard   11.194958229612086
beware monsieur   6.303443247035445
perhaps this evening madame bonacieux will visit the conjugal domicile   12.265259668334872
at all events i could not guess that you would invite me to dinner   10.827335991913944
he would then be lost and france perhaps with him   7.548860104935157
the ladies received the offer with too much pleasure to dream of a refusal   8.807299330061612
the only thing that astonished d artagnan was that his friends had never thought of this   13.120435034170132
go my dear boy said old dantès   8.6590021363685
mercédès who will detest you if you have only the misfortune to scratch the skin of her dearly beloved edmond   15.644589079563609
unhappily in an instant he fell mortally wounded   10.907611949393226
as he passed the table on which the axe was laid he stopped and turning with a smile said ah   8.62817903052394
and bassompierre was right   13.879724790538145
mazarin had left his lamp in the gallery to make people believe that he was walking about but he had with him a waxlight to help him to explore his mysterious strong box   6.94995957860497
but how did this horse come into your hands mousqueton   13.275763092648212
d artagnan picked it up and offered it to lord de winter   13.131294561852323
you will not   9.999627403509198
you have a quick ear monsieur athos said the cardinal   11.547955187152809
let us call one of these lackeys with a demi pistole in the left hand   11.93181484283387
in appearance not heart   15.394224817645895
silent caresses heartwrung sobs broken sighs burning tears were all that passed in this sad interview while madame de villefort leaning on her husband s arm maintained all outward forms of respect at least towards the poor widow   7.607813141958349
and the name of this lord   9.238335478412088
you told him that   11.467531721119515
you must be well aware that this requires reflection   7.326038724110585
why should they   14.62352872716028
thus m   14.280065502119097
president but in its turn   14.077684632472348
i hope that is true said aramis   15.255095655170033
what does all this mean   11.823794701682951
he began by moving his bed and looked around for anything with which he could pierce the wall penetrate the moist cement and displace a stone   12.76015947272759
morrel and this day and a half was lost from pure whim for the pleasure of going ashore and nothing else   10.234228103310357
said gondy laughing   11.98521369951102
oh yes yes cruelly   13.19218869894457
then you love me   10.46138609142821
nevertheless or find some one else continued d artagnan turning his back   12.779776625192952
i am desirous of having an estate by the seaside in normandy for instance between le havre and boulogne   10.354274854064926
and your present happiness has it softened your heart   9.11475991126431
it was given to you by that veiled lady i met you with the other sunday near the gate st   14.356901103738814
my lord you are right and i am glad to see that you do justice to the count at last   10.577157212761572
now then what had i better do   12.516594963865465
and supposing valentine to be disinherited by her grandfather she will still be three times richer than he   11.492002603479188
murmured my father   12.951148990756757
yes your friend at least hopes so   13.200641410316456
i was reflecting upon the rapidity with which the blessings of this world leave us   11.088013132071813
perfectly safe and sound my good host   15.058392989321458
it was already too late   12.945022253742332
to travel   12.218029688938127
i might even say that we have some reason to praise him   11.159056477420695
italian cigars are horrible   10.399573111328792
at last said athos the first to speak by this time i think all must be over   13.442799534534366
the corpse was found on the bed next day and the whole truth was guessed for the men who performed the office then mentioned what they had not dared to speak of before that at the moment the corpse was thrown into the deep they heard a shriek which was almost immediately stifled by the water in which it disappeared   14.93383973799303
ah yes monsieur commissary   12.16200833110384
what do you wish me to say   16.185648602191648
so it is my dear vicomte said athos laughing to make bad ones   12.642059113598329
cried d artagnan giving rein to his famous steed who darting forth overturned several men   6.788719948767198
asked aramis smiling   13.829723058284964
seeing however no one there except a musketeer of his own troop he fixed his eyes upon the supposed soldier in whose dress nevertheless he recognized at the first glance the cardinal   9.026423581015173
kitty who was to set out that evening for tours was waiting in the next chamber   13.119278502376615
franz and albert were like men who to drive away a violent sorrow have recourse to wine and who as they drink and become intoxicated feel a thick veil drawn between the past and the present   13.40331907488125
come then thou regenerate man thou extravagant prodigal thou awakened sleeper thou all powerful visionary thou invincible millionaire once again review thy past life of starvation and wretchedness revisit the scenes where fate and misfortune conducted and where despair received thee   14.640157619264592
the englishman appeared to reflect a moment and then said from which it would appear sir that this credit inspires you with considerable apprehension   8.343726562865863
at the end of three months he had learned to read   10.459830237505372
tell me sir could you have the courage to do so   10.818902947939918
the conference being finished the queen summoned him to her cabinet   13.857079457445359
it was not known whether after the taking of the bastion the rochellais had evacuated it or left a garrison in it   16.7896983580828
go then and take the waters of forges or any that may be more agreeable to you and recuperate yourself as quickly as possible   9.742805225325537
everything appeared as usual the precious secretaire in its place and the key in the secretaire   10.155964056038636
as for himself he declared that he had only need of a little rest and that when they returned he should be easier   7.3532581394478935
meantime d artagnan who is full of invention would find some way to save the king   9.163473708859485
the officer waited for his reply and seeing it so long coming he burst into a laugh turned upon his heel and re entered the house   6.419396166455845
said athos oh no it is impossible   14.861899264497008
23 germain pillon was a famous french sculptor 1535 1598   8.93849720328771
every one wished to see the young king with his mother and the famous cardinal mazarin whom they hated so much that no one wished to be deprived of his presence   11.777459062029248
i will say he had doubtless given you the plan of this house in the hope the count would kill you   6.789774702099515
because as porthos was talking louder than the rest of us he took him for the chief said d artagnan   11.59033995783751
and eventually as he was stupid enough to be vexed at this change of position the queen had had him arrested and sent to vincennes in charge of guitant who made his appearance in these pages in the beginning of this history and whom we shall see again   15.978699768212559
it remains here   9.075788048614706
you are not guilty toward me and i have already pardoned you   10.927246729496593
you are too charming said d artagnan sorrowfully   7.505184447035962
by this smile m   11.519568235827716
edmond did not lose a word but comprehended very little of what was said   10.62842487021684
the hôtel de ville a massive sixteenth century building was on his right   13.398706170016737
can you conceal me   6.684684333726511
it advanced rapidly along one of the avenues leading towards the open space where they were assembled   14.455665841021103
i have never interfered in your affairs excepting for your good   11.09432134779806
in truth in a few minutes he heard steps approaching and low whispers   15.249776699741087
take care albert said franz   11.527279772343322
ah well exclaimed château renaud who because he had seen his thirtieth summer fancied himself duly warranted in assuming a sort of paternal air with his more youthful friend you young people are never satisfied   17.381043859072808
laugh then said monsieur de retz   12.60062602061339
one of the sailors leaped on shore a cord creaked as it ran through a pulley and dantès guessed they were at the end of the voyage and that they were mooring the boat   8.302270848564527
your eminence may be perfectly easy replied d artagnan   7.861730529151317
but of what are you accused   11.935767171594534
you are aware what huge whitings are served to us on maigre days   10.100873090370904
adieu sir adieu my beloved protector   16.172091598777065
next morning le moniteur contained the following it was without any foundation that le messager yesterday announced the flight of don carlos and the revolt of barcelona   11.694576043982334
if i thought the fellow knew me by my name i would be rebaptized for fear it might be thought i knew him   14.459718662198968
the conversation took place in english a language which d artagnan could not understand   12.904408085734742
do then as i did my lord   12.193422512924604
at this word the three friends leaped from their horses and entered   11.229266346891325
de bruy   15.402719932905494
nevertheless you have still the power of banishing from your presence those whom you do not like   11.64131923429921
nevertheless it was the rendezvous of the great world and all paris went there   10.302299184113078
oh i comprehend now said the astonished porthos   14.373198133967966
and yet since the amusement seemed to me rather tame i proposed to chevalier de rieux that we should be spectators instead of actors and in order to see to advantage that we should mount the bronze horse   10.954952509501869
no that is true   14.645744831084038
well i understand what i now have to do replied villefort   5.991943698808356
no monsieur quite the contrary   13.287575820343301
and he quietly resumed his dispatch at the place where he had been interrupted   9.893388121617903
to involve me three governments must crumble to dust   13.515138781940161
at the expiration of ten minutes the clerk returned with a beaming countenance   16.692168545704092
but danglars had not reckoned upon the formalities of the police and the idleness of the posting master   12.218776720946705
besides it has perhaps been her majesty s calculation to seek on this occasion for support so lowly   7.857589436517913
he then sat down in the corner until his eyes became accustomed to the darkness   10.78338399543128
the carriage is at the door   12.351221075022469
therefore gentlemen not a word more of this affair   9.140807937623027
arranging your papers apparently   11.067716721467434
no sooner had this idea taken possession of him than he became more composed arranged his couch to the best of his power ate little and slept less and found existence almost supportable because he felt that he could throw it off at pleasure like a worn out garment   13.635123748579117
the waistcoat and the letter were both what is termed circumstantial evidence   14.142614148810392
his eminence can not see the letter without the bearer of it replied the young man   12.36077399416499
well said he let us go to valentine   10.546837439395908
on coming near the bank she jumped lightly on shore and took to flight   14.895121863521648
grimaud approached with a very sullen expression on his face   12.495974512045308
deuce take it all the worse for me   10.2355289007373
he drew back smartly while a mass of stones and earth disappeared in a hole that opened beneath the aperture he himself had formed   12.278472484301814
thus d artagnan entered paris on foot carrying his little packet under his arm and walked about till he found an apartment to be let on terms suited to the scantiness of his means   15.325356499949486
but they were not alone your musketeers   6.686824194877722
the count patted him gently on the shoulder his usual mode of praising ali who pleased and gratified with the commission assigned him walked calmly towards a projecting stone forming the angle of the street and house and seating himself thereon began to smoke his chibouque while monte cristo re entered his dwelling perfectly assured of the success of his plan   12.132582712237678
yes my lord he replied   12.246385389218855
he must know where his master is   9.856224508886864
repeated the cavalier a second time letting his cloak fall and leaving his face uncovered   13.74956114139578
what is his folly   7.531920637623969
then aloud well my dear aramis do you ask me why i came to seek you   10.517857901763781
even he added in an inaudible voice even that the procureur be not dead   15.631968943389612
he is afraid i have come to borrow money thought d artagnan   16.213249895710774
this astonishment was doubled when aramis saw athos fill a bumper and toss it off with all his former enthusiasm   10.603534300668013
debray rose smiling and was about to contradict the baroness upon this latter point when the door opened suddenly   5.021711756789035
this door communicated with a subterranean passage leading under the street to a grotto in the garden of a house about a hundred yards from that of the future protector   14.720795032674829
as soon as possible   12.69318122009391
i would as willingly accuse myself   9.858649375569382
whence comes that money   9.999863522337947
this is torture to me cried athos   8.368908134898689
cried d artagnan pale with terror   4.441814245491563
by a violent effort he rose half out of the water waving his cap and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors   8.08258123610543
mazarin especially yes do you know i am very glad to hear you give that testimony   16.828301105961906
i trust we shall never find it so in our experience   20.11047747544316
d artagnan entered after the cardinal and behind d artagnan the door was guarded   9.201952342286049
i said i wished to be alone he exclaimed on seeing the young man   8.10857471189988
ah my lord   12.60797697560547
well in spite of that d artagnan said athos you are not sorry that you were useful to her   13.609586426113333
if i durst say what i believe on that head what you believe   13.310362235887142
it had disappeared   9.130010036868274
moreover great liberty prevailed throughout the immense crowd   12.152057346650784
one might have said that twenty men or rather twenty mad devils were fighting   9.122898689100502
if you wish me to enter upon the more difficult part of the business you must assist me by the most minute information on every point   12.170791079630243
said the woman crossing herself   10.179365782277902
he appears to be a resolute fellow   8.0111888473872
the interests of that kingdom and those of england though taking now diverse directions are very nearly the same   7.0308681788141545
no dying   8.736573457444258
when we parted at the pont du var you told me you were going to travel through piedmont and tuscany   10.672531119100995
in the front room the follower was also still asleep her head leaning back on the chair in all respects worthy of her mistress   16.397690414673406
comminges bowed and returned to athos who was awaiting with apparent calmness but with real anxiety the result of the interview   9.28937957996193
that she would infinitely prefer leading an independent and unfettered life   11.505938695345193
said athos phlegmatically   13.654784266864903
lafitte   9.309972236682968
if on the contrary any repulse should take place you and your men must fight to the last man whilst we and the king proceed on our road   14.5925491422596
did you inquire the names of those three musketeers   11.737845728593365
because before you could escape you would have to be turned into a bird   7.199788646173504
de tréville how the affair came to pass   15.680126486716034
if so i will give you a letter of introduction to him   18.384025576350076
sir you alarm me   8.646677886335992
what think you of citizen luigi vampa   13.49883943181161
but tell me what woman has a lover more truly in love   9.954274089278453
and what are you going to do in paris   9.077003397694265
mordaunt bowed   12.610890390588567
and he rushed out of the study   10.48240097333857
a flame seemed to rush from his throat to his eyes he bent his head and wept   10.210884451609356
athos porthos and aramis after having had an entertainment at my house and enjoying themselves very much created such a disturbance that the provost of the castle a rigid man has ordered them to be confined for some days   8.9804165574442
only i fancy i could pass the time less painfully here than anywhere else   15.437392408643396
planchet glared fiercely over the back of his armchair   10.428584178514235
of this treaty at least i have been warned   13.963955827875973
i wish to forget it myself   13.51795580980525
i see him   7.689274876896985
well is all said   11.585559648392422
you know something of that as well as i do i think   13.804393356455918
how few to day exist   9.939544405659356
well asked anne of austria when d artagnan reappeared what does it mean   13.368493956501991
and king charles is well as i have just heard   11.049194648157412
he is doubtless come to prove the perfect innocence of our colleague   17.006010392377775
hold sire said d artagnan they have just told the people that you are asleep   15.345434524155902
the others followed   16.046900506426788
full of affection for everybody because he was happy and because happiness renders even the wicked good extended his affection even to his judge spite of villefort s severe look and stern accent   14.97453448088837
ah traitor cried buckingham you have killed me   19.193330402543488
and this is an irresistible charm to novices in love   11.636804039914571
at least that will conciliate us all said aramis   14.468202877313669
morrel who had already gone some few steps away again returned and pale with joy extended both hands towards valentine through the opening   12.49325143755214
then we are to have no more pistols no more despair   14.978485951065347
i am not at home to any one said the duchess de chevreuse to the footman   10.982545005847793
good god cried kitty there is my mistress calling me   9.538514941459045
said he i see   10.353819072677567
i respected your father very much said he   8.631879368703117
paris has been sufficiently punished   16.181393075508254
but tell me can you not perceive the russet tint which marks the heavens   14.119475265367598
and caderousse rattled his glass upon the table   18.67999491652717
seventeen ages rather especially to a man who like me had arrived at the summit of his ambition to a man who like me was on the point of marrying a woman he adored who saw an honorable career opened before him and who loses all in an instant who sees his prospects destroyed and is ignorant of the fate of his affianced wife and whether his aged father be still living   10.132257385499885
their masters are dead   11.120098742461755
the duke uttered a cry but grimaud did not give a single moan   14.929094250089719
what is the matter with your highness   14.480846304302066
well asked he as soon as they were by themselves tell me what it is   11.487301666028554
we shall re enter london place him securely on his throne and he will make us dukes and peers said porthos whose eyes sparkled with joy at this imaginary prospect   13.626774398944477
suddenly mousqueton uttered a cry of delight taking from beneath one of the benches a bottle of wine   14.201608053021056
athos rose and offering him his hand be welcome my lord said he you are one of us   9.40936708270186
d artagnan thought this was the moment to interfere   13.562929352979637
the son of a rich shipbuilder in malta   10.573313383073085
i say that she is a hostage for the parisians answered the cardinal   10.643886359423536
and the man opposite to you is the man i saw go in   12.772354898486899
i went out as if to fetch wood passed through the subterranean passage into the cellar and whilst parry was gently bolting the door pushed up the board and beckoned to the king to follow me   14.031991907768617
for if he should be there will be really no speaking to him   10.381855597021113
a soldier of the usurper then   12.760839575048093
raoul blushed again   10.58658357043973
happily i vanquished death   13.497849560106392
i am betrayed on all sides   14.647475054921774
make no allusion to the past   12.733963398317446
the four crossed the public room and proceeded to take possession of the best apartment in the house which d artagnan occupied with authority   11.027855181723366
very well said the gentleman   9.561408091416558
chapter xxxii   13.562211026473179
then he went into the stable   17.766329764008695
gentlemen gentlemen said d artagnan do not let us lose our time in jesting   21.31774322911024
pray are you aware that the king has no money in his treasury   13.902518772729103
said the duc de beaufort to himself every man in order that he may lose his heart and soul must receive from celestial bounty one of the seven capital sins perhaps two   10.923985360581053
the queen on seeing him uttered a cry of surprise and asked him what was going on   10.908997966626563
what would be the use of carrying so much more weight   10.63996734164556
it is true sir said monte cristo with his dreadful calmness   8.907602115873624
at that instant there was such a rataplan of musketry that one might have imagined the infernal regions had opened   10.170883610344928
and the count de guiche follow urban and planchet   15.852979761614312
behind the door keeper walked a woman enveloped in a large veil which completely concealed her   18.133011464955832
save me i am pursued   14.220474816657461
20293m it was the end of september   13.082928177200662
that may be madame   15.730876018695575
shall i see you again ere my departure   15.801105073056943
don t you see they are aiming   14.643948753541157
while faria restored by his alarm to a certain amount of activity pushed the stone into place with his foot and covered it with a mat in order the more effectually to avoid discovery   8.476568847537182
monsieur d artagnan repeated louis   13.184983262799795
dantès meanwhile went on his way   9.094467069288662
in my office or in the court if you like that is the surest place   9.415424593049533
the next morning when kitty presented herself at d artagnan s she was no longer joyous and alert as on the two preceding days   10.698201021271533
as the eleventh hour struck he entered with a swaggering air attended by two of the most dissolute and reckless of his boon companions   10.123316498052308
his mocking laugh and threatening words passed over their heads carried by the breeze until lost in the depths of the horizon   11.254642723143807
the note is changed   10.940664156753794
there is a servant active and vigilant not like that lazy fellow bazin who is no longer good for anything since he became connected with the church   11.175218350303764
but the parisians are so subtle in paradoxes that they mistake for caprices of the imagination the most incontestable truths when these truths do not form a part of their daily existence   10.578002477669036
i shall follow your advice not because you give it but because i had before intended to quit france   11.751893444923805
at the moment you left his house   6.053198002110555
the opportunity is favorable to avoid an explanation   14.991628872750633
in the meantime the mousetrap continued in operation and likewise d artagnan s vigilance   13.969783985274347
ali extended his hands towards the apartments destined for the fair greek which were so effectually concealed by means of a tapestried entrance that it would have puzzled the most curious to have divined their existence   13.633354363777036
your friend s soul must stick tight to his body   10.317718643207522
very good signor pastrini said franz   9.061196190300276
he will be here tonight   11.919677116243303
i imagine anyone may write to yanina   13.879331602767476
with me you will be as safe as in a temple   10.608838798094661
oh it is simple enough madame   11.418468932026723
look round you then   8.886049285260599
excuse me said the implacable young girl monsieur albert claims and well deserves his share   10.287725285756903
but a pistol shot is easily fired from a carriage which goes at a gallop   14.413905101590766
do you come from the end of the world   13.913621144620226
but how unless a miracle should restore your speech your gesture your movement how can you chained to that armchair dumb and motionless oppose this marriage   7.292712241125024
sobbed forth mercédès   17.961185083587402
truly a byronic hero   20.144080532149246
the officers were full of thanks and took away their prey   10.475282345000851
morrel allow me to present to you m   12.453596965212322
then believe me it will be time to act   11.027913861479762
you ll be shut up again in the bastile   9.128542101331902
listen to the voice of your heart morrel and ask it whether you ought to preserve this melancholy exterior towards me   12.156584479667073
to no class of persons is the presentation of a gratuitous opera box more acceptable than to the wealthy millionaire who still hugs economy while boasting of carrying a king s ransom in his waistcoat pocket   13.65204788003575
so he has   11.864265464123683
thou alarmest me   15.306210809193827
with a terrible bound he sprang to the side of cahusac crying to me monsieur guardsman   11.585275941834297
anne of austria s eyes shot glances of fire   11.761471260222804
the third three   7.256702017062521
for all i ve had since yesterday was a slice of bread and butter with preserves on it   7.872617834658236
i do said my father   11.213401239296404
but when he saw the carriage take the way to la grêve when he perceived the pointed roof of the hôtel de ville and the carriage passed under the arcade he believed it was over with him   14.739773991137303
he went down to the stables not without some slight annoyance when he remembered that the count of monte cristo had laid his hands on a turnout which sent his bays down to second place in the opinion of connoisseurs   11.185268651173763
my dappled grays   13.186961154602923
because said the old man the natural repugnance to the commission of such a crime prevented you from thinking of it   19.469065656046958
the count has only been two or three days in paris but he already knows what a fashionable woman of the marais is and if he does not you will show him   12.608389622337798
they had observed for some time before them on the horizon a rather thick wood   7.257943240836541
as happy as it is allowed to one of god s creatures to be on this earth   13.077131453035589
good said milady to herself   14.410626934605725
one from love and the other from ambition fernand and danglars   16.227533661208295
at the end of a few minutes monsieur raised his voice and said i want for this mission three or four volunteers led by a man who can be depended upon   11.7639034046244
it is evident by their sending for me that matters are becoming complicated   10.542682319785202
chapter lxx   11.335804423332947
morrel asked his daughter for the key of his study   16.100016588571382
the discussion is going to begin again   9.977670552132583
the two favorite studies of my youth were botany and mineralogy and subsequently when i learned that the use of simples frequently explained the whole history of a people and the entire life of individuals in the east as flowers betoken and symbolize a love affair i have regretted that i was not a man that i might have been a flamel a fontana or a cabanis   17.52761185202261
at these words he drew away the stone and showed teresa the grotto lighted up by two wax lights which burnt on each side of a splendid mirror   9.348309429629305
the queen is likely to follow mazarin s counsels and to have me tried   9.175864100541398
said the old father of the bridegroom as he carried to his lips a glass of wine of the hue and brightness of the topaz and which had just been placed before mercédès herself   9.201736834678533
well said aramis when they were alone what do you think of this business my dear count   15.222037246988823
say not so   12.69554950591543
once across the barriers these two knew neither fatigue nor fear   6.101058779976574
it was mercédès who hearing no news of her lover had come unobserved to inquire after him   14.09862404783533
yes monsieur replied the terrified citizen in a tone so low that he was scarcely audible   16.721654923268332
that is your road excellency and now you can not again mistake   10.187079707470112
mine money   9.674375196699252
my adored valentine words can not express one half of my satisfaction   8.843721404493282
think of the offense you have committed toward me madame   9.465589798893474
there was such dead silence that friends and enemies could have heard these words   15.959144201486474
thank you said monte cristo   11.862525020512493
be it so cried aramis   9.257276736761991
i did say so   9.60102373659571
consoled for what   14.631382376540156
let us go to rueil said athos   10.187064039984396
prudence is a virtue   12.754346065010845
sir he said you are a profound thinker and your plan was sublime   12.622492351081258
as perhaps our readers are not familiar with the slang of the rue de jerusalem and as it is fifteen years since we applied this word for the first time to this thing allow us to explain to them what is a mousetrap   10.249745366415349
where we have orders to lead you   14.16762874876014
no answered porthos i hear it said that he is very badly fed by the cardinal monsieur de mazarin   11.030573144620098
he eats then   6.157889022674165
13 ali pasha the lion was born at tepelini an albanian village at the foot of the klissoura mountains in 1741   15.787614428586068
he was a tiger hurt unto death gnashing his teeth in his wound   15.568304701193144
it is impossible to say whether charles who kept his eyes constantly closed had noticed the insolence of the puritan captain but the moment he heard the clear tone of d artagnan s voice his eyelids rose in spite of himself   12.09388212397749
whatever evils may befall you they will not be occasioned by my instrumentality that i solemnly promise you   9.86754306530137
the fifth part of the profits from this stone belongs to us then does it not   12.742501648597987
he let go the rope and fell upon his feet without receiving any injury   14.063157118306945
the standard   5.398567355388828
at this name every one looked around for his was already a very celebrated name   9.534816129773699
monsieur de rochefort said gondy laughing are you a boy to play with firearms   15.490010356173244
when on the 8th of september that is to say precisely three months and five days after the events which had perilled my life the abbé busoni whom i never ventured to believe i should see presented himself at the prison doors saying he understood one of the prisoners wished to speak to him   9.860269853949266
i regret not having heard them   11.738780806738497
the very sum you named whispered the inspector in his turn   9.94812945794667
morrel saw it was useless to say more and refrained   14.089725389165514
at five in the evening they sent mousqueton on before as agreed upon   12.99059270912441
but what has de rochefort to do with this manner you have of invading my room   11.099170656380553
i see nothing but faces a yard broad   13.939455684104281
but why did you not dare to speak aloud planchet because you are afraid   17.41198139563155
she appeared to me charming though rather melancholy   11.655041657103276
that is likely said d artagnan   14.169052024435327
it is only the sentinel warning me that they are about to change the guard   18.39635344485938
as for me i play my game squarely fairly and above board as i always do   6.8535273903732445
and thou hast not hurled thy thunder at him my god   10.817072848839299
yes that you sent me   11.620602466515555
cried the viscount springing towards her   14.845658028520788
the count then looking over into the street saw the man who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction and place himself against the angle of the wall where caderousse would come over   14.543815216523505
the result of these reflections was that d artagnan without asking information of any kind alighted commended the horses to the care of his lackey entered a small room destined to receive those who wished to be alone and desired the host to bring him a bottle of his best wine and as good a breakfast as possible a desire which further corroborated the high opinion the innkeeper had formed of the traveler at first sight   8.249975463816451
this reasoning seemed to d artagnan so satisfactory that he no further insisted   14.002496480284547
now remember that you are a general and do not go and drink   15.70020512767452
how much have you left of your hundred pistoles d artagnan   11.220915332527108

he felt the stiffened limbs   11.218124224987124
in that respect unlike you my dear aramis for you are still the same   8.768110544059548

gondy withdrew distributing benedictions on his way and finding a malicious satisfaction in causing the adherents of his foes to prostrate themselves at his feet   13.531958863672632
only this time it was addressed to m   12.15346746273527

five seconds has scarcely elapsed after the disappearance of the officer when the door opened and a new personage entered   13.3953921862413
the king as we have said was to follow as soon as his bed of justice had been held   14.206458611217801
edmond was again cleaving the azure sea which had been the first horizon of his youth and which he had so often dreamed of in prison   19.09280884245547

no but her mother   10.964439018774225
it is impossible a gentleman could have written such a letter to a woman   16.147880731374265

he had come twenty minutes before the time appointed   5.17547953760503
he now calls himself the count of morcerf and ranks among the peers   12.390724594919247
now on such a day i can neither eat flesh nor see it eaten   17.18889711871819
porthos replied that he asked no better if the stranger in his turn would drink the health of the king   10.838389962464474

the abbé d herblay resumed de winter is one of those gallant musketeers formerly belonging to his majesty king louis xiii   10.211102033007847
do you then really suffer   11.45383403108163
therefore when at dessert upon a sign from d artagnan porthos had sent away his servants and the two friends were alone porthos said d artagnan who will attend you in your campaigns   16.84960734580902
to send you the chaise as soon as possible   17.413744390148253
there was a secret communication between the cardinal s apartments and those of the queen   11.833065016023676
a more material interest stirred his blood   10.444193302671708

more than once he had reached that part of the garden where the famous boarded gate stood overlooking the deserted enclosure always returning by the same path to begin his walk again at the same pace and with the same gesture when he accidentally turned his eyes towards the house whence he heard the noisy play of his son who had returned from school to spend the sunday and monday with his mother   10.892241152766001
without me you would both have died   17.58181338252046
the heat of the day had gradually decreased and a light breeze arose seeming like the respiration of nature on awakening from the burning siesta of the south   11.811339169139803
responded danglars who had now approached the group nothing more than a mistake i feel quite certain   9.94338252506902
morrel allowed his hand to fall into that which the count extended to him   8.375789451528853
read said the old man   13.448767199467088
i was pretty drunk yesterday d artagnan said he i can tell that by my tongue which was swollen and hot this morning and by my pulse which was very tremulous   14.695715218947196
porthos murmured d artagnan look well at that priest   12.365628754704852
besides which in a short time resumed d artagnan we shall have set battles cannonades conflagrations and there will be great variety   12.890229048662135
my name is edmond dantès replied the young man calmly   10.783396243873609
and i am afraid you will refuse me the favor i come to ask if you do not know to what end i ask it   11.847346282514733

i tell you she loves that infamous buckingham   13.228529151201466
whom heaven protect from evil   13.975054101078754
and there was no fear of being taken at his word   15.818589404896926
he forgot all that was dark in the past and that was cloudy in the future   12.145418323590047
god keep me from it my dear monsieur mordaunt   11.534547080815898
he immediately made a new point in advance rubbed his horse down with some heath and leaves of trees and placed himself across the road about two hundred paces from the camp   9.76983046004511
gondy edged into a corner saw them vanish from the first until the last but one   12.798901657799808

my dear count said albert i will endeavor to return your politeness at rome and place my coupé at your disposal until your own be ready   10.366605412690218
asked aramis glancing toward the west where the sun had left a single golden cloud which dipping into the ocean appeared by degrees to be extinguished   12.812524885778597
i saw your vessel and fearful of being left to perish on the desolate island i swam off on a piece of wreckage to try and intercept your course   17.372802900590727
the only thing to mislead the investigator would have been belief in all the good things he said of himself   12.992763160901996
she placed the poniard in his hand   7.835161768642521
on arriving at the extremity of the castle d artagnan found himself overlooking a beautiful valley in which at the foot of a charming little lake stood several scattered houses which humble in their aspect and covered some with tiles others with thatch seemed to acknowledge as their sovereign lord a pretty chateau built about the beginning of the reign of henry iv   13.32766546931793
but fortunately i do not want for anything   11.941535102365162
some fine morning he will return to take command of your vessel   9.326111286368068

the shadow monte cristo had noticed passed rapidly behind the tomb of abélard and héloïse placed itself close to the heads of the horses belonging to the hearse and following the undertaker s men arrived with them at the spot appointed for the burial   9.623255726976655
d artagnan whose inquiring disposition we are acquainted with had not whatever interest he had in satisfying his curiosity on this subject been able to assign any cause for these fits or for the periods of their recurrence   14.863869093621703
at length they reached it but it was not the friend   11.4843838626791
28 rue de la fontaine   9.484407124323136
andrea only calls himself count   14.509570243209687

raoul turned toward athos who showed him by a secret sign that he did not wish him to go   10.31750376266646
these two newly enlisted soldiers marched gravely after the valet de chambre who opened the door of the vestibule then another which seemed to be that of a waiting room and showing them two stools your orders are very simple he said   13.999404171417467
stop and aramis gave him a louis d or   5.609213909376103
and i am very glad you recognize me dear m   13.715925449467417

for his flight has caused us to miss a glorious affair gentlemen an affair by which there were a hundred pistoles and perhaps more to be gained   12.825607054863546
oh the wickedness of man is very great said villefort since it surpasses the goodness of god   13.910214590136377
a lutheran   13.451894232043351
asked the guide in astonishment   9.168832713019379
no sooner said than done and i lost the horse   11.440077753002482
very good said the prince understanding the reason of that ignorance   9.251270398164605
added monte cristo   12.317993746161504
the usurper converted   13.780771933647049
well then to the king your nephew   15.223969255328559
it may be easily understood that in the present disposition of his master nothing could be more disagreeable to bazin than the arrival of d artagnan which might cast his master back again into that vortex of mundane affairs which had so long carried him away   15.914997243117305
no my lord i still plead   10.437876351575136
have you gone mad my dear friend   8.736164443746532
both were stained with splashes of mud of the same appearance   13.133193918480421
you see i am calm and strong   11.335597434127717
she closed the door after her took the duke by the hand and after a few experimental steps grasped a balustrade put her foot upon the bottom step and began to ascend the staircase   10.541190149707933
no let us belong to no party but remain friends   7.497429546320527

but what does she tell you   10.723664738786097
at the end of a long corridor with which the door communicated and which formed the antechamber was on the right albert s breakfast room looking into the court and on the left the salon looking into the garden   8.627352388796922

yes replied teresa with astonishment   12.884387069850842
the count stood alone and at a sign from his hand the carriage went on for a short distance   16.293452177441978
and indeed for a man in andrea s situation an arrest meant the assizes trial and death death without mercy or delay   7.091666979062852
opportunity is the martingale of man   9.849651357856823
i would swear to it   12.225253037104183

then follows the melancholy chant of the priests mingled now and then with a sob of anguish escaping from some woman concealed behind a mass of flowers   12.239008066366123
he is one of cromwell s most enthusiastic disciples   12.991229144905994
he then drew two crowns majestically from his purse and gave them to the host who accompanied him cap in hand to the gate and remounted his yellow horse which bore him without any further accident to the gate of st   12.341303817453372
it is my happiness my treasure my hope   13.298740399938342
to save yourselves to scamper away to flee that is good for the king s musketeers   14.22033202741843
the dog shook his head   9.919926083279456
she has been dead a year and you know fernand i have subsisted almost entirely on public charity   13.269139389555054
now jump down athos   14.04518282566181
madame said he if i dared in my turn advise would it be to give up broussel sir   13.821701132580635
another person was confined in the château at the same time but he was not wicked he was only a poor mad priest   15.33489007481013
the queen may appear to have abandoned those persons but we must not put faith in appearances   12.123232120467392
i am mistaken   17.811687805845644
but viscount since we can not perform the journey in less than seven or eight hours do not keep me waiting   11.633120432582807
asked morrel with a sickness of heart   12.893754674456009
no your excellency   6.414522580711056
the friends urged on their horses and arrived in fact at about five o clock in the morning   10.852911578994908
athos who had been observing him and guessing his thoughts took his arm and led him into the garden   12.460598534709618
asked monte cristo who could not help looking at morrel with so much intensity that two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that clear and piercing glance   10.688493779944507
and do you said valentine depend on me to stimulate the tardiness and arouse the memory of grandpapa   9.899175899755233
but we must say at the present moment d artagnan was ruled by a feeling much more noble and disinterested   14.304212647212813
sir replied the queen closing the coffer and leaning her hand upon it if there is anything to be said it is that i have always been ungrateful to the brave men who saved me that i have given nothing to that gallant officer d artagnan you were speaking of just now but my hand to kiss and this diamond   12.915249442605296
ten parts of a hundred pistoles each in ten throws without revenge   12.446717824368678
asked mazarin turning pale   13.373872841726303
but when i did so the shade disappeared   11.145868624957009
we can die but once   14.78769071188675
then running downstairs she left the hotel walked to the rue de provence called a cab and drove to m   8.490714586712295
believe me guilty as i was oh yes i too have suffered much   20.184475963781452
come parry said the king cease your tears   8.054044453962112
but of what disease then did she die   11.646004019394445
the count turned around and fancied he saw him in the corridor rendered still darker by the torch carried by the concierge   10.395058091890647
she knew him   14.211380429488436
brave athos   12.394691165750828
it is the social capital of a theatre on the boulevard or a railroad from the jardin des plantes to la râpée   9.683202115407198
all faithful hearts with me   11.79951053006997
i imagined your dead body buried at the foot of some gloomy tower or cast to the bottom of a pit by hateful jailers and i wept   9.7849313385659

morrel we shall see   14.017061614739134

morrel said he as if he had just quitted marseilles the previous evening and had just returned from aix or toulon   7.790852222785597
a sign from grimaud put him on the alert   12.301377778247753
monsieur passed along the front of the line   6.100475521599725
have you admired the rapidity of my fall   14.732704586844253
i learned so much at marseilles replied the abbé making a strong effort to appear indifferent   10.972993989127627
and i know my son had good reasons to wish to fight with you and to endeavor to kill you   11.111868307025516
then i speak at random   18.453818401954596
do you not remember him   19.211773823661446
but when you have drunk give me your opinion   7.632648611886744
enjoining in case of disobedience on his part all the subjects of the king to pursue and take him   13.985062608888805
all three have left the service   15.272492490988757
he said i am then to die   9.232323982614659
and let us burn this letter which no doubt announces to you some fresh infidelity of your grisette or your chambermaid   9.713615033099382
bertuccio wiped the perspiration from his brow but obeyed   13.707981029872762
he soon perceived that a slope had been formed and the rock had slid along this until it stopped at the spot it now occupied   13.914352490763923
30245m for shame   9.167083222708163
the magistrate was seated in an armchair writing with his back towards the door   7.524709921156392
now this is not all he said   15.51701264674497
he was for some time without reflection or thought for the divine charm which is in the things of nature specially after a fantastic dream   16.086343036423017
and as he had only gone there for the enjoyment of seeing it and hearing the music he took his place at their head beating the drum on two pieces of slate and passing from that exercise to that of the trumpet which he counterfeited quite naturally with his mouth in a manner which had more than once called forth the praises of amateurs of imitative harmony   11.880506164394927
i believe in you and i would have all the merit of my devotion even if that devotion were stupidity   10.580424105940839
aramis returned soon with a man from the hotel de rohan who was saying to him you swear sir that it is not so   9.714960298378758
monsieur de chavigny where was he   9.704555932513351
as for you morrel this is the secret of my conduct towards you   12.168594745651466
exclaimed d artagnan picking up a louis and displaying it   10.921113119956356
he is more than that replied château renaud   14.60526084874724
this box contained an unctuous substance partly solid of which it was impossible to discover the color owing to the reflection of the polished gold sapphires rubies emeralds which ornamented the box   12.306740586605883
but at the present moment i can only do for you that which i just now offered   8.952240857914264
here was another frondeuse to persuade and she was even less open to conviction than her younger rival   11.846034129854973
the king motioned him to accompany them   11.735281097170223
my jeweler and my secretary   11.421194073388047
let us break the carriage   15.819626543111706
then as he went in he saw the fair madeleine his hostess standing on the threshold   11.584983363282564
volume four 40010m 40012m 40020m chapter 74   15.55369377926305
and the third the duke de longueville and the prince de conti brother and brother in law of condé   15.733360826894788
by jove i am falling or rather bayard is falling answered porthos   12.953145852119208
these are all so many empty words my dear sir said morcerf they might satisfy a new acquaintance but the comte de morcerf does not rank in that list   13.57299572520372
you will hear again from me   9.749622704255009
i should like it early as i am going into the country tomorrow   11.066964167315597
forget even my name and be happy   7.194633870923325
come my friends   12.751461905491029
if i had listened to you the knife would have been pointed and of steel   18.79165376003465
listen now to what i say in this my dying moment   18.42107983595791
do you believe it was because i committed the sacrilege of mounting en croupe behind henry iv   13.750261523154819
he had fainted   12.172294137895838
really i think you are going mad good bertuccio said the count   10.113396761845857
well baron i promise you some good exercise   12.07815592064811
and me also said porthos   10.467245136022568
scarcely so much   13.600936423873682
promise me i say   14.29932990381326
i forget   9.159085889085711
and he struck out with the energy of despair   11.553417186509737
many observations were made the import of which was a unanimous opinion that there was something sinister about the room   13.776167953923213
in god s name answer me   11.654189876149598
we appointed to meet at la chevrette   9.71648104080568
yes at the time of her relations with monsieur de buckingham   13.329285824613155
and you will place the king and queen in safety also at saint germain   13.545463041760142
colonel tomlison said charles kings can not yield   7.5661207242945565
i shall seek not mazarin but the queen and say to her madame restore to us your two servants and our two friends   9.9639472318935
there it is then said monte cristo as he stepped out of the carriage   15.002229947577135
he ran to porthos and threw himself into his arms   10.152233298802333
and to remove all suspicion if she had any milady repeated to the lackey before her the latter part of her instructions   7.259819903425804
are we mistaken and is dantès triumphant in spite of all we have believed   9.409040638565305
the duc de beaufort made his entrance at court receiving ample reparation for the wrongs he had suffered and all the honor due to his rank   13.59281229396734
while the flatness of his forehead and the enlargement of the back of his skull which rose much higher than his large and coarsely shaped ears combined to form a physiognomy anything but prepossessing save in the eyes of such as considered that the owner of so splendid an equipage must needs be all that was admirable and enviable more especially when they gazed on the enormous diamond that glittered in his shirt and the red ribbon that depended from his button hole   13.027180065026565
tell him all this for me for these are things which a king can not say for himself   11.753902972199878
this is tuesday well tomorrow evening we leave and the day after we shall be at tréport   10.403861485430937
that is true and that will redeem us a little in the eyes of posterity if posterity ever looks at us   6.615773512832408
that it is only the pope who is infallible and that this infallibility does not extend to cardinals   13.4457499057942
lover and husband chapter xix   11.655512018499568
but we know very well what had become of edmond   6.688205772642285
raoul remained silent for he was not prepared for the dignity of the bel esprit   15.072069115865578
you would be the happier for it at home sire and i do not doubt you would be the greater for it abroad   10.315944191891715
she heard him enter but she did not raise her head   8.107782654123088
you are vexed are you not that he thus gives a clew to the labyrinth   2.917569991365239
well that has happened friend porthos   12.990688232182741
the portcullis was therefore raised the porter had a louis for his trouble and they went on their way   13.355491118166277
assemble the servants who remain there   13.181294987170503
you shall not do that d artagnan said athos coolly   13.953975290830753
the moment she lost sight of him milady tumbled fainting into her chamber   13.23705734358248
what papers   17.858588848325315
oh that s simple enough   7.685938887724396
during the evident preoccupation of madame de villefort monte cristo scrutinized the features and appearance of the boy she kept folded in her arms lavishing on him the most tender endearments   7.254044112173432
i saw her put to sea the same evening we quitted marseilles   12.53275753316479
but this relation you mentioned do you wish me to speak to him   13.370335136308444
oh this time it is too much   10.74462211756931
said porthos opening his eyes at that last word   8.864436230888384
monte cristo gave his hat cane and gloves to the same french footman who had called his carriage at the count of morcerf s and then he passed into the small salon preceded by bertuccio who showed him the way   13.085970896612686
that which i have to say of her can only be heard by yourself my lord   12.168168903236335
i ask pardon of your eminence said d artagnan but i was so fatigued don t ask my pardon monsieur said mazarin for you fatigued yourself in my service   10.836237587535177
travelling with his sister   10.426022528789805
at the hour appointed lord de winter and the four friends repaired to the convent   12.209959895215249
it is too late said mazarin tearing his hair too late   12.476545259086299
cried d artagnan is your first witness monsieur porthos   13.820752249806047
cheer up said she to noirtier   14.112525812539124
i want to find out who was the man in the mask who so obligingly offered to cut the king s throat   13.4431217064135
why good god   11.982994640581676
you asked me the cause of my being late and why i come disguised   16.371544492600936
cried the calm voice of athos from the other side of the door let them just come in these devourers of little children and we shall see   13.928073921824119
and for this very reason said danglars with a smile which he tried to make sardonic i prefer m   13.381074980027417
at this time that is about half past twelve madame danglars ordered her carriage and went out   17.857163992299554
this did not prevent the king from being as complacent to him as possible whenever he met him or from asking in the kindest tone well monsieur cardinal how fares it with that poor jussac and that poor bernajoux of yours   12.335481055187508
did she stay long there   8.6513615191096
my prisoner   11.585344717441952
cried the sentinels   14.234738426722966
lord de winter thought athos was mad   9.155238093637479
we are getting to the story now   9.607298079616289
stop said selim seeing that she was about to go out   10.842363390637756
father he said do you reflect that you are bidding me to live   7.472912468020468
i give you a hundred i give you a thousand times to guess monsieur the visit i received in your absence   15.507645914089114
as you are my commander it is my duty to obey   8.453790491814923
what has become of her then   13.121642174007473
the king was lying on his bed resting on his elbow   12.920748757665205
morrel swore to love him with all his soul   11.45462573640569
and i am yours body and soul   14.2423386154486
her majesty did us the honor to ask our aid for her husband   13.967270512439423
in any case aramis replied the punishment should fall not on the king but on his ministers   12.760432422607828
then you advise me to accept   9.315760553541322
he placed his letter in the hands of the usher on duty who led him into the waiting room and passed on into the interior of the palace   12.16571318812355
some condemned soldier perhaps suggested athos whom they have pardoned at the price of regicide   9.793162512493495
while lone and solitary like a forgotten sentinel a tall pine raised its melancholy head in one of the corners of this unattractive spot and displayed its flexible stem and fan shaped summit dried and cracked by the fierce heat of the sub tropical sun   9.331044067939624
that we have as you well know good heaven   6.570999279312076
what doest thou here good for nothing   10.331791205632912
murmured he clenching his fists and his teeth chattering   16.216024100722414
i don t suppose that our friend d artagnan has added any of his own to the amount   18.243642158614236
when the procession stopped this shadow was recognized as morrel who with his coat buttoned up to his throat his face livid and convulsively crushing his hat between his fingers leaned against a tree situated on an elevation commanding the mausoleum so that none of the funeral details could escape his observation   12.640979504194963
no no doubtless he was deceived and it was but one of those dreams that forerun death   15.779083973762054
he had divined in the past of this woman terrible things which his red mantle alone could cover   15.295906202233342
as soon as the door of gondy s study was opened a man rushed in   12.767874607094138
but services such as he had rendered could never be too often acknowledged   19.244930629330852
where shall we pass the night   11.126060910588842
said château renaud shaking hands with each of them   5.493278217944999
yes undoubtedly the abbé busoni himself replied monte cristo   15.490004820209455
the door closed and dantès advanced with outstretched hands until he touched the wall   7.095086468320032
monsieur the abbé said he do you like blows with a cane   13.36062786318847
calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black shagreen the abbé opened it and displayed to the dazzled eyes of caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained set in a ring of admirable workmanship   10.401166727991471
i came to thank god for my happy deliverance said rochefort   13.061248183150033
as for me i had been forgotten in the general confusion   17.029976761145903
she only told me she wished to send me to london to serve the interests of an illustrious personage   12.654144724990516
the procureur exerted himself to reply   15.008428806031315
desideras diabolum unhappy man   12.971433725938157
do not think i wish to turn you out my dear debray continued danglars   14.07554543515249
i have no part to play   15.17708146591755
each one went out by the open doors   13.208893072634329
bonacieux saw her go without being able to follow her   14.677150444670723
now as you are one of the whole world i mean to say that you also are deserting me   14.398959085517182
gentlemen here is the letter conveyed to me by lord de winter   12.605069783066734
he had a great desire to go to the window but he dared not   11.404568260792097
said andrea who knew the delicate sense of hearing possessed by the walls   11.460384904663284
in truth my young friend you will act rightly said the gentleman pressing the gascon s hand with an affection almost paternal   16.052737090755475
the food is the same as in other prisons that is very bad   15.626311104095803
d artagnan received him as he would have done a friend of twenty years standing   7.977557306512076
i have made money at the same time by speculations which have succeeded   13.122328313630192
it was impossible that bazin should go out of the cathedral without his seeing him   12.076347643615126
her large eyes were dilated with surprise and expectation for it was the first time that any man except monte cristo had been accorded an entrance into her presence   5.937557639322236
mercédès started   13.220561887481065
an agreeable one   10.426186390975438
well monsieur laporte placed her near her majesty in order that our poor queen might at least have someone in whom she could place confidence abandoned as she is by the king watched as she is by the cardinal betrayed as she is by everybody   10.859570428501224
he shall die then since you condemn him   9.487025288918659
the procurator s wife was piqued   12.56990307901676
who will give it to you your prince   8.502667194016102
and d artagnan coughed   10.318130218039945
then i must go to the rue st   13.691255018369283
at any rate said she since i am to be married whether i will or not i ought to be thankful to providence for having released me from my engagement with m   13.851948907844305
he is the most estimable the most trustworthy creature in the world and i will venture to say there is not a better seaman in all the merchant service   14.218443452847696
it is true she speculates with her own money not mine   13.688325839900768
she cried out but d avrigny paid no attention to her   16.672210938285538
why prithee   13.825314610518433
have you any idea what became of them   9.357593967428336
la ramee was in ecstasies at having beaten a prince of the blood   11.794586300817473
the latter knew that this officer who was so pale but who appeared so determined would keep his word   12.658196601302592
under the other cardinal continued d artagnan we didn t know enough to make our profits   13.089827946202275
this example was imitated by the rest until the room filled silently as if these men had been the humblest most devoted courtiers   8.697793123970115
that title said cromwell laughing is all very well here but take care a word like that does not escape your lips in public   16.758144211413672
you know it must not   13.538947800905063
and as a far higher encouragement it brought him into close intimacy with a woman he adored   10.626565162424486
there edmond dantès   13.10002258535097
monte cristo observed it particularly and by a look asked the banker for an explanation   11.840817801422268
yes yes dantès good health   15.163306935618778
did i ever tell you that my mother was lady of honor to marie de medici   14.020263825869343
ho friend   16.18530468498505
how well you reason   11.416614172821603
yes let us drink said athos anxious to make it up by hobnobbing with d artagnan let us drink and get away from this hateful country   10.272961299244386
that this house which has remained uninhabited for twenty years must have some gloomy tradition or dreadful legend connected with it   11.96912838034957
bah said beauchamp he played the prince very well   7.638481002305024
de tréville fixing upon his compatriot a look so piercing that it might be said he wished to read the thoughts of his heart on account of my old companion your father as i have said i will do something for you young man   12.046266834772794
to be imprisoned   4.995199489497223
she stopped and slept at an inn   10.323398823291953
cried morcerf parodying the banker as the selection came to an end   13.929485815459714
the popular banker found that it answered better than count   10.341644496906426
he was a statesman of high standing and you may or may not know valentine that he took a leading part in every bonapartist conspiracy set on foot during the restoration of the bourbons   13.068979492907953
d artagnan put his forty pistoles into his pocket without any scruple on the contrary thanking his majesty greatly   8.28507429600778
i madame replied he follow monsieur de la fere wherever he leads even were it on to death without demanding wherefore   14.55520072757895
cried aramis is it not a warlike encounter that we are going to   13.372595349471323
who prepared it   12.805537292848385
but there is the cardinal always at hand who does not leave me a moment s repose   8.996082758227
the horses started on a trot and took the road to the louvre which they entered   13.162827188681138
but his eyes darkened by death encountered only the knife which had fallen from the hand of felton still smoking with the blood spread over its blade   14.504463670394529
why it is as good as a century   12.224356465942895
their days were passed in endeavoring to catch all that was said in observing the proceeding of the cardinal and in looking out for all the couriers who arrived   15.664236332777708
we must play the game to the end and consent to be blindfolded   14.590184309956992
never mind that returned the sailor i know their vessel   14.186937647296283
said mazarin looking fixedly at d artagnan   11.255437530425539
from whom comes this letter   11.720604661819397
the dappled grays volume three chapter 48   16.670289061813413
you will find here moreover the young woman of whom i spoke who is persecuted no doubt in consequence of some court intrigue   16.38228907518372
the steamer waits and in an hour i shall be far from you   15.670941779141842
friquet had a quick eye and a fine ear   10.859183189079934
d artagnan had judged correctly   12.126650551684731
he had good cause to do so   8.35038715319447
the president paused and the count turned pale   17.20854468652562
yes she of whom you told me one day at amiens   9.776143677069287
june   14.466309476199992
oh no sir it was expressly forbidden   8.978365957050185
tis true i said so and i say it again   10.07634640365766
do i for instance fare better   7.758549239390426
a person whose confessor i am replied he and who entertains a high regard for me applied to me a short time since to procure him a confidential servant   10.87794491474388
however among all the incoherent details given to me by the abbé busoni and by lord wilmore by that friend and that enemy one thing appears certain and clear in my opinion that in no period in no case in no circumstance could there have been any contact between him and me   8.069397797842464
and you honest man have ever since been asking your heart and sounding your conscience to know if you ought to expose or conceal this secret   12.047527512339522
do you know whom i have encountered here   14.850515468899074
de tréville of the letter with the great red seal and the cardinal s arms   9.733486410266416
there is no prison here   8.752023443566678
he was punctual dressed in black with crape around his hat and presented himself at his cousin s with a face made up for the occasion and which he could alter as might be required   17.309850602696997
tranquil on this important point aramis continued his way with d artagnan and both soon arrived at athos s dwelling   13.417248963873448
during the evening two men engaged for the purpose had carried noirtier from valentine s room into his own and contrary to all expectation there was no difficulty in withdrawing him from his child   14.587993432502191
the caves of the small island of monte cristo all i poss   14.26858606686554
you knew the poor lad then   10.804078484310097
his lips again moved   17.308500583754846
milady held out her hand to him which he kissed tenderly   9.254105196792185
my dear monsieur de comminges said d artagnan you will find that my friend monsieur du vallon will go to the most fatal lengths if cardinal mazarin continues to provide us with this sort of meat   8.748205423180115
a committee of twelve members was chosen to examine the proofs brought forward by morcerf   5.007927066234618
it is fernand the man whom after you edmond i love the best in the world   15.153214565847694
said planchet humiliated by the suspicion and moreover terrified at the calm air of the musketeer   8.766318669847168
and bowing to the lady he sprang into his saddle while her coachman applied his whip vigorously to his horses   16.151572387395984
besides i shall be there   9.293343078797319
although the musketeer was not expected before one o clock the procurator s wife had been on the watch ever since midday reckoning that the heart or perhaps the stomach of her lover would bring him before his time   13.343092330586614
and i know not what you mean said d artagnan bowing   15.316786758427066
let me blush for the faults you know and perhaps perhaps for even more than those   14.28586110826353
god has so willed it   11.559332618559996
there is not a single woman passing   7.604860156587476
he felt assured that benedetto was guilty and he hoped by his skill in conducting this aggravated case to flatter his self love which was about the only vulnerable point left in his frozen heart   10.781940740023638
then i can speak without fear of tiring your excellency   9.479785407487327
i must then remain here   18.82710799531894
now the italians and the gascons are too much alike and know each other too well ever to trust what any one of them may say of himself   15.231855568689376
what is it you want dear grandpapa   12.851474947148926
ah your pardon said dantès frowning in his turn   10.926767208270608
the ball contains a letter   10.410964660092276
athos was delighted to find he was going to fight an englishman   7.971571855133051
meanwhile the prisoner had remained impassive and as if he had no understanding of what was taking place   12.845604556698019
and having got out all he wanted he paid for the hypocras which he did not drink and went quickly back to the rue tiquetonne   12.626134343508202
therefore albert had not an instant to lose in setting forth the programme of his hopes expectations and claims to notice   12.90812414538399
well then resumed faria with a bitter smile let me answer your question in full by acknowledging that i am the poor mad prisoner of the château d if for many years permitted to amuse the different visitors with what is said to be my insanity   11.383433278464024
but are you not still in the service you d artagnan   13.955264032383909
the magistrates freely discussed their political views   6.626945734516012
now it is for me to perform my promise   12.130125501475018
but you were speaking of haitians   8.520141327899314
a pallor overspread the young man s forehead and he looked around him with anxiety   15.737507380195083
a great effect upon porthos who thought her much prettier than the lady with the black hood   9.918514035685416
what the devil makes you think of bonacieux   12.260186975428013
ah i can understand how the sight of him struck you replied lord de winter   14.14477979553549
i wish to speak to you   14.897988425627224
listen said the doctor   6.853575022079854
is it not so madame   11.490447703627208
she bore me rapidly away   8.571291308821513
cried friquet don t you see   12.966772443955954
but asked the sailor where are your companions   11.961104231432298
but with his simple musketeer s uniform and nothing but the manner in which he threw back his head and advanced his foot athos instantly took the place which was his due and consigned the ostentatious porthos to the second rank   10.376082225566998
besides repentance becomes the guilty   12.578895042115233
but that happiness was denied me   19.633655210061573
said d artagnan this is rather warm   9.833253942115144
all very well said porthos but i should like to understand   11.442783424499027
i have learned some fine things concerning your musketeers   9.852881452150168
as these words agreed wholly with the order they had received they bowed their heads in sign of assent   10.127564797321643
said villefort to have such duties to perform at your age after such a blow   11.633830227948726
everyone looked at carlini   19.560909699567944
i am afraid that remaining at blois would be dangerous to his youthful mind   12.039478395228207
that will look very well   7.508710309651017
moreover he had now the means of adopting any disguise he thought proper   10.976840436472603
and what is serious is that it will certainly spoil his face   7.346499637331764
if there is a sentinel within the apartment kill him without hesitation   9.229903129870271
sell it then   11.671786151931371
permit me to thank you   12.187673805955527
and even what i am sure of   11.031108691929349
but i who only understand my own figures know nothing more than that one day these figures deceived me   12.582379912033288
then of his wife the noble and courageous woman who had sustained him to the last moment   9.502314340799566
till now i have watched over his education and i have made him i hope an accomplished gentleman   13.818912883542938
a cold sweat covered the brow of the cardinal   14.833164992290314
i wish what god wills   7.141113763399028
the phial contained perhaps twice as much more   11.465468689146553
his aim was to elude the examination   9.648635832644649
the inspector begged the englishman to seat himself in an armchair and placed before him the register and documents relative to the château d if giving him all the time he desired for the examination while de boville seated himself in a corner and began to read his newspaper   9.12991452594382
the little light in the lodge had long been extinct   16.712864072009108
the emperor now king of the petty island of elba after having held sovereign sway over one half of the world counting as his subjects a small population of five or six thousand souls after having been accustomed to hear the vive napoléons of a hundred and twenty millions of human beings uttered in ten different languages was looked upon here as a ruined man separated forever from any fresh connection with france or claim to her throne   5.268724824925841
the spectre of valentine rising before the poisoner would have alarmed her less   10.88474674319528
athos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to fasten the door inside and to make them a sign to come and listen with him   10.97148998923428
but i know   16.149809291031126
for women have infallible instincts   14.876395833769564
look after the house wife and i shall be back in two hours and caderousse left the house in haste and ran rapidly in the direction opposite to that which the priest had taken   16.720955219583214
then your count entertains visitors does he   10.66830948828964
i promised to come said felton and i have come   9.62510111471354
grimaud thereupon presented himself with his smooth exterior at the donjon of vincennes   10.611004399868289
surely you will not refuse a comrade   2.886476911779294
it is six o clock said madame de villefort evidently agitated   12.526123334570524
then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged   12.075919546735557
thus they applied very curtly to the salutations healths and jokes of their companions   15.395952024080703
oh sire replied the minister we have no occasion to invent any   13.529298600525335
morcerf paused at these words quietly waiting till the cloud should have dispersed which had gathered on the brow of danglars and which he attributed to his silence   13.917615237471988
capital isn t it   10.278422934393717
the sergeant had not the courage to reply   11.326741048797965
for the second time i give you your life   5.669164284466523
is he much changed   12.058356582637074
you see the address said the queen speaking so low that mme   14.642826904779787
but return to your question   10.522690199984645
35   10.008766136326802
we are observed   14.111895766596234
there was no answer and she continued i have not seen you all day   14.389359683923388
monte cristo then was in league with his father s enemies   12.914518992575005
i almost hesitated though replied the sailor   12.008189337034533
and you will always love him   12.36318112405442
have you traded it for your diamond   9.51396602767139
you have proved it   10.35320953177466
his hand of iron grasped quick as lightning firm as a pair of blacksmith s pincers the soldier s throat   13.25555802601855
when you are told anything can not be done there is an end of it   7.614047017576892
she was in a little boudoir hung with blue damask adorned by red flowers with a foliage of gold looking upon a garden   16.54500867592164
albert left the cab in which he had come at the count s door intending to take a turn on foot   18.107513004438704
the case was therefore prepared owing to the incessant labor of villefort who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming assizes   12.505691458771082
and i have no inclination to play   15.587153596744278
cried the two friends   12.560787997204674
a despairing cry escaped the pale lips of mercédès   7.468653772936279
and was this lady young and handsome   13.19904981585333
in the rue saint honore athos fell in with two gentlemen whom he did not know on horseback like himself followed by a lackey like himself and going in the same direction that he was   10.634630622763332
debray you are a connoisseur i believe let me have your opinion upon them   10.311290861420177
but withdrawing his anxious look from the chest and fixing it upon porthos he contented himself with saying monsieur our cousin will do us the favor of dining with us once before his departure for the campaign will he not madame coquenard   15.754124630773656
30137m go then into the drawing room my young friend where you will find your father awaiting you   11.156233879951706
exactly so said the delighted major   7.580421694906153
they were encompassed by a troop of horsemen   11.569576135563706
four men traveling together would be suspected   13.193036999069221
we are admired i faith answered porthos   9.819678463276825
do i regret life   10.116039268297865
cried the young girl   12.49326799765117
the king therefore arose a minute after and putting the money which lay before him into his pocket the major part of which arose from his winnings la vieuville said he take my place   14.932266519938082
this man was armand jean duplessis cardinal de richelieu   10.270489797222172
the officer who had stopped in front of her and studied her with so much care might have been twenty five or twenty six years of age   10.44921229883047
but overpersuaded by the advice of her women she at last had the appearance of beginning to forget   11.854241924918842
gaetano then exchanged a few words with this man which the traveller did not understand but which evidently concerned him   11.354864603760099
and athos whose domicile was established in the rue guenegaud found himself close at hand   13.541563762612858
can i not like pasta malibran grisi acquire for myself what you would never have given me whatever might have been your fortune a hundred or a hundred and fifty thousand livres per annum for which i shall be indebted to no one but myself   15.61358795066509
you are going then to offer a prince are you   11.55040555098643
one night more and he would be on his way   10.541123640008319
she cried as d artagnan finished you dare to tell me the details of your crime to give me an account of your treason   9.115209307586822
but cried bonacieux this is not monsieur d artagnan whom you show me   10.717849418991236
and this time as though nature had at least taken compassion on the vigorous frame nearly bursting with its own strength the words of morrel were stifled in his throat   13.192484550022883
and he smiled on receiving d artagnan s response the béarnese accent of which recalled to him at the same time his youth and his country a double remembrance which makes a man smile at all ages   7.194099743175328
they have been speaking of my marriage have they not   14.893267431989857
d avrigny put his hand to his heart and placed a glass before his lips   10.957664010525606
order it as you please sire   12.624263417906256
d artagnan but that till that hour he had been at m   11.983763167400978
one of the notaries sat down the other remained standing   9.453680141011695
but the count exercised over him also the ascendency a strong mind always acquires over a mind less domineering   11.981231726792199
morrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken barrois s situation and in noirtier s name gave that order   11.410554601089643
de tréville or whether he should only ask him to give him carte blanche for some secret affair   10.710996246676471
but everything in the world is unstable and the man who happened to fall into disgrace with your majesty might lose this office to morrow   9.574389012208815
he was about to see in reality a certain coffer of which he had twenty times beheld the image in his dreams a coffer long and deep locked bolted fastened in the wall   11.814555923812817
de monte cristo is almost an oriental and it is customary with the orientals to secure full liberty for revenge by not eating or drinking in the houses of their enemies   6.120906303206849
athos cast a glance over the epistle and to disperse all the suspicions that might have been created read aloud my cousin my sister and i are skillful in interpreting dreams and even entertain great fear of them   13.374325077498808
but it seems you have come back rich my boy continued the tailor looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which dantès had thrown on the table   12.307569778193871
he had sent to engage a box at the teatro argentina   14.871309278238598
perhaps you are an officer that i am detaining here   12.189102895737504
he saw me hold out my arms to him and he stooped down and pressed my forehead with his lips   14.211842477901413
ah here is one of them i believe   8.322071276927804
dantès began to fear he had delayed too long ere he administered the remedy and thrusting his hands into his hair continued gazing on the lifeless features of his friend   15.438821379327827
well there s nothing bad in that it seems to me said porthos   12.866957311383239
now attach him to our party   15.059309483947324
you can not mean that   13.630526031360972
by the orders of the deputy procureur   6.657704359893126
men of the robe and men of the sword on the day after these events had taken place athos not having reappeared m   14.561069987496227
but instead of going into the saloon with the rest of the crowd he asked to be introduced to m   10.886591469734537
my father too is dead said morrel   7.192499073818029
continued d artagnan   12.057783787180307
i confess this staggers me   4.343503149124349
he took the arm of madame danglars and conducted her into the garden where they found danglars taking coffee between the cavalcanti   14.467073231346012
said monte cristo sighing   7.249748342670677
yes replied de comminges more especially if it could reveal how monsieur d artagnan for this last week has been anathematizing him   13.493338668095348
it was night when the two adversaries reached the field of battle   11.85756842610456
added villefort extending his hand toward her as though to seize her in the name of justice   6.605055508745087
woman s yes   11.248003394451443
this tunnel was dug no doubt with an intention of escape   9.991985508206028
and the father and son previously informed that it was through danglars the one was to receive his 48 000 francs and the other 50 000 livres annually were so full of affability that they would have shaken hands even with the banker s servants so much did their gratitude need an object to expend itself upon   11.873341488949029
but where is my old friend winter   9.293258586676819
i have heard of it   12.18464287439322
yes said villefort closing the door after him it is i who am come in my turn to ask you if we are quite alone   14.209747959072313
but the good curate went every day to say mass at a little hamlet too poor to pay a priest and which having no other name was called borgo   5.660526722156105
i confess i have seen nothing but the fire   11.150021680852717
you love   13.908734631972242
50101m do you wish to see him   13.073863283001224
both descended to the chamber in which the wounded man lay   11.604577084619917
to be a bishop   14.864253094368504
mademoiselle said the stranger one day you will receive a letter signed sinbad the sailor   10.558094478959793
he might have been taken for an exile about to revisit his native land   12.78582314163307
my dear albert he said if you will make haste we shall yet have time to finish the night at torlonia s   14.851584024629684
oh misery oh vanity   11.483989545567733
it is true then he said rather uttering his thoughts aloud than addressing his companion it is true then that all our actions leave their traces some sad others bright on our paths   10.135272975840486
he found the duke reclining upon a sofa with his hand pressed upon the wound   7.660613314486153
but if i am not hungry   13.634760328267404
you know his father s name   17.586112452084308
is there any particular priest you wish to pray with valentine   13.108560985746486
40130m no he wished to speak to your excellency   11.359349921521805
he took the full glass and a biscuit   9.934628119506792
yes if you will not consent to retract that infamous calumny   13.06340046885185
oh sire what an idea   12.941619596855253
he let off his fire at but four paces   15.947333392946582
yes your purveyor godeau the purveyor of the musketeers   11.015528214643293
occasionally by the light of a flash of lightning which gleamed along the horizon the road stretched itself before them white and solitary   9.469859945976555
and the poor coachman was conducted to a closet the windows of which were barred and which looked very much like a prison   14.153553991041523
besides do you see that door athos   9.687069856572158
he therefore hastened to the palace to congratulate the queen on the battle of lens determined beforehand to act with or against the court as his congratulations were well or ill received   19.169081704005322
as the distance increased between the travellers and paris almost superhuman serenity appeared to surround the count   11.569976595330287
then observe too that the woman with him is altogether unlike all others of her sex   10.881661401498203
they are below sire and with your permission la chesnaye will bid them come up   11.729991158469451
that is to say two hundred more a hundred pistoles for you and a hundred pistoles for me   12.041252993030374
prove it to me   13.835705341102582
the gentleman who receives us   13.027854831329764
behind this figure glowed a vast fireplace alive with leaping flames   8.542725140451088
and on their saying that they were going to monsieur de bouillon on a mission of importance a guide was given them under pretext of conducting them but in fact as a spy over their movements   13.559791125802064
why there is nothing to prove that the general was murdered   11.513527564771538
nor me either said athos   13.183951825266501
grimaud intimated by a scarcely perceptible nod that he should consent   17.823927709944115
remember that his name is all my secret   12.232594384863603
and this costume a ball costume doubtless becomes her admirably   6.681753133936747
in an instant from the door of the cabinet to the street gate the whole hôtel was boiling   10.712469096499905
well my dear friend add to his natural devotedness a good sum of money and then instead of answering for him once answer for him twice   13.788168372014026
resumed porthos with a movement of the shoulders full of good fellowship   11.371636078382654
d artagnan does not tell you raoul said athos in his turn that he was reckoned one of the finest swordsmen of his time a knuckle of iron a wrist of steel a sure eye and a glance of fire   12.253452323262996

after a momentary examination during which the queen became as white as the cloth which covered the altar on which she was leaning he put it back into the coffer with an involuntary shudder   13.152288811236733
in an adjoining room andrea saw also a tolerably clean table prepared for two two bottles of wine sealed the one with green the other with yellow a supply of brandy in a decanter and a measure of fruit in a cabbage leaf cleverly arranged on an earthenware plate   15.257223794004709

and who am i to nourish such ambition   12.387246495563431
she is cowardly said villefort   12.50432144129823
but it is probable said the light horseman that they will send pioneers this morning to repair the bastion   11.565848577517759
how could i make such a proposition especially to a woman who always professes to be so entirely disinterested   14.489155636462499
come step in said the young man   11.238911817287512

and of this be well assured that if you love me as a father i love you as a child   9.048540945176866
feeling certain that i intended to pass the night there he had returned to summon his comrades who just arrived in time to hear the report of the pistol and to take me in the midst of such circumstantial proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of proving my innocence utterly futile   9.018203730287562
far from wishing my lord to quit paris i hope he will stay there and continue to be prime minister as he is a great statesman   7.347477404331686

vulcan   10.629132942024272

de tréville attended the king s gaming table   14.34274339586659
and the travelers buried their rowels in their horses flanks who thus vigorously stimulated recovered their energies   13.518019351066869
my friend placed a bottle at the distance of thirty paces and at each cast he caught the neck of the bottle in his running noose   13.436267500174873
20189m come two or three more such adventures and i do not despair of seeing you a member of the academy   14.574319100944791

de guiche who was young and impulsive said to raoul here we are three masters and three servants   13.116422576471614
the approach was not such as to prepossess people an ill smelling dark passage a staircase half lighted by bars through which stole a glimmer from a neighboring yard   13.192723994558733
every one thronged around mademoiselle paulet for she was always very much the fashion   16.1297186312922
this movement was accompanied by killing glances at mademoiselle danglars and by sighs launched in the same direction   10.392532469062965
exclaimed dantès his heart wrung with anguish   9.235748705459951
old dantès was dead and mercédès had disappeared   10.682885431847355
take away that fool   13.319577742248539
with regard to athos he leaped lightly into the saddle and set out at full gallop   12.1939627792405
two horsemen going out as athos and aramis entered were obliged to give place to them   17.35989619935506
there is nothing so expressive as the face of an epicure who finds himself before a well spread table so la ramee when receiving his plate of soup from grimaud presented a type of perfect bliss   13.44567562463405
answer for i have many things to tell you too   13.769481944634117

kitty will conduct you to my chamber   16.387628634427085
cæsar and his father searched examined scrutinized but found nothing or at least very little   13.04079530084856
and his guardian what would he have said to that   14.837014878472328
but what if i were mistaken   10.613381124179485
now said d artagnan i ve one last favor to ask of you monsieur de comminges   13.707436574758015
do think of it giulio   13.7724508578802
andrea turned pale but said nothing   11.08108130045602
then said the abbess looking at milady with increasing interest i behold another poor victim   11.110741239029414
the parliament   9.646057109048261
my deduction is replied villefort that my father led away by his passions has committed some fault unknown to human justice but marked by the justice of god   9.081440947337402
therefore he must have made 300 000 livres   11.057884490162882
wholly yours aramis   12.958739939729957
this treasure belongs to you my dear friend replied dantès and to you only   15.070726673339014
i thought i had crushed you madame   13.149153180837615
but i do   11.748468119614023
it was likewise an indelicacy   10.147713144893165
that did more honor to your heart than to your experience m   13.505631574786113
replied la ramee   14.418207032350628
i held back his arm   13.597698062804335
d artagnan awakened planchet and ordered him to open it   10.084011152501535
he flew from the apartment and morrel at the same moment darted out at the other door   11.447023593796846
why then did heaven make the mistake of placing that manlike soul in that frail and delicate body   15.184259867838499
have i not already told you that there is nothing between me and the duchess de longueville   16.579123074617
my cousin knows nobody but bazin and places confidence in nobody but him   13.37301871725284
the two young men arose and entered the breakfast room   11.882961875014502
so saying the countess quitted franz leaving him unable to decide whether she were merely amusing herself at his expense or whether her fears and agitations were genuine   10.256417661952243
monte cristo returned her smile   8.304769150567164
and do you think she is in the least interested in me   16.690253054564852
our chimborazo is mortmartre our himalaya is mount valérien our great desert is the plain of grenelle where they are now boring an artesian well to water the caravans   9.756803106976028
at that moment he cut it   16.785417100532122
therefore i do not doubt what you say monsieur athos i do not doubt it for a single instant   12.56467823001508
my livery will be known replied porthos   8.478580218979296
although he felt himself ably supported the young man was not without a little uneasiness as he ascended the great staircase step by step   5.681613109832487
gentlemen and citizens set me free   9.264560207549811
but they eluded the vigilance of the guards and made a passage from one dungeon to the other   10.283972517871838
think of your joy mother when you see me return with an embroidered uniform   13.992968448094691
do you think that i sorrow for madame danglars   8.998148610611011
madame danglars was rooted to the spot   14.79190585570043
ah very well   10.175384500252973
excuse you for what   15.84209112807006
little flirtations perhaps and that s all   11.431563029565151
i thank you equally for the service you have rendered me in being my seconds   15.6302712513534
i remained in the room and waited   7.972706419271994
between the two baskets he placed a small silver cup with a silver cover   13.100177266548446
we will spend with him a guinea each per day   10.76341746404393
god s blood   8.029768665103129
selim made ready his lance   6.152398405315272
mercédès read albert while showing you that i have discovered your plans i hope also to convince you of my delicacy   6.821951464660236
in spite of his habitual silence the poor lad this time found his speech   15.2053095619986
whilst supper is being prepared he said smiling you will not my friend be sorry to have the mystery which so puzzles you cleared up   11.934770096117047
it was round and a large divan completely encircled it   12.607942411630429
still that idea of death madame said villefort   14.797037684322827
come said the wretch is not peace much better than such a war as that   12.516838363056015
monsieur de nargonne was a baron and my name is hermine   7.151784847205943
your mission is accomplished but ours is not   11.828564445195255
they were caught   8.408695923716465
you will not pardon me   15.70101254951126
the stranger touched his mule with his heel and continued his way   13.686528863158735
then i have full occupation for i am so   13.189552308071917
rent the air and thirty blades glittered about their heads   8.54200925756662
you will accept his judgment   15.839666362315652
milady recoiled uttering a cry   16.55657772792132
the noise increased   14.115481948533546
i do not wish it said the eye of her grandfather   9.266274414282737
d artagnan s eyes sparkled with joy   15.048996308006814
but i thoroughly hate but a few   10.6084295088742
they walked from one end of the chateau to the other porthos looking with wondering eyes at d artagnan who was counting on his fingers   8.615540294721598
his dialect amuses me   13.849078176890977
but this time milady lent a more attentive ear than the first and she heard their steps die away in the distance of the corridor   16.8527884628325
where is my son   14.100881173509713
said de winter i am at this moment as poor as he is if not poorer   10.727573354263122
that it is no longer a riot madame he replied but a revolt   11.8572514501505
i have a very good cook and he is not to be my heir   16.019278877042147
remarked d artagnan   9.129377670418485
there he told the chief all his affection for the prisoner their promises of mutual fidelity and how every night since he had been near they had met in some neighboring ruins   17.841795642455878
then in my turn i also say very well   14.857661300755272
she then went on to describe the persecutions exercised by the cardinal upon his enemies   6.87123710061674
danglars will pay you the amount you may rest assured   12.12074375638951
the past chapter 114   13.372033210234997
but the agitation of the night was legible in his pale and careworn visage   10.570801262648196
i tell you to the left and you are looking to the right   8.661226442170697
then leaning with one hand on the oaken rail of the dock in the most graceful attitude possible he said gentlemen i assure you i had no idea of insulting the court or of making a useless disturbance in the presence of this honorable assembly   14.343662803195166
the first prince of the blood the king s uncle   16.662266948053013
let us go said athos and aramis   17.011235771901756
it remains possibly for us to accomplish ours   11.594770963469763
leave him with me replied the duchess   13.399281444111365
cried the marquise napoleon the type of equality   9.678239898775464
said she shrugging her shoulders i am not ill   13.19331494254125
one of the last as you see   15.994793216245554
gentlemen continued the baroness among the ten horses in the stables of baron danglars are two that belong exclusively to me a pair of the handsomest and most spirited creatures to be found in paris   11.938437244534606
come if one can t always eat one can always drink a maxim of poor athos the truth of which i have discovered since i began to be lonely   8.298590383544886
he loaded them looked at the priming and waited quietly   11.069399554850024
i have not breathed a syllable to them   6.994137782084416
he consequently kept it as a piece of evidence and being in safety behind the angle of the trench he began to interrogate the wounded man   11.458370264419864
i have induced you to take a charming promenade   10.413177245718972
we know him said athos he never left the king   13.060738666790245
when you pay me a visit in my cell my young friend said he i will show you an entire work the fruits of the thoughts and reflections of my whole life   13.83231763635857
he answered her summons as an humble soldier obeys an illustrious general   14.213704354196064
but go on i beg of you   11.50134549315652
50265m give way said the traveller   10.838824666450865
and he gazed with terror on rita pale and bloody a knife buried in her bosom   7.994939654417115
to leghorn   13.593937855011584
the house in which aramis dwelt was situated between the rue cassette and the rue servandoni   16.393797381488596
i think that if you would take the trouble of reflecting you could find a way of simplifying the negotiation said franz   10.31764518464982
because i was arrested at piombino and i presume that like milan and florence piombino has become the capital of some french department   10.096286547849012
if he be a sensible man he will prove it by renouncing of his own accord the hand of his betrothed and will secure my friendship and love until death   18.23606866803214
d artagnan felt himself bewildered   11.656804103812162
he might perhaps have been bought for less   15.323381793611844
cried porthos and aramis   14.288724800717931
my dear fellow let them sleep on if they are asleep   10.50800203063678
he however kept a good countenance holding his hat in his hand and awaiting the good pleasure of his eminence without too much assurance but also without too much humility   14.195916384643208
all eyes all thoughts were occupied with the young and beautiful woman whose gorgeous apparel and splendid jewels made a most extraordinary spectacle   10.647651883666557
yes cried bonacieux recalling all his remembrances of the circumstances yes that s it   13.510816379885496
my faith yes said d artagnan   16.257110376932403
bonacieux was explaining her devotion and that she had freed her from that prison   8.539290032193435
with one spring he flew from the chamber of milady into that of the maid and quick as lightning he slammed to the door and placed all his weight against it while kitty pushed the bolts   12.007026542059224
chapter lxxxix   13.00224839909382
you are very provoking and will not give me credit for anything   14.917317510123858
he swam on still and already the terrible château had disappeared in the darkness   11.163090147798291
gentlemen said the president when silence was restored is the count of morcerf convicted of felony treason and conduct unbecoming a member of this house   10.148585068326021
light me   12.383694070494666
but perhaps he whom you await is inconstant or if he is not the sea is so to him   15.999747496335075
he folded up the accusation quietly and put it as quietly in his pocket   9.795209479858649
you will take your musketoon and your pistols   9.076479037902734
you may retire   10.84170554199632
i will call for them   11.06025939322836
and then i feel the loss of my house tis a long time since i visited my castles   14.49765809567544
the penalty of death i greatly fear   6.499892417472298
i dislike these quarrels among men of the church   19.65499923403773
but by some strange play of emotion in proportion as the proofs that faria had not been deceived became stronger so did his heart give way and a feeling of discouragement stole over him   12.377983545239726
yes and give them a chance of escaping said d artagnan   12.888397082206208
d artagnan had his sword and placed two pistols in his belt   9.452839793938733
i have no one   8.667553306181123
d artagnan released the hands of athos which he still held clasped in both his own and hastened to her   9.038838951750295
if these are spanish doubloons or even gold crowns thought d artagnan we shall yet be able to do business together   12.953283697690932
night   9.193764443614569
we were merely joking   12.167574911932217
le comte de soissons by the grand prior by the duc de longueville by the duc d eubœuf by the comte d harcourt by the comte de la roche guyon by m   12.311748002991619
oh you are a just man   8.680272815269998
nay nay   8.308088202859835
gaspard   14.847746963397844
speak monsieur speak said d artagnan who instinctively scented something advantageous   11.825414946978913
possibly nothing at all   10.525941631772632
but d artagnan was too far off to hear him   11.388219936659741
he took her for the queen   12.91126814365011
you believe so   14.19730208155905
but not for me who discover a gentleman by instinct and who scent out an aristocratic family like a very bloodhound of heraldry   13.07982707557474
chapter lviii   8.687412359726054
asked his friend   11.97056013609133
the young princess clapped her hands   13.62665311443779
but you who must know that i am not listen to me and believe me so afterwards if you will   10.460966746061981
i agree with you entirely sir   10.995996419204662
to be sure why not   14.37972528515381
again danglars bit his lips   13.014474601402346
mazarin shuddered but he reflected that a man who had the least intention to betray would not warn first   10.550982702609366
you are somewhat blasé i know and family scenes have not much effect on sinbad the sailor who has seen so many others   15.559830678923204
ah as regards aramis that is another thing said porthos and it wouldn t surprise me at all   8.718321104658408
no albert take my advice   15.787661382412974
de tréville crying to the rescue musketeers   12.008292503716026
that is to say she was in the full splendor of her beauty   5.426907426251688
ah valentine tell me if he ever looked on you with one of those sweet smiles   7.441344286536355
to fight that was to disobey the law that was to risk his head that was to make at one blow an enemy of a minister more powerful than the king himself   5.203791796685516
you must obey the king   8.950050637959436
indeed your excellency i had very considerable difficulty in obtaining them and as it is they have cost an enormous price   11.209570107782408
these two shots had mortally wounded my father and it was he who had given utterance to these frightful cries   12.014263250397228
he shall do what he wishes to do   7.288600493481148
this marriage added madame de villefort is quite agreeable to the wishes of m   13.107847451964172
have you by any chance been in the bastile   12.260415914208743
my father has in his study a genealogical tree which will tell you all that and on which i made commentaries that would have greatly edified d hozier and jaucourt   16.520245435213756
but his appearance manifested increasing uneasiness   12.433099229368056
he is going to fall   9.481487028985184
ah said villefort smiling i confess i should like to be warned when one of these beings is in contact with me   14.035443356211989
whom god preserve   14.550694478045795
and for pirates returned gaetano repeating franz s words   6.5571068284725325
valentine smiled but it was evident that she suffered   10.510927331583579
from his eminence cardinal mazarin presenting a letter   6.536192099075616
aramis swallowed a hasty mouthful gulped a glass of wine and changed his clothes   8.626799945192657
said caderousse groaning with pain   11.112770974880036
valentine stretched out her hand but scarcely had she touched the glass when she drew back in fear   16.602058948570846
you would like one that sails as rapidly as lightning interrupted mordaunt   17.44074685545132
thus the poor sailor lives in the recollection of those who narrate his history   15.499773429773658
now kiss me   10.516667674537679
but who after watching over her child during the brief period allotted to her in this world now i fondly hope watches from her home in heaven   13.040464839740597
i have never seen her from that day   8.516674985360334
his complexion was pale not of that deadly pallor which is a kind of neutral beauty but of a bilious yellow hue   10.699703410315541
sir what a cook must monsieur pierrefonds have when he was so fond of eating and drinking even whilst he was only called monsieur porthos   13.21512075314436
one morning he took this man on one side and had succeeded in speaking to him when grimaud entered and seeing what was going on approached the duke respectfully but took the guard by the arm   9.716531585311088
presently said d artagnan   10.399448242625661
debray who has not trembled before me   10.588012652771383
how exquisitely coselli sings his part   7.473751444952292
an apartment as we have said had been retained beforehand and thus he had but to go to signor pastrini s hotel   9.718798064917749
well it is the same with hashish   11.56414889339096
nothing the cardinal spoke in his most conciliatory manner except to beg of you to forgive my unworthy suspicions   12.087272303468579
willingly my lord   5.345004636938441
porthos we slept six years side by side   12.29099277163135
for the rest the orders had been issued by the count   14.541550519427156
and then there is a human being killed according to all the rules of art and skill and of whom justice learns nothing as was said by a terrible chemist of my acquaintance the worthy abbé adelmonte of taormina in sicily who has studied these national phenomena very profoundly   10.415537665832263
in a fine linen cloth was wrapped a new born child   9.768676909504403
but yourself monsieur said athos who began to be annoyed by this inquisition give me i beg you the proof that you have the right to question me   16.57890922209578
when she wakes she can sup   9.25695433799398
meanwhile time was passing on for the prisoner as well as for those who were preparing his escape   11.315335835332238
but said danglars thoughtfully how is it that your patron m   12.532606001588602
like all persons of real genius milady knew what suited her nature and her means   14.539199539710333
every one was impatient la ramee to sit down to table the guards to go and drink the duke to escape   17.50916638669961
you hear d artagnan   14.803681958259801
but you may easily comprehend felton that the more superb the prison the greater was my terror   7.914439330670795
you see very plainly that there is still danger for you since a single word makes you tremble   18.089587789376896
help help my friends   13.038011411079093
a fine idea that of his said danglars shrugging his shoulders   12.978632659143665
amid the moaning of the storm she heard the grinding of the file upon the bars and by the light of every flash she perceived the shadow of felton through the panes   13.983434813754783
he felt afraid of hearing his own history   13.84940325403582
at the sight of these men the englishman started and advanced a step   13.296336992279358
they merely stood aside to let him pass by as usual nothing more   8.689770295620068
the young man and young woman perceived they were watched and redoubled their speed   13.400248563243023
i wish to know can you tell me pray is anything fresh occurring in this part of the town   17.08304822195916
they told me the executioner of bethune was here and wounded when you uttered two piercing cries   5.633898196005195
about in the same manner said another musketeer that i bought this new purse with what my mistress put into the old one   10.96580871133461
buckingham also was pursuing a private vengeance   14.293404812936846
they weighed heavily upon your stomach   10.007507929896658
de villefort at the moment when the count leaning over a large table was tracing on a map the route from st   10.074537868679911
i have already told you my lord that i shall see no one   14.325369859698624
for the major like a prudent man in case of any accident happening to his bank notes had immediately converted them into an available asset   14.657729824952352
be satisfied with being a plain straightforward citizen and turn to that side which offers the most advantages   11.81468871122838
but pray sir continued aramis who seeing his captain become appeased ventured to risk a prayer do not say that athos is wounded   9.823531523272763
your crime   10.774806006346427
a horse for your lackey   8.757507252268235
admirable and dogmatic   11.103065595773895
on the contrary it seemed to be a delicate attention to be gratefully received   12.513598734305
only one minute mr   15.338593088493473
no one ever asked her where she was going   15.046505907989857
it kills as quickly and prevents all outcry   10.74641883277283
noirtier s look continued to interrogate   15.271076670506332
but for me who am without any settled means and without resources for me who am neither a musketeer nor even a guardsman what am i to do to inspire either the affection the terror or the respect in planchet   11.584382981121536
the young man bowed   12.365941615929643
where can we find another sword   18.447652985231294
risked our lives twenty times for your majesty   8.501262687420333
my fortune though small is free and unfettered and the memory of my late father is respected in our country valentine as that of the most upright and honorable merchant of the city   13.920187897022835
mazarin saw the smile and profited by the moment   6.224097409160915
with such a heart as yours and such a sword one passes through the valley of the shadow of death a dozen times unscathed and unalarmed   13.575944337529181
hear me maximilian said his father   16.981379683757638
ah good evening my dear m   14.780281489382991
he made up his mind not to take a single step to equip himself   11.589069650913572
then you came here to defend him   18.57664402309289
i love zaccone and he hates him   9.853183257794306
said aramis with that mildness of language which was observable in him every time that his ideas were directed toward the church   16.18148046613984
that is true said the duke   13.88097896956516
you don t know i quit the seminary   8.856952783561697
it is the talk of all paris   9.110564544346136
and monsieur du vallon added the other   11.055910482022053
gentlemen said he let us drink to him who presides at the repast   12.040762192395379
my time is not my own   19.202582833870085
cried dantès eagerly quitting the table   10.40165936549282
the second contained the duke and duchess of orleans the tall young mademoiselle and the abbé de la riviere   9.806922583295187
d artagnan started alone on his journey without other escort than his sword and with a simple passport from mazarin to secure his admission to the queen s presence   10.901635544732704
he is to be trusted   14.74687734345561
but you come from england   7.1899180273202505
and now added the queen her voice broken by her emotion have you any other question to ask me   12.176914182416903
i have told you   6.485852231229436
but your mission will not be accomplished   16.006539854904492
i present them   12.568796024647018
de chevreuse   11.498054068596272
yes monsieur i believe so   9.027208171519149
instantly   16.512903995864626
you are here   9.376000788524902
all were fully engrossed with the affairs of the day   11.598777352799415
but as for the carriage what as to the carriage   12.594208701806446
cried d artagnan what matters it to me after all if cromwell who s an englishman revolts against his king who is a scotchman   13.24910924537961
and with his fine countenance radiant with joy and happiness a more perfect specimen of manly beauty could scarcely be imagined   9.102344411908408
what she threatens she will do   9.361633344765224
for you and nobody else as the horse which paws the ground is mine and the other horse which is caracoling belongs to athos   15.360717695678375
look at the arms   17.957119296225713
what hatred she distills   13.395267390856135
hence it resulted when d artagnan proceeded to draw his sword in earnest he found himself purely and simply armed with a stump of a sword about eight or ten inches in length which the host had carefully placed in the scabbard   12.423406715087584
i have read so in petronius said the count   10.253042217487204
but villefort interrupted him   11.04558015685676
go into my study here and i will show it to you   9.768782033011158
true said aramis so as i am in a minority i withdraw my proposition so far as it relates to the voyage to rome and monseigneur s resignation   14.39037156379529
last year i had four apricots they stole one i had one nectarine only one well sir they ate half of it on the wall   9.511209386049414
felton arose   10.940940657018574
the dog again shook his head as if to say no   14.345692857620403
athos smiled but did not reply   12.182194622439596
i understand said athos   12.649206079963253
milady arose as if moved by a powerful spring and her eyes flashed lightning   14.800721793929815
in particular there is one yonder of a gascon look   11.577812051626887
for you porthos who carry matters in such a magnificent style and are a god to your valet mousqueton   11.571368095478462
but i see that you have preferred commending yourself to me by giving me good counsel   5.999670715050645
till we meet again then dear traitor   13.647332551166862
i thought he was philosopher enough to allow that there was no murder in politics   17.509065320873148
you oh heaven you   12.484178949334042
mademoiselle paulet took her accustomed seat but before sitting down she cast in all her queen like grandeur a look around the room and her eyes rested on raoul   12.865870035651128
i wish you to obtain for me from monsieur dessessart leave of absence for fifteen days   11.23450798676533
well and what then   9.581101874342291
from the time d artagnan took quarters in that hotel the mistress of the house a pretty and fresh looking flemish woman twenty five or twenty six years old had been singularly interested in him   14.450334564641388
and as i was about to say by the word of bonacieux i have confidence in you   11.843650657612494
it appears said cromwell that this improvised executioner did his duty remarkably well   11.117333674641271
arrived and was the bearer of the duke s dying gift to the queen   8.433036722730265
what do you think of the plan gentlemen   10.153205017041898
no my lord he had three colleagues three brave men men such as you were wishing for just now   14.880778281199419
go away he said   12.949552892665698
so said the cardinal in a tone that contrasted strongly with the severity of his words you have constituted yourselves judges without remembering that they who punish without license to punish are assassins   13.677855759939762
cried la carconte do as you will   14.409793774930531
while in that service he had discovered a silver mine in the mountains of thessaly but he had been careful to conceal it from everyone   15.995087372782056
so saying the two young men went down the staircase and got into the carriage   13.263578771196068
i opened the door of the ante room myself and i saw you enter at the end of the corridor   10.191827731484207
mademoiselle eugénie   14.135929259331572
but being obliged to go against the current he advanced but slowly   20.592561450814742
said morrel in a hoarse voice   11.172052790279254
franz hastened to inquire after the count and to express regret that he had not returned in sufficient time   13.444683397822045
and as since that which you have said is too clear to require any explanation replied d artagnan in a low voice i beg you to follow me   13.897594909509156
a half hour afterward d artagnan returned with the two thousand livres and without having met with any accident   7.6858517453555475
let her go free and i will exact nothing else from you   15.238050637781155
shall you not go with the queen   19.28425797863925
said morcerf quite ready to aid the memory of the narrator   8.66836463600822
and so connoisseurs in wine as we are we have sent you some anjou wine   14.915183302566927
cromwell had two or three of these retreats in london unknown except to the most intimate of his friends   12.74176851033501
sir my instinct told me that those people were assembled there for some bad purpose   10.713197273682885
believe me madame i feel most grateful for your kindness but i got out of my travelling carriage at your door this morning and i am ignorant how i am installed in paris which i scarcely know   7.777520161007445
what is the matter my dear m   12.487223094695057
by my soul you had made me forget all that dear constance   13.88199264640632
on turning round the owner saw danglars behind him apparently awaiting orders but in reality also watching the young sailor but there was a great difference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the movements of edmond dantès   19.147526141494676
he felt that he had passed beyond the bounds of vengeance and that he could no longer say god is for and with me   14.287024764687985
let us unfold them first and then pass on to the private plans which perhaps had not less influence upon his eminence than the others   14.47534501831747
money my lord as much money as what you wish me to undertake will require   13.698978355245817
the duke is english   6.62323844250685
at that period of his life i lost sight of my young comrade   15.876064451352219
my father was not a bit behind yours in that sort of talk   14.048362279255178
and you fellows resumed mousqueton stay near monsieur le comte d artagnan and pay him every attention in your power whilst i go to prepare my lord for his visit   18.08129860723775
but since they served your eminence so well why are they my lord cardinal in prison   13.994794770326092
how do you feel this morning   13.824115230277553
inquired emmanuel   16.776715495055896
the next day on awaking the count perceived raoul by his bedside   15.50239668387856
the two friends went near him   9.28625707028039
the young men had no objection to this proposition   12.69578627167748
asked the queen who did not understand or rather was not willing to understand   11.116329718109071
at these words he gave a signal and as if only awaiting this signal the yacht instantly put out to sea   9.895419500431663
the dose has been excessive but she has only been shaken by it   15.124763330412156
scarcely more   10.40337433356467
no matter replied de boville in supreme good humor at the certainty of recovering his two hundred thousand francs no matter i can fancy it   13.840379097880007
many said your father had only to show himself to crush the charge against him   15.604134335563751
twenty five thousand francs a bottle   6.296743197956273
said mousqueton the letter was very consoling   12.627180134033011
he seems besotted said danglars pushing caderousse with his knee   15.182519487382956
having run against a young shopkeeper who was gaping at the crows and who had splashed him aramis with one blow of his fist had distanced him ten paces   13.929187722510196
the door soon opened and the accused appeared   13.41651048687873
but he held too tenaciously to his projects above all to this one to change the program which he had laid out in advance   12.525985412468133
i am very sorry for what you tell me said the governor replying to the assurance of the doctor that the old man is really dead   6.3991770508174755
whether noirtier understood the young man s indecision or whether he had not full confidence in his docility he looked uneasily at him   12.014803684589914
when madame de beauvais appeared at the door and announced the cardinal the child who had been absorbed in the pages of quintus curtius enlivened as they were by engravings of alexander s feats of arms frowned and looked at his mother   12.207979792859149
a silk waistcoat covered with embroidery   13.647636553634275
silence be silent   7.132943209244878
delirium   15.016782032969473
she would look far better if she wore fewer and we should then be able to see her finely formed throat and wrists   10.533538566104628
of the caresses of children so pleasing and so sweet especially when one is parting from his children never to see them again   12.380583486500468
in the concierge that opened the gate the count recognized cocles   10.297384837783483
i shall stop and conceal myself a few leagues hence until my brother can rejoin me   15.629395172887012
and he lives   17.500072471131205
and i the duc de beaufort by his white plume of ostrich feathers   15.148030859104722
he had noticed however that the prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor   10.747524695238324
i felt a great chill at my heart and at the word fire which resounded in spanish from the enemy s ranks i closed my eyes and thought of you   14.447046976962222
the noise had ceased   10.175096120569629
on this occasion he began his rounds at dantès cell and on leaving him he went on to faria s dungeon taking thither breakfast and some linen   4.044647575166584
it was   13.02956902449086
come sir said he addressing broussel silence that woman and follow me   13.180654230944981
the gentleman raised his eyes slowly from the nag to his cavalier as if he required some time to ascertain whether it could be to him that such strange reproaches were addressed   12.451560047114313
the ballet ended amid the applause of the whole assemblage and everyone reconducted his lady to her place   8.030164329185823
alas you will find it so yourself said aramis with a sigh   12.318132141986982
he is he would have added edmond dantès but the count seized his arm and prevented him   13.0163039097345
and two or three times i fancied that i had heard it before   9.846686213690038
said the cardinal knitting his brow   12.970496180592724
yes i promise you as faithfully as you have promised me that this horrible marriage shall not take place and that if you are dragged before a magistrate or a priest you will refuse   13.50603537675791
the fox as he quitted his earth on some marauding excursion   7.794096893062674
exclaimed lucien   15.819490016413202
and you will have nothing to fear on your return   14.489628725814516
it is a snare to prevent your making any resistance when they come to fetch you   7.22087796734533
turning towards monte cristo she added count will you oblige me with your arm   12.84924853647128
everything is best in its time monseigneur   12.294112907241127
gascon headed man will you have done   10.52844079157006
you understand then monsieur resumed planchet that if it were for some enterprise like that undertaken against monsieur broussel that you should ask me to take my carbine no don t be alarmed   12.640479118459215
then thinking the deposit might contain some treasure he turned up the ground and found me still living   12.663072411530889
porthos was not very quick to understand the language of glances but now since the name of athos had suggested to him the same idea he understood   10.831964592644404
planchet added grimaud   9.580236121597194
i hope soon to see you again my dear edmond   12.167655884485267
many curious faces had already appeared at the windows and the people attracted to the end of the street began to run first men then groups and then a crowd of people   9.59926724150066
valentine cast down her eyes   15.130937621350487
the trap once replaced over his head you being on the trap dead or alive they will need at least ten minutes to find the hole by which he has escaped   14.363873598956257
go and fetch it my good fellow   7.858414430075249
upon his answer in the affirmative the sailors exchanged a few words together in a low tone   8.326643779051714
there was not a blade of grass to be seen in the paths or a weed in the flower beds   15.553317049503114
dantès had entered the château d if with the round open smiling face of a young and happy man with whom the early paths of life have been smooth and who anticipates a future corresponding with his past   16.830556314511266
where he is going to visit athos   16.010168357655807
then you will be besieged   12.201126508686544
i said without your laying out a sou   17.786437284020092
farewell saintly martyred majesty lisped athos chilled with terror   7.955274067927777
and in a few minutes cahusac fell with a sword thrust through his throat   12.024469100589364
on recognizing her step mother valentine could not repress a shudder which caused a vibration in the bed   7.847797389215222
the three musketeers therefore did not hesitate to make a step forward   15.514938297689536
and as if the shrieks of anguish had driven away the clouds the veil which hid the moon was cleated away and the gray sails and dark shrouds of the felucca were plainly visible beneath the silvery light   11.749824131760617
supposing also i should persuade the marquis to give me my capital which is not likely but still is possible we would place these two or three millions in your hands whose talent might make it realize ten per cent   12.957049563300087
my brother is reading his two papers la presse and les débats within six steps of her   13.477502799654076
i know it sir replied monte cristo   8.700161802381025
it was precisely at this moment that m   15.76146226700906
allow it to die tranquilly and honorably of old age and if you make a campaign with it take as much care of it as you would of an old servant   16.220157039287795
said louis xviii   8.947393309772291
you will know presently pass it   14.485954717570007
they went on board and the captain instantly conducted them to the berth prepared for them a cabin which was to serve for all purposes and for the whole party   8.796528097456987
as danglars had hitherto contented himself with being called a baron he felt rather flattered at the title of excellency and distributed a dozen silver coins among the beggars who were ready for twelve more to call him your highness   9.25391986458922
the title attracted me   15.92217304822532
thanks to m   8.918643779758055
it was now athos who turned pale   8.970740319199589
i pardieu   10.59066934926939
poor young man   12.231847135267827
raoul without dismounting called to the host and announced that a wounded man was about to be brought to his house and begged him in the meantime to prepare everything needful   13.934477199938378
this time you have an idea   10.599087661666378
and is it your cook who prepares these pills   12.53741301725058
who goes there yourselves   12.815428045537878
monte cristo was engaged in examining this portrait with no less care than he had bestowed upon the other when another door opened and he found himself opposite to the count of morcerf in person   14.29695784205675
yes have you a plan   10.983278869603161
d artagnan therefore followed mme   10.993407454820964
my father s income is about 50 000 francs per annum   12.577825068833292
rising and retreating to the very wall   12.698132276161768
milady concealed her face in her hands as if she could not endure the shame which this name recalled to her   8.068670892097671
yes my lord said the marshal you have divined all that was possible to human genius   9.990342084575287
is that all then   13.423746608689665
but is not your eminence going to the queen   11.481725314524084
the plate was magnificent old and appertaining to the family   12.048925435318207
near her was mademoiselle louise d armilly who thanked the count for the letters of introduction he had so kindly given her for italy which she intended immediately to make use of   11.533850580477548
and as he had more imagination than the swiss he dreamed that aramis having become pope adorned his head with a cardinal s hat   11.476179509743844
he stifled therefore the feelings of compassion that were rising composed his features and sat down grim and sombre at his desk   12.531780509662243
if by chance our amphitryon changes his mind and receives only porthos and myself why then we must resort to heroic measures and each give two strokes instead of one   10.555110585902064
la ramee uttered a cry of horror and rushed toward the gibbet which he broke at once and threw the pieces out of the window   12.059462303314792
think you it was the poor servant s life was coveted   11.545692228115874
this cry was generally heeded   14.308644293765479
i will describe my captivity   8.591567256234857
ah reverend sir i tell you the simple truth   10.628922603702952
the most humble clerks such as our deacons and sacristans bless with holy water sprinklers which resemble an infinite number of blessing fingers   14.626708333629805
nine tenths of the english people are horrified at what you say   9.102153484970843
they are prevented at this moment but will join us later   7.770033518152276
the fingers resumed the jesuit st   13.699601578648084
and we are even a little uneasy on what account   20.851776365677054
i shall have nothing to fear but robbers   9.334282237173102
this was too much for the procurator s wife   9.75707001679924
it was then into the midst of this tumult and disorder that our young man advanced with a beating heart ranging his long rapier up his lanky leg and keeping one hand on the edge of his cap with that half smile of the embarrassed provincial who wishes to put on a good face   13.277762403604736
mazarin who at the words it is not the queen with whom the people are displeased had pricked up his ears thinking that the coadjutor was about to speak of the cries down with mazarin and pleased with gondy s suppression of this fact he said with his sweetest voice and his most gracious expression madame credit the coadjutor who is one of the most able politicians we have   16.40251450846528
for the last year my faithful highlanders have fought for honor alone   12.826773568763407
observe said villefort smiling i do not mean to deny that both these men were revolutionary scoundrels and that the 9th thermidor and the 4th of april in the year 1814 were lucky days for france worthy of being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil order   13.097750601537797
from the comte de la fere said aramis   11.423060294468941
said grimaud   11.869479322451681
marvelous   11.467825531710481
thus the count was halfway turned towards his visitor having his back towards the window his elbow resting on the geographical chart which furnished the theme of conversation for the moment a conversation which assumed as in the case of the interviews with danglars and morcerf a turn analogous to the persons if not to the situation   15.524931013975085
a great pity said monte cristo   13.759875143564498
the rendezvous chapter xxiv   14.944015210397069
fie madame fie   18.912341195498048
he who just now presented himself to the abbess as a messenger from the cardinal   10.584255076657469
come just acknowledge that i could eh   13.229578949478602
does my lord seriously wish me to name any one who was mixed up in the cabals of that day   16.51887331659607
nevertheless the keen glance of athos perceived at once it was not rogers who stood before them   13.994105470552409
the feast had been made ready on the second floor at la réserve with whose arbor the reader is already familiar   11.720583734804444
i shall do so if only in gratitude eh   11.680317252103825
your brother has been the victim of this   16.65478025701968
satan bowed his head and groaned   10.976324590084676
the count praised bertuccio s zeal and ordered him to prepare for a speedy departure as his stay in france would not be prolonged more than a month   10.024894426347554
ah i shall know how to make you leave your home   14.8477698923184
have a care how far you pledge yourself my good friend for i may remind you of your promise at some perhaps not very distant period when i in my turn may require your aid and influence   6.458490190892703
the servants passed gayly along the fine courtyard   18.109516373420902
your brother   11.257695396214459
i give you my word of a gentleman   11.165257379032113
it is nevertheless the truth monsieur the pure truth the truth of the good god   5.147066884436787
dantès ordered the helmsman to put down his helm in order to leave la pianosa to starboard as he knew that he should shorten his course by two or three knots   11.470825156386976
this operation proved as great a success as the first   11.221018978303688
caderousse stared at his wife with much astonishment   7.097471081401624
what think you of it   12.637717330007334
the three men saluted one another whilst exchanging a last look   12.55863043129298
and where is the unfortunate being   16.595377323853445
as the hour to wait upon the king was not till twelve he had made a party with porthos and aramis to play a game at tennis in a tennis court situated near the stables of the luxembourg   7.4487408973185545
said porthos raising himself in his bed   8.363556538671695
caderousse who had let his head drop on the table now raised it and looking at fernand with his dull and fishy eyes he said kill dantès   15.849504565617117
poverty was repugnant to her   7.330808714302245
the catalan watched him until caderousse almost overcome by this fresh assault on his senses rested or rather dropped his glass upon the table   7.966796327908632
dantès had tasted nothing but he thought not of hunger at such a moment   9.172188627458523
embrace also our good and brave porthos   14.128675508023182
aramis looked after them and as the last of them passed close to him he pressed the hand of athos   10.36981993006108
d avrigny warned me of it   18.21309262315055
leave the rest to me   12.917894602018006
i should like to understand said porthos   10.10307992381653
thanks to the spurs which served as stirrups in a moment we were perched upon the croupe   11.654475848758217
this was all the furniture   18.699433807967452
the duke shrugged his shoulders   12.87638839635987
without doubt she murmured   13.804640653862673
that s very kind of him   6.981671577937436
40196m yes was the unanimous answer   10.152229974829746
what the devil do you see so bad in it   11.811533321046094
he was at least forty   15.663195294357092
20219m let us understand each other said albert   9.741689688175136
franz waited impatiently inhaling the aroma of the roasted meat when the captain returned with a mysterious air   13.908750315762596
d artagnan remained for a moment motionless asking himself where he could be   10.32357288054612
it depends on you only   9.983490611568902
this conversation had passed as they stood upon the terrace from which a flight of stone steps led to the carriage drive   13.30444295196962
but i will tell you   9.650827518218225
said madame danglars signing   12.50795263498743
two other clocks slower than that of saint philippe du roule struck the hour of midnight from different directions and excepting the rumbling of a few carriages all was silent   12.802603067068226
now will you taste our wine and without prejudice say what you think of it   7.995690053331952
three of the four horses had already arrived   12.990384246530649
it is too gracious   11.606845968809038
to me to a brother   13.062690852044176
de tréville and ran quickly up the stairs   10.239029086022866
d artagnan took advantage of the circumstance to find a place in the hedge not so thick where his glance could penetrate to the supposed cavalier   10.623645624688221
it was then nearly eight o clock in the evening   9.575091694228506
at last he heard the voice of la ramee   12.200118413989525
remain free then and guard your hatreds and your sympathies   10.144055616883374
the house at auteuil chapter 44   11.646581679433396
long live blancmesnil   8.262103737890317
said louise looking at her with admiration   11.2660540572209
thus spoke and acted the gallant knights of the time of charlemagne in whom every cavalier ought to seek his model   11.276386716942957
then came a hum and buzz as of many voices so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the bridal party among whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension quelled every disposition to talk and almost instantaneously the most deathlike stillness prevailed   7.811970159630011
be assured of that   11.128204892757914
well then we will live and die together   15.647791059876425
my dear friend exclaimed athos how i should admire the resources of your mind did i not stop to adore those of your heart   15.74808502780075
your life is devoted from this moment and does not belong to you   11.559536553672674
to the waters of forges   10.302079342021928
the englishmen convinced of these peaceful proceedings sheathed their swords grumblingly   18.88601121733777
as for the queen furious and left to her own guidance she went for the marechal de la meilleraie and desired him to take as many men as he pleased and to go and see what was the meaning of this pleasantry   7.996387969300223
this demon gout this demon gout   11.966693158497275
nothing could be better done   9.882981332691351
but did you think there was anything particular in his look   13.94392562654254
he has been beaten   8.56474083941485
replied the marquis let us lose no time then   10.390519106929322
only that our enemies have escaped   10.267917804477513
is it not tempting what i offer you and is it not an easy thing since it is only to do thus   14.434871374007681
yes i have seen him he replied and he has handed this letter to me   9.473203940735306
he dressed entirely in black with the exception of his white tie and his funeral appearance was only mitigated by the slight line of red ribbon which passed almost imperceptibly through his button hole and appeared like a streak of blood traced with a delicate brush   12.540308228332005
said he on perceiving d artagnan   11.85130883071896
he is coming to play with us this evening   12.340863764381677
the deputy procureur du roi chapter 7   9.39896679747672
speak to me not as a magistrate but as a friend   12.878256236097178
does not that sunbeam yonder just by the side of the town glitter on the ironsides   14.720230646888186
goeden day broder replied the astonished landlady   8.381896801992808
to that i can say nothing returned d artagnan who knew the vanity of the new baron   10.199049886867718
i am dying with anxiety   5.029877042095704
but you madame so beautiful in reality you so pure in appearance must have committed great iniquities for lord de winter to pursue you thus   10.651819041302144
i have a party at my house tonight and therefore can not possibly remain till the end of the opera   19.175363092713788
and the best advice we can give you is to do so unresistingly   8.047179026978089
the more reason you should fire the first   12.967536597593504
all were still   9.758770499777231
morrel advanced towards beauchamp and château renaud who seeing his intention came to meet him   15.63300853987689
now my father is not coming to paris is he   12.455154313201101
the young men rose and returned into the salon while the count again apologizing left by another door   5.36985206565819
if bonaparte landed at naples the whole coalition would be on foot before he could even reach piombino   8.801137177486726
cried the officer in the tone of ill humor habitual to him   9.510523626820017
well my lord said la ramee falling into the trap what is there to prevent your trying them   12.80862500267932
said milady in an anxious tone   14.715701836386238
oh traitors that ye are   15.902441946296182
immediately i hope   10.627727279920686
his face was pale and drawn like that of a man who had just undergone some inward struggle   8.847818230782805
athos porthos and aramis you are looking for them   11.263400833434948
the scheme is well known said the inspector   12.424286192202771
said mazarin uneasily   9.74855610730742
ah yes said porthos there is nine o clock   14.731522721309686
he was so well wrapped up in his cloak that it would have been impossible to see his face even if the night had not been so dark as to render precaution superfluous   17.9313777489843
oh decidedly sir   5.606440722773309
said the latter closing the door and bolting it that they might not be disturbed   10.31499648267121
on the honor of mazarin   7.603974523572009
and indeed i am not sorry to quit paris   9.40807524429989
go monsieur i will follow you   12.004848885798488
this awakening you have given me   15.63779343904088
why this count of monte cristo must be a nabob   15.948605444175522
certainly replied the officer and left the room   9.204754332421535
you shall see   8.344906843556942
and who is the cause of all this annoyance   12.574054338393514
but we are bound to say to the credit of our hero that the bad opinion entertained by m   11.103124291070303
in short answered the duke if i comprehend you aright la ramee i am ungrateful for having ever thought of leaving this place   14.798737701324496
no said the banker   13.754111180020502
ah s blood how you have hurt me   18.39833633084078
who s up there   11.674134883737151
you will leave that exactly as it is   17.65413379207925
d artagnan as we have said perceived a hole in that place and in this hole the steps of a winding staircase   10.917567501677555
the benevolent abbé took an evident interest in all that concerned me   13.316189566425875
each time he read it he renewed his vow to make her happy   12.671297740447368
the count was no longer young   11.401103782211138
muttered villefort saluting the minister whose career was ended and looking about him for a hackney coach   11.134175356871634
you can not think so dear love   13.023600295721135
it only remained to put it to the vote when the president resumed gentlemen and you monsieur you will not be displeased i presume to listen to one who calls himself a very important witness and who has just presented himself   13.992834997762545
and as the wound is very serious seeing that after crossing the shoulder it penetrates into the chest it is to be feared at this instant the tapestry was raised and a noble and handsome head but frightfully pale appeared under the fringe   9.949909454866631
i have given you a great fright have i not   7.560120566414435
from which it would seem my dear count that you can at pleasure enjoy the seraphic strains that proceed from the seven choirs of paradise   9.57026117723828
he carried his head erect and seemed on the watch to see on which side his liberator would appear   9.59027130604041
thought the gascon   17.265982614139816
so saying the worthy shipowner quitted the two allies and proceeded in the direction of the palais de justice   11.213027566181944
oh would we could relate it everywhere and to everyone so that the emotion of our unknown benefactor might reveal his presence   12.012290355993017
come answer freely   7.816264896128581
my father has not yet forgotten me i am sure but god alone knows if she loves me still   8.523434375279486
bonacieux having always lived among her husband s friends people little capable of inspiring any sentiment whatever in a young woman whose heart was above her position mme   13.608887250538267
i as a philosopher should like a little country house a cottage down there under the trees without so many free stones over my poor body   12.256647312074408
to provoke him to threats and violence which would produce a contrast with her own resignation such was her plan   7.606562952041109
with his elbows on the table he sat between the two empty bottles while spectres danced in the light of the unsnuffed candle spectres such as hoffmann strews over his punch drenched pages like black fantastic dust   12.570024816927187
but rely upon my obtaining the reprieve i seek   13.448347318206613
d avrigny followed the direction and saw that they were fixed on a bottle containing the mixture which he took every morning   12.70919157699071
he tied her hands behind her and hanged her on a tree   12.029559876926463
you know he always has wise advice to give   9.479141903022718
and if it were an interrogatory   11.604162980007874
his task was the more difficult as there was no board to support him   12.441035975997249
what do you say of this   15.4922011388684
the man alone submits to force   11.726308462110161
tis not a long time since the late cardinal burnt urban grandier though   13.7230578694688
how did you penetrate hither   10.995287349050738
for they thought the visit would not be limited to the one room and that at the same time they would obtain a view of the rest of the building of which monte cristo had created a palace   12.493870163062809
now madame here are 800 notes of 1 000 francs each resembling as you see a large book bound in iron   10.827355234383052
well penelon said the captain what makes you shake your head   16.546367381797143
it is too much to ask   11.453381543249689
then you know the men who are now on monte cristo   19.196281518451517
mad   12.760905148593032
dantès rose advanced a few steps and with a fervent prayer of gratitude stretched himself on the granite which seemed to him softer than down   9.010296022333685
as to king charles the question must be viewed differently   4.383277942974479
i consider myself as brave as most men but when i drew from my breast the little key of the staircase which i had found in my coat that little key we both used to cherish so much which you wished to have fastened to a golden ring when i opened the door and saw the pale moon shedding a long stream of white light on the spiral staircase like a spectre i leaned against the wall and nearly shrieked   11.366907481127306
suspicion instantly seized me   12.96771779199948
nothing but what you are fond of   11.077111666398832
well such things have been   12.510810735949732
but who poured the wine for you that was in this glass   14.602969150752257
said caderousse thunderstruck but for that black hair i should say you were the englishman lord wilmore   12.5417236256432
then do not marry her said the count   14.303064005199985
is it not then curious to study the different ways by which the soul and body can part   13.97397208277755
my lord said athos we are just arrived from england and our first concern is to inquire after your health   12.25728301103872
adieu madame   12.961089777979378
foolish creature he exclaimed   13.188546340589228
the lady always left first and as soon as she had stepped into her carriage it drove away sometimes towards the right hand sometimes to the left   14.336204395937267
0148m eh pardieu   14.4109697073773
30229m did the young man recognize that face by the light of the lantern in his tilbury or was he merely struck with the horrible appearance of his interrogator   12.709343180929839
within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly   12.226638025204249
they had not seen him for two days   9.037969842466616
my mother replied the young princess a cavalier has just entered the louvre and wishes to present his respects to your majesty   11.961930080906995
oh it must have been the young man certainly for he was strong and industrious while the abbé was aged and weak   17.86315246608299
the count s eye expanded   14.25531762375073
insolent   10.245215809308737
he no longer loved her   14.220078539802586
precisely so replied gaetano   16.072552305878375
that i will have a little romance made of it wittily turned with a plan of the garden and portraits of the principal actors in that nocturnal romance   11.618084949248724
charming   17.696498484064833
he could not see it but he felt its presence   15.466631646794331
lieutenant yesterday said aramis captain to day colonel doubtless to morrow   9.451703354936607
vampa without saying a word hastened to the stone that closed up the entrance to their grotto drew it away made a sign to the fugitive to take refuge there in a retreat unknown to everyone closed the stone upon him and then went and resumed his seat by teresa   15.740142715908043
noirtier made no answer   12.20428026020212
but milady herself reconducted him through the darkness and only quit him at the staircase   12.331015549078687
particularly when there is money in the house eh   10.484383851816734
stay since we have finished dinner i will show it to you and then we will take coffee in the garden   9.526389154102752
and now what is to be done   13.851407112613686
his grief was so profound that he was nearly unconscious   13.237024457834881
is this the man   15.043080068397408
thought the dying man   15.529235120082136
but argued porthos i speak french and they are all english   8.17812250918016
de tréville was in his saloon with his habitual court of gentlemen   12.946593692267667
let us not depart from the sentimental turn our conversation had taken   16.64313062360784
we soon launched the boat and all eight of us got into it   15.240779485448051
i had known the famous vampa for more than ten years   10.259008244277666

reverend sir   10.498664283625912
during this storm gondy who had it in his power to make it most unpleasant for the jesters remained calm and stern   9.593615641322376
on account of political opinions   17.613992874728865
i shared the same fate at aquapendente   8.760528193647243
and i too said porthos   13.108082463049639
she looked at luigi who could not refuse his assent   8.955543353974788
the letter signed sinbad the sailor is it not   12.743075424455418
exclaimed andrea stupefied   15.792286775631322
do you know what you did unfortunate adviser   9.379299373315371
more intrigues   7.7402262887768405
montalivet transmitted to the prefect of bayonne mystified by two greek words têle graphein   15.650873044746344
albert had never been able to endure the italian theatres with their orchestras from which it is impossible to see and the absence of balconies or open boxes   11.106390385159825
i know it will end in that way   16.164743706219458
baptistin bowed and was proceeding towards the door   12.110387261010777
you are ill shall i ring for assistance   15.07661006782655
that fellow has a decidedly bad countenance said the count in a tone of disgust as he shut up his glass into its ivory case   11.2731733952849
morrel whispered what have you done to him   19.340786458862357
how many men have you about the palais royal   12.784196640880525
and thirdly from my own imagination   11.043772425972127
i wished to run to the window and call for help but my legs refused their office   13.732952276386033
we shall find him changed into a broken down old man with garnet nose and eyes that slobber   7.809695061946621
said beauchamp placing his eye glass in his eye where he tried to make it remain   14.798775209897244
i open them again and i see what you are now a hundred times more beautiful   15.156133031903867
i think some one is coming   8.970012747709324
there you must rest   13.79101872669614
the clerk seized his pen and peppino his beads   10.004935410701789
the same as usual my dear my glass is there on the table give it to me valentine   10.533888182351024
hold sir said villefort do not prolong this dreadful scene   16.845137368141415
therefore d artagnan was going to ask leave of absence of m   11.989509457019697
de saint méran is dead   13.613010926111711
but when she saw the careless bow of debray and the glance by which it was accompanied together with his significant silence she raised her head and without passion or violence or even hesitation ran downstairs disdaining to address a last farewell to one who could thus part from her   9.413441859605596
this affair would give a fine opportunity for a traitor my lord   12.455935266154984
villefort traversed the antechamber cast a side glance at dantès and taking a packet which a gendarme offered him disappeared saying bring in the prisoner   12.11634108670871
and he seized by the neck the last bottle that was left put it to his mouth and emptied it at a single draught as he would have emptied an ordinary glass   9.85386204042013
my hand   14.297744570304523
verses perfumed with the odor of the billet from the attendant of madame de chevreuse   15.463583455109438
in fact he was so astonished at what had happened to him that he stammered and reeled like a drunken man   7.16827277918391
near the merchant s signature there was indeed the seal of the sublime emperor   9.57331418334988
mazarin remained some moments in deep thought as if he were fighting with himself   12.120962506251391
why did you not tell me all this you   13.132662530327313
to be sure returned monte cristo   7.0580974827931335
look out for the black fowls   4.528918729093862
what then is to become of royalty   15.18733562363138
well i feel as if transformed a confession weighs on my mind   15.551176892449199
still i agree with you in thinking that my present ignorance of the first city in europe is a reproach to me in every way and calls for immediate correction   10.396756073832998
so i shall never be a great man as he was but to compensate for that i shall be a good man monsieur de rochefort and i hope to prove it to you   14.35268508824217
but who was the man who brought him from lucca   13.24326774298952
at the end of an hour she heard a soft voice calling her   11.720123099573275
do not strike then   12.943789017939679
bonacieux wept all day like a true mercer not being at all a military man as he himself informed us   8.460476944167075
i wrote to franz and were he here he would confirm every word i wrote then to franz that if he did not come with the four thousand crowns before six at ten minutes past i should have gone to join the blessed saints and glorious martyrs in whose company i had the honor of being   13.348224133408701
yes the sheep are fed in my meadows which are excellent pasture   9.32887223770169
grimaud and his basket were far in advance out of the range of the balls   14.411299682769734
i could not find them   15.071715981279178
milady was dressing herself all the time   9.353088739205605
what avails recrimination over matters wholly past recall   9.23329993914581
the jeweller examined attentively the interior of the inn and the apparent poverty of the persons who were about to sell him a diamond that seemed to have come from the casket of a prince   13.040641114821673
i remember it perfectly   13.578202416072472
madame de saint méran a gloomy scene had indeed just passed at the house of m   14.94267174232914
it would require years to do again what i have done here and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers knew we had communicated with each other   16.643851957692007
cried grimaud impossible   13.911767990303016
30031m sir continued villefort there is something to fear besides death old age and madness   10.34368851636111
but it was not the case with debray   12.751285457654934
and when shall we know   13.416021008097022
but how have you become acquainted with all these details   12.16906303190326
olivain advanced retired then made his horse rear turned it and then struck to the core by shame leaped as raoul had done only repeating i am a dead man   11.323362189105978
and he took his sword and cloak   8.480345458310222
retreated if at all as a point of strategy and not from cowardice   11.24517182241646
that may be done said aramis   19.80574366807661
how long will this fuse burn   7.9808444940337235
secondly to embrace my children and bid them farewell for the last time   12.683835194529069
help me out of paris   11.164878916460944
you can not take me with you   12.177655608584313
dantès was tossed about on these doubts and wishes when the patron who had great confidence in him and was very desirous of retaining him in his service took him by the arm one evening and led him to a tavern on the via del oglio where the leading smugglers of leghorn used to congregate and discuss affairs connected with their trade   9.691404700552006
do you hear what he says major   13.027001982422023

but i can not leave paris just now without knowing aramis stopped   13.400292544955015

when i think of you my heart beats fast the blood burns in my veins and i can hardly breathe   17.462782195566867
he was out of range   13.744098042295807
but all the italians are the same   10.526594589520585
we know the count s vigorous and daring mind denying anything to be impossible with that energy which marks the great man   16.282381395253754
the marshal raised his hand in token of assent   17.450232347949335
she received him like a woman who had already recovered all her advantages   11.015766119168315
what do you mean by that question   10.151830269993154
he opened the window   9.627955224703655
he was crazy   13.709030156342855
i have already made my excuses to the count for quitting him and i pray you to do so also   13.417541708960904
yes said andrea   10.936475451052575

to the point sir said the queen to the point and answer me yes or no   13.731826677010815
and you think you can catch him   13.248525588800302
any other person would perhaps have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise   15.836338696384821
pardon me said d artagnan   16.0019522941974
you do not know that i remained for fourteen years within a quarter of a league of you in a dungeon in the château d if   5.01522212596703
i will entertain you tonight   8.505226027308753
once upon a time there lived a queen a powerful monarch who reigned over one of the greatest kingdoms of the universe   2.6330319393661306
it is kept by a friend of ours   11.935609058757183
he had his foot upon it that is all   14.037373183433884
and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the weight on her heart   8.631217603600874
in what branch   11.620486578487899
well pursued caderousse can you without expending one sou put me in the way of getting fifteen thousand francs   6.175958842527834
i was just then looking at them myself   12.111270081075071
an hour had elapsed since her condemnation   11.147642924442222
and the four friends guided by mousqueton took up the way toward the house already almost restored to their former gayety   14.740650393850878
that is to say of a man before whom trembled the greatest men of the kingdom beginning with the king   12.596286261256648
let s fly the feather before the wind   17.13163751657931
i do not remember if it is exactly 48 000 francs which i am still owing him but i dare say we shall not dispute the difference   14.690175396914697
and what do you reckon your outfit will cost   9.01906904759374
a double movement of the globe he inhabited and of which he could feel nothing appeared to him perfectly impossible   12.190361815489883
you would meet the queen and she would not know who you are   11.669222288457334
for i have the proofs   9.66934549275351
those ruins crowned the summit of a hill which overlooked the surrounding country   15.418007529855293
whilst all this was going on a cavalier in full gallop was seen approaching   9.650893244673659
it was a gloomy dusty looking apartment such as journalists offices have always been from time immemorial   7.391260350471091
are you not going to put up at the arms of england   11.415386362540806
placed between life and death as bernajoux was he had no idea for a moment of concealing the truth   9.139008451632101
by confessing all he might prove his good will   11.329889035334485
my dear maximilian you are really too fanciful   7.0883375657207495
the reason of it was that they had insisted on my keeping the matter a secret and begged me not to tell you anything of it   17.411163540212307
rochefort recognized the voice   13.486585847679736
so we will take leave of our friend and let him hasten home   11.64866329885187
you forget that what you have just paid me is much more than a poor woman requires who intends for some time at least to retire from the world   12.998400201686518
you are examining the luxury i enjoy said the queen glancing sadly around her   10.487430378824076
danglars appeared   11.695634108637899
i will not die alone i will not   12.801322113903288
one day you will be able to understand how all this is   13.366308587290954
the only amusements left us are the indifferent races at the champ de mars and satory   7.0250420857932525
d artagnan politely begged the swiss to yield to him the disputed chamber   11.942812151243334
i will show the gentlemen the door   12.134339634145721
i regard them as invaluable   11.861318804232923
the guests having eaten the soup were about to lift the first glass of wine to their lips when all at once the cannon sounded from fort louis and fort neuf   7.138536501112807
continue continue   18.73728649432307
anne understood this covert reproach and was more moved than irritated by it   11.386975548698947
yes i am aware you may go alone since i once met you in italy but to accompany the mysterious monte cristo   14.334412580880464
you at marseilles   10.987719654225765
and which should be the lackeys to carry the letters   14.185512110137992
i did i promise you anything my lord   11.172683567737902
come answered mazarin i see it will be necessary for me to capitulate   8.562134791139991
well then said the baroness if slave she be she has all the air and manner of a princess   13.516429657454484
asked albert of franz when they had returned to their own apartments   14.540397260491188
come come signor pastrini no joking   8.158089938388585
a strange incomprehensible unearthly sound seemed to pervade the whole city   12.720126037236945
that where society attacked by the death of a person avenges death by death   10.718106692719191
the carnival was to commence on the morrow   9.375003409739367
he did not dare to write for fear of not being able to such experienced eyes as those of milady to disguise his writing sufficiently   8.643025129943188
nothing was visible save a few lights that burnt behind the windows   15.763689641968647
inquired villefort in astonishment   16.483475261966817
all these gentlemen had been noticed by athos and aramis in the guardhouse and when the two friends were announced they started and exchanged some words in a low tone   10.134711524074293
i believe you said mme   12.403278408114392
athos then took him by the hand and led him into the drawing room where there were several people   12.398055717247187
planchet was sent for and instructions were given him   10.947076715017351
jacopo could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent present which dantès hastened to account for by saying that he had merely been a sailor from whim and a desire to spite his family who did not allow him as much money as he liked to spend   9.228121592636032
in the name of our child   12.526306888985886
you are not unlucky in being charged with such commissions particularly if my lord has authorized you to look into her bed   12.567614079470182
tomorrow monsieur   8.597582965663465
let us drink   5.973145575981195
if i knew that he did i should know all   13.384552319341514
the some one is coming   11.30991082288454
and have those who have lost their lives lost nothing   9.414593602981721
but where and when shall i see you again   19.636941303497895
my lord has forgotten the supper   12.341081825487477
we are no longer in the middle ages   11.167367998048535
did you not say something of an infant   10.82345523639287
what sized man is he   9.227208647328396
look here resumed d artagnan   10.966954305986985
oh do something for me   12.506341254966097
d artagnan continued before god and before men i accuse this woman of having attempted to poison me in wine which she sent me from villeroy with a forged letter as if that wine came from my friends   16.67231588606608
to carry generosity so far as to put myself up as a mark for that young man to aim at   18.132423997941846
monte cristo drew the young man towards him and pressed him for some time to his heart   8.488817099380105
and never shall i forget it returned peppino with an accent of profound gratitude   9.265104359985315
you will give me your advice will you not and if possible extricate me from my unpleasant position   8.862507192498613
repeated buckingham   11.37319878835925
he has then charged me to take it from you   11.919264527212658
de rieux was inclined to do likewise but i told him they wouldn t look for us where we were   12.898580508971845
major cavalcanti both the count and baptistin had told the truth when they announced to morcerf the proposed visit of the major which had served monte cristo as a pretext for declining albert s invitation   13.596842474982559
yes perfectly well intimately even   9.026872154917726
here is debray who detests you without reading you so he says   10.562987189627162
but he was a man of stone   12.166207910504998
this was the name of madame de longueville   11.759384711133634
chevalier d herblay   5.219459324620427
noirtier fixed his intelligent eyes on valentine s hand   11.72871043967532
but porthos turned sharply round and every countenance quickly recovered its gravity   12.506556559819918
a cap was sufficient to drive out the bullet and from the adjoining room no one would have suspected that the count was as sportsmen would say keeping his hand in   15.777695685961362
i was wondering what could be the significance of this purse with the paper at one end and the large diamond at the other   11.76301947771428
yet five minutes afterwards the rabbit was dead   15.063052918804209
and she left the room   12.05092799238428
a lover s deception which the woman who has married that man ought certainly to forgive   13.580760175361304
have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden fusion of my ingots   8.689986692376307
and to whom   12.260875145144782
ah added the count in a contemptuous tone do not tell me of european punishments they are in the infancy or rather the old age of cruelty   13.043354566775282
prophets of evil are not in favor at the court father   14.05428252194445
i am i am no   19.68864389352014
then i have my mode of dispensing justice silent and sure without respite or appeal which condemns or pardons and which no one sees   13.38905721411717
did you doubt it   20.913725194022767
i m not such a rhinoceros as you are   9.554788576947672
it would be long indeed ere you would find so lucrative a post as that you have now the good fortune to fill   12.50424359492147
he pushed back his bed and waited for day   16.498013427198835
it need not be said that d artagnan was still thinking of the husband   13.897078819838876
with you sir replied the baroness one can wish for nothing one is so sure to obtain it   9.727859300863088
but i even thought though that surely must have been a mistake that m   8.510947073948541
you can restore it to his family said d artagnan   11.023088173538993
still it is better than suffering   15.695018132483204
i have been nearly mad   15.263781108532214
i did not like to say so answered dantès smiling   7.115131013715816
up to that time whether from devotedness or from want of power to act against it this maxim without being generally adopted nevertheless passed from theory into practice   10.259730654264306
you will find my will in the secretaire in my bedroom   7.341372606791644
at least he believed so   16.06301035550711
an instant after the count entered   19.586206626453404
d artagnan knelt down near the thickest part of the hedge   11.64490378385149
whether success rendered us imprudent or whether we were betrayed i know not   15.11542244179855
well then why it does not much concern us do you think it does   13.88825531494317
and then i was afraid you would not recognize me but you did added caderousse with his unpleasant smile   14.6527356945363
well replied he he has smitten with the sword and he has perished by the sword   16.659410103071185
at auteuil near paris   8.477168567295735
and even if it should fall into the hands of the cardinal we shall not be compromised   7.46740836303057
still let it not be supposed that amid this affected resignation to the will of providence the unfortunate innkeeper did not writhe under the double misery of seeing the hateful canal carry off his customers and his profits and the daily infliction of his peevish partner s murmurs and lamentations   7.54668922747833
20301m our expedition made a favorable beginning   12.425651759238564
the whole was cemented by two hundred years beneath these almost impervious depths for a revolution carried away the emperor who wished to make the trial and only left the documents proving the manufacture of the jars and their descent into the sea   14.201983460933022
thence he once again looked towards morrel who weeping with joy was shaking hands most cordially with all the crowd around him and thanking with a look the unknown benefactor whom he seemed to be seeking in the skies   9.318534428909835
i will go and take a turn in the garden to recover myself   10.222675913880948
20025m the englishman smiled imperceptibly   10.451308980209365
you mean to tell me that three female attendants await their new mistress in her sleeping chamber   14.522775580438939
is he armed   14.362730917023384
faith my lord it is very necessary for me to make my fortune your eminence has so long forgotten me   7.863634691903142
he turned a spyglass toward the little group amongst which the king stood   13.6453954972492
aramis colored imperceptibly   14.98115184878175
why we are looked upon with a rather favorable eye by a lady of quality the duchesse de but your pardon   6.459495778577702
at the voice of this last speaker grimaud started and felt a shudder creeping through his very marrow   11.126346040138156
alas said andrea sighing one can not be completely happy in this world   15.824459533506749
and believe me monsieur coadjutor the court will give from fear what it will not give from good will   7.028159123589132
the very dogs that wander houseless and homeless in the streets find some pitying hand to cast them a mouthful of bread   14.46497036928697
his first care on entering it was to lock up in an old bureau with a new lock his bag of money and then as soon as supper was ready he sent away the waiter who brought it up and sat down to table   14.931154064426037
and alexander vi   8.738067434105766
andrea appeared in despair but consoled himself when the hostess assured him that no   10.811878155002645
at that moment planchet put his head modestly in at the half open door and told his master that the horses were ready   6.278618476547496
sinbad the sailor is your baptismal appellation and yet the first day you set foot in paris you instinctively display the greatest virtue or rather the chief defect of us eccentric parisians that is you assume the vices you have not and conceal the virtues you possess   19.26219669410922
in reply i gave her the half of the linen i had kept in order to reclaim him if we became rich   12.773720574996837
the next morning d artagnan summoned the host one of those sly normans who say neither yes nor no and fear to commit themselves by giving a direct answer   9.769248729112293
what the devil makes him glower thus behind him   9.465541938677703
the gascon uttered a cry of joy and turning to mordaunt i hope sir said he you have no objection to make   11.977198472057257
is there indeed my good fellow   12.434107933721968
here is the relic she said   12.453991272016681
or that if he did think of him it was only to say to himself that he was very well where he was wherever it might be   13.117982464818109
she is simply a duchess   16.596851250157965
0039m ah yes continued caderousse and capital offers too   9.319329466371705
really athos you would make a singular general   9.995023950700157
and i turned my horse aside from going plump on to him   15.340728745904215
on both sides loud cries arose on the one side cries of anger on the other cries of enthusiasm   11.652631633565477
and now eat and drink   15.400991409963574
only eat for a week and nothing in the world will seem to you to equal the delicacy of its flavor which now appears to you flat and distasteful   9.802297191270252
and i too exclaimed porthos   11.448610511043208
the coadjutor has given me dispensations from fasting on the jours maigres on account of my health   13.701524046254935
the whole world conspires to break our bonds   11.915356461193877
and he sat down   7.04984695496611
the young man remained standing and motionless having but the force of will and not the power of execution   6.682286165802253
and sitting down villefort wrote the certificate at the bottom   5.541014655946461
leave that for those who like to suffer at their leisure and indulge their grief in secret   12.096382263287502
well he has taken nothing yet   15.613936728806168
it appears there is something fresh aboard   15.90040393153912
the coadjutor possessed perhaps as much wit as all those put together who were assembled at the court to laugh at him   17.630436991287063
from m   19.436140901218558
aramis and his thesis chapter xxvii   14.4395578212606
the brother did not perceive this   14.064130209432138
ah said the count i see that m   18.172323341558048
and he gave me reason to hope that at paris he would present me to some one who would recommend me to the favor of the prince   12.464028688092144
exclaimed the duke rubbing his hands   13.166065196509795
a man of spirit is not to be reminded of such services   13.551136330038492
bertuccio remained standing before him   9.294334787622185
this good major cavalcanti is come to take a second view of paris which he only saw in passing through in the time of the empire when he was on his way to moscow   15.503285030886847
this was fulfilling the intentions of monsieur porthos who had desired us to be so careful of this letter was it not   9.245939978804405
it was stopped by porters horses and footmen   9.10394409504842
well said the latter a young woman of about twenty six or twenty eight years of age and a man of from thirty five to forty have indeed lodged at the two houses pointed out by your eminence   10.17408257498401
explain yourself mousqueton   10.73822740127551
i am at quite a loss how to answer you i admit said mme   9.913906372688414
the place madame is vacant and although tis a year since monsieur de tréville has left it it has not been filled   16.288817867130305
ah that said the prince i understand that language thoroughly   14.705397588125063
we have so many means of gaining information   16.58897111092259
besides by the faith of bonacieux you call yourself bonacieux   9.891687479817337
i hasten to comply with your excellencies wishes   7.863960554576972
milady had told the truth her head was confused for her ill arranged plans clashed one another like chaos   14.19711786478008
but that must be a princess at least that lady with her negro boy and her maid   12.85861632905718
he went afterward to the innkeeper and bought from him two hundred trusses at the same price   10.346199663414271
said the cardinal pensively gazing at the two friends with lively admiration   14.530449944307808
how do you make that out   17.915491012384294
he is called bragelonne   13.329788362667273
his glance full of expression   15.784929872428249
at the first word before i had even mentioned your father s name ah said he   10.670841384935969
however the struggle still continued and it was dreadful to witness   10.042803097741551
cried the wretch falling on her knees   11.610228231959631
i give you my oath that i will not   9.431016650682173
at first perhaps he did not recognize the infinite mercy of the lord but at last he took patience and waited   10.853325309920113
persons whom i do not like   10.928099653335527
you are right madame said the king and i am ready to retire to my room when you have kissed me   12.929762349463152
as to his voice prayers sobs and imprecations had changed it so that at times it was of a singularly penetrating sweetness and at others rough and almost hoarse   10.116643420884794
you are going to leave us   6.96627255148825
scarcely had he left her when the queen went into her son s room and inquired from laporte if the king was in bed   9.904477135806797
come he said as he ascended the stairs leading to his wife s room nothing is changed here   6.178784080181789
noirtier s eye remained immovable   16.168792227253803
we lost five men and the rochellais eight or ten   10.334449843526448
monte cristo and morcerf drew their seats towards a small table on which were arranged music drawings and vases of flowers   8.893289164858897
you can not imagine mother how beautiful i think you   14.450773265790438
of course he could not inquire from d artagnan himself who he was and what had been his career   8.83538550928319
all these defects pressed hard on a man who had had his stall at the bouffes and had shared a lower box at the opera   11.337051021236201
two gentlemen   7.274064749073111
so many dreadful things have happened to me lately that i am on the verge of madness   15.030455422388757
i am frightful tonight she said   14.011416067347627
which way   12.010816162968032
d avrigny carried the science of divination almost to a miraculous extent for he was one of the physicians who always work upon the body through the mind   17.906772805021326
but almost immediately he returned to fetch the lemonade   12.255651652319933
that s because they don t see us said athos   10.213351886672825
but i warn m   11.984680914384882
let your servants guard them   10.462179332195134
it is well returned the voice   13.39546973386232
i am still terrified to such a degree that i scarcely believe my eyes   11.546079377498168
de chevreuse and mme   9.937413891018656
come i will reform   13.962500305514933
you must give your recipe to planchet   14.327188673762993
at herlier planchet who led the column turned to the left   13.205013597962582
that you may be sure said the gascon means something   10.646666199329694
no human being not even my sister is aware of its existence   10.860177367166047
however he would not leave without the promise of seeing valentine again the next night   10.995069375345418
oh meddle in nothing which concerns me   10.287358515832421
albert understood the allusion in a moment and was about to throw his glove at the count when morrel seized his hand while beauchamp and château renaud fearing the scene would surpass the limits of a challenge held him back   8.265466598647185
it was for his sake she has committed these crimes   7.977046412607445
fool that i was   8.980908012984603
they are soliciting the hat for him   12.21846643310274
so be it i will erect an altar deo ignoto   13.50051388878037
the lieutenant of musketeers   14.958770846529653
in the first place monsieur athos is arrested   7.011265981400438
certainly said morcerf   11.395526433788765
the litter borne by two servants now entered the house   17.962554695707198
d artagnan breathed as if the whole hostelry had been removed from his breast   11.856909600548688
said the host bewildered   8.485504895341275
i am determined to tell them all about it   7.958520557058095
the funds rose one per cent higher than before they had fallen   9.562934163314788
yes you wished to speak to me   13.552674603625942
do you think i can not be saved as well as anyone else and that there are only arabs who cut off heads   15.185837738397524
it is that the honest emotions of youth have given place to suggestions of interest whispers of ambition counsels of selfishness   8.887785330244006
the infernal demons   17.479020340211452
yes if it isn t contrary to the rules   8.355881409820775
i will live   10.57063003028694
yes said the paralytic with the same solemnity   13.561371827458348
you knew it   15.703161691315005
what is the matter monsieur   6.638045733591271
and seeing them dantès sighed heavily   9.218763485308635
and he levelled his carbine at dantès who felt the muzzle against his temple   12.6094579097428
he shut the bedroom door after him without adding another word and returned to his apartments   13.64754286032934
silence laporte you may be overheard   12.43321368978003
good bye till we meet again   12.258993220339491
shall i call him   15.471967736501222
these last words were uttered in so low a tone that the stranger could not hear them   12.065811090177851
and he moved out of the way to let the mercer pass   8.947240480841037
tell us about it   11.649173318803575
repeated porthos   11.09158087272142
she remembered that she had a son said he   13.786615384510952
the tree forsakes not the flower the flower falls from the tree   12.335988759269032
if i wished to surprise him it was evident this was the spot to lie in wait for him   15.622978454198117
everything in this charming retreat from the warble of the birds to the smile of the mistress breathed tranquillity and repose   8.566113416454472
hear me said he   12.39994038041574
then it was not in society that i met with mademoiselle or yourself madame or this charming little merry boy   15.214823212660756
morrel fell into a chair   10.189982117789254
so then gaetano said franz this is then all reality   6.35782894077005
but the wind was contrary the sea bad   15.369997118044648
i love you so tenderly that i can not help being jealous even of the past   15.358625754703066
the coadjutor alone obtained nothing   10.905085088723657
the sun red and flaming was sinking into the embrace of the welcoming ocean   12.53378002153126
they both went into the house   14.824482526327772
oh added a third voice the shrouds of the château d if are not dear   14.47861956964075
your arrival here without waiting my visit at your house today looks well sir said albert   12.206097000229859
yes sir replied the youth with deep respect and i have performed the commission that you gave me   13.13798232122136
i also was married at the death bed of my mother and certainly i have not been less happy on that account   13.79320604904436
monte cristo expected a burst of passion but he was deceived for morrel turning round said calmly you see i was praying   13.899872647796775
when you please monsieur said athos putting himself on guard   5.64594688839904
athos walked in the direction indicated and reached the suburb situated at the opposite extremity of the city from that by which he and his friends had entered it   11.990275852274612
villefort tried to smile   18.224337747280934
caderousse remained on the landing until he had not only seen andrea go down the three stories but also cross the court   10.809937921320813
then after having led monte cristo around the little garden he returned to the house   16.6826866843178
a smile which was indefinable passed over the lips of the queen   11.092613050350003
ask my beloved sister haydée who ever since our departure from france has caused me to wait patiently for this happy day while talking to me of you   18.32692796708084
but the features of this latter personage it was not possible to distinguish   12.47564140975107
yourself   12.536648326165865
a part of the good abbé s words however were wholly incomprehensible to him   15.121321614508059
ah that is my affair   17.755585119662975
eh give it to me   9.916302502549364
on the opposite side two cavaliers one covered with a gilt cuirass the other wearing simply a buff doublet from which fell the sleeves of a vest of blue velvet charged in front   10.63640525699985
but i have a shirt and a pair of trousers   5.377246641654217
blood and anger mounted to his face   12.848458203310418
debray told me apropos what has become of him   15.244310326012751
said d artagnan bowing to the officer   12.14326435909783
the latter rose and bowed to the countess who inclined herself without speaking   13.712579100338388
discipline is the same for them as for everybody else   14.675189230347138
was it an entire army   10.149740543854104
40108m i promised him to wait replied morrel   14.704725345711223
but on our way to the piazza del popolo i wish to pass through the corso   13.739369814026443
thank you said the young man   12.691908271461147
but strange as it appeared he cared not for those who might pass from the avenue of the champs élysées or by the faubourg saint honoré   10.906063577725629
albert   13.597261909649434
now pistache my good dog jump the height of this cane for madame de montbazon   12.089434523783677
no said mazarin   15.481579908254256
upon my soul monsieur said the duchess you are a true nobleman   9.724472944940878
the abbé uttered a kind of groan   13.305613313910472
the one serves against all their physical sufferings the other against all their enemies   19.021355231519117
the ballet at length came to a close and the curtain fell amid the loud unanimous plaudits of an enthusiastic and delighted audience   16.610185902014344
the two lackeys conducted milady to the bank of the river   15.513213901766704
de morcerf s   9.749772759500969
still in spite of this reciprocal politeness the countenances of the women betrayed a certain amount of uneasiness   12.920718099305244
well porthos follow my examples   10.632821290743301
i grant it monsieur replied madame de chevreuse with her most gracious smile   10.560669194264841
but he was unable to complete this oath for two days afterwards in an encounter with the roman carbineers carlini was killed   13.980977894592103
it was one of those perfumed gloves that lovers like to snatch from a pretty hand   10.685305451937511
you pardon me   16.55444160966301
cried friquet suffocating   11.849789592657888
de morcerf and is justified by his son   12.083828613189723
he was charming   13.194084198406891
then you really lost by that affair in spain   14.173003533908055
40280m i   14.484467349433153
noirtier are not on the best terms possible and that is another sacrifice made to the royal cause and for which you should be recompensed   12.764113445034628
sell a jewel which came from my mother   12.618318123006848
who live upon the stones i suppose said franz with an incredulous smile   10.47958914167943
said mazarin what is the matter   7.395263279554355
i maintain that the position of a man like you has done more than my name my social position and my merit   10.057316703490233
she first and he afterward   15.020965247963879
but that s quite enough gentlemen   12.295225940248972
woman is like a wave of the sea said shakespeare   8.371038216282432
the royal procession set out for paris   14.462138234435143
i agree to athos s plan   10.992598582984487
rare birds retaining their most brilliant plumage enormous fish spread upon massive silver dishes together with every wine produced in the archipelago asia minor or the cape sparkling in bottles whose grotesque shape seemed to give an additional flavor to the draught all these like one of the displays with which apicius of old gratified his guests passed in review before the eyes of the astonished parisians who understood that it was possible to expend a thousand louis upon a dinner for ten persons but only on the condition of eating pearls like cleopatra or drinking refined gold like lorenzo de medici   12.54002536777281
and the proof of this is seen in their yellow and dry appearance like the florins of the republic which from being constantly gazed upon have become reflected in them   10.967948770738118
one individual went from door to door bending under the weight of swords guns muskets and every kind of weapon which he deposited as fast as he could   15.68571381949872
i make about twelve thousand francs a year without counting a little benefice of a thousand crowns the prince gave me   11.306162269417053
a few hundred yards beyond the town d artagnan drew rein   11.945943442965708
but if your body be not greatly benefited by it be assured your soul will   14.979824209460201
then you don t know me sir   12.624497735477533
besides if we go out too late nobody will see us said porthos and that will be a pity   10.260431220154445
ah you are his son   15.360472720341946
do you say as a monk   11.959722640954244
they seemed awaiting orders   9.614610674243194
is everyone here your excellency   10.110212731951096
will your excellency be so good as to mount the shoulders of two of our men they will carry you ashore   11.654470462040933
they passed through a courtyard as they went full of soldiers and courtiers   11.209254434468706
a man was introduced of simple mien who had the appearance of a tradesman   8.799860959206729
said monte cristo with a searching look   9.04653005160192
i was about to ask you if you had heard any news of them   11.500900074220263
twenty good pistoles already without reckoning the doctor   10.49728260701264
you know bragelonne said athos i never speak without reflection   12.881214576504304
but as regards your wish to visit our fine city my dear count i can only say that you may command me and mine to any extent you please   9.82230543631556
break his arm wound him but do not kill him   9.913002481552173
women of a certain grade are like prosperous grisettes in one respect they seldom return home after twelve o clock   14.607683302356705
for since this little affair began i have not manifested the slightest opposition and yet i am always sure when the opportunity arrives to oppose a determined and absolute will to people who have not consulted me and things which displease me   9.143013989959051
how stupid   10.678618455687552
but as lord wilmore in the character of the count s enemy was less restrained in his answers they were more numerous   12.595604592014105
but no sooner had the man s footsteps ceased than he started up drew the bolts closed the curtains and examined every corner of the room   11.1630263213072
the marshal   14.385261654220475
the doctor poured some drops of the lemonade into the palm of his hand put his lips to it and after having rinsed his mouth as a man does when he is tasting wine he spat the liquor into the fireplace   11.772775616856887
parry for his part will raise this slab of marble and a passage will be opened   15.128187925090085
on me   12.78225182864635
now since the affair of nordlingen they had experienced nothing but reverses   8.794151458782043
the cardinal advanced to him with a smile and taking him by the hand led him into his study   12.426308293867733
my good friend said valentine i should take you for a visionary and should tremble for your reason if i were always to hear you talk in a strain similar to this   13.165081939678203
then he passed his hand across his forehead which was clouded with doubt   11.646434052765382
goeden morgen mynheer eth teen begeeray le weeten the ge sond heets omstand   14.239019281158955
he has foretold many things which have come to pass   10.556555645732857
pack up all you want for a journey of a fortnight and follow me   12.800593634223375
if we have no news of them this evening to morrow we must start   11.449415612907107
athos after making sure that lord winter was really dead let fall the corpse and said come aramis now for the honor of france   17.856592244172372
i suspect a hoax is intended but the instigators of it little knew whom they had to deal with   14.423301158882893
come he said to himself let me try if he will be more tractable than the other   11.644353533321528
go on monsieur bertuccio said the count   8.828544018404902
i could defy a nation   12.844738919630649
i only know one thing i dislike more which is the sound of your voice   13.623854358446371
even his fat smooth cheeks shook as he spoke and he looked at d artagnan with an air of reproach   11.939073041248086
he was softened   5.611483076936102
but finding she could not accomplish this she in her fury stabbed at the door with her poniard the point of which repeatedly glittered through the wood   12.937086526752605
tell me what i am to do for this   13.405043790303392
just now before i came down to you i drank a glass of sugared water   10.415662112056296
he was told that his eminence awaited the orders of his majesty in the business cabinet   9.216787257713838
mousqueton is here then   8.473599283888047
do you know i always felt a shudder at the idea of even a destroying angel   11.981820674014546
these were the only obstacles which appeared possible to the young man   15.360293516637899
everything believe me   11.331447921246305
why truly replied monte cristo determined not to lose an inch of the ground he had gained my reason for desiring an unlimited credit was precisely because i did not know how much money i might need   17.729602817135838
and for greater security we have taken from them even their penknives and pocket scissors   11.607421787915532
oh what a dreadful event   14.597932307995345
when my father with a pistol in his hand was once on the point of committing suicide had anyone then said this man deserves his misery would not that person have been deceived   7.314232967637077
we are well mounted are we not porthos   12.648603769912926
and i also have reflected   11.798592173128295
you are sure it is not he   17.43243690216995
cried bertuccio whose copper complexion became livid i go to auteuil   11.138992564963237
the hours one after another seemed to awaken the clock as they passed and every blow of the brass hammer resounded upon the heart of the prisoner   5.632370735883034
you see i make an ample allowance for all delays and difficulties   14.46461926995677
you were waiting for horses which were delayed in consequence of the festival   9.666464021554937
a man or a woman   10.281938082790553
should you therefore be questioned deny all knowledge of it deny it boldly and you are saved   13.68039525321748
do you mean at rome   10.141020108418179
besides i am a picard   9.288351216476604
but replied the owner glancing after dantès who was watching the anchoring of his vessel it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so old as you say danglars to understand his business for our friend edmond seems to understand it thoroughly and not to require instruction from anyone   16.422034319366254
since we are recalling names let us remember them all   14.002220988880728
the outlook was sad   9.648547006077171
jussac was as was then said a fine blade and had had much practice   12.562932706855788
i have sported with the green mantle of the one and the azure robe of the other   16.423296574468324
but before the doctor and the father could reach the room the servants who were on the same floor had entered and seeing valentine pale and motionless on her bed they lifted up their hands towards heaven and stood transfixed as though struck by lightening   11.236542376022248
exclaimed d artagnan putting his finger on his lips   12.312570272219634
arrived at the barracks he made himself known took the best horse in the stables mounted and gained the high road   10.829255676910439
and he hastily quitted the apartment   14.9563151763716
such are my orders   15.068272917954431
sir said he that man has been here   15.011093182403254
and another paper deriving its information from some malicious source had published two days after albert s departure for normandy the few lines which had rendered the unfortunate young man almost crazy   14.844703814341784
the priest stole the sacred vases and sold them   7.238748334182537
repeated mme   13.984431075952182
ah sir exclaimed madame de villefort clasping her hands what do you say   9.170323133063432
without doubt he recognized d artagnan for he became deadly pale   17.90264134900123
i fear it is a conspiracy   10.484425008218171
de tréville who had received the account of the adventure from the mouths of the heroes of it related it in all its details to his eminence not forgetting the episode of the napkin   13.635411469505204
and you spoke to him   7.748100799118566
she believed the order ready for execution   8.051138487758587
but he made it and there is the evidence yet remaining of his work   16.945548565752937

frequenting the café de paris the boulevard de gand and the bois de boulogne during his brief career of splendor the false cavalcanti had formed a host of acquaintances   13.009679638679
we chased him for six hours and when he was near being taken when st   12.385116993565045
but being anxious not to be too conspicuous all with the exception of porthos who had a fancy to display his red doublet were quite satisfied with their places the more so as chance had brought them to the centre of their row so that they were exactly opposite the arm chair prepared for the royal prisoner   15.088647387257662
vaguely   8.624095132956306

it was of this detachment sent as a vanguard that our friend d artagnan formed a part   14.961795829742186
but i should say it was two lovers walking side by side and hand in hand   12.252105299222164
where is this lemonade   13.87736243655581
the moaning of waves the noise of thunder the roaring of a volcano can not be compared with the tempest of cries heard at that moment   16.337614626415032
you are quite decided then to leave it   9.687247305961005
italy sinbad the sailor towards the beginning of the year 1838 two young men belonging to the first society of paris the viscount albert de morcerf and the baron franz d épinay were at florence   12.669555004242426
and andrea continued his plan   10.655426469122336

one of the two riders he who had spoken second was ten paces in front of his companion   10.370485562120141
but these monks are subject to such degrading practices   13.57238712684802
i believe the storm is over said he   14.338204478319717
and i feel convinced they have all unfeignedly grieved over my loss   14.80800697248101
let us talk no more of mordaunt it will bring bad luck   10.687147626009907
i had the king and monsieur the whole of one day in my care   11.815431856768202
at these words he took up a silver bell and rang it   11.321397080338691
with being an agent of the bonapartist faction   8.855237296618148
why here is the simple fact   13.99679724707333
well it was that affair madame   8.527843398607008
if you can guess the position of the island in the darkness you will see that the fire can not be seen from the side or from pianosa but only from the sea   9.736301940345953
it was about half past nine   5.2314094910984945
d artagnan here   8.817189812338539
then a voice reached them once more sending this threat to our next meeting sirs in england   15.123961325311152
faith no for between the culprit and the victim i have no choice   8.050149030993031
where is athos   12.640764380032314
and matches   13.242663783913976
oh cried the novice as to friends you would have them wherever you want you appear so good and are so beautiful   9.986969936948302
for he said nothing and did much   17.536240042540083
perhaps he may   13.769502669528697
that is true monsieur you are well informed   11.852464666193342
and before you went to the bastile   12.849321566901212
good thought he   9.974512219039593
i shall replied d artagnan and instantly   15.08194135391583
another   10.719155846725346
and this in addition to his position as responsible agent on board which is always obnoxious to the sailors made him as much disliked by the crew as edmond dantès was beloved by them   6.981930947705209
ah yes so i was   15.832097035450719
perhaps i shall have lost all influence   5.451239049438923
but wait a minute said m   12.458887282710206
i know too that you are a good marksman there we are about equal   16.081305506246935
have i anything to pay   10.065171565405766
if there were any danger to be apprehended on the road i am going i would request you to accompany me   13.093582694434133
de blacas wiped the moisture from his brow   17.09385463483303
i come therefore to ask what has become of him   11.294191766050371
the young greek as we have already said occupied apartments wholly unconnected with those of the count   13.599579373477868
he received thirty sous per day and for a month he returned to his lodgings gay as a chaffinch and affable toward his master   9.012617185593019
muttered athos i may be mistaken i haven t the unerring eye of d artagnan   6.509892925746158
what asked the duke what do you mean   8.250775569129157
oh juxon said the king seizing the bishop s two hands in his own promise that you will pray all your life for this gentleman and for the other that you hear beneath your feet and for two others also who wherever they may be are on the watch for my safety   14.573778591928836
athos on quitting aramis went to madame de chevreuse   10.183514166812785
but the latter went on without pity seek whom the crime will profit says an axiom of jurisprudence   4.966918183377292
if he turned up an ace first he won   7.266609503275797
you have not seemed to be well for the last fortnight   13.01312433643469
why then they would be laughed at and a master pastrycook must never be laughed at   15.568785865983255
no replied the count carelessly   11.450243414843536
d artagnan placed in line with his company saluted with an expressive gesture his three friends whose eyes soon discovered him and m   19.574629771440954
but if you saw this you must also have seen the person who poured it   8.78478315320828
and about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl   6.229659062437279
but after we had taken in our cargo the wind became contrary so that we were four or five days without being able to enter the rhône   16.056512584117566
ten minutes later the curate of st   11.60307037624595
the three carbineers looked about carefully on every side saw the young peasants and galloping up began to question them   12.069154573204113
it is not very difficult to discover that   12.500446532175516

during this time exempt from the anxiety of its only and true chief the royal army led a joyous life neither provisions nor money being wanting in the camp   19.389471880748737
20107m one evening a wolf emerged from a pine wood near which they were usually stationed but the wolf had scarcely advanced ten yards ere he was dead   13.285603986114175

present yourself at the wicket of the louvre on the side of the rue de l echelle and ask for germain   10.114594082205086
and i believe it is from him my guardian whose near relation he was inherited the estate from which i take my name   11.143711433758623
because it is against prison rules and prisoners must not even ask for it   13.71834050075564
but it is ridiculous thus to yield to the caprices of an old man and i shall therefore act according to my conscience   10.125292408664569
but this simple operation upon the most delicate organs of our frame generally so easy to accomplish became almost impossible at this moment so much did curiosity struggle to retain the eyelid open and learn the truth   8.391299510750738
the vicomte de bragelonne who will have the honor of remitting this letter to your majesty is the friend of my son who owes to him his life   10.507370827818818
hold on   19.0062662728264
but if they fire all is lost   14.133424215991948
the sea knowing what was required of her threw over them her weeds encircled them with coral and encrusted them with shells   14.710316586984892
0255m the draught produced a galvanic effect a violent trembling pervaded the old man s limbs his eyes opened until it was fearful to gaze upon them he heaved a sigh which resembled a shriek and then his convulsed body returned gradually to its former immobility the eyes remaining open   12.17212100943959
then he added in a low tone yes   18.51058696075728
benedetto rejoined his associates and i saw him from a distance point me out to them as a fool   9.025848363635266
one plays with anybody   9.568165888473995
how long has he been there   10.341843098070933
cried the gascon from the door we must set out in ten minutes   15.862188530625698
and where is she then   15.538661612303715
the other seemed to meditate yet he was more than half asleep   5.154795935871799
oh i am sure of it   14.387560372673658
let us rest here an instant to give these poor creatures breathing time said porthos   10.203591329294312
no but to set my mind at rest as you observed just now   13.666508706245606
all was over   17.364558697048466
dantès let go of the timber which he now thought to be useless and swam vigorously to meet them   8.060448028913015
he opened a drawer and took out a purse   11.237093028622068
look emmanuel   13.489666042336832
planchet yes i have found him again but he is lackey no longer   15.872245606911893
i doubt it   11.640759094161945
why yourself to be sure   12.556377585454996
asked the abbé smilingly imputing the deep abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe and wonder   13.461446150985632
beware morcerf he is already an old man   13.58271644928673
bonacieux in an undertone   15.148979988632053
the palikares had remained on the shore of the lake ready to cover our retreat   13.42409701998588
i don t know what it was   14.677876195778019
however you may look and see added the lackey raising the curtained entrance of the tent   7.721249795069002
haberdasher she is afraid so   9.886307213137819
but still you acted from motives of self interest my dear maximilian for you well knew that from the moment in which you had manifested an opposite spirit all would have been ended between us   12.320206860353412
the way was therefore opened to the four friends with all sorts of puritan congratulations   14.529800140118022
but all that even you know with respect to the french code i know not only in reference to that code but as regards the codes of all nations   15.496259541397244
the blade was round and of flexible silver   16.622589381325195
in that case replied the major it would be necessary to write to the curé for duplicates and it would be some time before they could be obtained   11.90908225351548
at seven o clock in the evening all was ready and at ten minutes past seven they doubled the lighthouse just as the beacon was kindled   12.93005366015573
a thousand times yes   10.024241973032398
well said he they likewise have refused me   12.14940029563193
your tilbury your groom your clothes are not then hired   6.514942269024588
he again   8.743905620361248
the evening passed as evenings mostly pass at italian theatres   14.785312977533934
with hatred in his eyes foaming at his mouth and his fist extended mordaunt had advanced one more step a threatening terrible step toward de winter   13.705646765408641
dividing the proceeds chapter 107   15.647614079873392
i am sorry i did not follow him said porthos   10.579409401709732
the doors are about to be opened and in five minutes they will be here   12.331880126432074
long live the duc de beaufort   11.283957341561266
oh he is always as colorless as you now see him said franz   6.411853817365579
and he knows the full casks said blaisois for he has already been in the hold with monsieur le chevalier d artagnan   14.814462413408547
what did your father tell you m   10.171937186288801
and besides loves your majesty too well   12.336556566422326
do you promise   8.837212105202424
fortunately twenty times at least from misanthropy or fatigue dantès had received his jailer in bed and then the man placed his bread and soup on the table and went away without saying a word   8.575327598453008
i have five hundred pistoles or thereabouts   19.207610225191544
the principal thing for her then was as we have said to keep mme   12.460797041919827
and why have you come here   8.7828200700819
whispered caderousse you have deceived me the trick you spoke of last night has been played   11.316857699497959
but you are dripping my dear fellow   11.058285917351537
cried groslow rushing to the hatchway   15.704313858025394
returned the count   11.887120488127707
aramis had passed his sword through the body of the first and athos had knocked down the other with the butt end of his pistol   9.176945414326285
now his plans were fully made and this is what he intended to do   9.196567755472245
and he named several distinguished gentlemen and among them was m   15.345624510410708
i want nothing now that i have you said the old man   10.566686463837097
at ferrara tasso s prison   14.067910671991472
and i perceived with terror that a man was standing within a few paces of me   6.979778998756227
though sinking from moment to moment the wounded man was not yet dead   18.049724838006725
we will explain in a few words how d artagnan had been led to choose that place of residence   13.5550287882778
the king accompanied him to the door where aramis pronounced his benediction upon him and passing through the ante rooms filled with soldiers jumped into his carriage and drove to the bishop s palace   14.5576302884188
as to groslow he promised himself that on the following evening he would recover from d artagnan what he had lost to porthos and on leaving reminded the gascon of his appointment   11.874125509760994
i was not praying   16.421682754382022
at the conclusion of these words the count rose to depart   10.309699193254081
it is as if you said for example chastity modesty innocence it is a kind of baptismal name as you parisians call it   11.51483796530014
but i confess to you i am now almost exhausted   9.854351863653267
tell me replied faria what has hindered you from knocking down your jailer with a piece of wood torn from your bedstead dressing yourself in his clothes and endeavoring to escape   12.509524304981127
the last count of spada moreover made me his heir bequeathing to me this symbolic breviary he bequeathed to me all it contained   13.13592853201444
for truly at this moment when there is question of war i confess to you that i see nothing in your grace but an englishman and consequently an enemy whom i should have much greater pleasure in meeting on the field of battle than in the park at windsor or the corridors of the louvre all which however will not prevent me from executing to the very point my commission or from laying down my life if there be need of it to accomplish it   9.32393049330878
said kitty blushing   9.342243266819892
well now that everything is decided cried porthos rubbing his hands suppose we think of dinner   9.126405355023707
villefort said nothing but he clasped his hands opened his haggard eyes and overcome with his emotion sank into a chair   15.490467416000431
so much the worse so much the worse diavolo   13.067176560347793
the door was opened to the coadjutor of the room in which the mendicant was suffering   12.744752076630325
the next day they kept their word and thus they grew up together   8.869611227722578
where is your master   7.878265470196354
cried monte cristo stopping suddenly what words do you utter   14.495472101958443
midnight sounded and almost at the same time the bell was rung in milady s chamber   9.836600978187407
when franz appeared again on the shore the yacht only seemed like a small white speck on the horizon   16.52513958753766
occasionally he shuddered   10.65559620589618
because they would not spend money so guiltily acquired   10.553428808519483
in doing us justice you will no longer treat us as men of vulgar stamp   16.407191934753197
bills upon his majesty s private treasury answered d artagnan who reckoning upon entering into the king s service in consequence of this recommendation believed he could make this somewhat hazardous reply without telling of a falsehood   10.27187401883901
you surely will not do that my dear count   14.019979774366275
lift it and judge if i am mistaken   14.071908006547988
athos listened to him without a frown   16.606843327700666
do you think of him   15.76494891169089
when i am dead you will go and examine it   11.834189486693832
20029m as to the note which accompanied this the englishman understood that it might have been added by some inspector who had taken a momentary interest in dantès situation but who had from the remarks we have quoted found it impossible to give any effect to the interest he had felt   13.59780127660201
he looked at the pictures whose faces seemed to smile and the landscapes which appeared painted in brighter colors   9.673121573518006
her body even pays what she promises i must do her that justice   16.069051000175286
in these prompt arrangements we recognize the order of a well disciplined soldier   13.082782009029668
why didn t they search more vigilantly   11.82416234169798
danglars was joking in a friendly way but fernand looked pale and agitated   11.853575717119064
madame danglars threw a rapid and inquiring glance which could only be interpreted by monte cristo around the courtyard over the peristyle and across the front of the house then repressing a slight emotion which must have been seen on her countenance if she had not kept her color she ascended the steps saying to morrel sir if you were a friend of mine i should ask you if you would sell your horse   13.085672110562088
continued the count   8.532631691428652
after the king and the cardinal m   8.757760638146252
nothing is impossible gravely replied monte cristo   13.33116812100076
and whoever appeared there was taken and interrogated by the cardinal s people   10.606346529857287
he is in safe custody answered villefort   11.585113379290133
40190m these words restored albert   10.50567392400307
he remained there fourteen years morrel said the count placing his hand on the young man s shoulder   10.518956688522296
replied the cardinal knitting his brow in his turn the secret of many unknown things might perhaps be found in your brains if we could read them as you read that letter which you concealed as soon as you saw me coming   10.746578905905302
ought we to go on   14.25886140019755
what makes you think so   8.894509516421866
in the french or turkish style strong or weak sugar or none cool or boiling   9.857542826079197
it concerns your treasures does it not   10.873676630563983
and he darted out of the room shut the door and waited in the corridor the soldier s half pike in his hand and as if he had mounted guard in his place   13.59402925574447
lord winter is killed then   10.696868715027561
you will not have me turned out this time as you did in london you dare not   15.606267118103723
i am lost said he   17.33649086686762
after dinner the count of monte cristo was announced   12.25242220473028
one by one the several groups broke up   11.469942425533766
on whom   8.262558010157388
never have i met with so remarkable a person as yourself   9.01809425552762
you will see said the man proudly   13.116819619843403
if i guess rightly will you confess it   8.334601784535993
be it so said athos   12.021604634017246
well but what does that matter   13.774201094608362
your wound   14.244391668264976
resumed mme   7.629193631085097
i have scraped together some such things as an income of two or three thousand crowns in the haberdashery business but more particularly in venturing some funds in the last voyage of the celebrated navigator jean moquet   10.732397242625007
no said d artagnan and yet i am certain it is not the first time i have seen that visage   13.406054852556629
we are reluctant to leave for a single moment men whom our lackeys know to be millionaires   13.153981051154254
the intrepid treasure seeker walked round it and selecting the spot from whence it appeared most susceptible to attack placed his lever in one of the crevices and strained every nerve to move the mass   11.928314764208249
my dear danglars said morcerf we have been acquainted for many years and consequently we ought to make some allowance for each other s failings   10.947423433456837
you must have searched badly   10.162457080685313
no vampire cried beauchamp   13.230007671474798
he uttered not a word nor shed a tear but a deadly pallor spread over his face   16.032986957455474
he may have fallen from his horse he may have cut a caper from the deck   10.290449906215933
franz who had mutely interrogated the countess and received from her a gracious smile in token that he would be welcome sought not to retard the gratification of albert s eager impatience but began at once the tour of the house closely followed by albert who availed himself of the few minutes required to reach the opposite side of the theatre to settle the height and smoothness of his collar and to arrange the lappets of his coat   10.902094664886945
tell me valentine for it is that i came to know   12.94825082278497
athos immediately profited by the permission and the door was closed behind him   19.67207462372366
he believed this opportunity was now come and addressed his neighbor it is not astonishing that that young man should be afraid of a ball for he is doubtless a musketeer apprentice   9.966646852174696
you re a great moralist and that s the fact said porthos   10.150340037396756
and from this time the kindness which edmond showed him was enough for the brave seaman   8.860695008951847
did you see the postscript   11.00736015807468
but when the sea became more calm he resolved to plunge into its waves again and swim to lemaire equally arid but larger and consequently better adapted for concealment   14.62760210054951
since the moment he had first received these two mementoes athos had never parted with them   10.018583363236083
it was faria s last winding sheet a winding sheet which as the turnkey said cost so little   8.755111798741604
and if you will believe me you had better spare yourself the trouble of reading that long letter and follow me   10.883798211353843
we have a queen blinded by a belated passion   8.00578482637732
her wrists were bruised   7.016630496745945
d artagnan spoke these words with a simplicity that did honor to his courtesy without throwing the least doubt upon his courage   12.084227178379267
the bride blushed while fernand restless and uneasy seemed to start at every fresh sound and from time to time wiped away the large drops of perspiration that gathered on his brow   9.885860329883137
a miracle of heaven replaced me on the throne of my fathers after five and twenty years of exile   11.438841615745119
this was one of his parts in the popular comedy he was performing a make up he had adopted and which suited him about as well as the masks worn on the classic stage by paternal actors who seen from one side were the image of geniality and from the other showed lips drawn down in chronic ill temper   10.796631475850697
but they were not pioneers they were soldiers of the garrison   10.443198220860964
with five thousand you can buy a pretty little house with two acres of land   14.12461897499531
thus then it is your opinion said anne of austria with a sneer and biting her lips with rage that yesterday s riot which to day is already a rebellion to morrow may become a revolution   14.735889487376166
the funeral being over the guests returned to paris   10.306772079542746
i offer my best respects and services to you my lord   9.186186494238637
albert de morcerf or i should this day have been the wife of a dishonored man   9.270039568742742
but will you promise me whatever happens that you will not complain but hope   13.968448313673473
continued m   13.335356941905907
i remarked that he regretted the horse furniture very much   11.904529223245092
come aramis   6.553713329869166
then with renewed instructions to grimaud athos signified to raoul that he could set out and ended by reflecting that it was perhaps better that raoul should be away from paris at that moment   12.143838807245514
doctor i resist no longer i can no longer defend myself i believe you   10.60805230505019
yes if your majesty herself should beg him to accept   15.548271046566441
ah that s all very fine retorted the woman   12.605119546531974
cromwell turned as he was going   18.18409330913803
i believe i can guess at least   7.557184487047506
no doubt she fancied the count would speak to her while on his side the count thought she was about to address him   16.065790729484483
and if the king permits me returned the gascon i shall be near him always when there is danger to be encountered   17.074404921411464
suddenly he rallied made a violent effort to restrain himself and then a smile gradually widened the features of his disturbed countenance   12.732349531743825
where he was no one knew   8.675159387985698
the letters being finished each put his own into two envelopes so that no one without tearing the first envelope could discover to whom the second was addressed   11.666665717768893
he is beforehand with us said m   14.278553011857817
i owe to this worthy lord all the happiness i ever knew   16.289513836889487
and he favored this man the more as grimaud became the more and more odious to him   14.196706664174425
it is i   14.873256102317445
the truth was it had been entirely overlooked in the plan arranged and followed out by m   15.471287399996763
d artagnan took the paper hesitatingly and cast his eyes over it   14.187559088980201
i need but mention one fact to make all the ladies in paris court his notice and that is that he has come to take up his abode in paris for a year during which brief period he proposes to spend six millions of money   13.495890332043732
and you may rely upon me for the others not being inferior to them   17.054383027017693
said he what is this   12.861248669735467
it proves that we know how to keep our secrets   10.407424938831591
rosette of an officer of the legion of honor in his button hole   11.212629122996905

i do not go on because it pleases me to stop here   13.332541224975028
but as if they likewise mistrusted each other they kept their respective distances   12.39162566709622
and milady stretched out her arms to mme   7.506969017543506
for a moment the idea of struggling crossed his mind and of so ending the unexpected evil that had overtaken him   11.448868098863892
resigning himself therefore to what seemed inevitable he bade his host good night and mounted the stairs   14.888349365873657
asked the comte   15.87145061737419
but she is dead and my duty regards the living   10.944955407180295
they pursued their way along the quay then called l abreuvoir pepin and went along by the walls of the grand chatelet   9.94011282792109
inquired the elder dantès   13.786615963267346
is that monsieur   14.763408044224228
bazin entered at that moment carrying a bottle in each hand   15.54174189081226
meanwhile it was necessary at all hazards in order to gain time to put some obstacle in the way of the execution on the following day the day appointed by the judges   13.973913680268709
ah said he here we are at the last act of the tragedy   12.64689729159149
said caderousse twirling a plate in the air between his two hands   9.92331647810992
the nubian immediately descended and opened the carriage door   15.067730676589143
it has four hundred lines and lasts a minute   16.793035023182256
let him signal   8.335393600401616
this permission we feel bound to say was graciously granted   13.36091390674518
lord de winter went out making a sign to felton who followed him shutting the door after him   4.958627785586145
he offered his arm to the countess   10.728127820155152
that is to say highway robbers   11.3304829511646
this visit had infused new vigor into dantès   10.85471272151317
most palpable proofs said he as you may perceive   10.603699624593396
he was like a soldierly automaton or rather like a magnificent marionette   7.999575262368341
but it is not selfishness alone that makes me thus in haste   14.858686203462469
nevertheless replied the jeweller if by the time i have finished my supper the tempest has at all abated i shall make another start   10.88329406989417
i will ask leave of absence of monsieur de tréville on some pretext or other which you must invent   8.322677238082179
milady was in it   17.34216506035721
i recognize you perfectly   10.542193416103636
you know my devotion to you   8.518452692678657
the jailer advanced   13.482801645855726
i came here direct from the castle of st   13.522958025463002
and i madame   14.736086748449583
at ten o clock the king s collation consisting of preserves and other delicacies was prepared in the little room on the side of the church of st   12.55340789882469
did he receive you ungraciously my dear friend   12.684184610952787
the birds whose songs delighted him cheered him with their music   14.664799584939667
i speak of monsieur de tréville who was formerly my neighbor and who had the honor to be as a child the play fellow of our king louis xiii   10.351732520847639
she made him kill the duke   11.0122426443346
the old marshal turned toward the viscount grateful for that praise of his son whilst the prince exclaimed the young man is right   19.34071815078314
monsieur d artagnan belongs to the service   12.571693001532884
the consequence is that when i saw our laborers which did not at all suit two such delicate stomachs as ours i had recourse to a little of my old trade   14.528088556367333
stay with grandpapa maximilian   12.889447509542338
d artagnan was over him at a bound and said to the englishman pointing his sword to his throat i could kill you my lord you are completely in my hands   14.286786863896126
is your horse tired   12.497517722609988
is it not almost incredible said madame danglars that a person having at least half a million of secret service money at his command should possess so little information   13.994953657661103
i am a priest and confessions die in my breast   10.731307706598447
of course   10.662713434150762
this time the illusion or rather the reality surpassed anything valentine had before experienced   12.39331008584075
come come do not look so astonished or you will make me think you are laughing at me in return for my good nature   9.839008286694618
to the palais   14.451485098409027
but with all that he outstripped ariel and barbare against whom he ran by at least three whole lengths   10.982385494579257
the child was small for his age and unnaturally pale   13.185803501907106
cavalcanti s father will be gone   9.216750345295768
the duc d orléans visited the posts   7.16020065614575
carmela turned towards the young man who was talking with her and saying a few words to him pointed with her finger to teresa   13.16368542925625
he is my only remaining friend and we both need his help come   12.553656747433624
and raoul fell back trembling upon his chair   14.071179580885403
the countess in reply bowed gracefully to albert and extended her hand with cordial kindness to franz   11.927184712918722
it was intensely dark   11.720501133362065
poor father   8.849910931624233
they did not scruple much in the case of athos   12.595741580456083
richelieu thought d artagnan would have given me five hundred pistoles in advance   9.81032491623303
let them all be taken away and changed then with the exception of the sleeping chamber which is hung with red damask   11.242847134659401
yes said the procureur and i think the will promises to be yet more extraordinary for i can not see how it is to be drawn up without the intervention of valentine and she may perhaps be considered as too much interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable interpreter of the obscure and ill defined wishes of her grandfather   12.133979615100118
do you not father   13.092775915213089
although d artagnan did not at all know the queen he soon distinguished her voice from the others at first by a slightly foreign accent and next by that tone of domination naturally impressed upon all royal words   14.474854169335027
for my part i declare d artagnan i think it of much more consequence than the little piece of waste paper you have so cunningly slipped into your bosom   12.124002947663563
albert however felt no less insulted   12.68077057050473
the king will be delivered at the tribunal said athos   9.803085152641033
besides had not the deputy who had been so kind to him told him that provided he did not pronounce the dreaded name of noirtier he had nothing to apprehend   9.240775408434455
but he added in this war prisoners stand a chance of being hung   8.720678744956007
as for monte cristo his eyes slowly rose towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude   4.956909627659165
d artagnan was a woman and still more a mother   15.243855006315142
by five minutes   13.318439040494022
oh delightful   14.182040560643355
this manoeuvre transparent to the duc de beaufort was quite unintelligible to la ramee   14.031249303269227
and he hid what he had written by sliding the letter under a folio of blank paper   12.201382420030749
the more reason they should be sulky with us for having captured the stuart for whom i hope you re preparing a pretty trial   15.180237647373866
now here montaran we will do better than that let each take a half   6.718942716989547
i believe they do   13.72471343958421
speak and i will follow your advice   12.096488178543577
asked the count carelessly addressing himself half to bertuccio half to the notary   11.550313936406758
then trembling agitated and her heart beating with indescribable terror she awaited the event   15.917122758048839
they say that the door is not opened by a key but a magic word   7.912302064961276
madame said villefort believe me a fortune of 900 000 francs is not so easily renounced   16.492940988760534
he said to himself what chateau   12.631737354121938
at last charged with murders with debauchery hated by every one and yet threatening still like a panther thirsting for blood she fell under the blows of men whom she had rendered desperate though they had never done her the least injury   9.501829248800478
four powerful horses were already pawing the ground with impatience while ali apparently just arrived from a long walk was standing at the foot of the steps his face bathed in perspiration   10.721655088852405
they turned round and saw diavolaccio bearing the young girl in his arms   14.47724203213264
then with sighs which were unlike any human sound he dragged himself to the door reeled across the courtyard and falling into the arms of his valet he said in a voice scarcely intelligible home home   15.6259571787975
she cast a glance at the door   11.912377363198518
nevertheless they felt convinced that all was as it should be as it was done by the order of athos   15.543625227931976
overpowered with agitation the poisoner succeeded in groping her way to the door and reached her room in an agony of fear   12.382451164869916
your courage can not be doubted   16.705969443799912
milady asked some questions about the carriage   13.349337262880129
such feats sir are done once and never repeated   12.147565197095874
it was evident from his pale face and knit brows that his resolution to revenge himself was growing weaker   12.499907094186074
the eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind   10.474830604431531
pity me help me   6.5950629812114006
indeed i fear 40028m valentine will have no greater pleasure than that of fulfilling her grandmother s last injunctions   8.882146941976092
my lord will remember that the lodge is at a distance from the house   11.456785342743753
he got in it and thoroughly wearied by so many emotions arrived about midnight in the rue meslay threw himself on his bed and slept soundly   15.050621584191568
he confides him to my care   10.393574920624664
you have seven martlets on your arms   10.188561079359863
this man was dressed in a greatcoat or rather a surtout a little worse for the journey but which exhibited the ribbon of the legion of honor still fresh and brilliant a decoration which also ornamented the under coat   11.215911143124675
yes monsieur said mousqueton but in a very ill humor   10.60820082301601
it must be so and i will not endeavor to prevent it   8.533007809464753
then i should advise you to leave off wearing that style of dress   15.727460862946817
see him and hear what he says   12.821068161977177
teresa had become alarmed at the wild and deserted look of the plain around her and pressed closely against her guide not uttering a syllable   9.961556599722448
saddle our horses take your carbine   12.41860571097024
first my lord   12.5213295841051
mine was to guard you and i am doing so   10.961376524985905
you wish to know what i will do   10.449707075057633
but don t fancy that i am going to take you on your bare word   11.829856616194174
and should i forget you kings memories are short do not be afraid to bring yourself to my recollection   9.998091636466535
on his account i add two hundred crowns   17.092649503981765
let us speak candidly sir   12.301167290934636
but that s impossible   17.69006797613813
the first rays of daybreak penetrated the aperture of the tent as winter re entered it   16.94078977993164
a young man does not require luxuries   12.758085856794949
here are thirty francs   13.640070456440775
this woman passed for his sister   12.824891876363612
so that three of the king s musketeers one of whom was wounded and a youth not only maintained their ground against five of the most terrible of the cardinal s guardsmen but absolutely brought four of them to earth   16.252211902186588
you are mistaken you will not die   8.768768555532928
30183m what do you say   11.233217780548134
at length they heard the cannon so near that it was evident they were within a league of the field of battle and at a turn of the road they perceived the little village of aunay   12.231463003599362
i must confess that i was mistaken   9.205610383268292
give me the despatch raoul   7.2194301296183205
then make yourself quite easy   11.19568334685536
we will embrace raoul and perhaps he will have news of athos   14.572865421851983
an amateur headsman replied aramis who however does not handle the axe amiss   11.691438580160131
as for myself brought up in the mountains i had a double motive for fearing the gendarmes and custom house officers as my appearance before the judges would cause an inquiry and an inquiry always looks back into the past   7.616226139866152
that angel resembles the one i have lost   12.105127904604092
let us drink heartily and while we do so tell me a little of what is going on in the world yonder   12.021053537806436
he seemed scarcely five and thirty   11.660003822704729
so you are free now and rich   17.286191280217388
then i renewed the search   9.086133630182628
said the king who began to be shaken was it so managed   12.307935537078723
bonaparte continued the baron is mortally wearied and passes whole days in watching his miners at work at porto longone   11.061258298518863
in the midst of this tumult the voice of the president was heard to exclaim are you playing with justice accused and do you dare set your fellow citizens an example of disorder which even in these times has never been equalled   13.361228724801151
but she positively answered that she was tired of the exigencies and infidelities of monsieur porthos and that she would not send him a denier   11.023304029693275
but milady allowed him to preside over all the preparations for breakfast without addressing a word to him   12.51803488113256
while walking near the wood of monsieur le prince i laid a few snares in the runs   12.50020926204573
it is the truth however   15.739051913917372
i have a jolly little circle of witty abbés and pretty women   14.967676908161785
no i only suspect he has warned the queen against some fresh machinations of the cardinal   18.501235093361867
did this proposed breakfast cover some stratagem   12.902235665416816
show me into one of those pretty little rooms which overlook the court and bring me a cold fowl and a bottle of bordeaux   6.802945432260751
but at the first effort he made although he played with his left hand he found that his wound was yet too recent to allow of such exertion   9.572648768100024
if you reveal it to anyone in the world i shall be lost and perhaps yourself likewise   17.750649740863587
happiness is like the enchanted palaces we read of in our childhood where fierce fiery dragons defend the entrance and approach   11.844784777488027
i am accustomed to adversity   12.688159610831084
and so he was murmured caderousse   15.94842768437127
you notice my ring   13.904941837917022
did you not tell me it was a family jewel   10.6307371640964
when franz had finished reading this account so dreadful for a son   9.935486211262361
they both listened   6.896529429908843
this man has gone and for the moment has consequently escaped my vengeance   9.95088674797377
this scrutiny was so much the more easy the coachman being sound asleep   9.179974245915055
but he called to mind the words of the will which he knew by heart   13.026328546713474
but i really pity this poor comte de wardes since you have ceased to love him   11.001766658591755
which is to say that the gascons made a king of me myself seeing that i am my father s son is it not tréville   10.557579963681347
the crime which i have committed my lord has no call upon human justice and you can only deliver me from it by blessing me frequently as you have just done   9.116615399911511
but still further his education had been so little neglected even with respect to scholastic studies so rare at this time among gentlemen that he smiled at the scraps of latin which aramis sported and which porthos pretended to understand   12.54391006914537
though i remember in our affair of the rue férou i received a sword wound which at the end of fifteen or eighteen days produced the same effect   13.891532953584019

and springing backward he broke his sword across his knee to avoid the necessity of surrendering it threw the pieces over the convent wall and crossed his arms whistling a cardinalist air   7.807690537558464

the four philosophers looked at one another in a state of bewilderment   9.290847231630053
that little stout man short and elderly that sort of lackey dressed in dark clothes treated without ceremony by the men wearing swords who composed the escort was bonacieux himself   15.166716475289798
ma foi yes   13.248827449658531
father said the young man i have the honor of presenting to you the count of monte cristo the generous friend whom i had the good fortune to meet in the critical situation of which i have told you   14.421436830974532
the south was aflame and to assist even on his death bed the father of so dangerous a bonapartist as dantès was stigmatized as a crime   11.468754360835959
i present to you he said monsieur le chevalier d artagnan lieutenant of his majesty s musketeers a devoted friend and one of the most excellent brave gentlemen that i have ever known   13.022648282519361

i feel easy replied porthos   14.422826889719063
the door opened   15.296049993220509
but beneath my fingers as if by magic in proportion as the fire ascended i saw yellowish characters appear on the paper   8.054275981929619
can i be so lucky as to find what everybody is seeking for   13.829961287137424
your life my young friend has not been of sufficient length to admit of your having passed through any very important events   11.044239317624092
replied mazarin with his italian smile   8.639536995200313
but not every one   12.771574916136421

it was there a lodging was prepared for them   6.7545189895321895
from time to time a shot from a musket or the blade of a rapier flashed among the crowd   15.749018902477598
just like the women replied d artagnan coolly   9.495914011570564

no the other cardinal would have done so but this one is too mean a fellow to risk it   13.014087048760718
my servants seem to imitate those you sometimes see in a play who because they have only a word or two to say aquit themselves in the most awkward manner possible   10.823399678435386
said athos musingly   6.416956167517652
ali suddenly cast aside his chibouque drew the lasso from his pocket threw it so skilfully as to catch the forelegs of the near horse in its triple fold and suffered himself to be dragged on for a few steps by the violence of the shock then the animal fell over on the pole which snapped and therefore prevented the other horse from pursuing its way   16.727298056630104
let us drink my dear d artagnan morbleu   7.604211905946402
that they may try a month hence to marry me again   12.290451704578514
to morrow according to all probability we shall attack the enemy   10.139502981118158
the ship drew on and had safely passed the strait which some volcanic shock has made between the calasareigne and jaros islands   8.61846970023245

noirtier was a true prophet and things progressed rapidly as he had predicted   13.323418585196164
morrel was dreaming and monte cristo was looking at the dreamer   8.738622819018191
i only wish to do what will be agreeable to you that is all   10.734947534464858
the heart of d artagnan swam in delirium   11.517911275540524
he has regarded neither my prayers my entreaties nor my tears   11.23770976443987
go he added and make yourself agreeable to monsieur la ramee and tell him that you suit me in all respects   10.013340910917364
noirtier was carried away   11.74765293975766
la jeune amélie was first at the rendezvous   12.40401686336971
yes but cautiously tell one thing at a time and do not say i told you   17.266948131264385
but that is not all after rescuing me from the sword he rescued me from the cold not by sharing his cloak with me like st   8.465803881401504
no light appeared through the chinks of the shutters   11.841884875102823
by r lady   14.754049685711609
and if mme   11.765470943679468
de morcerf as the officer fernand mondego   3.3466500893299393
it is for that reason i have given orders to pass the island for as you see the fire is behind us   12.597133372843878
if the pardon is to come there is no time to lose   6.988918526012185
so much the worse said valentine smiling   10.76422373557837
what is the day of the month   13.41412228313139
but then we know that understanding was not his strong point   7.3786760186222144
don t lose a word of what i m going to say to you porthos   13.754101775379638
she looked at him with an expression of kindness which it was impossible to mistake   8.191596843934542
my very own   11.303855841291796
her face is very pale and i have listened in vain   6.63461396327358
but alas his elegant toilet was wholly thrown away and one of the most worthy representatives of parisian fashion had to carry with him the mortifying reflection that he had nearly overrun italy without meeting with a single adventure   12.264908422004131
cried she my god   10.746016254424228
in the meantime d artagnan who had plunged into a bypath continued his route and reached st   19.346547531154663
gentlemen said groslow i beg you will take your places   15.705812114746625
any way mother   6.884892862628782
now then said villefort placing the letter in his pocketbook i must have another   12.754474245392206
you are perfectly right my lord   13.35518089295152
monsieur i implore you do not stay there   18.44822621740711
and lastly and perhaps the most important the record of the sale of my person and that of my mother to the armenian merchant el kobbir by the french officer who in his infamous bargain with the porte had reserved as his part of the booty the wife and daughter of his benefactor whom he sold for the sum of four hundred thousand francs   17.73176305097455
ho there my friend   11.298267545411074
i live because it is not ordained for me to die   11.538921935229858
at this word she athos who had seated himself quietly started up   13.202911524634102
20295m and what did you do with the child   10.08751481822601
well how is he now   12.383106213292379
see the sneaks come without drum or trumpet   14.031821386311378
it is very evident that it is the letter w which m   16.627375364070843
shall i suffer like this long   5.33702497302293
the english do they dislike wine   13.618107464389343
albert approached   16.004690722099788
cried the king the scotch sell their king for two hundred thousand pounds   9.95950288715598
thank you thank you murmured she   5.523706293327425
parry bent over his master s hand and kissed it respectfully   14.633030086831365
the island of monte cristo loomed large in the horizon   9.491510345885883
he would have written or at this instant someone knocked at the door   9.881380636295205
but you guitant are not a courtier   10.750480326872742
the same good fortune has not happened to your accomplices one is mad the other dead   15.720565580003974
the letter is still to be seen for it is in franz d épinay s possession signed by me and with a postscript of m   11.757002522496782
the abbess assigned her a chamber and had breakfast served   7.652194341893154
he could not refrain from a smile of visible satisfaction   11.16290871280031
quite contrary to the lot of monsieur de conti unable to be cardinal he was obliged to remain a soldier   11.676010464264762
forget them for a time   16.354087775534243
that s well said monte cristo   13.28469598209459
had we not better lower our heads   13.219648907901169
at this instant the minister of police appeared at the door pale trembling and as if ready to faint   7.9338498032287275
alas said athos we depart alone   13.246641942344764
i hoped that the active and laborious life of a smuggler with the severe discipline on board would have a salutary effect on his character which was now well nigh if not quite corrupt   15.5972932428978
what a fool i was said he not to tear my heart out on the day when i resolved to avenge myself   11.560709166934027
then turning to maximilian with an adorable smile   14.354625210486692
i faith the treasonable word is out   14.280011758199588
i shall hear from you   8.719281812686662
i have it with me   15.745541348258385
then you advise me to go alone to beauchamp   16.29349284737341
a great loss   10.002619578557336
oh as to that i do not engage myself   10.728871339493164
by the baroness he was most graciously welcomed while eugénie received him with her accustomed coldness   10.897189712625034
at last louis xiii   12.732184635265343
will you tell me that your three damned musketeers athos porthos and aramis and your youngster from béarn have not fallen like so many furies upon poor bernajoux and have not maltreated him in such a fashion that probably by this time he is dead   9.20590240890685
ah said the inspector you have not the latest news from italy   9.081316400816274
that was no reason for staking my diamond   12.192041700838207
so pray excuse yourself as well as you can for having made me wait and after that tell me why i see you in a dress so singular that at first i did not recognize you   11.51403344975297
he made a sign to cocles who went first   9.748734366223648
it is no uncommon thing in italy   15.057759838615667
in an instant all the strength of mind of this creature though drawn from the most vigorous sources abandoned her   11.242660333965512
you know said the queen that they want to take the king away from me   13.606197751284363
we have plenty of time to spare   10.486362022364816
from their beds of dried leaves or wolf skins at the back of the chamber now arose the companions of the man who had been found by albert de morcerf reading cæsar s commentaries and by danglars studying the life of alexander   11.035038333952885
the poor duke became perfectly giddy   5.2652680165468535
she is then now at malta   10.066153308346596
what passed in the mind of this man at the supreme moment of his agony can not be told in words   13.997103657943661
the king muttered the wounded man the king is a prisoner   11.498919700419387
well i will certainly drink to their health with all my heart but i will not drink alone   11.06003741491369
with princes not with presidents councillors and low born lawyers   13.578044689447148
but the more the young woman excused herself the more important bonacieux thought the secret which she declined to confide to him   10.16383718260699
he had labelled them with as much care as if he had been master botanist in the jardin des plantes   8.722945039184381
the corso was light as day   14.17355484940266
beware said m   12.177881108603353
where do you come from now   14.560845908089242
then seeing his son he fell into his arms pale and trembling   17.646994008428983
they stopped on the road but you continued yours   9.832539484147595
the fortune of war my dear viscount the caprice of fortune   13.465487579064053
he thought a moment cut a branch of a resinous tree lighted it at the fire at which the smugglers had prepared their breakfast and descended with this torch   12.29868902746254
this rabbit dead the abbé adelmonte has its entrails taken out by his cook and thrown on the dunghill   7.186953350985867
then i will go alone   18.263404452766714
the chance of being attacked would be an excuse for everything   8.990280880929438
replied the young man where are you   9.604138272550792
it will do me good   13.338605586784393
there was a third point in view which will appear hereafter   13.236281962810285
demanded he of the paralytic   12.189891904223506
happy   10.445356640553634
a deathlike silence reigned in the room above   13.96528791598163
keeping along the shore and examining the smallest object with serious attention he thought he could trace on certain rocks marks made by the hand of man   9.342414086263465
well well said the count who told you that   13.351320253301694
and i in exchange pardon you the murder of my poor love and your cruel vengeance against me   12.865979581020333
i will not marry count andrea cavalcanti   12.621536117489795
and franz having a number of letters to write relinquished the carriage to albert for the whole of the day   6.542931667105774
then i shall recognize you as my nephew for you would be a worthy son of such a mother   11.418238755909622
grimaud smiled   6.190836746935972
there he again appeared uneasy and embarrassed and stopped for the third time   12.217403644029655
please to remember that he who shall touch a hair of my head is himself an assassin   14.350566497972093
observe to nobody   14.466456184433898
do you know this ring   12.149275148728568
raoul on foot for he had not time to mount his horse again tired like the guards of distributing blows with the flat of his sword had recourse to its point   10.202695269498722
he inquired where they were and was answered by a burst of laughter   15.61769660649304
it was a man who would fight and it was evident danglars would not fight   20.1720230725377
what was the expression of his face   14.624827359794297
but villefort was a man of ability and he knew this would be a sign of weakness   10.987074161135881
valentine shall come down into the drawing room   5.015732045959351
the queen   13.781772929422093
well what then   13.241150878567884
but had its owner asked half a million it would unhesitatingly have been given   10.021651663757591
begin with me my lord   16.58848283481472
among those who aided you to contend against the duc de richelieu and even to conquer him   13.214727516921192
it was thus he had succeeded in approaching several times the beautiful and proud anne of austria and in making himself loved by dazzling her   9.789531016047654
monsieur was already such a good theologian said bazin almost weeping   13.995419792802672
the gardener nodded and began to fling up the balls which were picked up by la ramee and the guard   13.271982349544704
we will try and carry him on board the tartan   16.082042719655387
mazarin breathed again   11.968623452773542
i have parted with him   13.351113130849154
but drawing from his belt a little silver whistle such as boatswains use in ships of war he whistled three times with three different modulations   5.48089861247127
that is reasonable since he is an only son   16.163126340715614
you are not a priest   15.415549936522444
it was the day after that upon which bertuccio had paid his second visit to benedetto when the latter was to learn his father s name   13.670581560375595
give me the letter   14.98312750484249
he even thought he could perceive something on the ground at a distance   17.49860302821216
you had nothing left   9.65304797601301
i am a man of honor said d artagnan determined to come to an end and since your love is mine and i am satisfied i possess it for i do possess it do i not   12.036213611131815
whatever happens let us not leave england before the crisis   11.978419620489728
she had not a soul in the world in whom she could confide   18.57280794025983
the latter obeyed without reply and entered the chamber where he appeared to be expected   16.95953529487439
the street was completely deserted but in the distance was heard like the noise of the tide rushing in the deep hum of the populous waves increasing now around notre dame   11.00101855926958
the eight oars fell into the sea simultaneously without splashing a drop of water and the boat yielding to the impulsion glided forward   17.196385245748445
quite a canoe   6.1926465520866145
no madame   11.4147162625931
undoubtedly i know it but it is a mystery   6.947905284283571
this however did not prevent his asking with the greatest coolness after his majesty s health   14.455295321996587
but villefort uttered words which even he himself did not believe   9.8320064856327
jean had struck three quarters past two   6.30125507232399
in short she had taken the measure of motives hitherto unknown to herself through this experiment made upon the most rebellious subject that nature and religion could submit to her study   11.59605320763651
i wore a long sword which cut like a damascus you remember it aramis for you always called it balizarde   7.782725352699146
now continued aramis taking the same graceful position in his easy chair that he would have assumed in bed and complacently examining his hand which was as white and plump as that of a woman and which he held in the air to cause the blood to descend now as you have heard d artagnan monsieur the principal is desirous that my thesis should be dogmatic while i for my part would rather it should be ideal   16.560954908998646
i have been a captain in the queen s guards for twenty years was the reply   8.771469757734423
impostor indeed   18.841787502281363
take the stairs on your right   9.831354499404746
coysel is a madman   13.076201846497614
you were right he said my dear monsieur d artagnan and you can not set out yet   11.06360882500147
he might have been taken for a statue   10.432387270581314
and scratches himself for amusement added the king   16.95572518218023
tell me is not her father baron danglars   13.101822770348758
no but i was brought up in corsica   13.062203555730141
why he was so called as truly as i myself bore the appellation of gaspard caderousse   15.1935814691584
well and what are you going to do at st   9.648155512665967
his devotion to the queen was boundless   12.144762576297527
we need hardly add that these peasant costumes like those of the young women were brilliant with gold and jewels   8.216581175416822
lord how i have eaten   13.092741189284283
dear friend at raoul s age the heart is so expansive that it must encircle one object or another fancied or real   14.92149657210735
whenever you hesitate as to whom you ought to serve abandon the exterior the material appearance for the invisible principle for the invisible principle is everything   9.68648836739174
a new source of noise and movement was added to the crowd   9.388387070154959
that woman that woman   9.302196347493553
said d artagnan comprehending the slight frown of the musketeer   9.087348709920944
but her cries were soon stifled   8.108177481889369
those devilish scotchmen are always thirsty   11.539642959935621
excuse me but as you will see i only tell you what is absolutely necessary   13.232866728685954
caderousse signed it   13.302635023331936
add monsieur d artagnan my lord   12.117395946415831
50277m let it be then as you wish sweet angel   14.785682411079932
cried the gascon and porthos   8.919234379236368
asked porthos who perceiving that d artagnan had allowed the conversation to drop profited by it to put in a word or two   9.964777549381232
my daughter is only seventeen years old and your son twenty one   13.4636523713104
then do your best to keep our name free from dishonor   13.031593514980546
now then asked albert eagerly have you found the desired cart and oxen   15.36067894192746
but he did not appear to recognize him   9.37279874711294
i only arrived yesterday   17.22580706918214
ah it is m   11.773874195724854
let us rather persevere in our researches   13.355567537513833
30065m but i remember it perfectly interposed the darling edward   14.191866049914038
how is your husband our dear monsieur coquenard   8.874917897420133
fernand opened his mouth to reply but his voice died on his lips and he could not utter a word   12.447155042791849
that would be nothing for us four   13.645822607516454
aramis and his thesis d artagnan had said nothing to porthos of his wound or of his procurator s wife   9.097200073165443
the men he beheld saw him undoubtedly for their cries were carried to his ears by the wind   8.95821105435557
one drop will restore life as you have seen   12.96969280230451
no one can say that m   11.771841253114324
on reaching her room eugénie locked her door while louise fell on a chair   12.215479629522404
assassin of buckingham assassin of felton assassin of my brother i demand justice upon you and i swear that if it be not granted to me i will execute it myself   14.20863215947162
chapter 53   15.019465683248043
the king s authority will put all this to rights   13.789537610393324
well since i gave you a fourth of my gains i think you owe me a fourth of my losses   11.78688540723978
strength and sagacity continued   11.39958203480001
d artagnan bowed   7.067141404374536
do you think said madame de villefort that valentine is in league with him   12.395855076489815
i fell upon one knee then upon both   18.086047217559617
morrel subdued by the extraordinary ascendancy monte cristo exercised over everything around him did not endeavor to resist it   10.947831061766022
the palais de justice communicated with the prison a sombre edifice that from its grated windows looks on the clock tower of the accoules   12.267132138901426
all we have to do is to stop the issue of any more and close our office   12.533359367904705
dear excellent friend murmured albert still burning the papers   8.636272123068343
already rich he held a high official situation though only twenty seven   10.116813447367146
if the news be inauspicious we must fly this night   15.00304365703727
and what do you mean to do   15.929889116609761
let us go and see whether they are quite dead or if they can still be helped suggested raoul   11.902598457774037
i have taken the oath of allegiance to louis xviii   10.714189420919018
made tréville the captain of his musketeers who were to louis xiii   12.642901576811203
porthos who had not spoken one word answered merely by a word and a gesture   11.150977902896368
the guards more skillful did greater execution   17.92291061514574
in this instance i may fairly and freely accept your thanks   8.939086271543982
at the end of the next act with your permission i will come and inquire whether there is anything i can do for you in paris   14.671618570468222
take the detachment and conduct him to his place   10.921588158476533
the four walls alone remained as he had left them   16.7219568153227
but everything does not depend on wealth and it is a fine thing to have a good name and to occupy a high station in society   15.218121449376072
de villefort the object of unusual attention and we had almost said of general admiration sat in the armchair and cast a tranquil glance around him   10.103492888064824
in your place i would do one thing   19.32156095517575
you are really too difficult to please   10.413249935325945
baptistin appeared   17.9989407661362
said d artagnan who quickly understood whence such an exact description had come   13.714662499657509
insolent wretch   10.920303626005605
in the first place light me a torch   19.1374274119768
the arts change about and make a tour of the world   14.944923950633264
all his funds amounted to 6 000 or 8 000 francs his bills receivable up to the 5th to 4 000 or 5 000 which making the best of everything gave him 14 000 francs to meet debts amounting to 287 500 francs   11.056953763075404
inquired monte cristo laughingly   6.999092419630247
during this passage felton related everything to milady how instead of going to london he had chartered the little vessel   16.567526411893347
the councillor broussel is being arrested   14.88946527454398
each one on awaking would find himself on the field of battle   8.768979458501434
he was moderately reassured however by the aspect of that countenance full of astute intelligence and affected humility   16.445156610244947
d artagnan slipped out of the cathedral and placed himself in ambuscade at the corner of the rue des canettes   9.015965660160548
now said the old man aid me to bury my child   17.52176115953513
but three weeks had already passed and the most diligent search had been unsuccessful   13.86529632995044
he returned to mousqueton but the steward had sold the last wisp   13.847850297453126
everyone turned towards the procureur who unable to bear the universal gaze now riveted on him alone advanced staggering into the midst of the tribunal with his hair dishevelled and his face indented with the mark of his nails   12.073031849960893
but mousqueton forages and brings in provisions   9.657990805394387
exclaimed morrel with increasing anger and reproach you who have deceived me with false hopes who have cheered and soothed me with vain promises when i might if not have saved her at least have seen her die in my arms   14.204864827730635
on the contrary one shot at this moment would be paid for dearly to morrow   10.505100052156639
no said danglars smiling they are bonds on the bank of france payable to bearer   7.627222928312295
tis well and may this money profit you   14.216238276310538
that s true said porthos   10.707916692585833
the minister and the king exchanged numerous caresses felicitating each other upon the fortunate chance which had freed france from the inveterate enemy who set all europe against her   7.799904802290262
there was no time to lose   5.528153987831883
warn his friends too   17.511317269372064
yes i heard this news and knew it even before you could   12.648750622778014
now this point was settled   14.495014603066751
bonacieux could hardly hear what she said to my lord duke of buckingham london   11.008728884393301
madame replied aramis i must ask your pardon but i know not how to hide my indignation at seeing how a daughter of henry iv   8.588719026953505
dantès gazed with admiration but he had some difficulty in believing   17.73682032272887
but the two young men sought the privilege of passing the night together and it was accorded them   10.692963250704294
the old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same expression   13.442131528180958
cried athos my son i entreat you   16.45532747270167
chairs were placed scaffolds were raised and windows were hung with flags   14.322440389615842
what a wicked looking crooked staircase said château renaud with a smile   11.828276787957545
now shall i tell you something   7.114737866237435
athos called grimaud pointed to a large basket which lay in a corner and made a sign to him to wrap the viands up in the napkins   12.872066142203142
replied now as to the worthy cardinals spada and rospigliosi let us ask both of them to dinner something tells me that we shall get that money back   8.88931865843278
monte cristo sprang lightly from the carriage and offered his hand to assist emmanuel and maximilian   6.271989177775479
went without recompense   10.341850031418582
that of the telegraph man was horticulture   6.261844637062306
good replied athos whose blood mounted to his face at the insult offered to royalty   9.221790800293647
to morrow we will hunt the hare on my plain which is a superb tract of land or pursue the deer in my woods which are magnificent   11.419248080361328
this alone can stop me in my onward career before i have attained the goal at which i aim for all the rest i have reduced to mathematical terms   8.511800802151017
a burst of satisfaction hailed the last words of the captain   11.683067530572647
and therefore my dear monsieur bernouin if you wish to do what will be pleasing to your master announce to her majesty that i have come and tell her with what purpose   17.49747753535285
the door opened and the man in the mantle reappeared   12.059806995916155
but as to you i do not advise you to risk doing so   10.459964380541834
then rising and extending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old man s head he slowly added by the blood of christ i swear never to leave you while you live   3.866604370708446
villefort knew not when he should return and renée far from pleading for dantès hated the man whose crime separated her from her lover   12.864333353679879
vampa approached the corpse and recognized cucumetto   14.29905184532102
they see neither the police commissary with his badge of office nor the corporal with his four men   13.791871268980671
all the other guests followed   11.446722898657308
there are in this bag three hundred pistoles   10.669406383990678
grimaud translated the question and groslow who was wiping the perspiration from off his forehead answered some full others empty   14.913543962790419
porthos blushed but with pleasure rather than with confusion   12.872293631877113
assuredly said d artagnan i admire this piece of prose   8.753038755571438
acknowledge it beauchamp   9.00096483837337
as the light shone on them a cry was heard from the other two combatants   12.392801577181856
let me do what i please and do you what i do   10.557001737987989
exclaimed planchet here s land in good condition   11.131765115135035
the tumult was indescribable   14.348394023885255
there were then great griefs tears without end and solemn promises to remain faithful all of course on the part of the hostess   12.539488749401123
in the street   16.137828179079044
cried d artagnan raising his head and regaining his self possession   14.385741956949333
they took leave of each other and in ten minutes after having commended his friend to the cares of the hostess and bazin d artagnan was trotting along in the direction of amiens   13.641881618839182
my friend since i killed chatillon adored of the ladies of saint germain i am too great a celebrity not to fear a prison doubly   11.566966426998762
cæs   11.595138865179376
do i wish to know him   10.896288811039586
have you not seen m   7.714159280715188
the fair worshipper touched the great hand of porthos with her delicate fingers smiled made the sign of the cross and left the church   10.877564499649033
he had changed his prison for another that was conveying him he knew not whither   12.578208290644788
athos then shrugged his shoulders and without putting himself in a passion thrashed grimaud   14.606483886938207
and with a rapid change of thought the conversation passed suddenly to another subject   11.370611410982484
heavens   10.167431400962045
a great poet   8.112154584118741
it will soon pass away and as he said so the old man s strength failed him and he fell backwards   16.828159761058384
i am determined to try and be on good terms with everybody at all events said monte cristo   16.122677647934978
you are doubtless provided with pistols gentlemen   6.411475187872504
and in what light did you view the occurrence   14.937144368639041
teresa with the chief s consent did the same   9.449637884264474
the walls were hung with one of the gray papers which economical landlords choose as not likely to show the dirt   7.672554270679617
whose is the ocean upon which we look   6.731080991869174
when i shut my eyes and think i seem to see it all again   10.489661481542345
yes the queen   10.58731421982582
nearly nine years   14.606791687641032
for i only am left and they seek my life   11.043344249681102
then you really consider we shall not be intruding if we pay our respects to him directly   13.891338858270897
farewell monseigneur   7.366781700421391
in order to render an act valid i must be certain of the approbation or disapprobation of my client   7.784781523697384
do you know that i die to morrow at ten o clock   14.036052034633844
cried he and if you have the good fortune to be admitted to her majesty s presence tell her what you have seen   17.228030958013335
take the hundred pistoles my friend   16.97103116267029
and running into a court he disappeared   9.6458801147043
the most profound terror reigned throughout the house   11.489136575623213
gracious heaven we are hesitating   14.502509301110335
no sire for that would only betoken for us seven years of plenty and seven years of scarcity   11.008553177916875
do you still wish to do so   10.90128019230831
that is never leave him alone an instant   18.422463013126745
you a deputy procureur to found an accusation on such bad premises   16.141342436100537
the second reason monsieur the chevalier replied kitty emboldened by the kiss in the first place and still further by the expression of the eyes of the young man is that in love everyone for herself   4.707249047227945
ha ha ha   15.124211275232689
some ministers are fortunate and find out all that they wish to know   12.836532563605385
the president put it to the vote and it was decided that the investigation should take place   9.937139121473294
faria gazed fondly on his noble minded single hearted high principled young friend and read in his countenance ample confirmation of the sincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his purpose   12.92156222889063
and you would be to blame for not assisting him if the young man really needed your help in that quarter but happily for me he can dispense with it   10.791190778331517
i will search for them madame said de winter and doubtless i shall find them   15.5094329807557
he who returned to france with millions had been unable to find the grave of his father who had perished from hunger   10.294815126491937
d artagnan jumped into the saddle then the old companions in arms again shook hands   12.384906252553712
then he looked about for something to pour the soup into   13.718033536298677
now take your courage in both hands and hear what this gentleman in black is going to say about his sovereign with full license and privilege   13.033523471702855
why my dear fellow that on leaving us he lost his way that s all   16.21797804378926
there has been a crime said monte cristo   13.277072173580299
is it to do us some ill turn   18.49233931922036
we traveled five or six leagues serious silent and almost without speaking   13.794492590632007
not personally but from having heard the queen speak of him more than once as a brave and loyal gentleman   12.249003362831402
read that said he when i am gone that you may not be witness of my anger   10.785903517251878
sign the order for the liberation of milady de winter   12.553370763522627
la ramee came into the room   11.594058737280337
i try to be beloved not feared   11.195179351716414
the day has been unfortunate but it is not your fault thank god   5.590642381582704
my father died but i did not die   15.584361194861897
at the extremity of the building on the contrary he saw one of the three windows open   15.035289400550377
during all this time the general on whom they thought to have relied as on a brother manifested evidently signs of discontent and repugnance   13.17554105940994
for like all other recollections in this world these impressions were by degrees effaced   16.231169865103986
no it was somewhere away from here it was i do not know but it appears that this recollection is connected with a lovely sky and some religious fête   4.871648032040164
and yet during the entire repast he seemed to be preoccupied   6.728522481382319
why did you talk of a regiment athos   10.292075853780302
mad you mean don t you   9.798852012694677
ah yes where is my sister   8.091072106781578
and i was ready to strangle you   16.729000285673827
and how much will that cost me monsieur d artagnan   12.322155342391655
d avrigny i would not accuse anyone   11.649791901333536
no violence will be offered to you madame and what happens to you is the result of a very simple measure which we are obliged to adopt with all who land in england   10.368218618640517
oh monsieur said the concierge i shall not have much cause to regret him for he came here but seldom   11.667008196313539
the remaining twenty thousand will bring you in a thousand francs a year   13.131793361376563
cried valentine calling her step mother and running upstairs to meet her   14.392127869968908
it leaves its track   13.938527651389983
no on the honor of an officer   9.292426083145054
let me pass   8.475726978819749
asked mazarin smiling   10.037281651145832
take all needful precautions replied the inspector   18.109088148746803
he must be a vampire   18.113389005906562
40194m business had already been going on for half an hour when he entered   7.0067186002510295
cried aramis and d artagnan at the same time   10.774202297603413
all all all are thine my adored mistress   13.563103041373596
said the swiss who had needed a little time to take in d artagnan s proposal pooh   10.974645641962047
they heard the horsemen pass under the windows   11.82136282467285
and tis a child he loves   15.533838923742568
what is he himself   13.275865957623564
dantès folded his hands raised his eyes to heaven and prayed fervently   13.976767418683266
albert looked at franz like a man who hears a reply he does not understand   13.476806322894
oh as for parricides and such dreadful people as that interposed renée it matters very little what is done to them   13.450462623861998
muttered fernand   10.680610576421335
she cried will you dare to tell me you did not know what you now reproach me with   10.33797070735228
anne of austria sought to read in mazarin s face the occasion of this unexpected visit since the cardinal usually came to her apartment only after every one had retired   16.562948229396326
the queen although already pale became visibly paler and her face was contracted   10.590451273077335
all the rest of the year the city is in that state of dull apathy between life and death which renders it similar to a kind of station between this world and the next a sublime spot a resting place full of poetry and character and at which franz had already halted five or six times and at each time found it more marvellous and striking   13.424548246259084
true excellency that was the crime the real crime for in that i acted like a coward   14.460104711948151
the french army held all between pont a marc as far as valenciennes falling back upon douai   8.862737806932213
on the nineteenth the impromptu army had attempted a sortie more to assure itself and others of its actual existence than with any more serious intention   11.903457538875067
it was elegantly fashioned and worthy of its mistress   12.132244521037274
this sum i have expended upon travelling expenses and and you want money   12.875598860289209
cried la ramee cold sweat upon his brow   14.344219132722863
and moreover it kills said beauchamp   14.194529565365855
by guards brought by the men in black whom you put to flight   9.591160258233778
i would lay a wager he has stolen it   11.772076548572963
cried the monk standing up and lifting his hands to heaven   6.575004637320234
for whom do you take the blue domino at the window with the white curtains   16.293550697006317
the swiss with an air of stupefaction looked at the hostess who turned pale   8.81325171221945
excuse my putting such a question to you   9.857838528041187
and that is why on account of the living mercédès and my deceased father i have sworn to revenge myself on fernand and i have revenged myself   9.043142040255418
but could only trace the acquisition of the property of the cardinal rospigliosi his companion in misfortune   13.04679176035406
monte cristo drew morrel a step or two behind his brother in law   14.790268444267651
such words as those belong to your profession answered caderousse and you do well to repeat them   12.582236701873006
i will introduce you to them   15.029500659853902
i monsieur replied the abbé with an air of surprise i want nothing   8.642063614337108
besides he said a treasure is not a thing we need hurry about   9.641208451362466
replied the secretary resting on the stairs   13.7281954291063
i listen to your eminence with greatest attention replied a female voice which made the musketeer start   8.791942796036208
besides to do all this time is necessary months years   12.34715217045186
if he comes back you will kill him you are so skillful and so brave   8.930998327961166
speak gentlemen speak i am listening   12.404120927005444
my children he said this is the marechal de la meilleraie as to whose intentions you have been deceived and who pledges himself on returning to the louvre to demand of the queen in your name our broussel s release   12.481045926794629
oh you have some design against me reverend sir   13.824013974838692
but at the moment when the cardinal saw his means already bearing fruit and applauded himself for having put it in action an inhabitant of la rochelle who had contrived to pass the royal lines god knows how such was the watchfulness of bassompierre schomberg and the duc d angoulême themselves watched over by the cardinal an inhabitant of la rochelle we say entered the city coming from portsmouth and saying that he had seen a magnificent fleet ready to sail within eight days   10.399763729499393
anne gave a quick glance to mazarin who answered by an almost imperceptible shake of his head   14.735837257654609
but the culprit   12.326885169937666
and the count began his defence i assure you albert in a most eloquent and skilful manner   9.659820443480148
in an instant d artagnan perceived that the best way in which he could act would be to go home and write milady a long letter in which he would confess to her that he and de wardes were up to the present moment absolutely the same and that consequently he could not undertake without committing suicide to kill the comte de wardes   10.929210271412824
you had better see him for his madness is amusing   12.955661522773283
strong thinkest thou   15.156667017076419
said the host in spanish   18.051388917596952
you knew very well that i threw the paper into a corner of the room indeed i fancied i had destroyed it   8.155214374905704
ah yes that is another thing   10.412224672936642
there is a third and the most terrible that is my condition as a mortal being   15.73149525716206
i should be more than glad   10.413956713989315
we have still a word to say to these gentlemen   11.784542725209398
i am her best friend   14.672248760194488
we will see gentlemen we will see   7.526879675490254
cried athos and aramis at once   15.874810058897015
but what did you do yesterday after you left me   9.86594729504715
what do you think of monsieur de tréville telling me when he did me the honor to call upon me yesterday that you associated with the suspected english whom the cardinal protects   12.944187404781287
don t trouble yourself to reveal your good luck   9.72572622302887
you know i am cool enough   11.39249637266747
every niche in the wall held its living statue   12.172369470771784
yes he murmured yes be satisfied   12.74188121030448
there all the items of the day had their source and were so quickly transformed misrepresented metamorphosed some into epigrams some into falsehoods that every one was anxious to pass an hour with little scarron listening to what he said reporting it to others   11.089212389630628
if he send me his poniard it will signify that the emperor s intentions are not favorable and i am to set fire to the powder   18.392609852220517
never had morrel witnessed such an expression never had so terrible an eye flashed before his face never had the genius of terror he had so often seen either on the battle field or in the murderous nights of algeria shaken around him more dreadful fire   8.089444598189473
the bandage fell from his eyes and he understood the joke which he did not think quite so stupid as he had done just before   11.637523456182572
but there he is in the hands of justice   13.523127867008498
of course we hope that you will support the project gutenberg™ mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing project gutenberg™ works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the project gutenberg™ name associated with the work   9.931023425566618
nobody will think of us and for my part i am greatly fatigued   9.953105620703504
felton as pale as death remained some instants with his ear bent and listening   9.421406257559921
stop a moment said monte cristo   12.104081306906565
where is the count   16.406158718339107
for three days the mercury had been five or six degrees below freezing and the steps were covered with ice   15.417360019410777
d artagnan said to him as they descended the staircase of the palais royal   13.85353971024492
he would not come up   6.357406722347775
and they both returned thoughtfully to the procureur s study   11.058941954802282
and be upon your guard before my husband who is rather shrewd notwithstanding his seventy six years   6.990167788823542
of what think you do young and strong men die in prison when they have scarcely numbered their thirtieth year unless it be of imprisonment   10.620784927038587
d artagnan related what had taken place between the cardinal and himself and drawing the commission from his pocket said here my dear athos this naturally belongs to you   12.637217989149244
thus then you will take this bag and you will go away without being too malcontent   11.817886004835618
let me know my crime and the reason why i was condemned   10.040565621163417
dicers oaths   9.827521192932391
plague stifle you and your latin   14.341577136331743
well then we will go into paris   14.328018383624066
they had not long to wait   8.785586451904788
on reflection my dear du vallon it is a great honor for the comte de la fere and gives good reason to hope   11.13648680296677
the captain gave his orders the helm was put up and the boat was soon sailing in the direction of the island   13.434680546992915
i mentioned your diamond then to my adversary who had likewise remarked it   14.531294551148276
as he departed danglars approached and said well it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his landing at porto ferrajo   12.54373782518389
no it was not dead   18.205142793590806
let us hear the means   16.161291575280508
the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of raoul   14.226741563506778
suppose that all the stars had descended from the sky and mingled in a wild dance on the face of the earth   10.933645749233415
you may even say my lord replied athos who stickled for propriety   13.31430400121328
she was born to treasures in comparison with which those recorded in the thousand and one nights would seem but poverty   7.43963777072651
there the great number of inns puzzled them   14.437841537989684
he besought the jailer one day to let him have a companion were it even the mad abbé   13.551323658040241
but the powder flashed in the pan and it did not go off   11.084097081391414
after the two friends had been chatting a few moments a servant from m   15.259417392603773
you are mistaken for i have made a vow never to return to africa   14.979712139730529
that night the adventure at auteuil was talked of everywhere   15.498578486984702
he folded the letter fancifully and took up his pen and wrote to mlle   14.916479995486633
let us charge them answered the gascon   9.952300775360785
the count returned to a small drawing room on the first floor sat down and crossing his legs motioned to the young man to take a seat also   13.179454168451631
well albert inquired franz of his companion are you still disposed to go to the colosseum by the outer wall   17.039846065661806
the fact is said the young man that i should be exceedingly grieved to leave it   8.875926750265396
but consider d artagnan added he in a tone so solemn that it made the young man shudder consider that béthune is a city where the cardinal has given rendezvous to a woman who wherever she goes brings misery with her   12.733904522344764
precisely answered bertuccio   12.998923444620653
you would follow the escort   13.306831492994752
it is possible haydée that so perfect a seclusion though conformable with the habits and customs of the east may not be practicable in paris   10.0512467140113
before daybreak he would awake leave the inn after rigorously paying his bill and reaching the forest he would under pretence of making studies in painting test the hospitality of some peasants procure himself the dress of a woodcutter and a hatchet casting off the lion s skin to assume that of the woodman   10.914101174932949
today he said with an effort today the man who holds the blade of justice must strike wherever there is guilt   14.089009536922852
this promise of an impotent old man was so strange that instead of being the result of the power of his will it might emanate from enfeebled organs   12.55964720878829
as for porthos i believe him to be eternal like god although less patient   7.080608835696748
de boville the confidential clerk of the house of thomson french of rome presented himself at m   15.605252574328688
yes and to the point   14.485362151670827
no stay here and try to make barrois drink the rest of this glass of ether and water   14.840189260444223
i beg a thousand pardons said the count there is nothing the matter but i slipped down and broke one of your panes of glass with my elbow   9.510877805518483
my wish was not to confine myself to domestic cares or the caprices of any man but to be an artist and consequently free in heart in person and in thought   7.803986289069491
said athos to his adversary   18.284248143659873
you will take a biscuit with it will you not   9.137612886342122
how so general   14.656875224737504
my dear friends said d artagnan give your swords to monsieur mouston who will return them to you at the proper time and place and do not forget you are our prisoners   10.580306414165683
at the same moment the faint report of a gun was heard   6.747840410112634
during the daytime valentine s perceptions remained tolerably clear owing to the constant presence of m   10.634060151210058
conjecture soon became certainty for the figure of a man was distinctly visible to franz gradually emerging from the staircase opposite upon which the moon was at that moment pouring a full tide of silvery brightness   15.146281426151429
twelve replied aramis   8.06452425712635
who then has so correctly informed you   13.994127549233454
athos came down   12.343308674735235
it is deeply engraved on my heart and after what you have just said i remember that only   10.607565085002433
he was very taciturn this worthy signor   9.60872104326371
mordaunt tried for a moment to read in the general s face if this was simply a useless question or whether he knew everything   15.426940633530954
bertuccio said he give fifty five thousand francs to monsieur   11.103674909099805
i like everyone   10.747053991752692
then turning to athos he added i seem to miss something here   19.806872922966296
had any one but you been there i don t say d artagnan bowed   14.033657676678171
for the last time where are you going   12.009641513208331
the four young men standing and motionless followed him with their eyes without speaking a single word until he had disappeared   7.314912587499631
returned the prince   14.702414951829583
if her majesty will have faith in my counsels she ought to profit by this event to address at this moment in favor of her august husband the court of france   8.4886845753288
it will be a wiser plan than the first which you proposed   11.016403453013599
for this time i swear to you we shall act like powerful men who know their enemies   18.440353217190125
all the world was ignorant of it   12.06672509956184
she then went out by the same door which she locked so that the duke found himself literally a prisoner   16.87850757028427
in these days the throne is too dangerous a place for me to wish him to retain it   11.414570019815564
or on sardinia   12.004791384998141
where does he live   15.275643986531078
pray was danglars acquainted with fernand   11.718308820295587
now as a half smile was sufficient to awaken the irascibility of the young man the effect produced upon him by this vociferous mirth may be easily imagined   10.1981081022526
and i say and proclaim it publicly that you were justified in revenging yourself on my father and i his son thank you for not using greater severity   8.333755585752026
i had a brother an elder brother who was in the service of the emperor   11.899830160313533
she then slowly raised her head which had resumed its formidable expression of menace and defiance ran to the door to listen looked out of her window and returning to bury herself again in her large armchair she reflected   14.268512656114051
as to the key it had disappeared   13.840856753349826
to a certainty athos said aramis you were meant to be a general of the army   12.168874712638866
in ten minutes they will perhaps be here   14.899341070709976
a great effect upon d artagnan who recognized in her the lady of meung of calais and of dover whom his persecutor the man with the scar had saluted by the name of milady   8.039042206321
but resumed athos i recur to my first proposal   13.562296096270861
kitty entered to bring some sherbet   15.571859193368457
command me madame   16.96875740350014
and the man in the red cloak came forward in his turn   14.861524121689143
yes it s true   16.81621674552444
devil take the vain fellow said d artagnan   10.581513298922305
give it me said andrea and he read by the light of his carriage lamp you know where i live   13.001050986662412
and la ramee resolved never again to disobey these injunctions   11.168285976947868
and with this good feeling drawing near to aramis who was departing without paying any attention to him monsieur said he you will excuse me i hope   15.335695872418246
asked caderousse shuddering   14.608901692588448
mordaunt replied by trying his opponent s weapon with an amount of strength which the gascon was astonished to find in a form apparently so feeble   12.691485893943403
o reilly   15.068628096537163
but there are four against you   11.626782136410661
replied porthos   8.983068616536075
i don t see why   10.90768504811077
for of course you know   7.955812584970852
where is the child   14.227672351088117
the young men burst into a laugh and as may be supposed the affair had no other sequel   14.839746267334974
this very day   7.238405439886007
let your majesty remember said tréville that monsieur athos is the musketeer who in the annoying duel which you are acquainted with had the misfortune to wound monsieur de cahusac so seriously   15.850655666753902
that is all i wished to know said the queen   17.461021187109143
i must be alone   6.210322309795629
the world is not wanting in attractions   12.75262512921024
get me out of this in heaven s name   11.779798656296897
grimaud did not answer but bowed a second time   9.252948755248672
the name of sinbad the sailor as may well be supposed awakened in him a world of recollections as had the name of the count of monte cristo on the previous evening   13.939009315198941
the same evening the grocer or grocers druggist or druggists come and say it was i who sold the arsenic to the gentleman   12.777723654272341
during this time edmond seated on his bed with his head in his hands tried to collect his scattered thoughts   11.659184514108032
i must have wronged you in some way at marseilles   11.658005247289392
but to a certainty it is not for having knowingly at least disobliged monsieur the cardinal   14.82887021367917
it will be time for you to perceive my motive when we have paid our visit to the coadjutor   17.289901699163593
danglars immediately advanced towards the door and opened it   15.067868019492082
unfortunately i have no idea where they are   11.01143571003495
my friends retire   15.138748643245126
i promise you   13.903682723111373
and he showed the cardinal with his finger the four muskets piled near the drum on which were the cards and dice   8.122172325050366
what a devil of a face you have porthos   14.372134802026881
wait an instant said the host   7.394070705386557
watch over him in my absence as much as you possibly can   11.302104246740525
nothing is easier   15.203115120250544
thus if not actually happy yet the days these two unfortunates passed together went quickly   14.071129902828144
i was going to ask you if you had received any news of monsieur franz   13.77878385534165
a key was inserted in the lock of the first door and the creaking of hinges was audible   9.68083535323036
i had forgotten that england was an island and that you were the king of it   11.319834347706326
four hours later he was in neufchâtel   9.773238269351234
the felucca is mined said d artagnan   11.760702853599646
is she there grimaud   11.339034707465759
this burden almost as heavy as a world which i had raised and i had thought to bear to the end was too great for my strength and i was compelled to lay it down in the middle of my career   14.79164481847971
is he still amusing himself in italy   17.068450319938677
non siete spagnuolo he said   9.3735795970442
madame danglars and eugénie were going out at that moment   13.874164137946558
it is true also that as i did not then know his eminence if i had been able to dispense with the visit i should have been enchanted   13.20251998071306
d artagnan and porthos moved so as to plant themselves between the person entering and the cardinal   15.44244105561119
baptistin without answering approached the count and presented the letter   10.294276065401052
besides my lord must remember that monsieur de chavigny is governor of vincennes continued la ramee and that monsieur de chavigny is not friendly to monsieur de beaufort   12.273014962364316
have you the diamond   12.985425075286832
that man wanted aramis to swear that we are not going to the place royale to fight   13.039134313175051
but we we shall remain   16.077357971914562
my father howled aloud plunged his fingers into the holes which the balls had made and tore up one of the planks entire   12.077790773705587
the colosseum franz had so managed his route that during the ride to the colosseum they passed not a single ancient ruin so that no preliminary impression interfered to mitigate the colossal proportions of the gigantic building they came to admire   15.546595421741884
i am of your opinion but find me a better one or give me the means of living   13.90004688739289
why it is poor lubin the lackey of the comte de wardes he whom you took such good care of a month ago at calais on the road to the governor s country house   9.081967521223268
there now said eugénie while i change my costume do you lock the portmanteau   15.895064143956974
however sir said the stranger he has neither fled nor is in prison   11.738599183620304
bonacieux called a long time   10.392993774135027
the musket fell from the soldier s hands who yielded on the instant   15.104794843213273
employ it and you will find that you derive advantage therein   9.27373915060562
there is but one person or rather one cause to whom a man like me can be useful that of the king   18.32192372909047
jump directly down close to monsieur de la fere or on the honor of a gentleman i ll kill you   10.993721291147173
on my word of honor   13.345030238252406
little acquainted as i am with the habits of parisians i should not have thought this the place for such a demand   8.253867152689775
0329m but the strangest part of the story is resumed the abbé that dantès even in his dying moments swore by his crucified redeemer that he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention   8.1851413645929
why do we hate   13.145119618556409
an expression of unspeakable joy lightened the countenance of milady   12.458798318144254
stay my dear count said danglars   11.981444434379924
i remember well said planchet he was fond of drinking in truth he drank but not as other men drink   15.93617367018313
i will break every bone in your body   14.82824815119409
are there then really women who bear the name of haydée anywhere but in byron s poems   11.92954905197955
i believe you are right   11.346174510024746
you know it don t you   7.718046190169388
my poor boy told me yesterday he had got a small case of coffee and another of tobacco for me   12.072596420034053
with the eagle glance of a sailor he had recognized there where another would have seen only a gull hovering over the waves the sail of a sloop which was directed toward the coast of france   1.6712389709592461
it is chilly this evening   13.491900621717736
nothing interrupted the progress of the work except the necessity that each was under of returning to his cell in anticipation of the turnkey s visits   14.943017946576502
no said mazarin again   14.13866825964325
yes said the queen   12.017310448436978
how i have searched for him replied villefort wringing his hands   6.1761274323250435
dantès wished to ascertain whether his neighbor had really ceased to work   7.803827668562405
cucumetto was a cunning fiend and had assumed the form of a brigand instead of a serpent and this look from teresa showed to him that she was a worthy daughter of eve and he returned to the forest pausing several times on his way under the pretext of saluting his protectors   8.505230190974364
as he approached carlini raised his head and the forms of two persons became visible to the old man s eyes   15.590921705983831
i should have liked something more in the manner of the venus of milo or capua   7.550800391174998
milady arose went to the door opened it looked in the corridor and then returned and seated herself close to mme   11.095180218347071
i made a vow at a time when i little thought i should ever be able to accomplish it said the unknown with a singular smile   8.622288179567494
will you go for them yourself or shall you send   13.47094562072985
if you come from ali himself said selim you know what you were charged to remit to me   10.625410140395172
and they finished her off with pistol and dagger   10.122730384671845
yanina   11.517020973520673
and who brought you up   15.15003840715394
and make la ramee eat the pear answered grimaud   4.572473907294565
a quarter to ten   9.982402131876349
the artist who could have depicted the expression of these two countenances would certainly have made of them a beautiful picture   16.904996934261607
pardon my lord said felton stopping the duke   3.580073987417581
without reckoning added monte cristo that he is on the eve of entering into a sort of speculation already in vogue in the united states and in england but quite novel in france   15.315859900145137
give him the despatch raoul   12.610245610288175
and thanking the captain he regained the state cabin where his friends were   7.366145352860949
but after the searching look of the king he encountered the burning eyes of aramis   15.802691353061647
then resting his foot on a small ledge he made a sign to show all was right   12.719359764909324
40054m indeed said albert it is exquisite   10.100065704275378
a giant had seized also aramis s two wrists who struggled in vain to release himself from this formidable grasp   12.26771212315806
as i am only a humble foreigner you must pardon me if i do not understand all the subtle refinements of your language   8.79143133513064
i should avail myself of your offer with pleasure replied the host but unfortunately if i go there it will be in all probability incognito   11.511420853087287
de tréville thought of an expedient which might terminate it quietly   10.073189626620934
cried the steward   17.14096863022377
cloud in front of the pavilion which stands at the corner of the house of m   11.866942456774257
in the name of the queen i forbid you to throw yourself into any peril which is foreign to that of your journey   13.919070753367198
beauchamp solemn transactions should be sanctioned by a witness   7.631975026132855
felton only expressed with regard to the duke the feeling of execration which all the english had declared toward him whom the catholics themselves called the extortioner the pillager the debauchee and whom the puritans styled simply satan   20.06726340523862
danglars immediately recognized him as the man who had called out in such a furious manner put in your head   15.513007401669787
madame de chevreuse uttered a cry of surprise and looked at athos with an expression of astonishment that made the old musketeer smile   15.633421351302756
one instant sir said the man in a gown whom he addressed   13.747385081831535
why as for that i could only know what i was told respecting the merchandise with which the vessel was laden   11.37232663430379
debray shrugged his shoulders   12.532669391998619
and to you also m   13.442903390086347
well then with well acted good humor i allow grimaud but no one else   18.686906920353724
but i feel assured it will not be for long added she   13.408865543961996
returned the cardinal   16.710986004582118
coquenard filled her own plate and distributed the crusts without soup to the impatient clerks   13.030099821318416
demanded the swiss stamping violently like a man who begins to be seriously angry   14.615613515347711
like monsieur pixérécourt   10.333815399816624
but let s get back to the subject   7.886414441992109
well then said cromwell i promise as far as lies in my power to grant your request   10.955863264771976
franz d épinay i am happy to be able to mention this in mademoiselle de villefort s absence and will conduct myself toward him so as to compel him to challenge me   9.144195036092302
you speak of him very much at your ease aramis   11.727953973162904
why then are you about to betray it to me   16.552682388918484
at the moment he passed through the gateway into the street the wind blew open the cloak in which he was wrapped although it was in the month of august and lifted his hat which the traveler seized with his hand the moment it had left his head pulling it eagerly over his eyes   13.216508101253766
that gentleman is the abbé d herblay replied he   13.092080392661803
anybody may possess a five franc piece   11.030693098564205
you had no pity for that youthfulness that beauty that weakness   5.6697925503120405
and the goldsmith   10.870656932156347
grimaud wishing to relieve him advanced his hand toward the hilt of the dagger   11.26954101435496
noirtier was sitting in an armchair which moved upon casters in which he was wheeled into the room in the morning and in the same way drawn out again at night   15.930084166028731
he regrets the devil   13.179180116719413
his name is said she in her turn   12.458924675033948
sketches torn from the album of dauzats travels in the east that had been made in a few seconds on the saddle of a camel or beneath the dome of a mosque in a word all that modern art can give in exchange and as recompense for the art lost and gone with ages long since past   15.334419493444287
as for patience i consider that i have abundantly exercised that in beginning every morning the task of the night before and every night renewing the task of the day   12.079602313090351
what does the executioner   12.172118056859093
stay said monte cristo here in this very spot and he stamped upon the ground i had the earth dug up and fresh mould put in to refresh these old trees   10.9135740511119
noirtier looked at valentine with an expression so full of grief that she arrested the departure of the notary   15.657149938816696
i was not in voice   16.16361162356471
it is good advice said athos and if the king will do one of us the honor we shall be truly grateful to him   6.066304974474923
and pardieu i picked up two that i sold for ten pistoles each   9.695620299548636
since that time monsieur nobody entered his chamber but his servant   13.075968419134991
when you went to fetch your wife from the louvre did you always return directly home   13.127367118157293
all these trees great or small were turned in the direction to which the mistral blows one of the three curses of provence the others being the durance and the parliament   12.708345518100673
milady read in his eyes love   13.797801740809176
because i would not annoy my little benedetto   9.339734509195672
you whom i expected last you arrive at five minutes to ten when the time fixed was half past   10.727636292972042
i supported myself by a chair feeling that i was about to fall but this support was soon insufficient on account of my weak arms   13.142502491772436
sire said villefort the suddenness of this event must prove to your majesty that the issue is in the hands of providence   14.245983141905203
porthos was of the opinion that he should give him a good thrashing first   13.892023286845935
you are aware sir of the deplorable condition of my husband s father   13.799492392975921
athos insults us   11.88360913718388
marie michon oh what do i not owe you aramis   15.091878491054047
i have already recorded sentence of death five or six times against the movers of political conspiracies and who can say how many daggers may be ready sharpened and only waiting a favorable opportunity to be buried in my heart   15.555699753634329
i know that name a son of monsieur de broussel s servant and a lad that i promise you in a revolt will not give away his share to the dogs   10.555726123669984
she has answered you   12.554277135756886
do you believe you have anything to do   20.360703408107405
and the baron pointed with a slow and accusing gesture to the left shoulder of milady which he almost touched with his finger   9.301265494707803
the same evening andrea was incarcerated in the conciergerie   13.125389770327592
cried he raising his head with quick anxiety   11.638249652512986
and truly to speak such words to me would be on the part of your majesty too great an ingratitude   12.055021934292554
we are alone sir said buckingham   16.71451790204116
i gave her my wealth i gave her my name   8.792088611159167
in the most conspicuous part of the salon was another portrait   14.861809641505715
we say corroborated because the brigadier was too experienced to be convinced by a single proof   10.025367689352628
and the consequence   9.802939791235675
morcerf   13.336211313284274
now let me try on the dress of yonder chap   13.84715413706416
of what else do you imagine he would speak to me   6.653364542330155
great personages may have had a hand in what you have seen and if talked about the evil would only recoil upon us   15.2080239314975
no i did not say i was a stranger to you   9.596441426838467
a very imposing escort awaited them without the gates   15.06274602558721
the disappearance of mazarin was not as yet generally known   12.125852955052702
but before you leave france my dear father i hope you will put me in possession of the documents which will be necessary to prove my descent   12.839367858613493
the poor young woman could not possibly suspect what frightful cruelty was behind the rampart of that pure brow behind those brilliant eyes in which she read nothing but interest and compassion   16.259762322164264
and this remark proves that you have deeply considered the subject   11.460662205187456
and i am delighted to see that the present government have adopted this salutary principle with all its pristine vigor   12.338951095147808
he must be about twenty three years of age said athos in a low tone   11.357147200650337
at length a hand and an arm surpassingly beautiful in their form and whiteness glided through the tapestry   12.896466422831597
de villefort and his father exchanged looks   12.752732056008643
what end would that answer   12.655551741833793
shall i assist you in repairing your negligence   9.709603629939885
had surrounded himself this second or rather this first king of france became desirous that he too should have his guard   12.615473244355345
everywhere were swords pistols cuirasses and arquebuses and it was plain that as soon as his gout was better monsieur de bouillon would give a pretty tangle to the enemies of the parliament to unravel   15.671357238801512
asked anne of austria after a moment s silence   10.185558360504617
then what do you fear my lord   13.757259712780847
and above all mademoiselle danglars   3.173765764659491
it seems to me rather reassuring than otherwise   10.241245331970708
he almost believed in the crime of de wardes   10.443316555865438
but i am ignorant   11.588842433869704
then sir since you are so liberal i ought to offer you something   11.991400614488768
athos did not even turn his head   6.153786408046267
the officer entered a large fat man with an open physiognomy   7.804157391134375
i will swear to you by my soul s salvation my faith as a christian i have told everything to you as it occurred and as the recording angel will tell it to the ear of god at the day of the last judgment   17.05152371048238
the order is strict and must be put into execution this instant   14.398970881101246
said aramis hastening forward   15.89987674866143
and he conducted them to mousqueton who freely distributed the trusses at the rate of a louis apiece   11.297886861034343
we have a second bed in the adjoining room   13.11204256542121
and how do you know her   8.552176829319265
perhaps one of those beloved ones he had so often thought of was thinking of him and striving to diminish the distance that separated them   11.890299999476758
exclaimed the man half suffocated   13.525960566945301
happily he had time to reach a closet hidden behind tapestry in which he was secreted by an old woman together with his brother the bishop of meaux   10.899469767035981
i confess it openly   6.567375570894509
soon the water rushes out of the scupper holes like a whale spouting the vessel gives a last groan spins round and round and disappears forming a vast whirlpool in the ocean and then all is over so that in five minutes nothing but the eye of god can see the vessel where she lies at the bottom of the sea   14.956925566629703
nay i flatter myself that there can be no doubt of it replied the cavalier in the cloak   9.286504605426543
he inquired after the count with his usual familiarity and ascending lightly to the first story met him at the top of the stairs   13.268271921204684
nothing replied the count   10.099350590072323
you know there s only one way of saying things so i went in and said my lord we were not the strongest party   9.484663919771126
why we can not tell   8.834241691244321
de villefort or rather mademoiselle valentine or still rather our friend franz inherits a magnificent fortune amounting i believe to 80 000 livres per annum   13.490342796863864
more likely he has been speculating on the bourse and has lost money   11.476856699751085
they killed six thousand angevins in sicily because they pronounced italian badly   8.914033320466377
he made a sign to ali not to lose sight of the man in the street and turned to the one in the dressing room   12.179223902313703
and to give more weight to his protestation caderousse advanced another step towards the abbé who remained motionless in his place as calm as ever and pursuing his interrogation   13.42786011459084
not because i have the least desire to learn anything you may please to conceal from me but simply that if through your assistance i could distribute the legacy according to the wishes of the testator why so much the better that is all   11.666939125423275
excellency the evil has arrived   12.153729432902965
but when that was done why did not his son come and throw himself into his arms   17.221543468976925
it was an illuminated book with beautiful gothic characters and so weighty with gold that a servant always carried it before the cardinal on days of great solemnity   12.73414612810165
the dead once buried in their graves rise no more   10.729707940896244
will our help come from you   13.676641978132242
and as you say i am myself agitated feverish and out of sorts   9.581918668898332
unfold your plan my lord and we will see   8.838798898973218
private misfortunes must never be allowed to interfere with business   9.077357468359647
i was very wrong my lord for in giving it to you i acted in opposition to my orders   14.407485059840706
30325m no she replied it is for my poor grandmother   7.372610837568455
proceed said the president   16.04938824238527
porthos yielding to the pressure of the arm of the procurator s wife as a bark yields to the rudder arrived at the cloister st   6.747604963457425
i wished to inquire why you stopped at the island of elba   16.594833156520874
so can i said the englishman and he laughed too   14.038840492768806
why do you mention my father   14.832162989026854
not on your own account surely replied monte cristo   5.982595688083687
roman bandits chapter 34   9.496464642245867
bravo said beauchamp to albert   9.863340552715263
he found him completely surrounded   7.86211850446041
twice the count left the ranks to see whether the object of his interest had any concealed weapon beneath his clothes   14.052694067330702
arrived at the bastion the four friends turned round   9.315668189144958
albert was punctual   13.253128632193622
you remain minister   10.899183879484212
the gate of the enclosure was shut   13.671122713910282
the noise of the door did not awaken her and monte cristo gazed at her with affectionate regret   7.0261654343026825
as soon as she saw him she seized his hand   12.668064227413378
the recompense will exceed your expectations   10.510337811958902
yes as an augustine monk   15.226430288412718
oh god thou hast preserved my memory   12.826631720593316
besides is he not a butcher s son   5.16958583270211
the man resembled aramis so much as to be mistaken for him   8.117438496212525
why they may amount to said porthos who preferred discussing the total to taking them one by one   12.426723026014699
a general murmur of approbation showed that the narrator had faithfully detailed their misfortunes and sufferings   14.148848695867352
then putting the 4 500 francs into the hands of the astonished dealer i proceeded to fulfil my intention of passing the night in riding in the champs élysées   16.036772183652268
valentine chapter 103   9.801214379285948
replied athos smiling   14.478848527987953
the first thing that met his eye was the meridian drawn by the abbé on the wall by which he calculated the time   10.415615225620991
we were in a place where it was not very cold replied porthos giving his mustache a twist which was peculiar to him   12.235940733374317
or at least he has not long been so for he was pacing up and down for more than two hours after he left the king and the sound of his footsteps has only ceased during the last ten minutes   12.564850841151495
grimaud signified that he was not mistaken   10.694209171756881
he found with pleasure that his captivity had taken away nothing of his power and that he was still master of that element on whose bosom he had so often sported as a boy   9.80451205397782
to horse porthos   12.475236339566226
chapter 82   9.055432341617783
with 200 francs we can reach marseilles   14.983723479600865
the defiles of the chamber of aramis were as well guarded as the gardens of armida   12.470148877398875
while doing so i had leaned against a laburnum   10.382386262432794
d artagnan did reflect and resolved to thrash planchet provisionally   10.83357325443411
during the whole time he was speaking the queen appeared to be well pleased with the coadjutor s harangue   15.527210020197485
i have pursued it for six years only   19.71389232338439
i misunderstood you   9.415883916709374
you thought to escape my munificence but it is in vain   10.149073727606375
the hand of god caderousse continued to call piteously help reverend sir help   11.261987632009223
say absurd since it has become useless   9.758991553078614
you must manage it all   14.180164702882141
you told me that the letter was from the marechal de grammont henrietta   16.08182235821805
before you leave me tell me what you are going to do maximilian   10.631487739087058
the queen on whom he threw himself as sole support seemed to him now not much to be relied upon   7.67742150804702
it shall take but a quarter of an hour i answer for everything madame   10.573244771098329
well have you made up your mind to this journey   10.129772532507884
the valet then left the room   10.590681100036399
in the meantime d artagnan took his way toward the rue tiquetonne where he lived at the hotel de la chevrette   9.834662089318817
we shall try to persuade the great d aguesseau 11 m   15.553873599898218
grimaud finding that his master had been arrested fell back into the ranks near aramis without saying a word and as if nothing had happened   11.67613757113896
that would save us all   13.701829813101575
in the meantime the ferryboat had floated away carried down by the stream and the shrieks of those whom it contained resounded more and more   14.257571810809864
d artagnan grew pale with rage   14.875247545778972
a letter from the king perhaps   8.727389929159209
inquired the old man   9.65352087861107
but that s more than dislike that s ingratitude   20.644501665684324
morrel s   12.780648871718263
therefore i will retire for i can not endure the sight of blood   14.18080662730909
there said the king looking at a clock there now as it is half past eight you may retire   16.773174252892755
if you speak a single word to anyone before going aboard ship my sergeant will blow your brains out   12.339766591062599
she is my betrothed   10.140536443815417
who is this athos   9.856308637495486
at ten o clock in the morning the sieur de la coste ensign in the king s guards followed by two officers and several archers of that body came to the city registrar named clement and demanded of him all the keys of the rooms and offices of the hôtel   12.06570655924031
he stated his scruples and the difficulties of the case   14.786531987335696
they have eyes repeated milady with an accent of indescribable grief but they see not   15.970019327938223
where is the hay dealer s   8.99699189076155
come hither monsieur   15.658267597829084
five minutes after andrea left the hotel completely disguised took a cabriolet and ordered the driver to take him to the cheval rouge at picpus   11.854765946518336
planchet said d artagnan to his domestic who just then insinuated his head through the half open door in order to catch some fragments of the conversation go down to my landlord monsieur bonacieux and ask him to send me half a dozen bottles of beaugency wine   13.07723088382551
well then signor aladdin replied the singular amphitryon you heard our repast announced will you now take the trouble to enter the dining room your humble servant going first to show the way   13.32857819447951
he got in followed by two soldiers and the magistrate and the vehicle drove off towards marseilles   14.7468477764265
and if we lay hands on them his eminence may be assured they will be reconducted to paris under a good escort   15.546302498077512
did he come to arrest me   11.089589135693567
it is not usual with us corrupted wretches of civilization to find gentlemen like yourself possessors as you are of immense fortune at least so it is said and i beg you to observe that i do not inquire i merely repeat   6.155457137935109
yes doctor cried villefort clutching his hair yes   11.955910499051718
when the chancellor appeared the king had already gone out by another door   11.522970620374624
one day he stopped all at once and exclaimed ah if there were no sentinel   11.199074334166246
at which the cries of the multitude were renewed   9.424369815778725
and where was this letter written   12.26667264949253
never mind continued the man in the cloak   16.76760086931113
and this constitutes the zenith of human fortune   13.342489698725831
there is in the world then one man who having the power to ask asks nothing   10.871702289210361
at length franz arrived at the word myself   10.891888330072373
andrea had not spoken without cause of the pretty rooms looking out upon the court of the bell hotel which with its triple galleries like those of a theatre with the jessamine and clematis twining round the light columns forms one of the prettiest entrances to an inn that you can imagine   13.972841096009523
if monsieur aramis hesitates to come he said tell him i am from tours   16.415582461870244
the general has just blown his brains out replied monte cristo with great coolness   10.916497982485097
and besides she added her eyes troubled and moistened with tears wait wait fernand   17.23843163361792
how much have we louise   14.844674405469615
cried the young man and set off at full gallop   14.79263522328349
when they opened the window they saw the poor lad lying senseless with his head split by a blow with a pitchfork   10.630523508117815
the landlord sent out for every description of garment as if he wanted to fit up his wardrobe   9.085653083265784
returned the influence of m   4.56338983236723
it is to be found for the searching   13.323877569611316
we must be discreet with this sort of letters   8.16695885349948
every means had been employed in vain to restore the use of his limbs   9.57896403768904
it is one of the most desirable connections which could possibly be formed   10.645806010237969
indeed the carriage crossed the fatal spot without stopping   9.816017943239954
he muttered   16.266268845606373
then have a care i repeat for you seek to persuade me and if you succeed i should lose my reason for i should hope that i could again behold valentine   8.962374165250377
no my prince replied mazarin the third bed is intended for your highness   5.09473237751199
but he leaves his room he plays at tennis at the mall   15.156908564821942
good said comminges   16.231865594857382
and signor luigi vampa such was the name of the chief of these bandits would have scrupulously kept his word   14.112532272629668
he drew near with his sweet smile and but for his paleness one might have thought him in his usual happy mood   5.910431722211578
what are they your excellency   8.015599583386532
this is a gloomy introduction if i may judge from your pallor and shuddering morrel   14.489157067353547
porthos would have given ten years of his life to possess this sword   14.87018429675428
but you must swear solemnly that i shall never have reason to repent my recommendation   13.063439608392912
what s the use of mentioning that   9.311268545720294
villefort   15.549618277082038
it is a long time since that has happened   14.55372769045583
asked villefort with a last effort   11.333366142439502
but d artagnan took very little heed of the eloquent discourse of m   11.55057582802257
but to avoid risk put the pistols in the holsters   22.019615827934814
has he gone intending not to return   12.501191229891361
he not only gets used to his captivity but jokes about it   11.317685471685003
you shall know it now then said monte cristo listening   12.98335195319612
for his death   18.289420881423066
alas poor albert   14.298002741345284
he used to weep he now laughs   13.832052480497303
are there any stories connected with this prison besides the one relating to the poisoning of mirabeau   16.40565740398221
what is that stupid fellow troubling himself about   14.98639045415271
but the report was already in circulation that dantès was arrested as a bonapartist agent   10.823446064109536
so then so then pack up our luggage planchet and let us be off   20.306968564186896
the most perfect tranquillity was restored and the vigilance of the custom house officers was redoubled and their strictness was increased at this time in consequence of the fair at beaucaire   12.184051890097411
the young priest was condemned to ten years of imprisonment and to be branded   16.06878797946607
you had never anything to complain of   10.592255619845979
go sir go   17.336128346386996
it is enough   13.540335476347021
and now how are you feeling   15.755867944384963
but at the same time my boy i am as much obliged by your offer as if i took advantage of it   11.55041225352211
thanks planchet thanks   14.910493909009386
will your eminence be angry if i read you a lesson   15.623758267476216
dear friend to an englishman interrupted athos   15.638281398449633
enough blood has flowed enough misery has humbled a town deprived of its king and of justice   13.059798620453202
my dear cousin   12.009258117923547
you have said that my son should live have you not   14.976700048540982
see i send a ball into the moat   11.877815853836875
will you this ring would certainly only recall very bitter remembrances   11.200372440610879
felton began to descend the ladder slowly step by step   10.368584705221007
i am a physiognomist i assure you   7.481586574894961
inquired the bandits with astonishment   8.908039703653344
and that demand for his services on the part of mazarin seemed to him an auspicious sign   8.616949084818632
the smugglers dantès had not been a day on board before he had a very clear idea of the men with whom his lot had been cast   12.016949707040245
a circle was formed around them   15.457718400974766
they were brought to him   9.020487852082681
if i had had the honor of being your friend instead of only having the happiness of being under an obligation to you i should insist on detaining you to dinner and not allow myself to be daunted by a first refusal   15.978634635532027
god knows i would prefer sacrificing the whole so that it would obtain me a happy and affectionate home   16.746475485154328
it must be farther off than even that   14.590230749772054
and you have doubtless brought all your papers with you   10.128614655340575
what brings you to paris   11.70080790217168
i wish my life to be free and open   12.111416211648956
he saw her get into her carriage and heard her order the coachman to drive to st   12.357608781840979
it is you mordaunt he said   9.618162943140744
i will expose all   13.302195142922312
tréville added the king in a low voice as the others were retiring as you have no room in the musketeers and as we have besides decided that a novitiate is necessary before entering that corps place this young man in the company of the guards of monsieur dessessart your brother in law   9.506414135600169
then said mordaunt your honor gives me my liberty for to night   11.766096078742658
i would follow him to hell and that is saying not a little as i believe him entirely capable of the descent   13.888937615797747
the trial chapter 87   13.985613492779427
oh this is too much cried milady   18.597568132825458
a quarrel   8.72811766673624
scarcely had he entered the hall when he glanced at the whole body of magistrates and assistants   12.319644685454037
twice you have pronounced that word   5.741216990497958
where was i then   9.807108087498607
the queen stretched out her hand seized the ring pressed it convulsively to her lips and without being able to breathe a sigh to give vent to a sob she extended her arms became deadly pale and fell senseless in the arms of her attendants and her daughter   4.513187043584752
well said château renaud i was not wrong just now then when i said that houses had souls and faces like men and that their exteriors carried the impress of their characters   6.297342181553139
why the devil does that foolish girl who pretends to wish to speak to me not come into my study   13.002941544590993
well look through this opening and you will see the beautiful new horse which i rode here   18.595021531299196
i am sure your majesty will not commit such an act of imprudence first because it would be useless and would produce the most disastrous results   14.279559225214207
grimaud is the man whom a friend has sent to second me in everything   15.493945320179295
had he but waited till today the price would have fallen to 205 and instead of gaining 300 000 francs he would have lost 20 or 25 000   10.052811954170243
you are lucky   15.254884654909315
don t you think monsieur that woods are like churches   11.074830967070264
buckingham pressed his lips passionately to that beautiful hand and then rising said within six months if i am not dead i shall have seen you again madame even if i have to overturn the world   10.789297447263035
i will give instructions to everyone and you m   13.669212684974907
his talent   13.317072796176152
said mercédès coloring   15.476046495712582
are you not the marquis bartolomeo cavalcanti   11.767210258922663
in that respect my dear friend it s delightful   5.8115270412387945
had old æolus appeared at this moment he would have been proclaimed king of the moccoli and aquilo the heir presumptive to the throne   12.823012699648338
he reached the instrument he had placed on the stand touched a spring and immediately a pale light just bright enough to render objects distinct was reflected on his hands and countenance   8.982251321430955
on the contrary the meaning of m   10.49575301860869
resumed morrel   12.434785241955108
behind the grating of the room into which andrea had been led he saw while his eyes dilated with surprise the dark and intelligent face of m   13.61272839663863
choose for yourself in my stables the horse you like best   8.90493403854203
is it permissible   12.841306916231268
with these words he went stealthily to the door which he closed and by way of still greater precaution bolted and barred it as he was accustomed to do at night   12.58553263780006
yes that poor duchess   17.06053880364129
the receipt of m   8.387007496095789
but i am not a foreigner sir said she with an accent as pure as ever was heard between portsmouth and manchester   11.867576895130052
he seemed like one of the ancient titans who uprooted the mountains to hurl against the father of the gods   16.048826879627658
albert listened trembling now with hope then with anger and then again with shame for from beauchamp s confidence he knew his father was guilty and he asked himself how since he was guilty he could prove his innocence   13.684536366358845
remember we are waiting for our turns   9.221890770776696
and all the nobility of france would demand an explanation of your disappearance   15.591715121271003
i have chosen the drawing room sir as our place of meeting in order to avoid the disagreeable impressions and influences of a banker s study   4.6628560085325095
oh you do not understand me   10.613884106782194
de bracieux de pierrefonds added porthos   10.503417665992815
go on then for i see i shall not get to the chamber this morning and i must make up for it   11.37057033174504
oh yes i know what sort of vengeance   14.033879202764554
good heavens madame said the count are you ill or is it the heat of the room that affects you   9.8817355265913
i heard the noise he made in loading his pistols and his servant in loading his musketoon   6.546178055943329
the road selected was a continuation of the via sistina   9.63364376899229
it s a piece of good fortune sent from heaven said athos evidently much relieved   13.770058354810521
well then all is settled   11.618782200113198
grimaud trembled and stared at the dying man in a dull and leaden manner   12.326725583970717
well it has happened to me to do so in our blaisois forests and i remember that the first time i encountered one with its eyes fixed upon me curled up swinging its head and pointing its tongue i remained fixed pale and as though fascinated until the moment when the comte de la fere your father   15.59025525038425
morrel said he we were somewhere between cape blanc and cape boyador sailing with a fair breeze south south west after a week s calm when captain gaumard comes up to me i was at the helm i should tell you and says penelon what do you think of those clouds coming up over there   7.18002092767915
in fact he could say these two children of a cruel and persecuting king who have inherited the vices of their father which i alone could perceive in their juvenile propensities these two children are impediments in my way of promoting the happiness of the english people whose unhappiness they the children would infallibly have caused   8.5908793898028
0081m you see said danglars addressing caderousse the turn things have taken   14.059894116803994
the old man wrapped in a large black doublet in which the whole of his slender body was concealed was brisk and dry   13.776387004966018
he talked for the pleasure of talking and for the pleasure of hearing himself talk   14.27716150892073
only i believed that monsieur had but one horse in the guard stables   11.107404601469769
they arrived at the appointed spot   16.663799743176654
let our readers reassure themselves   9.252387468389339
de villefort was therefore obliged to request m   17.618517884960763
and her style of beauty struck him more forcibly from its being totally different from that of the southern countries in which d artagnan had hitherto resided   14.949397032482633
i am brutal i not only allow it but boast of it   9.975161626432088
at arles i was again placed on my litter and continued my journey to marseilles   11.067502923239369
but he will not avow it   19.13025649481908
ay and a very fine one   13.726303725518186
however i swear i was not guilty i swear it by the queen looked around her for some sacred object by which she could swear and taking out of a cupboard hidden in the tapestry a small coffer of rosewood set in silver and laying it on the altar i swear she said by these sacred relics that buckingham was not my lover   16.052858708286305
once at the house of monsieur créquy   15.21367014808836
sir replied anne with a degree of haughtiness which to certain persons became impertinence this is the reason that you trouble me in the midst of so many absorbing concerns   15.681641463838465
i was sure of it the cursed letter   8.198289411467368
danglars would give double that sum to attain the same end   8.545951984211012
and he made a sign to franz to take what he pleased   7.4589919885847715
for he thought this death would cause the wedding to be postponed indefinitely   13.741327709189731
some one drew near   12.53339008300891
having thus spoken d artagnan cleared the ditch by the roadside and crossed the plain so as to wind around the village   12.289421743600567
how is monsieur bernajoux your esquire s relative   16.163747667793288
the woman s lips seemed to move as though she were talking   10.933882545490356
if on the contrary he appeared his noble countenance his brilliant eyes his amiability his polite attention even towards madame danglars soon dispelled every impression of fear   10.613909038254087
a desert would not have been amiss said porthos   15.368143092922773
eh monsieur eh   16.124734284118986
order was re established in the hall except that a few people still moved about and whispered to one another   16.986752738694534
and the wretched family departed leaving a cloud of sadness hanging over the rest of the evening   9.379945411245078
i think it is a fine country said haydée but i see france as it really is because i look on it with the eyes of a woman   11.457079068596792
it was dark but at eleven o clock the moon rose in the midst of the ocean whose every wave she silvered and then ascending high played in floods of pale light on the rocky hills of this second pelion   11.90702622201902
by heaven m   7.004503482146005
20356m adieu   11.916156521392994
but it seems that it is intended to affect me personally   5.67410429228695
the clock struck half past six and a lady was announced a friend of madame de villefort who came to dine with her   12.642552951653306
well captain he endeavored twice to get up and fell again twice   5.817306336933852
i like to hear him talk said athos   10.275586518771583
or a tiger   17.94152551087805
caderousse approached him just as danglars whom fernand seemed most anxious to avoid had joined him in a corner of the room   12.569558477514601
some time after our rupture you wished to study music under the celebrated baritone who made such a successful appearance at the théâtre italien   11.433360698910688
the cable which tied the boat to the vessel was then seen plainly rising out of the sea   14.77586221478797
pity me   11.634682300606396
d artagnan fell at the feet of the cardinal   16.96406809319324
lord de winter is only her brother in law   11.47963441796055
my lord said athos we are satisfied   6.273274333672072
asked the jeweller   16.497086188416283
felton was then mistrusted   6.929373775321555
today i am at your service replied the count   11.678779461767625
he could distinguish amid the perfumes of the roses and heliotropes in the flower stands the sharp and fragrant odor of volatile salts and he noticed in one of the chased cups on the mantle piece the countess s smelling bottle taken from its shagreen case and exclaimed in a tone of uneasiness as he entered my dear mother have you been ill during my absence   10.365625350136726
multitudinously is good said château renaud   12.953712385928874
but if he should return   6.8663855901123885
then turning to monte cristo he said prince cavalcanti is a charming young man is he not   10.052152280347949
respond to her call   7.815037241835459
germain and asked the cardinal to order him an escort of only twenty musketeers   10.762601538773133
i will aid you in many ways but without attaching you to my person   10.547156161361885
de tréville was surprised to the greatest degree   13.183626685499744
my dear fellow replied porthos to be candid with you i am not happy   13.009154029985616
there are several branches of the d artagnans at tarbes and in its environs said the cardinal   9.173694762943057
so far i have appeared to answer his purpose   13.298940575685366
and what excuse did she give you for entering all alone   12.24207428560662
so long   8.542535440235328
he cared little for that mene mene tekel upharsin which appeared suddenly in letters of blood upon the wall   8.72072054903752
hold your tongue you fool   12.41130381609024
he s one of my most intimate friends   12.0327575006052
before a siege   10.25496204759511
the old man made a sign that he entertained no doubt upon the subject   18.43646150675864
of fifty large sausages suspended from the joists scarcely ten remained   7.359991154520403
so soon as another is admitted into our secret an inquest will become necessary   9.100601413614157
mademoiselle eugénie said the maid retired to her apartment with mademoiselle d armilly   13.62546218071098
did edmond make you his heir   11.127833589748787
bassompierre took up his quarters on the north of the city between leu and dompierre   11.38268485174084
said renée becoming quite pale   15.719493254143053
then rising he went out and meeting a servant on the stairs he asked where is m   10.963745855512995
it will suffice then to tell them that at the moment at which discouraged by so many fruitless investigations we were about to abandon our search we at length found guided by the counsels of our illustrious friend paulin paris a manuscript in folio endorsed 4772 or 4773 we do not recollect which having for title memoirs of the comte de la fère touching some events which passed in france toward the end of the reign of king louis xiii   10.525749346049167
one would have said andrea anticipated his companion s words so did his eye flash like lightning but it was but for a moment   11.276631784986456
noirtier stretching himself out at his ease in the chair   16.837271439132493
what you say interests me to the greatest degree   9.49665499847143
though i might have known him by his skill and coolness in danger   9.361900850935577
she would have cut your throat and after that everybody else s   14.104958971228978
the queen fixed her eyes upon the carriage they had left and seeing that it was empty she said but where is madame de longueville   10.405387891267356
he had scarcely finished this soliloquy before the prisoner arrived   15.830782784338748
said felton i can do but one thing which is to pity you if you prove to me you are a victim   10.024249262617134
bertuccio raised the lantern and obeyed   6.3158729801860805
d artagnan said porthos i must out with it at once for i can t keep to myself anything i have against you   14.098482228673095
you will say i apologized to the count of monte cristo   13.579842450412087
have you not received any   14.174602485000662
yes but monsieur groslow is not a captain of the ordinary kind   15.694134451091248
this treasure exists dantès and if i have not been allowed to possess it you will   10.510348055843831
porthos exclaimed   12.387274594246403
aramis determined to obtain from the bishop through fear or by persuasion consent that he should enter in the bishop s place and clad in his sacerdotal robes the prison at whitehall   10.915087569877546
all eyes were fixed on the door and i said beauchamp shared the general expectation and anxiety   13.737698345934458
exclaimed dantès   14.140337787566859
and d artagnan presented to the cardinal the precious piece of paper which athos had forced from milady and which he had given to d artagnan to serve him as a safeguard   12.862833125070491
lord de winter arrived at the appointed time   16.332497286511668
which i believe does not contain one   14.906477323076361
but i am not surprised   8.140716901091025
kitty said he i will read to the bottom of your soul whenever you like   7.996930500062226
that ring comes from milady   13.177012119203734
or by athos a noble and disinterested man but blase who desiring nothing further for himself doesn t sympathize with the desires of others   9.261929182741081
in an instant a space three feet long by two feet broad was cleared and dantès could see an oaken coffer bound with cut steel   18.113658227111774
well then my lord they must be found   16.438334407128938
and madame de villefort   16.021452877039568
i am weeping with joy   9.826302731263867
d artagnan and the englishman d artagnan followed milady without being perceived by her   12.435159989717775
but every time he had seen him he had remarked a deep sadness imprinted on his countenance   12.27665188571832
we did better than that sir said the old sailor respectfully   16.135298955390336
i am a priest resumed aramis   10.379843867012113
i would stab the man but the woman told me that if any misfortune happened to her betrothed she would kill herself   13.06690471823361
carriages horses guards and perhaps even the prisoner were about to be torn to shreds when all at once a voice well known to raoul was heard and suddenly a great sword glittered in the air   13.009536892305084
should you like a letter to the minister that they might explain to you no said monte cristo   10.73945286443032
who ever heard of such an occurrence as this   11.041152474191588
and then i have thought that considering three months lodging about which i have said nothing yes yes   10.469067169847742
how many did we crush under the wall   9.546710909619822
all i have is at his service   14.720926625393854
the president himself advanced to place a seat for the young lady   8.468194991610149
the major made a wise choice   13.798666918659695
but no his heart is beating   13.409565074842968
nature according to her way had made no deviation in the path he had marked out for himself   10.504329616264915
no i think not for he ordered his breakfast at ten o clock   11.13169336890802
that man was he who had pursued me during a whole year who had vowed my dishonor and who by the first words that issued from his mouth gave me to understand he had accomplished it the preceding night   8.144888843746365
i say i am entirely of porthos s opinion replied aramis   14.390201088397035
see said she if everything does not second us   11.337194435847314
a garden with two acres of land   10.01804169913129
the comte de wardes of thursday and the d artagnan of today are the same person   14.672697269979727
in the corso   13.671669220486496
listen to me said the countess and do not be so very headstrong   6.223065177712424
sir said madame de saint méran without using any circumlocution and as if fearing she had no time to lose you wrote to me concerning the marriage of this child   6.967010177479903
unfortunately porthos knew nothing of the life of his silent companion but what revealed itself   11.070453291560405
gentlemen your hands   8.478147273454343
madame de villefort received them with equal solemnity   10.519537499090978
gervais replied d artagnan from behind which the rochellais annoyed our workmen   11.890157366034812
asked the postilion in italian   6.812560815759132
he preserved this opinion even after the feast with the remnants of which he repaired his own long abstinence   12.093788114653085
at this moment the landlord came in   7.816810203535917
but what ails you   8.847080158357777
the duke was in the act of combing his beard which he had allowed to grow as well as his hair in order to reproach mazarin with his wretched appearance and condition   13.809855675182686
said a voice at the end of the gallery   16.36807092206572
where you can be relieved   3.3959970476942125
where do you suffer   9.355777803072375
you may go   12.586072917091947
this evening said the governor   16.204403726759413
it was a very near thing but he is not dead   13.678756394404616
thou canst be said grimaud writing down his figures   13.943833779918226
edmond listened and the sound became more and more distinct   9.956266767591977
twenty minutes twenty tedious minutes passed thus then ten more and at last the clock struck the half hour   8.759148979928677
noirtier did not love his child and yet he sleeps   11.386642429160547
he fell asleep again and another vision appeared   10.545369558354711
he replied he replied that the death was not a natural one and must be attributed to what   10.247367600486882
i use either hand easily   10.647545167901775
noirtier do not complain for it is for you that i came and my journey will be your salvation   9.889895990468924
inquired caderousse with a look of surprise   6.937271381059834
however you will be better informed as to me and my possessions ere long   14.843260997159275
perhaps he even suspects the person   12.809285925490961
it appeared to her that the blast as it swept along disheveled her brow as it bowed the branches of the trees and bore away their leaves   14.24872087795458
certainly replied albert seeing that without my title i should be nothing   11.496301031730695
almost before the key had turned in the lock and before the departing steps of the jailer had died away in the long corridor he had to traverse dantès whose restless anxiety concerning his friend left him no desire to touch the food brought him hurried back to the abbé s chamber and raising the stone by pressing his head against it was soon beside the sick man s couch   7.001294900406632
you have not played for a long time d artagnan   13.422603262883207
then the queen with that wonderful strength which is the privilege of parents repressed her tears and motioned to de winter to change the subject   6.376577203886651
noirtier and valentine had given him leave to go twice a week and he was now availing himself of that permission   10.936268900142572
but our mazarin impossible   14.321031533118175
but on two conditions   11.751132420735331
only he has remained asleep while you have awakened   14.749966825367853
but how do you mean to pass your time till i come back   5.323271596878561
he came there and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving elba the projected landing etc   10.545812403815656
you had a new livery yesterday   10.631011405007756
on their arrival at the castle they learned that buckingham and the king were hawking in the marshes two or three leagues away   10.373949530213345
they are bad managers said d artagnan shrugging his shoulders   9.768738517443907
the worthy sergeant had recognized the minister s secretary and the millionnaire and by way of paying extra attention to his noble neighbors promised to keep their places while they paid a visit to beauchamp   12.005424982839003
are you ambitious and do you seek after the greatnesses of the earth   9.314638287545648
the pleasure of satisfied pride was necessary to her domination   13.400423184800733
asked the fair traveler   11.326305658959276
are not your name your social position and your merit sufficient   18.467243663627116
caderousse followed him slowly to the threshold   13.294352032922065
vast was the crowd of visitors and inquiring friends who left their names at the residence of madame de villefort with the design of renewing their visit at the right moment of hearing from her lips all the interesting circumstances of this most romantic adventure   12.026666449331678
sir suddenly exclaimed the countess after their walk had continued ten minutes in silence is it true that you have seen so much travelled so far and suffered so deeply   10.872119354296798
it was danglars who wrote the denunciation with his left hand that his writing might not be recognized and fernand who put it in the post   17.10466358975323
torn and filthy garments covered his large bony limbs which seemed as though like those of a skeleton they would rattle as he walked   10.94739284227083
but you how did you get rid of yours   14.350971849562612
but in accordance with dantès request he began to speak of other matters   7.261388720858816
the cargo on board   12.372318521470143
d artagnan refused   10.612709084067097
all london was crowding to the doors of the house   11.662886258393875
what mean you   12.992203910756496
his face was much agitated   14.767129361157496
it is the desire of vengeance and how desire molds a man   12.627855380892639
yes a fine house standing alone between a courtyard and a garden you must know it   15.591758623389689
the scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling clearness   15.495047380649753
aramis calmly drew his sword which he had carried between his teeth as he swam   12.006582802017114
and i idem said aramis   13.084404941722275
she said bowed down beneath the voice of her tyrant   10.113099362281053
and the musketeer narrated to his friend planchet s adventure   14.318302606778296
i have just made m   13.409575094901484
this time we were the vultures   17.702205976498284
and the queen laid her beautiful hand on her bosom   5.7051007137185525
but i require three weeks preparation   12.366789401824391
and that explains how it comes to pass that fallen as i trust he is forever napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical satellites   11.506575308438805
i do not understand you   9.764421032503979
wait my dear sir wait a moment   16.087037725066747
whereas brought up by the coadjutor for instance he would imbibe national principles and love his people   10.124394638251937
well what s the matter   15.783054508140612
he has such a short neck said she   13.91399957908641
at this word apologies a cloud passed over the brow of athos a haughty smile curled the lip of porthos and a negative sign was the reply of aramis   13.255289072036852
here are the horse s hoofs again it seems athos he said carelessly   13.23702522946475
the wounded man smiled sadly   13.728879759804176
rather say that you have a new love   12.063298282503977
during the evening monte cristo quitted paris for auteuil accompanied by ali   16.744161701766615
oh nothing which was not right in the character of a creditor   12.342829564627603
it was a man who would answer for the offence whether trifling or serious   9.904274242347963
he therefore told him all   13.644652156908112
mademoiselle eugénie however merely returned a dissenting movement of the head while with a cold smile she directed the attention of her mother to an opposite box on the first circle in which sat the countess g and where morcerf had just made his appearance   10.482353616812649
we still remain four friends devoted to each other   10.268181294897804
who sends you   12.415488804627634
i pardon you for the attempts upon my own person   13.171380516946478
are there any materials for an article in what you are going to tell us   11.21871274817447
that was an oversight certainly replied the count   13.0077348459369
my poor friend   10.160072783697618
five or six minutes elapsed   11.703632884296756
you see i am dying   11.099013569079986
you will not leave me to perish   14.27888544147999
the boat was moored to the shore and they advanced a few paces to find a comfortable bivouac   8.77539890433279
and he withdrew sighing   15.84943421699517
there is no doubt of that   16.48358079231885
do not speak so loud madame   12.073628515058319
i am going to fight because i am going to fight answered porthos reddening   13.858258382887703
a cup of chocolate   9.49776717595324
as to grimaud he received orders to place himself behind the four friends in order to reload their weapons   13.019676319604127
for their ransom   14.083863027512836
i sailed for the island of elba where i arrived the next day   12.090951648720766
you are my son dantès exclaimed the old man   10.632651456779325
mousqueton heaved a deep sigh   13.399755618781729
madame de villefort could not drop the curtain which she held like a funeral pall over the head of valentine   13.105271377545655
said morrel shrugging his shoulders   11.9752800046646
my lord there is time to draw back said d artagnan and your eminence is perfectly free   13.668695285078703
excuse my smiling when you speak of a sum i am in the habit of carrying in my pocket book or dressing case   7.518863566004057
what matter if you are paid for it   17.300558748853312
as i came into the public room i saw one of our englishman bargaining with a dealer for a horse his own having died yesterday from bleeding   15.629872546757639
but for this precaution which it will be remembered the abbé had made to edmond the misfortune would have been still greater for their attempt to escape would have been detected and they would undoubtedly have been separated   13.703879317913062
the servants had just disappeared under the trees followed by the tutor and the young men were laughing and talking about a hundred yards off   9.295111655602135
i thought you would never come in   5.327378292547637
but of what   8.143210394765646
if only for the sake of m   14.4107785344731
if you must have me descend to earth i submit   13.810973981847804
how do i know that this is not his eminence who has honored you with the commission to procure my head   9.393185716380987
dantès uttered blasphemies that made his jailer recoil with horror dashed himself furiously against the walls of his prison wreaked his anger upon everything and chiefly upon himself so that the least thing a grain of sand a straw or a breath of air that annoyed him led to paroxysms of fury   9.943074132600467
my father and the baron d épinay lived in the stormy times of which i only saw the ending said villefort   17.858998866318725
oh that is not my secret   11.247515129161439
each of them had a ticket attached to it by which it might be recognized   16.307140491969083
ere the cardinal your predecessor sent our mother marie de medicis to die in exile she taught us that language   13.85530070583643
from that moment i have neither seen nor heard anything   13.816787322336562
unfortunately the light had been removed into another chamber   10.735430538374017
noirtier s eyes demanded the nature of her mission   14.776682047780078
well you soon become tired of singing and you take a fancy to study diplomacy with the minister s secretary   9.433087914803913
precisely so   15.206235022099332
there was a stream close by and a bridge across it   13.983885858040345
lieutenant with a promise of becoming captain   13.129757047784377
his face was livid large drops rolled down his face and in his fingers he held the fragments of a quill pen which he had torn to atoms   5.142346783135127
yes but not against a strong dose   11.660605073558484
grimaud always sees dark or light night as well as day answered mousqueton   11.842767398295704
sir replied mazarin with perseverance one may penetrate through a wall   11.967415152573125
he saw that these tracks tended toward the wall   14.111607191447165
immediately he who had spoken to me approached the door of the pavilion opened it with a key he had in his hand closed the door and disappeared while at the same time the other two men ascended the ladder   13.691303034839578
cried d artagnan seizing her hands and surveying her with an ardent glance come be more generous   15.08483425959853
those whom i am compelled to dismiss lose as a matter of course all participation in this money while their portion goes to the fund accumulating for those domestics who remain with me and among whom it will be divided at my death   11.511352846920047
all these old soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in the time of the emperor but which are not suffered now for the people here do not like soldiers of such disorderly conduct   12.098220376264377
don t try to understand it you will only lose your time   12.33993496894841
it was important that he should be informed of what was passing   10.510344112213065
for a fortnight i had been at that hotel during which period i had cured my valet de chambre of a fever and my landlord of the jaundice so that i really acquired a reputation as a skilful physician   10.340659992234164
he walked six or seven times round the place royale turning at every ten steps to look at the light in milady s apartment which was to be seen through the blinds   11.592405678954695
the journey chapter xxi   13.658201979326135
i shall never swim again replied faria   12.80079112752715
nor i said madame danglars   9.654997890361184
and as those could not be sold by auction they began to murmur   11.39001983398962
they are no doubt both curious and interesting   12.044047874753128
bonacieux was introduced afresh and upon a sign from the cardinal the officer retired   10.847489595448312
d artagnan colored   11.705716903623232
but terminating as it did with such a phrase the only one which could be caught at by the jokers anne turned around and directed a glance toward her favorites which announced that she delivered up the coadjutor to their tender mercies   10.685518933035485
do you agree with aramis   12.383461543071
about ten feet from the spot where he and the stranger were the roof had given way leaving a large round opening through which might be seen the blue vault of heaven thickly studded with stars   8.642017789324733
good day dear d artagnan said aramis   17.011696051359372
ah cried benedetto his eyes sparkling with joy   7.4437503009121295
and she flew to a little inlaid casket which stood upon the dressing table opened it with a feverish and trembling hand drew from it a small poniard with a golden haft and a sharp thin blade and then threw herself with a bound upon d artagnan   16.407979901968037
asked bernouin   10.47539458010463
it is you who are not a woman muttered mazarin   8.757717723411005
and yet it is difficult to suppose such a resemblance should exist between two jewels   4.805900427960113
and that the footsteps which were those of several persons stopped at the door   10.413287035978838
but really this is a most singular conversation for the carnival gentlemen   7.769529140210643
but the woman left last night and the man this morning   7.6724252978521745
the servant bowed and retired   12.992836015844405
château renaud rented a stall beside his own while beauchamp as a journalist had unlimited range all over the theatre   13.032069819071866
50213m mercédès burst into tears   16.937027382575266
pardon me for having joined with your persecutors   6.325392836107701
to break my vow in behalf of the ex emperor   4.754230484115763
had it not been for an adverse destiny that beloved monarch would this day have been among us   12.416343623659483
when we went up to the enemy it was slowly   11.587469231119668
i admit it   10.809535763417276
the supper appeared to have been supplied solely for franz for the unknown scarcely touched one or two dishes of the splendid banquet to which his guest did ample justice   15.323444863971106
some of his remarks corresponded with what he already knew or applied to the sort of knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to acquire   14.084804070073478
yes yes said valentine you mean that i have yet a kind grandfather left do you not   12.738255702245935
or will you allow me to show you several fine statues by thorwaldsen bartoloni and canova   11.51060802656695
there is nothing in hand but a party of pleasure   12.600629315567307
go to your chamber said she to mme   12.258697380019003
you tell me to lay aside the mask and i will do so be satisfied   14.956302309214475
give him to me   15.74128276629333
since your eminence has come so far come a few steps further   7.143957038086377
quite sir   18.306044074004475
and what is the pay   11.852595758278069
i have not seen you   19.6321008128644
yes calls himself   14.624213175268988
de chevreuse was at tours   11.92327846958772
he is merely my father said albert m   11.017023217770513
no not perfect was the count s reply   7.796972207383042
that does not concern me   5.1958130447206266
richelieu looked steadfastly at the young man   9.558315418136923
a written examination attests it said the cardinal replying aloud to the mute interrogation of his majesty   17.0221046407947
i worked at night also replied faria   11.697785219774689
the jailer therefore only grumbled   12.629448570281312
and by chance was there yesterday at the same time that i was and it was my duty to offer to conduct her to her carriage   14.168906768870478
remember said milady seeing the stranger lay his hand on his sword the least delay may ruin everything   15.807735550635073
i buy those horses he said to the groom   12.667435735209178
the officer superintended all these details with the same calmness milady had constantly seen in him never pronouncing a word himself and making himself obeyed by a gesture of his hand or a sound of his whistle   11.388929241613068
at the other end silent scarcely visible and like a shadow was a sentinel who was walking up and down before a grotto which was only distinguishable because in that spot the darkness seemed more dense than elsewhere   10.674611980713403
well and why should not you be free too   13.282946168241937
said d artagnan with an astonishment which this time was not pretended   10.051681021473014
said château renaud shuddering   14.47528730408507
an instant after the guardsman descended in his turn   8.686350132618113
cried the executioner i think i am dying   13.116205513199409
haydée scarcely had the count s horses cleared the angle of the boulevard when albert turning towards the count burst into a loud fit of laughter much too loud in fact not to give the idea of its being rather forced and unnatural   11.834659674861744
this frequently happened   6.937017607785181
liar   9.960309052929805
d épinay is coming back to settle this affair at once beyond all possibility of revocation   14.82784945277819
he frowned and his cheeks were colored   6.1604266428110925
indeed i think you understand them better since i am ignorant of what has become of a considerable portion of my fortune once very tolerable while i am sure madame that you know perfectly well   6.320321785202133
well be it so then   13.391043265248559
and you of me sir said louvieres   11.092511389907253
i have indeed   11.941870137339185
no replied bonacieux with a self sufficient air she is too superficial a woman   12.245055496841164
you need not look for it   13.090099835744338
once on board we drop down the thames and in two hours are on the open sea   14.677645516155435
the other was an instrument that was all   12.057667204579552
but that is a trifle since it enables me to justify myself to you   12.756162485492977
in madame de villefort s room   7.563102433264555
monsieur de beaufort   13.278505659224038
said aramis truly you are a great man   13.553588034248145
edmond said the poor mother who tried every means when i call you edmond why do you not call me mercédès   11.391171831395347
no one has seen d artagnan and porthos has not appeared   15.299378012472921
still as five o clock approached and the carriage was momentarily expected by the count the indication of more than common impatience and uneasiness might be observed in his manner   14.904908185533735
at least it was impossible for the wounded man to see her any longer from the spot where he was   10.965033586378059
it was soon time for grimaud to recall the past   12.729802805721643
really you appear to be totally ignorant of the cause which brings me here   14.332562524611355
but as we know d artagnan possessed with ambition to enter the musketeers had formed but few friendships among his comrades and he felt himself isolated and given up to his own reflections   9.446721861700926
yes that was the way it ended   10.758743784968306
ah you take it with that tone do you master gascon   15.152333955718673
the citizen took a paper from his pocket and presented it to d artagnan   13.361773532803838
danglars sold yesterday at 405 and pockets 300 000 francs   16.754304605701236
and thereby you have lied twice monsieur for i saw it fall   13.300223116389873
how is king otho getting on   10.8766820076137
i will read you the letter containing the accusation at least said villefort the king s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the religious institutions of his country that one named edmond dantès mate of the ship pharaon this day arrived from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo has been the bearer of a letter from murat to the usurper and again taken charge of another letter from the usurper to the bonapartist club in paris   12.607058753341184
d artagnan and porthos   11.170382003295234
are you satisfied now   12.598316001541182
and he gave her a kiss at which the poor girl became as red as a cherry   12.120455925522986
the landlord dreading the consequences of the encounter which was doubtless about to take place between the young man and the stranger had consistent with the character he had given himself judged it prudent to decamp   15.642813483149405
the latter faithful to the principle of horace nil admirari had contented himself with showing his knowledge by declaring in what lake the best lampreys were caught   15.288972269397947
but when is this ball to take place   12.198762894185515
my good my brave guitant whatsoever command i may give you in that language in french whatever i may order you to do will you not perform it   6.848443770994791
i do not suppose that you will all be quite so disinterested as monsieur de la fere replied the cardinal bowing to athos   10.341079389827097
on her left shoulder sparkled the diamond studs on a bow of the same color as the plumes and the petticoat   9.639392825025398
for the fastest sailor in the mediterranean would have been unable to overtake the little tartan that with every stitch of canvas set was flying before the wind to leghorn   16.08331524230831
chapter 91   10.94710595673955
said valentine raising her eyes to heaven and sighing   17.97208617294449
many young men of palestrina frascati and pampinara had disappeared   10.283584788892473
martin with his garrison and threw a hundred men into a little fort called the fort of la prée   12.526759566655254
it is likewise well situated neither too near paris nor too far from it   11.484688642804985
you know full well that my existence is bound up in yours that were i to lose you i would not outlive the hour of such crushing misery   9.132251032587043
dantès would have given ten years of his life in exchange for it   14.648506370374689
for my part said d artagnan i say this must come to an end   13.896980309790091
on leaving paris athos and aramis well knew that they would be encountering great danger   11.810228895261478
the presence of the two victims alarmed him   11.438292271683064
do you hesitate   10.244964767426888
raising my scaffold   9.728980731964128
at half past six the duke arose and said very gravely certainly caesar was the greatest man of ancient times   11.19673749267802
is that not true monsieur bonacieux   12.394653839332314
as if the catholic religion was not the most advantageous and the most agreeable of all religions   18.034674529229765
the duc de longueville gained the government of pont de l arche five hundred thousand francs for his wife and the honor of seeing her son held at the baptismal font by the young king and henrietta of england   6.513035538618534

tedesco   15.012755832574069
we must ask the comte de la fere the question   11.900879504598464
well read the letter again   14.208497237252143
how unfortunate that you were masked albert said franz   12.789786636922791
then after a brief interval during which the honest shipowner turned his hat in his hands m   13.42406608130046
de tréville was about to reprehend this breach of the rules of etiquette when he felt the hand of athos who had rallied all his energies to contend against pain at length overcome by it fell upon the floor as if he were dead   11.115764821056533
what had she done to excite the malice of an enemy   10.035937151792972
on the 10th or 12th he will be at lyons and on the 20th or 25th at paris   11.422360629990337
who are these gentleman   10.05398052483751
d artagnan imagined that on arriving in town the duke would slacken his pace but it was not so   10.811566134764071
yes said valentine he was very fond of me   6.741850771741366
whereas my own country which i can only judge of from the impression produced on my childish mind always seems enveloped in a vague atmosphere which is luminous or otherwise according as my remembrances of it are sad or joyous   13.50071014507968
it frequently occurs in a state prison like this that persons are stationed outside the doors of the cells purposely to overhear the conversation of the prisoners   16.308762632972577
one of her conditions was that she should come and see me twice a week   8.379948860190849
i m beginning to feel queer   12.13785362542484
oh i will find it he cried   13.011127713436858
myself and planchet are all that such a simple expedition requires   18.022817449578703
the left of the carriage was as well cleared as the right and they drew up the blind of the window which mazarin less heroic than the king had taken the precaution to lower   19.648325076510062
and in fact it was that unfortunate scotchman parry s brother you know on whom groslow amused himself by trying his strength   14.073714196905879
the movement was executed in silence and with precision   12.191564262542418
yes yes said milady   16.675317047356803
debray i need not give a further description because to you my beautiful pair of dappled grays were well known   19.72665296506188
yes i recognized mademoiselle danglars   12.283018207817857
the young woman only replied by the beautiful glow which mounted to her cheeks   11.740010795200194
to sea   10.98822190195774
but athos only replied to this proposal by shrugging his shoulders   13.400579507453525
at this moment steps were heard in the ante room and without any announcement the marechal de la meilleraie appeared at the door   12.491128756155067
all four of us   12.133251065654822
aramis had been to visit one of his penitents in the neighborhood   9.611538527863395
no no no said comminges who made a point of having the facts appear exactly as they were i clearly understood what the cardinal said to me   11.285781585159107
but said morrel the culprit the murderer the assassin   15.20889988368117
it was as a prey to this hallucination that d artagnan traveled at whatever pace his horse pleased the six or eight leagues that separated chantilly from crèvecœur without his being able to remember on his arrival in the village any of the things he had passed or met with on the road   10.337255217779726
noirtier answered only by a look which made villefort s blood run cold   14.454867328436707
i descended into the arms of the archers   16.23324478446608
you have told your coachman to leave the city by the porta del popolo to drive round the walls and re enter by the porta san giovanni   12.810833744220997
inquired franz after the countess had a second time directed her lorgnette at the box what do you think of our opposite neighbor   6.414908170619961
30171m yes i do want a notary motioned the old man shutting his eyes with a look of defiance which seemed to say and i should like to see the person who dares to refuse my request   14.72516501341596
marseilles is filled with half pay officers who are daily under one frivolous pretext or other getting up quarrels with the royalists   11.251265056092365
a singular commission   10.598167060362591
it was you who in love with de wardes and thinking to pass the night with him opened the door to monsieur d artagnan   13.7452356067363
before fifteen days are gone by i shall be away from here   14.895308983812903
only to think of it makes my flesh crawl   14.290577514487039
a mousetrap in the seventeenth century the invention of the mousetrap does not date from our days   6.483455052966576
good evening madame said the banker   10.902544113040452
athos porthos and aramis instantly drew near one another while jussac drew up his soldiers   15.649850671044488
in five minutes the party entered the courtyard and d artagnan led the prisoner up the great staircase and across the corridor and ante chamber   6.941699846972429
and yet what you tell me is madness for my father will curse me he is inflexible he will never pardon me   10.597526897767324
well should he be arrested do they think they will arrest him   11.092066465695803
yes we did some fine things in our time and we gave that poor cardinal a few threads to unravel   9.717660164011406
what must be done then   13.051652303780639
ah you frighten me   9.850201610976077
alas do you love nothing else in me   12.117472873253217
said danglars a lad of his make was not born to be unhappy in love   9.153649859301598
well then off to the nearest goldsmith s and sell that diamond for the highest price you can get from him   11.328701825746545
franz returned the salute by shaking his handkerchief as an exchange of signals   10.306874427939754
inquired madame de villefort   15.354603598652032
what does that imply   7.846568626354003
inquired mercédès evidently attaching great importance to this question   12.934629328281765
no monsieur for on the contrary i am desired to preserve the profoundest mystery   14.627451154654693
then i shall also remain   10.96803313606691
there now   4.636475747645729
you are pale and the perspiration rolls from your forehead   13.767979788110676
if you want another uniform and sword you must play the same trick over again   10.556479784584422
they must die die all together killed at one stroke by the thunder of men in default of god s   14.691278734712572
ali pasha was killed as you know but before he died he recompensed the services of fernand by leaving him a considerable sum with which he returned to france when he was gazetted lieutenant general   10.537784239640892
it is ali   20.88295137577311
i must again excuse myself m   13.333570390100675
tomorrow perchance it will be our turn   12.864690494565192
it was not so much the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grief but her total inability to account for the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an act   10.87842443383179
dear good renée whispered villefort as he gazed with unutterable tenderness on the lovely speaker   13.422426772015948
my sword   13.137127664813862
but for some time the imperial police who at this period quite contrary to what napoleon desired so soon as he had a son born to him wished for a partition of provinces had their eyes on me   16.324276666554375
aramis anxious and negligently dressed said nothing   16.879848572796863
repeated caderousse becoming excited and eager   11.336037809786571
but replied franz this ambrosia no doubt in passing through mortal hands has lost its heavenly appellation and assumed a human name   16.219170594354893
if you do not want me at leghorn you can leave me there and i will pay you out of the first wages i get for my food and the clothes you lend me   9.194094253313892
chapter i   21.2412059754307
or else whatever may be my repugnance to soiling my sword a second time with the blood of a wretch like you i swear by my faith as an honest man and at these words d artagnan made so fierce a gesture that the wounded man sprang up   17.543016999366134
get your clothes together   8.85488425548046
now inform me what you have discovered concerning him and the conspiracy   11.083506982259582

go i will rejoin you   9.896175960375446

the note indicated neither the street nor the number of the house where the meeting was to be held   13.949105564632386
but after all i ought not to blame you for the misconduct of your horses more especially as it procured me the pleasure of an introduction to the count of monte cristo and certainly that illustrious personage apart from the millions he is said to be so very anxious to dispose of seemed to me one of those curiously interesting problems i for one delight in solving at any risk even if it were to necessitate another drive to the bois behind your horses   9.538510194064374

then casting a glance on the handsome young man who was scarcely twenty five years of age and whom he was leaving in his gore deprived of sense and perhaps dead he gave a sigh for that unaccountable destiny which leads men to destroy each other for the interests of people who are strangers to them and who often do not even know that they exist   12.06168167345188
yes for i often wish for what is impossible   7.97389403379948
beauchamp repeated the name to himself as though he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright and then gave orders for him to be admitted   17.791077521242325

encouraged by this discovery edmond determined to assist the indefatigable laborer   10.084884716486432
a flash kindled in his eyes and a bitter smile passed over his lips then like his comrades he sank again into reverie   13.057640631527976
after a moment i fancied that i felt a slight pulsation of the heart and as i had been assistant at the hospital at bastia i did what a doctor would have done i inflated the lungs by blowing air into them and at the expiration of a quarter of an hour it began to breathe and cried feebly   8.278610168270328

then when he raised it again he was struck by the presence of a man who was standing at the open door and was gazing at him with a compassionate air   14.11074052811669
as our fugitives approached the house they found the ground cut up as if a considerable body of horsemen had preceded them   10.39087470503901

de villefort that general quesnel whom they believed attached to the usurper but who was really entirely devoted to me has perished the victim of a bonapartist ambush   9.202703827132284

for it is fit you should know monsieur d artagnan that i have received heavy and serious complaints against you   11.377639657535019
an officer was placing two soldiers at the door of each drawing room and was advancing towards danglars preceded by a commissary of police girded with his scarf   11.170744547566137
have you any friend whose clock is too slow   12.824397459558817

the brother of louis xvi   14.457472802760385
monte cristo seeing that the two persons for whom he had prepared this scene could scarcely endure it and not wishing to carry it too far said come gentlemen some coffee we seem to have forgotten it and he conducted the guests back to the table on the lawn   20.258607849277652
all that which a man wounded in his self love could let fall in the shape of imprecations and reproaches upon the head of a woman porthos let fall upon the bowed head of the procurator s wife   11.781916571257838
the musketeers saluted bicarat with their swords and returned them to their sheaths   11.946609934490958
but he has discovered a thousand means of taking it away and the devil has somewhat aided him   9.428509700717566
villefort smiled within himself for he felt his increased importance   7.388517895996852
she had met fernand at the corner of the rue de la loge   10.704249170436542

his fine eyes no longer surrounded by that dark line which nights of dissipation pencil too infallibly seemed larger more liquid than ever   8.10242141037881
and as we are prevented from going down there we are forced to refuse food and drink to the travelers who come to the house   14.501651222562648
and morcerf inclined his head towards the door through which sounds seemed to issue resembling those of a guitar   10.266346336124037
a ninny indeed   11.173998252627893
i have not your confidence   16.923684702055212
the cardinal who sometimes became weary of the king granted this leave of absence with great pleasure to his royal lieutenant who promised to return about the fifteenth of september   15.608657619944813
40152m as the last stroke died away the count thought he heard a slight noise in the dressing room   12.904384040219762
a minute afterwards the blinds were thrown open and through the jessamine and clematis that overhung the window one could see the garden ornamented with lanterns and the supper laid under the tent   16.65506360513566
he cast a passing glance at porthos and beheld this triumphant look   13.138993155857191

and what did monsieur d artagnan reply   15.481606639951936
porthos devoured d artagnan with wondering eyes   10.511454495172558

putting on his cloak and gloves   12.39672377985623
d artagnan listened to him with exemplary complaisance and when he had finished said and madame bonacieux do you know who carried her off   12.790645552721681
but he trusts you will excuse him as very important business calls him to malaga   10.270492861251878
said d artagnan with an accent so truthful that no one could mistake it   11.004832599681931

parry knew this room as he had often been to see me when the king was at newcastle   9.891426071722334
he felt more gratitude for the possession of this piece of iron than he had ever felt for anything   12.698395115429832
the cardinal spada buried no treasure here   6.3678968116703265

said franz inquiringly   13.347487029322172
mordaunt therefore raised the canvas and saw cromwell seated before a table his head buried in his hands his back being turned   5.734237070951343
he approached just as the brigand was refreshing himself with a mouthful of brandy which owing to the leathern bottle containing it sent forth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to danglars   12.450155231205986

feverish and excited i rang at the door   12.700967088342086
as the inquisition rarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and their flesh lacerated by torture so madness is always concealed in its cell from whence should it depart it is conveyed to some gloomy hospital where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the mutilated being the jailer delivers to him   16.295811547767617
as many thousands as you give me hundreds   16.3372160077368
bonacieux became livid   16.029627764599137
insensibly my eyelids grew heavy deep sleep stole over me and having no suspicion of anything wrong i sought not to shake it off   17.693155659491417
besides the casket is the more precious from being all that is left to me   7.4682901381027955
and i i swear to you before god madame said d artagnan that if i am taken while accomplishing the orders you give me i will die sooner than do anything that may compromise anyone   14.311767766763463
i gave it away in a night of love as it has been given to you   16.39385392955911

planchet saluted in the manner of one accustomed to fine houses   12.890833527573896
so that the two ends came out of the sockets of stone in which for thirty years they had been fixed   12.92456954523269
but why did we not breakfast at the parpaillot   16.606137238534263
two or three chairs were thrown down as if there had been a struggle   12.082478255528306
at this moment as if in reply to his words a man lying on a coil of cables rose and advanced a few steps toward him   13.9272339731702
séguier keeper of the seals looks more than once for the bell chapter xvii   10.604881370101541

and upon my soul i would give my life for a hair said athos   11.568166917186828
they are alive that s all that i can say about them   10.947348438535501
oh very shortly madame said he   12.266215810463578
then he double locked his door emptied all his drawers collected about fifty thousand francs in bank notes burned several papers left others exposed to view and then commenced writing a letter which he addressed to madame la baronne danglars   13.307329782218824
inquired the king   17.452770720254453
de winter took us to the house of a spaniard who he said had become naturalized as an englishman by the guineas of his new compatriots   18.118304758898073
then said villefort nothing further is required   10.825644873225524
of the middle height about the same stature as his excellency returned the host pointing to albert   13.098975806668225
silence d herblay   15.176642639849748
he is a millionaire his income is 500 000 francs   14.994406691846848
and although the entertainment was fixed for twelve o clock an hour previous to that time the balcony was filled with impatient and expectant guests consisting of the favored part of the crew of the pharaon and other personal friends of the bridegroom the whole of whom had arrayed themselves in their choicest costumes in order to do greater honor to the occasion   3.7800928601257393
there are fifteen of them   12.466147931040329
so said charles he who knocks down there is the comte de la fere sire said aramis   16.145425575500127
said the duchess   13.211433235673221
no i didn t know that   14.284022158526716
i can not stay here any longer   10.361197565752057
de villefort s marginal notes   13.458928125816847
but do not be uneasy   13.63607651912164
this child of the desert was in his element and with his black face and sparkling eyes appeared in the cloud of dust he raised like the genius of the simoom and the god of the hurricane   8.110077350676244
so my dear mother i am going at once to ask franz to lend me the small sum i shall require to supply my present wants   13.730681462625178
these odors escaped from two deep dishes which were covered and placed on a stove and from a copper pan placed in an old iron pot   13.933548794042567
and the members of the group whether rebels or not as if they knew with what sort of a man they had to deal at once gave place to the patrol   11.11576652227587
oh my lord my lord   14.744821064137113
lieutenant   11.37757955832604
monsieur d artagnan never made such an answer as that when the service of your majesty was concerned said athos bowing with great dignity   9.569368594422773
debray did not defend himself very warmly for the idea had sometimes crossed his mind   13.794091410725274
poor child   12.352654261313337
do you not see that i reserve eighty francs for myself   9.576188178534796
we engaged our word   12.787600491102312
planchet grasped him by the throat and pressed as hard as he could   19.499673645771967
then come here   10.308231769456194
as enceladus   6.980507399382481
but what shall you do with him   7.049828392712605
aramis and i are very unhappy   9.191298005430943
and then each group went and took their watch near an entrance   17.286427547438365
but why the devil dost thou run about the tops of houses at seven o clock of the morning in the month of january   9.69604887616447
her husband who when he married her had no other patrimony than his noble probity his first rate ability and his spotless reputation wished to possess as much as his wife   11.031625889603161
in conjunction with the affairs of ali pasha   10.486211902415514
for he was a quiet inoffensive prisoner happy in his folly and required no watching   14.628717129410253
the host became as pale as death   14.797961994890567
morrel said danglars you have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us   14.224933771215527
i should quite imagine that to be the case said cavalcanti   14.629480647067972
it is different with my mother who paints exceedingly well and who unwilling to part with so valuable a picture gave it to me to put here where it would be less likely to displease m   13.7993905247742
thanks to this double gift and the spotless name that accompanied it m   8.248057655680029
yes yes my boy so we will so we will replied the old man   21.28760585599454
beauchamp interposed this strange man the count of monte cristo bows to none but the count of monte cristo himself   14.407002890043863
but the knife had fortunately we ought to say skillfully come in contact with the steel busk which at that period like a cuirass defended the chests of women   13.985496488985556
explain yourself my good friend said the coadjutor   6.012353857946252
yes said monte cristo i think m   12.668408185327419
resumed d artagnan not having seen you for four or five years i concluded you were dead   14.619507714722594
instead of improving these gifts rarely granted so abundantly this has been your course you have given yourself up to sloth and drunkenness and in a fit of intoxication have ruined your best friend   11.380588964802879
disarm him only make sure of his sword   11.06019478363042
athos alighted and calmly opened the handkerchief tied at each corner whilst d artagnan ever cautious remained on horseback one hand upon his pistol leaning forward watchfully   18.365075621820672
the horse shall be restored to your lackey monsieur   11.192036120830597
is it possible that god has abandoned his representative on earth and left him to die thus miserably   13.721067866977549
but monseigneur i know nothing about them   12.169314439345658
he took them up just as he formerly used to take up the stones from the road and threw them out of the house   12.10264170609164
do you not remember that while you were seated on a stone bench and while as i told you mademoiselle de villefort and your young son were absent you conversed for a considerable time with somebody   11.875240486122717
they sailed   12.145682054572
d artagnan who was known as a familiar of the house went straight to his office and sent word that he wished to see him on something of importance   13.50721534730756
my dear father i think i already know what you are about to tell me   13.138475344336909
it happened however that these two men on meeting again assimilated perfectly   12.360971784622269
the fourth and last side of your cell faces on faces on stop a minute now where does it face   12.40985507636099
you must look out for yourself   10.269872590109145
no my child no said madame de saint méran   13.600403888712993
yes said the messenger and i bring you his ring   12.28197728303752
wait a little aramis   13.360175526941727
thank god   13.23285125912231
with these words the baron went out   6.478008506132539
my friends will be there i hope   16.011071095129836
but danglars restrained me   13.546328208867463
those who were at the front hurled defiance at the impassive sentinels of the regiment of guards posted around the palais royal the gates of which were closed behind them a precaution which made their situation precarious   12.583520990331598
the crowd invaded the space which the dreaded pikes of the guards had till then kept clear between them and the carriage   9.252229731323991
the president rang the bell   15.428933880578859
to which the others had responded that they would be glad to see the gallows erected   11.603006187899197
in ten minutes d artagnan reached the end of an alley regularly planted with fine poplars and terminating in an iron gate the points and crossed bars of which were gilt   10.004383248466356
his teeth were clenched and his speech had a short dry accent which indicated that something dark was at work within him   12.780869391930336
his excellency waits for you said a voice which he recognized as that of the sentinel   10.918626432993685
i knew that from the mixture of greek words   5.3256407479577845
by the torchlight dantès saw the glittering sabres and carbines of four gendarmes   17.805138535876488
yes monsieur said d artagnan lowering his voice and you will pardon me i hope for having disturbed you when you know the importance of my business   11.453799642700863
a sob which mordaunt could not repress burst from his throat and his livid face became suffused with blood   12.82168970346229
be it so said the envoy   7.174934949112356
ma foi there is no hurry   6.631076532496367
i of course give him the same title and everyone else does likewise   12.150218646781859
and when madame danglars recovered from her half fainting condition she could almost believe that she had had a disagreeable dream   13.046432797097891
and where does he come from   10.54367636804876
gentlemen said aramis decidedly it is a night for meetings   12.166257526815876
yes i understand grandfather said the young girl   15.055997252283213
long live the coadjutor   14.321168495208621
it is the day my father was murdered   7.7793588259657565
and he had many such among men of the pen as well as among men of the sword   7.042824186466423
my health is well enough said fernand clenching his hands without raising his head   13.479209715512793
do you know what he has done this child   11.738951713007653
the cries died away in groans and next morning as soon as wasilio s wife could muster up courage to venture abroad she caused the door of our dwelling to be opened by the public authorities when assunta although dreadfully burnt was found still breathing   13.726839096194066
so replied de winter laughing that beautiful hair so skillfully disheveled that white skin and that languishing look have not yet seduced you you heart of stone   12.398760291429298
ah but the friends of today are the enemies of tomorrow   11.100505528377138
are you all here   10.040678377735759
and if that were the case would your honor condemn his action   14.209433988197894
yes madame replied the astonished king   14.233013317213928
but he will make it up in you i am sure   14.927620189193407
i will perform your commission word for word my lord   15.609018250398469
jacopo pointed towards the horizon   12.998870805880442
true said madame de villefort with an intonation of voice which it is impossible to describe   17.893803484760873
merely say i am a frenchman travelling for pleasure   12.075384178466944
besides she found herself in circumstances where everything must be risked for the sake of everything   13.30885642855926
then you will start after the queen   10.796059652339263
you are good and faithful servants   12.440286536469783
i know it   11.641783565291133
and he placed you in the company of his brother in law monsieur dessessart leaving you to hope that one day or other you should enter the musketeers   11.219554300170568
replied the young man very easily no doubt for they are strong and well supported while i am alone   10.07907726076019
the diamond which glittered in the window at marlé s or fossin s shines with more splendor when it is our own   14.225802202296208
two of them were singing in a corner out of tune the psalm on the rivers of babylon   14.94673045274842
and did you not remonstrate against such infamy   10.676345934616883
it could be seen that she had wished to speak but she had remained silent through fear of losing one of her companion s words   12.740012009829439
but how do you procure a light   11.937720062435464
which compels us here to give a public contradiction to the slanderers who pretend that we live under a government but moderately indulgent to men of letters   13.749506108625608
the fifth of september the extension provided for by the agent of thomson french at the moment when morrel expected it least was to the poor shipowner so decided a stroke of good fortune that he almost dared to believe that fate was at length grown weary of wasting her spite upon him   12.004146866246217
you all know that i had the fancy of going to africa   3.85245111317583
do so then   8.785397852829071
still this extraordinary silence appeared strange to him and he called a second and third time   14.0088760950843
as to getting him drunk the duke couldn t hope to do that and he laughed at the mere thought of it   11.04003320284278
when he presented himself at the gate the porter informed him that the count had gone out about half an hour previously   11.074018855573788
punctuality   9.901974951320293
but pride but self love but madness silenced this voice and stifled its murmurs   11.207972162041647
he reflected upon the different characters of those with whom he was going to fight and began to view his situation more clearly   12.613550226645097
and if the action goes off well you may reckon upon a similar sum to morrow   18.855351221598355
this will give a faint idea of the carnival at rome   18.595635582630365
we are returning to his eminence monsieur the chevalier said athos advancing   9.286233838900923
porthos placed his hand on the pistols   11.984698729954317
speak to the governor then   6.883626300359546
then all looked at each other he was made to take an oath and did so but with such an ill grace that it was really tempting providence to swear thus and yet in spite of that the general was allowed to depart free perfectly free   14.093772846839219
i will say two words about it to the cardinal s esquire likewise   8.167235524277713
but he was pleased with his falsehood   4.4693508548620535
you mean to take your horse   13.547004262581675
i neither remembered having undressed myself nor going to bed   6.261607324362777
i go he said only shall i enter the chamber where those gentlemen are   13.880019608093285
well then with the first money i touch i mean you to have a small house with a garden in which to plant clematis nasturtiums and honeysuckle   13.359415403344478
the piercing eye of monte cristo glanced through clusters of bushes and trees and was soon relieved from all anxiety for seeing a shadow glide between the yew trees monte cristo recognized him whom he sought   9.13664630929182
a fearful agony pervaded her frame and she sank panting into the arms of porthos and aramis   12.906723661922149
she drew her husband to the door   15.71451153574671
athos and aramis turned also and went to salute the coadjutor and the duc de beaufort   9.78556839305147
that is what i want   10.273590810940494
and who is this witness or rather this enemy   14.285624745834067
we have a king ten years old who doesn t yet know what he wants   9.419455442156725
stake both pardieu   15.246385580851008
yes for an instant i hoped it was so   14.329001048685596
it is because i am in a worse humor than usual replied danglars   15.071003575589938
count he inquired have you any relations   10.328035458797114
the reputation of being out of his mind though harmlessly and even amusingly so had procured for the abbé unusual privileges   11.439858063786016
flints and pebbles had been inserted around it so as to conceal the orifice   7.224751826798384
your eminence may perceive continued athos knitting his brow for this sort of investigation began to annoy him that we have not come out without our arms   12.44840387388085
his cassock is a burden to him and i imagine i have had enough of mine   13.767559255343855
the two friends recalled by d artagnan to what was also due to porthos pressed his hand in their turn   12.761603523518282
the worthy mercer had immediately upon re entering his house informed his wife of his happy return and his wife had replied by congratulating him and telling him that the first moment she could steal from her duties should be devoted to paying him a visit   10.808526557009895
why is it not done already   14.970653441666279
do you intend to stand on ceremony because you are less attached to me than you were   13.395929192583225
impossible you a favorite of the minister   15.919043424287127
and we can now hear how the poor child is   11.307698058320025
where has he gone   10.581095345128249
then he looked around him and really recognized his dungeon   13.59256607082024
i have now the boldness to ask you for an interview of half an hour   14.648893836781756
have you ever seen the queen of england   13.575879523640433
he fell down this morning and broke his leg   11.528908651393541
fourteen years had changed the worthy merchant who in his thirty sixth year at the opening of this history was now in his fiftieth   11.093033358340575
then cried franz it is hashish   13.575222987913353
he was evidently ill at ease   4.9612857653324856
count may i suggest one idea to you   15.762123957190013
i speak of that adventure in behalf of the queen of the ornaments of the journey you made with three of your friends   14.017996135907559
all this was done in silence and from the moment that their course was changed not a word was spoken   11.67298012686339
answered the voice   12.64025100026262
said the queen to de winter he is one of my faithful adherents   13.96596154838376
he would have found in what fashion we had executed his commission   11.956832485145519
dantès carefully collected the plaster carried it into the corner of his cell and covered it with earth   6.8762302581407395
they will think we are trying to leave england and will search for us at the ports   10.781526348902862
the murdered man lay on the floor his head leaning against the wall and about him was a pool of blood which poured forth from three large wounds in his breast   10.342505019518203
but for heaven s sake resumed aramis   12.539808556733934
that is true said his antagonists   14.939074712395254
the vessel in which you wished to fry us is still smoking   13.274785689533147
they had found the door of the grotto opened and gone forth   15.717946858687593
monsieur she said i i do not understand you   11.931512230583849
thought villefort whose position demanded much reserve but who was longing to know what his father s intentions were   14.385374179865925
tell me what it says   12.611044113658348
charles shook his head   14.475482300054521
what do you think of our lover   12.216786815493903
you would expose the self love of another with a hatchet but you shrink if your own is attacked with a needle   13.213477931931699
well you do not reply   17.751748866383714
i think that disgust is even more sickening than hatred   13.729511502834253
oh if that were so i should lose my reason   12.609704313619968
when you complied with this twofold request you well knew we did not wish to secure the throne of louis xviii   9.328148963971175
and said the prisoner what talk is there of war with spain   10.379928048723809
it is a man then who expects you   12.619514570289683
now it seems that he has carried off the prize awarded by the jockey club   18.030472654347683
besides which the king fifteen years afterward gave him also this ewer and a sword which you may have seen formerly in my house also a lovely specimen of workmanship   11.954084545324935
where is he now   7.639510693783864
besides your fortune may perhaps be the result of your devotedness   14.019548462945151
well by means of these lines which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth and the ellipse it describes round the sun i am enabled to ascertain the precise hour with more minuteness than if i possessed a watch   14.89170148993595
he added turning towards bertuccio   12.732687393490137
oh i am aware of that said madame de villefort   6.470272950535134
my poor grandmother gets worse and worse   8.674947367430942
fortunately monsieur d artagnan is in our hands and you shall be confronted with him   9.404548368072529
you would rather be killed than desert your post   6.940425686593452
cried he throwing his sword upon the bed this man must be the devil in person   12.527714060421419
it relates to mademoiselle marie michon   8.583598759114336
oh yes said buckingham grating his teeth with rage   15.520430329383373
he who fires the first shot rarely hits his man for he fires with the apprehension of being disarmed before an armed foe   9.982946668832895
this man who had remained immovable as bronze when menaced by the mob not a muscle of whose face was stirred either at mazarin s witticisms or by the jests of the multitude seemed to the cardinal a peculiar being who having participated in past events similar to those now occurring was calculated to cope with those now on the eve of taking place   11.829738568258982
athos however perpetually recurred to his proposed interview with the queen   12.475945792756516
and i may even say the sight of you increases my dismay   10.032845779214389
at the end of the first attack i discovered symptoms of tetanus   14.12903647697348
athos is right you have my adoration said aramis in his turn pressing his hand   10.778756351956153
it is that of a friend who will love you to his last sigh   12.214515733908486
if you had been contented with drinking well and good   14.049509405153929
at the footman s announcement she raised herself a little and peeped out with some curiosity   16.438525775582242
now replied the count shrugging his shoulders shall i tell you the cause of all these stupidities   21.210675129950324
said benedetto   16.612497159464084
this youth is an orphan deserted by his mother who left him in the house of a poor country priest   15.439828813810148
then he raised to his lips the repast that like a voluntary tantalus he refused himself   7.963701261614998
he would fain have continued but his knees trembled and his heart beat so violently and his sight became so dim that he was forced to pause   11.157383453453274
is there anything extraordinary in a journey   14.183579694992925
come come gentlemen remove the fellow   13.116903658650795
for instance was marvellously served by his conscience after the putting away of the two children of edward iv   17.311765071135223
this moment was frightful   7.584718879262197
so i presume said athos that you have a large number of the nobles with you   13.084961663574857
i dare not return with those dreadful horses said madame de villefort   13.613935779654167
grimaud can take care of the horses said planchet   14.118932888125393
bazin sighed   9.103959854725055
his fear was lest the governor touched with pity might order him to be removed to better quarters and thus separate him from his young companion   13.655676020766657
i was about to give it when you anticipated me   11.833491042614373
they questioned him as to his sentiments but he contented himself with answering that the letters from the island of elba ought to have informed them franz interrupted himself by saying my father was a royalist   11.872072035597812
yesterday i was at your house sir said the young man   11.615914320838266
you drive the dying to despair instead of consoling them   13.407552445415552
bah exclaimed monte cristo that s a fine reason to give   12.29743547748309
said a voice   10.7247015166966
but don t sleep as you do all the time   16.683001206412044
his arms became stiff his legs lost their flexibility and he was almost breathless   13.535024927670776
what could put such an idea into your head   2.960841262866758
the red cap of one of the sailors hung to a point of the rock and some timbers that had formed part of the vessel s keel floated at the foot of the crag   15.717158293926895
then d artagnan ceased knocking and prayed with an accent so full of anxiety and promises terror and cajolery that his voice was of a nature to reassure the most fearful   10.976223625101568
your history is a terrible one mr   15.454832386323854
thou alone on the contrary knowest how to choose thy object and to gain it stealthily   13.20266284609623
are become our most dangerous enemies athos   14.630665009495663
debray why instead of going direct to him do you come and tell me of it   10.257996394139166
he was a fine tall slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty with black eyes and hair as dark as a raven s wing   15.071093530754016
and do you think your power as great with the fraternity as monsieur le curé told me it was just now   14.003198016117631
when the evening came i was so weak that every time i fainted i thanked god for i thought i was about to die   6.894564795311314
i ll manage it somehow you will see   5.077479059539508
it seemed to him that the island trembled to its base and that it would like a vessel at anchor break moorings and bear him off into the centre of the storm   8.92225222064808
aramis dismounted and went to porthos whilst athos approached d artagnan   11.989630673241077
and now he said may i inquire what are the orders with which your majesty deigns to honor me   12.05264754731243
he therefore went forward without a moment s hesitation although there was no beaten track but he knew his path by looking at the trees and bushes and thus they kept on advancing for nearly an hour and a half   14.854506207951276
he left the mercer quite astonished at his singular farewell and asking himself if he had not been a little inconsiderate   13.781767961207095
i have to pay a visit this evening replied he   9.801739332399137
chapter 101   13.062045054332657
let me see said the count   10.326591212587848
there are so many things which may save unhappy beings such as we are   14.594922130182137
but athos was a man of inflexible determination   15.469195760645684
all these cloaks gray or black were raised behind by the point of a sword or before by the barrel of an arquebuse or a musket   11.04842591663012
instinctively dantès turned round to observe by what watch or clock the abbé had been able so accurately to specify the hour   8.193777588970526
cried buckingham becoming as pale as a corpse   13.315500162948718
monte cristo looked at her with an indescribable expression of interest and pity   16.269583894013195
my god said valentine raising both her hands to heaven with a sublime expression i have done my utmost to remain a submissive daughter   9.253352517862073
there is nobody within said bonacieux   10.174890838709993
milady was livid   8.867142415000883
and they hastened to quit the palace followed by bazin who was lavish of bows and compliments   12.332746648326182
well then your guest will be poisoned at the fifth remove and die at the end of eight or ten days of pains in the intestines sickness or abscess of the pylorus   16.10464128128123
he will be condemned will he not   9.742901909346578
the rapidity of his walk heated his blood still more   10.41094239890483
it was pointed and divided at the nib like an ordinary pen   11.430589876094489
i can not speak latin responded the marquise   4.901513311340668
you are most kind   12.674541215777808
no said the paralytic   11.81717091896549
after the siege i shall enter the house of the lazarists   8.412395313683426
for monsieur de wardes   12.288771425842745
and the wife of king charles   12.655672448681756
a slight click of the tongue against his teeth informed athos of the gascon s uneasiness   11.869546700599354
these rochellais are bungling fellows said athos   17.161971496152688
but to you d artagnan i am i hope still dear athos your comrade your friend   14.30222646080572
fortunately he is a cunning fellow that friend caderousse   11.754538242438926
you tell me of m   13.670882124120473
that you knew it and i was not informed of it   18.35441767986047
the door opened the two gendarmes gently pushed him forward and the door closed with a loud sound behind him   17.319184878643668
the four friends seated themselves on the ground with their legs crossed like turks or even tailors   14.518248595539848
yes sir answered the host even more surprised at the question than he had been by the silence which had preceded it   14.952996568512317
but leave us i pray you   13.192373714293208
sir beware of driving us to despair   8.796741933887482
and that the left hand should not be less liberal than the right she drew from her finger a diamond similar to the one formerly given to him take and keep this ring in remembrance of me   12.497947966971632
they kept their word and never stirred said mordaunt   14.191860045677014
i beg you to do so replied albert   16.405918303186247
because there is a little secret a precaution i thought it desirable to take one of huret fichet s locks revised and improved by gaspard caderousse   8.339598796021882
at this fernand recollected her threat of dying if edmond died and dropped again heavily on his seat   9.203997688203177
you will get yourself exiled as you did in the time of louis xiii   8.237065848646601
50035m well said eugénie cheerfully we have then only to pack up our trunks   11.11248525254895
you will be lost   18.952173090477807
murmured the count of morcerf   15.093471173448911
it seemed to explain to him the change in athos   13.749847629980081
meantime he was going to try to find out milady   10.895547769713808
you had the nightmare that s all   17.671099121324275
andrea took the pen   11.784996391586487
milady sat down to table ate from several dishes drank a little spanish wine and felt all her resolution return   8.437450434434396
is the baroness at home   6.324672885008528
now said the baron look at this woman   11.941342474747344
and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the envy of someone   13.456015378937723
nothing more just   15.004809712091918
he might fail but something must be left to chance   10.93927704423459
debray continued when you receive this you will no longer have a husband   10.113590607439486
is not it true you fellows there   14.1352021145049
if he had insisted upon the letter being given up to him i would have presented the letter to him with one hand and with the other i would have run my sword through his body   10.593923534819641
to tuscany   13.138791688064389
they were in earnest conversation   12.401466398192536
i never meddle save with what concerns me and i know how to make believe that i haven t seen what does not concern me   15.381990812995376
said she hesitatingly   13.482816214208423
as for you viscount continued monte cristo to morcerf you are more fortunate than the government for your arms are really beautiful and speak to the imagination   10.278552151192052
all at once she paused a livid flash darted from her eyes   12.44338783489089
i am so little mistaken that in ten minutes you shall be arrested and in an hour i shall set off at the head of my army to release my minister   15.832752867859819
de rochefort enter said mazarin eagerly on hearing their names pronounced   14.124012693711872
now as upon this audience in his gascon imagination depended his future life he saluted aramis and porthos politely declaring that he would not resume the game until he should be prepared to play with them on more equal terms and went and took his place near the cord and in the gallery   17.760074622048517
in your place in truth sire i should yield to such powerful instance   16.283807807629913
when he was within twenty paces of it he heard a noise of people and the carriage stopped   6.493181258672443
nothing said the king nothing   9.097433961920233
cried milady trying to drag the young woman along by the arm   8.69827969720571
the king has made him a baron and can make him a peer but he can not make him a gentleman and the count of morcerf is too aristocratic to consent for the paltry sum of two million francs to a mésalliance   14.478486941323938
murmured caderousse   11.66787869195055
truly it is i who am mad and you prove to me that passion blinds the most well meaning   13.347592861750803
she then added this young madcap is however very nearly right and merely re echoes what he has heard me say with pain a hundred times   11.305100014401335
i will answer them both and contrary to the usual method the last first because it is the least difficult   10.759283555481646
royal honors to one whom they have murdered   11.825667856778852
but i shall make you lose your balance and we shall both be dashed to pieces   16.076723419321723
good said monte cristo smiling   6.815042468132415
come take a little oath for me on the cross   11.176587829116292
i know you are not rich madame coquenard and that your husband is obliged to bleed his poor clients to squeeze a few paltry crowns from them   13.332153935470036
to the installation of my rival at m   10.185326280125945
0161m villefort by a strong effort sought to control himself   19.607038273400093
you refer to the terrible rumors spread abroad in the world that the deaths which have kept me in mourning for the last three months and from which valentine has only escaped by a miracle have not happened by natural means   9.144769310868147
they were therefore much astonished and delighted in the regiment when they saw the young man come back safe and sound   9.938511833545327
by the streets morbleu   14.395316309488376
though he had acknowledged his guilt he was protected by his grief   8.809690548986806
and planchet took his place in d artagnan s suite with that sublime confidence he had always had in his master which even fifteen years of separation had not destroyed   16.166554687767253
we no longer talk we rise to dissertation   17.06085585654404
and at the same minute a carriage with smoking horses accompanied by two mounted gentlemen arrived at the gate which opened before them   15.699600239779535
o reilly you are my prisoner   6.733774516565237
that s a pity said athos coolly   16.59931061240117
it is bad news   11.233936546295958
and he opened the door with a trembling hand into the second compartment where mousqueton and blaisois were preparing supper   12.072308134027754
for this purpose i applied all the strength i possessed to force an entrance from the cramped spot in which i lay to the adjoining room   8.854522250787133
five millions   11.621049478871962
what would your excellency like to eat   10.116490888859392
and what does he mean by his news from greece   10.630805366965282
indeed his griefs hopes and fears on that subject might furnish material for a most touching and pathetic poem   14.082574496219335
yes i am going   11.523103822820788
mother and son chapter 92   10.893345547388815
accept that which the bearer brings you   7.259617372107991
bonacieux d artagnan turned toward her   14.52160042503115
this calmness was more alarming to the two women than the deepest dejection would have been   13.533632523035639
while the struggle between day and night lasted dantès still doubted   11.849548773169511
two ladders were hidden in the clover field   13.879503662409972
the latter sure of quelling the tempest when the waves became too violent allowed them to rise to a certain pitch that he might be revenged on the importunate andrea and besides it would afford him some recreation during the long day   13.703319925824633
there s the article of remunerations and indemnifications to be discussed and set to rights   11.512328059395168
i have mine said madame de villefort   10.752001080811176
but was it on her own account or on account of another that she exposed herself to such hazards   13.132538177758036
you must form honorable friendships and by that means counteract the prejudice which may attach to the obscurity of your former life   14.619846304722355
nevertheless he still saw grimaud with his lantern in front advancing   13.055173428023505
oh i would rather mount the scaffold of my brother louis xvi   11.664500857572623
does anyone know anything of a count of monte cristo   10.115313762424663
she ran to the window and opened it   10.372474830587718
have you seen the greek mistress   13.74220862963294
i could not have thought that there was an englishman in all england who would have required so long an explanation to make him understand of whom i was speaking   15.001745000944174
i saw notwithstanding the darkness a shadow which approached my bed   12.95704353439523
well so much the better   15.966605104278482
his eagle eye made him known and his blows proclaimed the hero   11.22251650116101
and now he has sent for you that i may repeat them to you   16.499023842703423
if any are missing when the fete is over i shall replace them   14.573572543433642
my dear albert one word for i must give poor lucien a respite   14.270089835591078
have you seen d artagnan   11.669945586123678
de villefort promised you said the gendarme but i know we are taking you to the château d if   14.576224297819708
twice or thrice during the dance the young girl had glanced at luigi and each time she saw that he was pale and that his features were agitated once even the blade of his knife half drawn from its sheath had dazzled her eyes with its sinister glare   9.49959214949122
if we follow the escort we shall find everything devoured and die of hunger   14.33716839321529
nothing good replied porthos   12.126157287894005
in short he had been a soldier and arms ennoble a man   11.387344591735392
said barrois   13.519727312016983
one day the old man fell ill and died   9.766643790215335
your son says he requires money   12.272562370268448
felton uttered a cry and rushed toward her   13.471373770093521
one evening he mixed a powerful narcotic with my water   9.383948770841975
you approach that famous point of free will which is a mortal rock   15.273680008993695
patience had in vain been recommended to them by reports of brilliant victories gained by france   7.4403149396273385
the people listened to these words and let go the ladies who thanked d artagnan with an eloquent look   12.381319263668745
all these proofs of an energetic resolution which albert did not fear on his own account alarmed him for his mother   13.523905670928801
in the first blazed piles of golden coin   10.95880334541977
then the first pangs of an unending torture seized upon his heart   9.032059488351484
one man was killed on the spot and two others were severely wounded   11.105969238003102
if these five men give themselves up we gag them   10.083369472428684
so my dear host be not uneasy and continue to take all the care of him that his situation requires   10.71998164916691
faria as we have said without having recovered the use of his hand and foot had regained all the clearness of his understanding and had gradually besides the moral instructions we have detailed taught his youthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner who learns to make something from nothing   11.782238032506381
we came here only to express our loyalty and to say that we are at your lordship s service and his most faithful servants   9.048064568065744
this woman is certainly a great liar   6.956384053873312
yes my lord i hate him   9.317232497658843
it is not a law but merely a custom and i pray of you do not cite this custom in your favor   13.05115457137525
to you alone then may i confide my sorrows and my hopes   9.862883427259575
i tendered my resignation for when you have gained your epaulets on the battle field you do not know how to manœuvre on the slippery grounds of the salons   15.019764170289903
we come from paris yes replied athos with the same courtesy   13.940767728027886
i shall only have to cross the river and i shall be in a foreign country   11.058119129667912
it however likewise appeared that the soldier on duty a zealous catholic no doubt shook off the charm for through the door he called hold your tongue madame   11.17862996604741
the laborers began to jeer the travelers and by their insolence disturbed the equanimity even of the cool athos who urged on his horse against one of them   9.066626098038856
i will restore you to liberty this moment   6.405773082451304
but who can describe the thousand means of extinguishing the moccoletto   12.218603864862274
and from that moment the sieur de la coste was charged with the care of all the doors and all the avenues   6.258654205645236
there was a moment s silence it was evident that the doctor was examining the dead body   16.624417362373762
excuse me sir returned raoul blushing still more deeply i know no more than i did before   11.044251900568776
fernand made no reply nor did he attempt to check the tears which flowed down the cheeks of mercédès although for each of these tears he would have shed his heart s blood   8.975050454041714
you will take it to the count and say that although in haste to attend the chamber my master came out of his way to have the honor of calling upon him   10.09034612959532
when the afternoon arrived and he felt that the hour was drawing near he wished for solitude his agitation was extreme   11.843755839564723
good day dear friend   13.14678258434734
but it was too late   12.70922005259701
only it seems to me that your majesty goes too far in engaging to load us with a friendship so far above our merit   14.499029551401822
then i have your leave sir   14.830633002787684
he has received visits from the coadjutor from madame de longueville and the prince de conti   7.922792057913731
yes yes said danglars laughing it would do her a great deal of good   16.93074840030565
around in the crevices of the rocks grew a few dwarf oaks and thick bushes of myrtles   15.457719897528904
however be that as it may the young man made a tunnel how or by what means no one knows   10.88124688753684
do you think then monsieur that we shall travel faster with two horses apiece   14.728607716565103
but it is something that you believe so   16.59842762458319
oh yes said the count   9.577953884571423
this is the point of departure   10.644136896645987
that of athos carelessness   10.465059845631993
madame de villefort had multiplied her questions in order to gain one answer but to all her inquiries m   9.46414274575643
but count do you remember that the 5th of october child replied the count not to know the value of a man s word   14.530418189495265
alone and free to act as he wished the man then drew from his pocket something which the count could not discern placed it on a stand then went straight to the secretaire felt the lock and contrary to his expectation found that the key was missing   12.121128493546559
and your slave   11.447706097229117
blaisois obeyed   12.409253386520058
we were coming from syracuse laden with grain   14.487527430725056
with two companions   14.286019095659192
still they may have concealed some precious stone some valuable diamond   13.23176697420844
kill the sentinel who guards it and make our escape   13.02081498467991
today let us fill our stomachs and not our memories   9.2177396513271
did you never hear talk of a young woman who was carried off one night   13.264249359157521
and where is the governor   13.152999525063354
you said prince did you not   9.809203175856517
yes monseigneur said d artagnan   14.66432820252633
devil take me if i taste one of them   12.158666203266723
hold yourself ready then to join me at the champs élysées and lead me out of this house without anyone seeing my departure   7.476705303190028
she remained at the same spot standing mute and motionless   15.47936071664035
said the queen you bring us three things which we have not seen for a long time   15.278985905683395
on the contrary what can you mean   12.072224709427964
and in short whether you consider yourself capable of resuming and retaining in the world the high position to which your rank entitles you   12.938328864763303
not much only two inches an hour but still it rose   14.170550742682632
fresh sharpened by his victory full of hopes of future favor he was resolved not to recoil a step   13.315652485914896
my dear albert returned franz your answer is sublime and worthy the let him die of corneille only when horace made that answer the safety of rome was concerned   6.40027848623769
exclaimed morrel   13.390115766329606
my dear cousin i think i shall make up my mind to set out for béthune where my sister has placed our little servant in the convent of the carmelites   11.409071095126508
franz was deeply affected   14.76823104379604
just at this time the famous massacres took place in the south of france   14.351454129234995
the yard was empty   8.70559686074288
the room was inundated with blood dripping from the mattresses upon which lay the wounded man speechless   4.347196592060934
there are hours which last a year   11.920759456881939
but this first desire of the heart is imperious   10.106825850998884
aramis less self controlled fumbled continually with his hidden poniard   9.778492518009614
morrel still alive   14.515976913378529
planchet seeing there was no longer any hope of making his master renounce his project heaved a profound sigh and set to work to groom the third horse   7.774566030487602
all these hopes were so many sweet thoughts for milady   11.751338172035016
sir interposed monsieur de flamarens to athos if we are mistaken the error has originated with the queen   8.474041453472205
you are not monte cristo   16.26316533580338
yes sir continued the inspector of prisons   11.848507785356862
we must seize the felucca said aramis   15.13552497230578
i stooped to examine it was the second pistol which had not gone off probably from the powder being wet   13.99124759986827
a small low door gave egress from the walled space we have been describing into the projected street the ground having been abandoned as unproductive by its various renters and had now fallen so completely in general estimation as to return not even the one half per cent it had originally paid   9.068884886748965
my lord said d artagnan will lend his which is of no use to him to the comte de la fere   11.09195564780779
continued athos the poor abbé was not a st   9.315072653347698
aramis and athos were astounded by the calmness even the gayety of the queen s manner   18.36005575565717
and if on the contrary you believe it to be him state your reasons for doing so   8.516305305500195
by adding all that he heard from the mouth of the young man to his own remembrances he was enabled to form a pretty exact idea of a position of the seriousness of which for the rest the queen s letter short but explicit gave him the clue   14.406486198406041
i agree with you there   15.250692339523177
the blow was direct and he replied rather dryly all this appears to me to be ill conceived disjointed gentlemen   11.537985896573494
in all 287 500 francs   8.243990136182159
but to leave the country to fly together to reach another part of france where they might live at ease because unknown money was necessary   8.320329982150573
at the same time he was a man of elegant manners and strong mind so that in addition to the revolution he had made in war by his new contributions to its methods he had also made a revolution at paris among the young noblemen of the court whose natural chief he was and who in distinction from the social leaders of the ancient court modeled after bassompierre bellegarde and the duke d angouleme were called the petits maitres   15.610243320371463
i have only to say after the little that i have seen and heard that i think even better of you than i have been told   13.021661406838888
i will answer for lord de winter as for myself   9.606427544780217
it s of no consequence   13.023719243314073
but two million francs make a nice little sum replied morcerf   12.84613695896999
but porthos i do not see him   8.712704921369873
what sort of men   8.959994053563909
and very princely added château renaud   8.740916656336285
be tranquil murmured milady   12.84869900097863
no monsieur be silent   11.126791243526794
first my stranger of meung   12.47840386422148
of three guardsmen of the company of m   12.004931486532715
comminges wounded by a stone which had struck him on the forehead had left a picket in the street and returned to the palais royal followed by a menacing crowd to tell his story   10.31626306906782
let us see said athos assuming in advance a critical look   12.971584043002567
well then if it be so are you ready albert   16.161533881641425
the more they are persecuted the more she thinks of them   12.317594610071795
we have already observed with what rapidity d artagnan seized the expression of a countenance   9.104945109964353
at these words the count s paleness which had for some time been increasing became alarming   11.793643779924409
when i perceived you i was just asking myself whether i had not wished harm towards those poor morcerfs which would have justified the proverb of he who wishes misfortunes to happen to others experiences them himself   13.051150122785632
is it really your intention to make me captain of the pharaon   6.940303355984052
i saw some very pretty woods which almost touch the convent garden   15.306464055219738
until to morrow evening you are not at your own disposal   14.238364409507371
on the other side the crimes the power and the infernal genius of milady had more than once terrified him   13.953873439359663
this doublet and hose though new were creased like traveling clothes for a long time packed in a portmanteau   9.406105065623642
i have been liberated by someone   6.8293813485515065
in that case my lord the time for words has passed and the hour for action is at hand   11.668412993786978
the deliberations had already begun   13.881584835904325
i can not i replied   11.586226453928836
cowardly court   14.90400219644538
i have driven away the swiss to humiliate you but i shall lodge here no longer   8.352081965338055
i can not answer for the queen   8.750850853459106
at this moment a sudden noise of footsteps was heard upon the stairs   14.91367943533864
he took monte cristo aside   14.757383380006035
the truth   11.419940185479499
all this i did scrupulously   12.35391567462208
with paris the bastile and our four bullies shall rot therein   12.707816707835764
monte cristo wrote i die murdered by the corsican benedetto my comrade in the galleys at toulon no   14.726216136820067
at these words with the most gallant air possible d artagnan drew his sword   11.416887201848082
this singular passion for a child of seven may some day make him very unhappy   14.493886822956515
he sought to open it   13.233309720230485
there was no child disinterred no   7.835615592176387
another idea presents itself what if they should be his hair stood on end   12.295406878718786
it is said that mazarin who though a cardinal had not taken such vows as to prevent it was secretly married to anne of austria   12.84748910626987
but the dead can not return their fire   12.669722326271689
this young man must not however fail in his duty said athos   14.519127099607159
each had his own particular visit to make   17.76677709486551
20347m excellent murmured monte cristo to himself as he came away   15.741455553682428
if i had wished to widen the breach between those whom monsieur d herblay chooses to receive with a rope ladder and those whom he receives with a wooden ladder i could have spoken out   10.352326193970004
are you not rather young m   12.737987611001662
when i need your assistance and the moment arrives i will come to you count   13.961859415322749
talking with you brings me misfortune said porthos   13.199799912164346
there is the subject simplified   10.027248225210068
three days after about seven o clock in the evening i saw a servant on horseback leave the house at full gallop and take the road to sèvres   7.678906059168569
alas madame said the procureur with his imperturbable calmness of manner i consider those alone misfortunes which are irreparable   14.803930315084054
emmanuel and that his business was with m   13.90231803810495
i am condemned   9.225407030823364
he was aware that opportunity has a forelock only for him who will take it and he was not a man to let it go by him without seizing it   13.390844668834449
however the vessel and the swimmer insensibly neared one another and in one of its tacks the tartan bore down within a quarter of a mile of him   17.107716244264406
the notary looked at villefort   13.689848062471347
we must use and not abuse said aramis sententiously   9.129689645331657
cried he to the coachman   18.60442500868715
it is a thing of the highest interest and upon which our future fortune perhaps depends   12.69336615142345
some complaints arose from the crowd and were addressed this time to the king as well as the minister   12.894343476559904
villefort approached noirtier   14.950254914131675
in ten minutes after the strangers had departed franz was on the road to the piazza di spagna listening with studied indifference to the learned dissertation delivered by albert after the manner of pliny and calpurnius touching the iron pointed nets used to prevent the ferocious beasts from springing on the spectators   13.662577469054657
the guardroom was filled with citizens and common people some playing some drinking some talking   12.456414583921442
was it worth while to wish me to swear this morning that i would mention the appointment to no one   7.571180368284798
ah take care you were teaching me just now how in case of an invitation to dinner one might creditably make an excuse   11.135601450463662
the inquiry is already made   11.405746380530136
she is said to possess as much wit and cleverness as beauty   9.661055972780188
between six and seven o clock the road of chaillot is quite deserted   9.597784305427407
i offered to pay them for cancelling the lease   11.821912861846174
he will convey you to a little port where certainly you are not expected and which is ordinarily only frequented by fishermen   12.715942092604653
her first look on entering the room was at noirtier whose face independent of the emotion which such a scene could not fail of producing proclaimed him to be in possession of his usual health   12.729588432416309
the island was utterly deserted and bore no evidence of having been visited since he went away   12.736422869235408
talking of countries replied franz of what country is the count what is his native tongue whence does he derive his immense fortune and what were those events of his early life a life as marvellous as unknown that have tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and gloomy a misanthropy   10.417743318442914
exteriorly nothing in the room showed that it was the habitation of an abbé   16.57834041576063
he had received a message from the prince to whom he had hastened with olivain the instant he had received it   12.76480138044014
why to accuse the man do you address the woman   12.232777388407193
the third attack chapter 20   13.540763171198963
i swear to you sir should any harm befall me your name will be the last name that i shall utter the remembrance of you my last thought   15.321049545492547
porthos had received a thrust through his arm and bicarat one through his thigh   9.490398533199732
you see we had each our mission said porthos   13.758724932068525
the effects are drawing near on the contrary   10.469180427742392
it was evident he had his orders   11.835257231296522
and in the politest tone monsieur duke said he to me and you madame continued he addressing the lady on my arm the doctor s niece   13.862699898106614
he had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he was almost like a commander on board   14.77356066971953
i know lavoisier and was the intimate friend of cabanis   12.990955139739011
and do you know what has become of him   9.972325908117673
silent shadows were seen unpaving the streets and others dragging and upsetting great wagons whilst others again dug ditches large enough to ingulf whole regiments of horsemen   13.547856190255718
come sir said comminges make haste   16.86961361247021
how not agreed about   13.148779583344865
and i have the honor of assuring you that i killed one of them with his own sword said aramis   12.84647656777642
and he fired two pistols   7.0811911406169115
did you take anybody with you when you put into the port of elba   14.403242362623285
speak sir speak boldly replied louis   11.122047501635421
at length he advanced toward the group the meaning of which he could not comprehend   11.627691225290386
athos did not trust this reply and he resumed   10.86928993048645
i have made an agreement with the navy that the access to my island shall be free of all charge   13.45940410801969
bonacieux knew that in talking of money to her husband she took him on his weak side   12.035873891714655
in the midst of this avenue was a nobleman dressed in green and with as much gilding about him as the iron gate riding on a tall horse   18.670702944304544
if i obtain the situation i desire i shall owe it to m   16.099585254085756
i understand he said you confess   12.707461755643976
the breakfast consisted of a piece of bread   7.627720376099244
everyone drew back and the man in the red cloak remained standing alone in the middle of the room   11.16181826120227
i remain here a day or two arrange accordingly   17.262840546610363
and that is exactly the snare the king s enemies are preparing for the poor child   13.086456321134575
and now you may ruin us all   11.501943080528982
and in his enthusiasm he struck a st   17.411590230838268
he therefore went down the rue des petits augustins and came up to the quay in order to take the new bridge   10.11574113649883
athos smiled with ineffable pleasure   9.376472596643541
but besides all this in order that the instrument may not be contested i am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity therefore one of my colleagues will help me and contrary to custom will assist in the dictation of the testament   10.09682678262838
but do you think we shall be permitted to see our poor edmond   15.317281007994374
one must replied monsieur de bouillon sacrifice one s comfort to the public good   13.936439131694978
in five minutes the malady will reach its height and in a quarter of an hour there will be nothing left of me but a corpse   13.21359655749181
keep the 50 000 francs you have left i give them to you   9.782469944718388
fortunately i don t know where he is   12.106412935054431
but it will never succeed now for they attempted it fruitlessly and napoleon was unable to complete his work   18.65125126977518
i do not patronize m   13.217027674198441
tiboulen and lemaire were therefore the safest for dantès venture   11.202905172695008
that would give me an idea of how i looked when i arrived in paris   10.713957335369841
oh that s very well young man continued m   10.646157836675707
why of downright starvation   18.964127640620774
let me meditate and consider   11.903121065109945
the smugglers chapter 23   14.23303420405164
you see said the king that it is useless for you to resist   12.218199210787642
the men run no other danger than that of falling in love with you and the women of falling ill of jealousy at seeing you so lovely   13.448634338771587
the fish bites the fish bites   10.842064226935117
thanks thanks said monte cristo judging from the steward s utter prostration that he could not stretch the cord further without danger of breaking it   12.537151895547726
athos foreseeing the period when he should make a soldier of the viscount had inured him to all kinds of arduous undertakings   9.195566930440041
here you are   10.23334126952264
carlini flew joyfully to rita telling her she was saved and bidding her write to her father to inform him what had occurred and that her ransom was fixed at three hundred piastres   10.70965729359683
madame de villefort followed the litter in her carriage   11.472132236745022
barrois his features convulsed his eyes suffused with blood and his head thrown back was lying at full length beating the floor with his hands while his legs had become so stiff that they looked as if they would break rather than bend   10.81447692089721
a man arrived yesterday from yanina bringing a formidable array of documents   13.200100342816361
now if you please remove your bandage   14.208599405789805
he took it up and as he took it he made a low bow   16.605178441933766
if it were not ridiculous to make a display of our triumph said morrel i would invite the count to our house   13.805066405291853
and your friend for instance   12.52182603482023
so that said the abbé with a bitter smile that makes eighteen months in all   10.868872953885694
i was taken to the slave market and was purchased by a rich armenian   18.39643698803318
said julie will you restore him to us cured of his melancholy   14.909843686093657
can t you guess my dear athos   12.142588478648722
none of those interesting adventures fell in his way   7.874811956513209
these exploits had gained luigi considerable reputation   13.04270392745858
they went on through the darkness silent as phantoms   16.671389425391368
don t laugh my friend   11.436934567610363
after having stood a few minutes in the cavern the atmosphere of which was rather warm than damp dantès eye habituated as it was to darkness could pierce even to the remotest angles of the cavern which was of granite that sparkled like diamonds   14.331301480225118
this secret passage is still to be seen in the palais royal   8.973165160865253
the young men loaded the pistols in case of a skirmish and they awoke in despair having both dreamed that they had arrived too late to participate in the battle   8.31913184830885
no sir he had not because he applied to me six months ago for the particulars he required and as i did not know when i might again come to paris i recommended m   17.122952205863854
d artagnan was about to assure aramis that he could descend easily when an idea came into his head which silenced him   9.26595515099241
come come cried d artagnan we must finish with this and in his turn he pressed mordaunt hard who continued to lose ground but evidently on purpose and without letting his sword leave the line for a moment   15.328149225088126
thanks to this stroke of business the four friends were able to take away with them a sum of money which if not large was sufficient as a provision against delays and accidents   10.324506845380249
danglars who thought himself threatened certain consciences are never calm danglars even before his guests showed a countenance of abject terror   12.037138777614851
i am pleased with one place and stay there   7.393975138846503
to speak its language tolerably to make a good appearance to be a good gamester and to pay in cash   10.60117239555061
that s my opinion too said the captain and i ll take precautions accordingly   7.766361608492679
ich bin ein deutscher replied the prisoner   6.008398859775998
now understand me said the count no direct questions my dear morcerf   10.808699496598418
so far as i can judge i suppose this to be a quarter of my father s revenue   14.081163250241016
but the walls were solid rock a man was sitting reading at the only outlet to the cell and behind that man shapes armed with guns continually passed   15.572090121459155
he had frequently called for capital punishment on criminals and owing to his irresistible eloquence they had been condemned and yet the slightest shadow of remorse had never clouded villefort s brow because they were guilty   14.662654226271009
as to planchet he has certain reasons for not going to court   12.475721285216997
but as i am very hungry pray allow me to eat   13.291111229139233
then you yourself are one of these marked beings   10.570577165963522
the spaniards   12.174425546584628
oh d artagnan my beloved d artagnan   15.589854620301228
do you hear that madame   12.235746617771058
you are afraid are you   13.840795800118988
i in my quality of journalist open all the theatres to him   16.2909977823773
he began by asking m   11.641806128292364
and i set off without waiting for one but he called me back and gave me this   16.382365119260925
and your business is that of a confectioner in the rue des lombards   15.915018705650478
on going home the two friends found a letter from athos who desired them to meet him at the grand charlemagne on the following day   8.368264878149898
your misfortunes engaged his sympathies so you see you must have been interesting   13.108478186600445
franz d épinay and she shall marry him   11.016285830681102
you know me well enough   13.476637685989523
he was no longer astonished when he searched on to find in the register this note placed in a bracket against his name edmond dantès   9.770144849940724
this agitation in one so cold and calm as athos frightened him   7.410248769851368
his profession must have made him renounce any great undertakings   8.774381010160045
that at the moment of arresting in the very act with all the proofs about her the queen s emissary to the exiled duchess a musketeer had dared to interrupt the course of justice violently by falling sword in hand upon the honest men of the law charged with investigating impartially the whole affair in order to place it before the eyes of the king louis xiii   14.033026458649017
and he who changes them will follow friend caderousse lay hands on him and demand what farmers pay him their rent in gold   11.888939761771399
cried all the guests simultaneously   14.677983250758414
your highness will approach the walls and call out to a man who works in the moat to send them back again   11.943515827302477
i shall live   11.27075290436404
yes i know it   3.514044623625887
and what is your deduction from this compensation sir   13.78635530397708
must i take anything with me   11.424640310859285
and i can t travel on my savings for in my twenty two years of service i have accumulated nothing but debts   10.722551528460372
come let us put aside all rancor and talk pleasantly   9.157473760700638
you think then said he that i am taken to the château d if to be imprisoned there   13.064380874272874
all at once he started   16.306323725191355
the joy of the king was lively   11.53559986299067
you certainly are a demon sent upon the earth   7.735495516535374
if the stranger expected to produce an effect on morrel he was not mistaken maximilian started as if he had been electrified   13.334060514584603
the officer followed her   10.053773542735883
poor assunta had guessed all   13.983444455911405
they looked at the cord still hanging from the loophole and broken at about twenty feet from the ground   10.251614952081194
had made restitution to the united provinces   13.986169535102327
at any rate said porthos i am glad to hear d artagnan admit that he is afraid   11.107458984768682
athos kissed the hem of the robe of the widowed queen and rising with a dignity that made a deep impression on those around i the comte de la fere a gentleman who has never deceived any human being swear before god and before this unhappy queen that all that was possible to save the king of england was done whilst we were on english ground   11.440266548314916
de salvieux to do so   10.998946855361257
oh madame said villefort deeply affected in spite of himself do not yield to those gloomy thoughts   9.326446256049032
come come said danglars tapping his fingers against the door i think it is quite time to think of giving me something to eat   16.609589827177835
the next day was spent as usual   11.109067157674192
said he eagerly   15.183346680272809
in the first place la rochelle appeared impregnable   14.30507982951573
kill as many as i could my lord   13.194831922450806
the inspector could not contend against this accusation   9.939719841675286
there is a carriage coming said château renaud   14.26476752740831
officer chapter lii   8.62525100377377
my shoulder quite burns   8.679630151360499
the queen was in the midst of her women mme   10.116656108215993
d artagnan dismissed planchet and requested his visitor to be seated   11.817103013476162
milady remained for some minutes in the same position for she thought they might perhaps be examining her through the keyhole   16.995929033204227
only for him it passed more slowly   6.6909992058512175
bonacieux yes there are traitors here   15.093068887314
after their departure fernand who had now again become the friend and protector of mercédès led the girl to her home while some friends of dantès conducted his father nearly lifeless to the allées de meilhan   15.885559810794964
my friend said athos he has given me news of raoul   14.145215138534006
what do you mean by tetragones   10.27635849351771
i do not enter the church   10.478340303748862
the hangings were of damask the carpets from alencon and the bed especially had more the look of a fine lady s couch with its trimmings of fine lace and its embroidered counterpane than that of a man who had made a vow that he would endeavor to gain heaven by fasting and mortification   9.158395771486003
well on the faith of a minister   11.109630521149969
the general proposed to cast lots for the swords but the president said it was he who had given the provocation and when he had given it he had supposed each would use his own arms   10.734545680868345
milady shuddered   10.78249754818789
he hastened to his cabinet   14.376528689411032
the heirs sought everywhere admired the breviary laid hands on the furniture and were greatly astonished that spada the rich man was really the most miserable of uncles no treasures unless they were those of science contained in the library and laboratories   6.229361094447359
sir began raoul with his usual politeness are you an ecclesiastic   14.069483166865375
and as often happens on such occasions from shame they passed to effrontery and two heads of clans advanced upon the king   12.509992713011801
of debray   11.69223542368802
how pale he is   11.40652027663114
and his whole appearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from their cradle to contend with danger   12.109372010818696
oh observed madame de villefort it must be an admirable anti spasmodic   8.28317082771408
while d artagnan was running through the streets and knocking at doors aramis had joined his companions   19.77703326007301
pray d artagnan said athos after a minute either take off that ring or turn the mounting inside   12.63387885044153
there was the king who made war against the cardinal   9.816476505185449
i did guess it replied the major with the greatest possible coolness   14.042813917799862
and since villefort the friend of danglars had acted in this way no one could suppose that he had been previously acquainted with or had lent himself to any of andrea s intrigues   12.076930115379918
three days afterward pistache was found dead poisoned   8.075837441959365
oh the train is well laid   16.1667699320017
all this while groslow and his men were assembled on deck   10.730219455306193
in the first horseman she recognized d artagnan   10.967234380061353
then said haydée proving by her remark that she had quite understood monte cristo s question and albert s answer then i will speak either in french or italian if my lord so wills it   7.944533285150685
therefore whenever you find any opportunity of saying something in my behalf i shall say it and you   11.826237012992918
nothing my lord   10.862360564294946
a deputation of two or four people   7.363357132048753
fair said athos is she not   10.634311877966981
my nurse lives there   5.678305210212924
and whom i advised you to strangle porthos said aramis   12.213827463697198
quick to the louvre said he to the louvre without losing an instant and let us endeavor to see the king before he is prejudiced by the cardinal   17.156692054067545
i say that you must surrender your sword to me monsieur and that without resistance   13.494676974342852
need we think of that since we are to save the king   10.06367293721593
all this will not advance your outfit said athos   13.63847704454096
mousqueton stood at the door and porthos was inside the carriage   17.548354390090438
panting with loss of breath he returned to the room he had just left   16.833358145386292
the name of one of the four friends is caderousse   12.219877792134795
la ramee laughed also and the guards laughed in chorus   9.121982076336783
danglars opened his enormous eyes on hearing this gigantic joke   17.17849987159104
you wore a robe of green satin embroidered with gold and silver hanging sleeves knotted upon your beautiful arms those lovely arms with large diamonds   12.611619013298156
i valued it much said mazarin giving a last look at it   15.93424472780901
d artagnan on the contrary quite full of his plans of conciliation and courtesy approached the young men with a profound bow accompanied by a most gracious smile   7.202387517549629
weak or strong repeated milady that man has then a spark of pity in his soul   16.15248662456458
that is all i was obliged to know and i beg i may not be asked for any further particulars   10.77125191576814
and then the baron hastened to the duke s chamber   10.849627217887825
and as a last memorial he looked round for some valuable object you will add he still sought   5.808418552278329
at the same time the crowd opened upset trodden down and an officer of the musketeers striking and cutting right and left rushed up to raoul and took him in his arms just as he was about to fall   13.709847513530253
and what did you reply to his most illustrious eminence   12.472597300534781
a summer ball the same day during the interview between madame danglars and the procureur a travelling carriage entered the rue du helder passed through the gateway of no   7.102920000163224
this is why i wish to set out again as soon as possible   10.765210683718282
she becomes at once a queen and a wife and it is impossible to thank and love her sufficiently   11.354405710339714
and here is your fowl   5.774777419400886
and in spite of himself the young man began to laugh aloud looking round carefully however to see that his solitary laugh without a cause in the eyes of passers by offended no one   7.969430894529378
said groslow   10.555194740425872
and with a boldness of which no bandit before him ever gave an example   11.073184510371629
the bed was the only one in the apartment which consisted of an antechamber and a bedroom   14.111760845686423
friend cried planchet   9.182354497716567
what do you say to this mother   18.123914539149897
but it is my lord giulio who cares about them   7.23708146757725
the other day it was barrois   11.327535115430086
said d artagnan you know you will not be my prisoner very long   9.883267514709587
since his majesty still lives since the honor of the throne is safe everything else is a matter of indifference to me   17.252545617877672
it is necessary that we should be more than complaisant to the count   12.5822916626668
and he began to laugh loudly but nervously   14.640366969321377
you recollect perfectly all i have told you do you not   11.571170350785927
he asked himself what had become of mercédès who must believe him dead   12.49464832831199
in case i am killed the captain s name is roger and the skiff is called the lightning   11.42361025606072
what should i care for either riches or poverty if my valentine was near me and i felt certain that no one could deprive me of her   8.30347480642822
villefort walked to and fro behind them   9.257288471080964
and then he charged with his twenty men and dispersed them in fear   11.983950545994078
i really never heard a person speak as you do   16.340093286116595
we have said that at half past twelve o clock madame danglars had ordered her horses and had left home in the carriage   10.450443045980967
i am john francis de winter he repeated and that woman well that woman   12.070623499870315
my father said i was his joy you style me your love and both of you have called me my child   13.358779075198274
then he offered us our liberty and we accepted it   13.59742830679963
as to the details the greater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in which we find the affairs of the testator and by yourself who having had the management of them can doubtless give full information on the subject   7.569319087852579
but there was such an ardor in his eyes such persuasion in his voice that she felt herself constrained to confide in him   12.709476233818924
said d artagnan rising and brushing his knees   9.996585233065986
la ramee went out   10.197031753546685
where to   13.691145997868064
and then myself covered with ridicule through the villany of benedetto   21.071809554594715
will you depart will you depart if i give you that you demand   9.292566730593386
but if it occurs a fourth time i shall complain of it so never mind   12.397999089582203
aramis porthos and d artagnan drew their chairs near him   9.700029526350418
yes sir answered caderousse   12.95115820836614
madame danglars   20.188765414475178
the duke in pronouncing these words suited as we have said the action to the words   8.451054511954979
short and stout   16.77579150889022
and he renewed the flame of his lance with a gesture which made one think of dionysus of old crete   17.445691233422558
you understand that interested as i am in this affair i can not see it in the same light as you do   5.625710243889934
he returned a sign in the negative   14.083343696520915
alas alas sir have pity on me   9.867735227535192
and without awaiting any reply disappeared behind a clump of trees and escaped to the house by a lateral alley   6.973600573308334
the comb was to be a leaden one because his beard like that of most fair people was rather red   8.05322905069785
he said i fancied this castle belonged to the ancient branch of orleans   16.1840921253324
as for you your captain is the prince understand that rightly   13.449195169442788
but said he did you observe one very singular thing   12.692408828527896
dantès saluted villefort and retired   6.599530148866121
d avrigny alone had followed madame de villefort with his eyes and watched her hurried retreat   12.182545607173756
suddenly a light passed over his face a smile played round his set mouth and his haggard eyes were fixed in thought   9.844664526021884
asked bertuccio   6.8544876736920575
all these successive accidents were perhaps the result of chance   14.60568911806959
my dear father said villefort i am on the contrary delighted   9.626261216341156
he had doublets cut out of his old clothes and cast off cloaks for mousqueton and thanks to a very intelligent tailor who made his clothes look as good as new by turning them and whose wife was suspected of wishing to make porthos descend from his aristocratic habits mousqueton made a very good figure when attending on his master   14.514810949695473
all england is with cromwell   9.718809298663576
the commissary designated by the same gesture athos and bonacieux let them be guarded more closely than ever   13.524078523077232
teresa uttered a cry of admiration   11.350790079721126
and extending his hand towards the table he seized a knife   15.548037459208013
the drop of water chapter lxiv   11.979592434963736
because you would bring us to ruin   12.30475517769873
it is at least a consolation to know that some who have so often risked their lives for us are safe   1.5363111818993733
grimaud therefore added nothing to his speech but contented himself with pointing his index finger in the direction of the hedge announcing by this gesture the cardinal and his escort   11.010993599799523
because then the affair will rest between you and beauchamp   14.642589227669353
dear grandpapa cried she what has happened   9.845042416871447
no no my dear edmond my boy my son   12.259413124555588
no you will not for he will tell you what is very true that perhaps there were fifty officers in the greek army bearing the same name   15.289108588538884
but whatever might be his speed the first who fired having had time to reload fired a second shot and this time so well aimed that it struck his hat and carried it ten paces from him   7.473333202735858
the treasure if it existed was buried in this corner   9.166537428732616
there came to the court an ambassador so brave so magnificent so elegant that every woman lost her heart to him   10.364035624135347
their connection could not last long without ruining both   11.854221199683408
always the same always the child s corpse coming every night in my dreams rising from the earth and hovering over the grave with menacing look and gesture   14.652731096681695
and the young man who had never shrunk from danger shrank before monte cristo with indescribable terror   18.06449050003287
the former had no doubt finished his questions for a moment later he said good night and carelessly followed the same path taken by the first cavalier   8.299273912503256
there are moments for if everything is not good everything in this world is not bad in which the most rigid and the coldest soul is softened by the tears of strong emotion heart arraigning sentiment one of these momentary impulses actuated anne   14.193688230458093
he fancied for a moment that he had been shot and listened for the report   13.695244731391359
in life our greatest preoccupation is death   10.7739230035385
so throwing himself back in his armchair he said with an arrogant and purse proud air let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your wishes   9.561080677592145
when the ladies had finished their supper the queen feigned extreme fatigue and passed into her bedroom   5.806339449000869
i will come again at that time replied the visitor who then retired   12.797129657422087
if you drag us both before a tribunal i will still say no my daughter is not guilty   6.557163267874835
she renewed the order relative to the gascon   11.416770546106555
his hand always wonderfully beautiful and strong was set off by a ruffle of lace like certain hands by titian and vandyck   9.393637287630387
hold your tongue stupid fellow said d artagnan   7.871453680277549
but in the obscurity of the church these things were not seen and porthos was still the handsome porthos   16.042547752043866
now and then a jolt more violent than the rest caused him to open his eyes   13.849896807582883
d artagnan has abducted my wife   17.313628113070212
the three friends were likewise greatly delighted   11.438641755446586
is it too long   8.071608884156124
about a year ago i talked of retiring to a convent   12.509977094973804
they carried him through an alley up a flight of stairs and deposited him in an antechamber   9.676032407631155
it was not over the downfall of the man but over the defeat of the napoleonic idea that they rejoiced and in this they foresaw for themselves the bright and cheering prospect of a revivified political existence   12.305256335496829
oh said danglars becoming very pale how you are running on   9.921752303111857
and the cardinal pointed with his finger to a chair for the young man who was so astonished at what was passing that he awaited a second sign from his interlocutor before he obeyed   8.680815518793274
you believe and yet you leave me in the hands of mine enemies of the enemy of england of the enemy of god   15.18944492709459
he passed his hand over his brow got into the carriage the door was closed on him and the vehicle quickly disappeared down the other side of the hill in a whirlwind of dust and noise   14.223440740857916
i killed one man if i recollect rightly replied d artagnan with a look of inquiry directed to athos   16.314461270630833
we only said he would escape   16.356748068843977
he rushed towards the door found it bolted and stopped shuddering   4.888574823786805
ah said monte cristo taking it from her hand   13.329676973231178
so much that i wonder how a man who can cook thus can complain of hard living   10.772104248021183
de bonaparte   14.440288253933645
faith yes with a haughty presence a fine equipage   15.248567720484255
cæsar thought they could make use of one of the means which he always had ready for his friends that is to say in the first place the famous key which was given to certain persons with the request that they go and open a designated cupboard   17.550725849275366
you see it makes a very respectable appearance   14.431679362661985
come come said danglars to himself now the thing is at work and it will effect its purpose unassisted   14.406050426455746
he set out and on the saturday evening reached the place de la douane by the mail coach   12.452409445674121
fighting here are you   7.395169891077078
that in triumphing over england he triumphed over buckingham in short that in humiliating england in the eyes of europe he humiliated buckingham in the eyes of the queen   10.409148100944785
around the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at such a time among people sufficiently free from the demands of social position not to feel the trammels of etiquette   14.204206021838408
madame i serve the king   13.42570580099986
she was sitting on a sofa placed in an angle of the room with her legs crossed under her in the eastern fashion and seemed to have made for herself as it were a kind of nest in the rich indian silks which enveloped her   15.548799331598037
the little house was surrounded by a low quickset hedge two or three feet high   8.862982725368177
it is not worthwhile to contradict me for such a trifle as that   13.877993793614868
you are insupportable   11.339420349547384
for he has to atone for past dereliction while i have no other impulse than warm decided preference and conviction   11.29024711702888
besides you must have perceived that the countess was really alarmed   12.326908967203835
once the cab was also passed by a calash rapidly whirled along by two post horses   15.713194735691886
the two travelers knocked at the door   15.451362837192733
when she was only about three steps from him he turned his head round fixing his eyes steadfastly upon the lady with the red cushion who had risen and was approaching followed by her black boy and her woman   5.671110216565083
he examined the register and found the following note concerning him edmond dantès violent bonapartist   9.70316549145766
take some she said   9.367846163952526
felton lowered his head without pronouncing a syllable   7.563688010822753
yes just so   11.328157340904578
he then endeavored to re enter the marvellous grottos but they had suddenly receded and now the path became a labyrinth and then the entrance vanished and in vain did he tax his memory for the magic and mysterious word which opened the splendid caverns of ali baba to the arabian fisherman   10.963361375576016
and if it be what i hope you will do well   11.432411374121765
then with a sigh poor haydée   14.287668739508085
ah replied the duke here i think is one of my servants who is seeking you   6.380095749505029
you incline me to think so said the king   15.896773319522188
if i live all would be changed   9.19429513654487
word of honor   11.350973279980835
what is my daughter doing   8.581150447361091
their doors seemed closed like their shutters but they were only pushed to in such a manner as to open and allow the men who seemed fearful of showing what they carried to enter closing immediately   4.546476817140767
said d artagnan do you begin to believe that it s a ruined cause and that what with your harrisons joyces bridges and cromwells we shall never get the upper hand   10.845183989566323
ah then indeed sir said the sweet girl bathed in tears i see that i am condemned to die   14.556636844226787
the king is but a man   11.722542846766693
de salvieux my brother s chamberlain   10.002462283958762
milady reflected that the more people she had around her the more she would have to work upon and lord de winter would redouble his watch   9.648156103116937
he might have become a bishop and perhaps a cardinal   14.37731515324528
and then philosophic ideas are wholly wanting in voiture s works but i am of the same opinion as the coadjutor he is a poet a true poet   13.730142170612188
does grimaud know him then   10.75915153262639
is he alive and at liberty   8.322531230743765
oh sire exclaimed the duc de blacas m   11.289185478095828
whichever you please there to the left   9.021395601826542
so saying he displayed a sharp strong blade with a handle made of beechwood   5.940352245089938
then was heard a great noise of fagots being removed and of the groaning of posts   10.844220734109888
aramis discharged his bill placed bazin in the cart with his comrades and they set forward to join porthos   8.932381087084561
what are the turks to such men as the comte de la fere and the abbé d herblay   10.92715197347817
the second was called the comte de la fere   6.955025239000997
ten men for monsieur de comminges   15.54625562063156
may the devil take me if the child be not dead said porthos   9.531202403102963
the curtain rose and the attention of franz was attracted by the actors   19.28207268850933
you are among friends said athos in english   15.48486506698685
we are coming to your aid   15.226342517915917
at length his eyes opened but they were at first fixed and expressionless   13.486238426080195
my blood boils at the idea of having encouraged a murderer by my cowardly concession   9.610147622451123
at the cry uttered by the duke and the scream of patrick the man whom felton had met in the antechamber rushed into the chamber   4.948722638958751
and i say to you fabulous as it may seem i tell it as a true one from beginning to end   16.042424365607488
well said he let us see gentlemen what are his eminence s commands and d artagnan unsealed the letter and read m   10.999838271386022
prayed the kneeling suppliant protect my husband guard my son and take my wretched life instead   15.102327421421402
cried renée unable to hide her emotion at this unexpected announcement   11.874265601938806
how do i know it   9.062728696428707
but the water was icy cold   6.412219259978248
well are you going away in that manner   10.98429363893413
now it is revealed this secret so full of horror as the tragic poet says   8.43457301261315
a signed statement chapter 76   10.191362152785636
you are then in possession of 900 000 francs   9.766436798987087
but your companions   9.525945757659969
to grief succeeded rage   14.8218615069685
did you not observe his despair on the journey   12.282352123589217
de villefort s hands then i shall be contented   14.004674596312533
but i have nothing to fear while i have you to protect me   11.524271834109847
my very self replied planchet   15.4346748256547
the young man turned round thinking that danglars or monte cristo had forgotten something they wished to tell him and had returned just as they were starting   12.757957341810446
that s the first time i ever heard of anybody trying to cure gunshot wounds with cat o nine tails   11.563306495460164
behind my bed   11.649991252296852
but there the confidence of d artagnan stopped   6.703474683400975
read then   11.671330759439055
d artagnan asked the poor girl what was the matter with her   12.586932316500334
now said aramis tell me a little what you do fear   15.852589925348791
well ever since then the infernal project has been ripening in her brain   10.181834604587158
the morrel family in a very few minutes the count reached no   10.18279082801744
you madame   12.977221441159989
to imprison him monseigneur   10.641957970317264
the result was that even if the king s troops remained quietly in their camp it was evident that some day or other buckingham who only continued in the isle from obstinacy would be obliged to raise the siege   12.506168263307872
well i should say   12.222534674903063
nevertheless his brow was armed with a severity more austere than ever   8.543623509462007
she gave the first to athos and the other to aramis so that should they be separated by chance they might make themselves known to the king   13.742692631202065
and d artagnan dressed himself in an instant   14.208317161388004
i have been myself to the best engraver of the palais royal who did the plate in my presence   15.5768525075474
i shall use it again upon occasion   14.162660243965155
your mother   11.444855362822679
he is really dead   8.080063407232824
chapter xxvii   7.938570765850921
pardieu monsieur   13.457968952236572
this dear friend said d artagnan carefully avoiding to utter either the former name borne by porthos or his new one then he has not forgotten me   15.106483778473523
oh heavens cried beauchamp the minister quotes béranger what shall we come to next   16.068864264150996
it was indeed strange in this unknown spot to find the young man whose misfortunes had made so much noise in paris   10.786992768835526
do you think she loves this italian so much as they say she does   18.176104231614637
it is true said he in so low a tone that he could hardly be heard   16.064480428046664
she saw the young officer suspended over the abyss by a ladder of ropes   9.238240443195124
dantès thought as they passed so closely to the island whose name was so interesting to him that he had only to leap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised land   14.281913158501155
scarcely had he descended the last step of the threshold when he saw athos bent down toward the ground as if he were looking for a crown piece in the dust   15.578548293381525
you do not understand me maximilian   7.067957869350321
oh as for that said danglars angry at this prolongation of the jest as for that you won t get them at all   14.27196145400849
the rendezvous chapter 39   6.088138793711247
at this moment the abbé pressed down his side of the shade and so raised it on the other throwing a bright light on the stranger s face while his own remained obscured   12.406653103183364
and you you are a woman a miserable woman stupid and brutal   10.857589683683535
thanks my lord   14.748610373490404
the inspector turned smilingly to the governor   6.905183696274068
i can not thus in a moment relinquish the respect the confidence and pride with which a father s untarnished name inspires a son   7.300243863560444
but neither in the street he had passed through nor in the one which his eager glance pervaded could he see anyone   16.96767934987153
a paper may be lost   13.587688735896947
oh why did i not tell you all   12.476888869130637
cocles appeared and the young man bade him conduct the stranger to m   15.899297220805988
the doctor was a friend of the family and at the same time one of the cleverest men of the day and very fond of valentine whose birth he had witnessed   14.937979089988504
and at this moment perhaps felton is paying with his head for the crime of this fury   13.272216101704235
ah sir replied mousqueton his eyes filling with tears why did you re enter the army   12.486891004133978
ah said he between his teeth is there truth in the proverb that fortune comes while one sleeps   9.497361396502043
under that pretense you run against me   9.973426407529296
bonacieux for such protestations may be made with the worst intentions in the world   7.748971989783819
that does honor to your imagination   10.46936618099008
a kind of steward appeared just as d artagnan and his companions were prepared to mount   11.405535469279437
what has happened is quite natural and in conformity with the law of reprisals   13.867988956726617
besides milady knew the masters and did not know the lackeys   9.76985962714466
i have not enough you said when you had more than you before possessed and you committed a third crime without reason without excuse   14.198632541394215
but we all have our faults   17.41046456423607
is that she mamma   8.759055966436655
no doubt the host knew what illustrious visitor was expected and had consequently sent intruders out of the way   11.579265830396235
i will stay   12.356633470622182
in a game of tennis   15.20835277689163
i mean m   11.457016817492224
you are laughing at me and want to try me   11.146100021323456
a croak answered this signal   15.37750204644487
at this moment nine o clock struck   13.677659829919595
who is this wretch who takes my comb and puts it in his pocket   16.45152277074658
are you prepared to embrace your worthy father   16.03140036708487
monte cristo turned round hastily and saw madame de morcerf at the entrance of the salon at the door opposite to that by which her husband had entered pale and motionless   8.934518062271568
and since monsieur le curé can answer for you i answer for him said the curate   14.854424550778626
the count then hastened to us and took us into his house where he speedily recalled my poor edward to life   10.062633016237823
yes i know him very well   12.644453120103469
mademoiselle de villefort will share them with you   10.43527252668728
i thought you were at smyrna   13.138376243486288
it might be expected that the attack if indeed an attack was projected would be made from the staircase of the ground floor and not from a window   12.782513614013471
yes answered franz   14.321829653080307
for you are dishonored by delay and death is preferable to shame   13.248274744823448
he had not heard a carriage stop in the street or steps in the antechamber   12.614356349542648
in that case we will put on an air of mourning and he will pluck for us his black fowls   7.956050593545621
take notice that you are shut up captured   11.66638667737287
not at all not at all replied d artagnan   15.00828046971928
and the bier was lifted once more and they proceeded   15.802348110387278
there you are beginning again to ramble to talk again and again of the past   10.456967255568225
yes i have said it and i now repeat it our destinies are irrevocably united although we now pursue divergent roads   11.487689609355048
what is the matter sire   11.831392466249282
that if they serve me as well as they served the queen my gratitude shall be magnificent   9.989511307845659
come then said lord winter   9.595322480600599
the first opportunity you have confirm her in her opinion   10.255034470254271
as was his custom d artagnan presented himself at milady s at about nine o clock   14.2776189160413
he is at vincennes   14.59951047063197
he had found the pates good the wine excellent   11.318908439778326
the husband had presided at the abduction of his wife   9.090322576252161
no replied d artagnan if i recollect well what you said it was nothing out of the common way   12.286145673550568
flee alone and leave you here   13.241433746005931
dark or fair   12.093712939210787
parbleu i believe it is not said planchet   17.038685991891814
the most vague and wild thoughts passed through his mind   12.08553050279625
on my word i think you are right lucien said albert absently   10.55149824446372
a sigh escaped him   12.018958494326158
this money was for her   11.791555024530926
i never jest   13.08724295682184
sign an order for his release and all will be said replied the cardinal   10.636992170785344
you can understand can you not that to have acted as i have done to have broken that glass to have intruded on the solitude of a friend you can understand that to have done all this i must have been actuated by real uneasiness or rather by a terrible conviction   9.777724459031859
your advice then   10.345810267415517
merri was announced   12.586293414138622
to what purpose   10.555581212295845
but i am content   6.4724453275683285
muttered mazarin unable to recover from his astonishment   7.507899476480671
yes since madame de morcerf invites me   12.668421139637351
my ten years of service have also confirmed my ideas on the subject of sudden inspirations for i have several times owed my life to a mysterious impulse which directed me to move at once either to the right or to the left in order to escape the ball which killed the comrade fighting by my side while it left me unharmed   7.027770698932327
is he not the son of general d épinay who was on our side and who was assassinated some days before the usurper returned from the island of elba   11.528352667553865
like a philosopher   15.133739708572818
the noble and distinguished air of athos those flashes of greatness which from time to time broke out from the shade in which he voluntarily kept himself that unalterable equality of temper which made him the most pleasant companion in the world that forced and cynical gaiety that bravery which might have been termed blind if it had not been the result of the rarest coolness such qualities attracted more than the esteem more than the friendship of d artagnan   11.725493345324761
an unhappy lapse of fortune and the absence of my protector have cast me down certainly but not forever   13.272816874727255
he has at the request of your father opened an account of 5 000 francs a month at m   12.180146246574292
poor edward is as much m   10.28200380504995
beauchamp was thunderstruck   10.315937356106014
good good   11.27365427377347
and still further upon my honor i don t like english horses   5.519602612307813
he was with you just now   9.662216043536397
the fog increased the darkness and formed round the sternlights and lanterns of the jetty a circle like that which surrounds the moon when the weather threatens to become rainy   11.635724113513739
murmured coquenard and he tried to smile   13.82110001128397
it is true that the enemies of the cardinal said that it was he himself who set these bungling assassins to work in order to have if wanted the right of using reprisals   10.542768924653146
and the four friends seconded by grimaud pushed with the barrels of their muskets an enormous sheet of the wall which bent as if pushed by the wind and detaching itself from its base fell with a horrible crash into the ditch   11.403128708828634
come hither said mazarin in his softest voice   6.794218902032094
if i had the least doubt of your love i would not make it but you love me my beautiful mistress do you not   15.454371876626972
very willingly if it be necessary to reassure you answered the minister and mazarin who was delighted to get off so cheaply led the way in high spirits to the corridor and opened the door   15.945689671876806
the father s   10.85637870940663
said d artagnan in a low voice as soon as the bolts were fast let me get out of the hôtel   9.681361777448629
faria has dreamed this   13.896370134063515
they will know you are deserted and think you also poor for i alone know your real financial position and am quite ready to give up my accounts as an honest partner   14.003849046338448
i know it and appeal to your penetration   15.58135277195985
no but it will be said caderousse as surely as dantès will be captain of the pharaon eh danglars   8.934048984838185
the cavalier entered the second hall which was guarded by the musketeers and doorkeepers   14.198376442141722
the two friends met her in the corridor greatly troubled and much upset by such strange events   18.480680546335662
ah sir do leave a few crowns for me at the gate that i may have some things i am in need of   17.709439977613407
ah here is m   15.949187596845842
then i thought she would remember it was through my chamber you had penetrated hers and that then she would suppose i was your accomplice   11.538070954040977
i heard that the colonel of the regiment that escorted charles was killed said cromwell staring very fixedly at mordaunt   10.525034227708401
it is impossible to describe what morrel suffered during this enumeration   13.045569037873605
selim repeated from time to time the sacred words god is great   10.917000654112437
six o clock   9.797388550543717
very well be here at midnight   17.537787808665072
d artagnan and athos laughed aloud   17.271839195037444
don t worry dear grandpapa said she endeavoring to smile   11.12007629765446
poor dear woman said debray she is no doubt occupied in distilling balm for the hospitals or in making cosmetics for herself or friends   12.835232942412292
those must have been ten weary years   12.801862734888866
said he with the resignation of a fanatic   11.61262376144659
d artagnan was looking at athos whose face betrayed all those emotions which the king possessing more self control had banished from his own   11.492075333872759
now then to breakfast said beauchamp   14.989963905966112
without the loss of an instant the carriage was placed on board and the two travellers embarked without delay   13.120302534641658
in the first place said he i wish my lackey placed with me fully armed   9.407481534865681
they were perhaps in league with him   9.362518498581728
is my father here   16.016345489467902
expiation chapter 112   9.297052614221327
ah that is really original said beauchamp   12.048771037781329
i wished to see all and to judge of everything for myself hoping the explanation would be in your father s favor and that i might do him justice   10.683680801248478
the 5 000 000 you stole from the hospitals has been restored to them by an unknown hand   6.932804055342297
to malta   18.45106647709852
but they all understood what carlini had done   16.98276170528974
said aramis suppose the master is a puritan   10.859077978922906
come thought danglars it is the same old story   9.62128704724954
who could these men be   12.563049549426632
it is not so bad for a novice   5.590153321730835
monsieur el comte de wardes   11.495866607501332
it is understood of course that when we say the queen mazarin is meant   12.767011065223045
mark s column at venice and on the borders of the arno at florence little imagining at the time that they would be arranged in order within the walls of the château d if   16.013671062560437
presently there are not a sufficient number of people here yet   13.48561371984529
they rose about eight o clock in the winter about six in summer and went to take the countersign and see how things went on at m   11.941064505411347
now if aramis had been at home when planchet came to his abode he had doubtless hastened to the rue des fossoyeurs and finding nobody there but his other two companions perhaps they would not be able to conceive what all this meant   11.592428749400055
not their application certainly but their principles you may   11.970429367735589
for were the gentleman a montmorency and the diplomatist a metternich we will breakfast at eleven   11.157158966748664
he has just gone and i am sure he ll be exceedingly sorry not to have had the pleasure of seeing you before he went   10.343414217490297
no she said   9.584112887700625
villefort you will not displease the marchioness and tomorrow you will sign the contract which will bind you to your husband   9.45078394527399
my dear athos he said i am going away   9.482551999541325
cavalcanti the elder had returned to his service not in the army of his majesty the emperor of austria but at the gaming table of the baths of lucca of which he was one of the most assiduous courtiers   13.049445464402122
this is frightful   6.924729289799004
two days afterward these same magistrates appeared before the cardinal and their spokesman addressed mazarin with so much fearlessness and determination that the minister was astounded and sent the deputation away with the same answer as it had received from the duke of orleans that he would see what could be done   13.560964478994682
come come give it to me   11.500570307126239
who could desire my death   11.607118078500063
everybody is looking at her   13.62306029023182
the prince is beaten since he can no longer fight   13.407617166730835
a moment afterwards he thought he heard his own name pronounced distinctly   5.010520198427189
how can i avoid interesting myself for one who is so beautiful and so amiable   15.066906818684505
but among enemies it would be only a stratagem   9.278418591547986
i can not return you many thanks for the drive of yesterday   16.866898979708196
this darkness and silence alarmed morrel still more than valentine s absence had done   12.006690436903487
how young this d artagnan is   14.085806132152381
i would arrest ten of them ventrebleu a hundred even all the company and i would not allow a whisper   13.74571799801218
grimaud himself understand   11.793587100720568
ali descended to the street and marked a straight line on the pavement immediately at the entrance of the house and then pointed out the line he had traced to the count who was watching him   7.625815013329346
if you repent of the manner in which you have acted toward me the young girl who brings you this will tell you how a man of spirit may obtain his pardon   12.121134785526452
besides i long ago determined to put an end to all these petty intrigues of policy and love   12.487486244276232
i say since you command me mercédès i must die   10.771002889135584
arrived at ryston d artagnan assembled his friends   15.84998406078178
there was connected with the remembrance of this girl a remembrance of anger   12.654212834011396
he grants a full pardon to the vizier ali and not only gives him his life but restores to him his fortune and his possessions   10.83625558953941
from the signs of respect the valet paid him he saw that his note had produced a good effect   20.165788230814698
but what then must be done   12.38026665535132
come i have a habitation prepared for you in which you will soon forget fatigue and cold   12.95884402057161
at this moment the duke s surgeon arrived quite terrified   13.577939773204884
the fanciful exists no longer in the east   11.28312308471629
sir answered a voice from the depths of the earth   9.545260770328877
he told luigi that he might meet him on his return and that then he would give him a lesson warning him that it would be short and that he must profit as much as possible by it   3.9244720839782534
he told me he knew nothing about the matter that the orders i had received did not come from him and that if i had the audacity to mention his name as being concerned in this disturbance he would have me hanged   10.458158243357703
their course was clearly defined they were to follow the road toward compiegne and on emerging from the forest turn to the right   15.770930838154284
the baroness rose hastily and was going into the study when danglars stopped her   11.187233886715713
grimaud sprang up   9.22978050694231
but on my word of honor i had no idea that it was so much   10.768984750087288
i shall go and fetch a notary nevertheless   12.633935798775052
but one morning at the commencement of the month of november everything was explained to him by this letter dated from villeroy m   13.73448288539487
hunting for the equipments chapter xxx   9.79782478481242
the poor old gentleman is entirely helpless   12.767734660588431
where you like provided that the place which you shall choose has iron shutters secured by padlocks and a door that can be locked   7.499021888605173
i have the key but make haste   13.34962307296928
inquired the king triumphantly and pausing for a moment from the voluminous scholiast before him   11.076617060579338
patrick uttered a loud cry   13.477731232968157
added he with that misanthropic tone which was peculiar to him perhaps sooner than you wish   10.081431077735965
the curtain which had risen at the close of the scene with albert again fell and a rap was heard at the door   11.508317928420311
moreover from being so long in twilight or darkness his eyes had acquired the faculty of distinguishing objects in the night common to the hyena and the wolf   9.772506212167512
why i meant to pass it over to you my dear athos   10.080522275590132
higher monsieur higher   11.626482785360308
villefort would probably have rather stood opposite the muzzle of a pistol at five and twenty paces than have heard this name spoken   3.2198901932104036
well said porthos in the first place make a bargain with the mercer and a good bargain   10.85631111708604
at last in an hour after the scene we have just described she heard someone speaking in a low voice at the door   10.158082262075094
stay where you are i will tell you   13.945236160370747
everything is possible   13.89447110117043
i gathered myself up my knife in my hand and when i saw him near me stretching out his arms to find his victim then with the last cry of agony and despair i struck him in the middle of his breast   12.557592196175161
de guise   15.788379700654831
besides perhaps i have not been missed at the fortress   17.406105972280656
have they any fortune   8.66090079643456
he easily understood why his son did not come to see him before he went to avenge his father s honor   11.67573534398846
which would make him lose a part of his advantage since when known to milady as he knew her he played only an equal game with her   13.894556491251802
we will embark for algiers for england for america or if you prefer it retire to the country and only return to paris when our friends have reconciled your family   11.131911470883772
buy some provisions   14.815347786805596
they all asked together in a low tone   15.182096621236289
he insisted upon it declaring beforehand that he was willing to make any sacrifice the other wished   17.87027365430081
i have lent him to a friend who will understand the signs he makes   9.144779860665729
i recommend you to sink forthwith to the bottom of the sea   16.06003720882621
then he thought it was time to make the last trial and he put the phial to the purple lips of faria and without having occasion to force open his jaws which had remained extended he poured the whole of the liquid down his throat   8.991922670733578
monsieur continued she turning to monte cristo will you do us the honor of passing the rest of the day with us   13.834219467504683
she comes from martinique so i call her the beautiful indian   15.272408902246104
she thanked them both with a smile   8.344428454647508
d artagnan seemed iron   6.675716697503855
you have told me how you talk to him and how he answers you   15.309504987232936
besides of what importance to you is the life or death of a condemned wretch   13.002920964515628
d artagnan to wait   10.23715018505045
and you will add to them this knife said the duke pressing the hand of laporte   13.427917617848655
after this he took from his cupboard the bank notes and gold he had put there thrust the one into the pocket of his trousers and the other into that of his waistcoat hastily tied up a small bundle of linen and rushing towards the door disappeared in the darkness of the night   4.72288191791879
de richelieu had sent for him to propose to him to enter into his guards with the rank of ensign and that he had refused   10.473951653872568
milady then perceived with terror that the uniform of the soldiers who guarded her was changed   10.782441042316718
well sir said danglars in case your proposals which do me honor are accepted by my wife and daughter by whom shall the preliminary arrangements be settled   7.032546223130466
murmured villefort   14.142585005536326
and by whom was your wife abducted   6.855522548195805
morrel i shall always have the greatest respect for those who possess the owners confidence   10.279322070914036
but this is droll cried d artagnan consoled and holding his sides with laughter   13.18127453703862
oh do not kill me   11.246326772560783
and what did you think of this fine story eavesdropper   8.513554115341883
what do you prescribe doctor   13.937655416649585
i remember too well how sometimes we were stopped for want of money and but for that diamond which i was obliged to sell we should have remained on the road   8.016684549157233
since you have commenced your sacred office deign to continue it   11.611207024584003
nevertheless i have remarked you   9.06564108591958
the instant groslow put his foot upon the hatchway steps the ship opened like the crater of a volcano   7.037365505590834
tis true that mercédès is not actually my wife   15.381986569131326
oh no my lord   11.735543768231084
it was this idea that had brought dantès back to the circular rock   14.574478919166904
and if i defend myself or call or cry out   10.765130578465898
adieu count said the abbé d herblay   13.16793010979455
well that s what puzzles me replied danglars   9.597271188950552
but because it suited me to marry you as soon as possible on account of certain commercial speculations i am desirous of entering into   6.762145863218565
why on board the tartan replied the sailor   10.599243729923757
oh what an abyss   10.044397343693007
you know that when he left here he was taken to the palais de justice   15.86408915469909
this is but a trifling inquietude i know but one that may be appreciated   7.789788217660362
as for me i remain in my humility and indolence   14.058555869680863
i say that valentine is dead   10.87306264484048
two of his comrades of the guards immediately sprang forward and two other soldiers having joined them the number was deemed sufficient   10.577000059699616
de boville said nothing but nodded his head and took up the portfolio   8.399165476908081
so preferring death to capture i accomplished the most astonishing deeds and which more than once showed me that the too great care we take of our bodies is the only obstacle to the success of those projects which require rapid decision and vigorous and determined execution   14.955817248883484
and you say that you have made certain conditions on my behalf   12.409106711394793
sir said he do you suppose for a moment that a man can sustain a physical shock such as m   8.657303072419705
monsieur bertuccio chapter 43   10.904734099702372
two millions   6.795628503959659
i say that she was my mother   7.297316920823871
are you alone reverend sir or have you there soldiers ready to seize me   9.611818768110105
do you know what gave him strength   14.300318360758206
say to the comte de salvieux that i would like to see him   14.899684844154585
you are among men of honor who will use every means to convince you before resorting to the last extremity but as you have said you are among conspirators you are in possession of our secret and you must restore it to us   9.947692110573337
we must confess these three strange names struck us   14.803462706863504
and in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced   11.781631079168719
so far from the sensation excited in the parisian circles by the appearance of the count of monte cristo having abated i take upon myself to declare that it is as strong as ever   11.355727359600023
well sit down and let us begin with these pilchards and this fresh butter   11.085368432141937
i do not know a woman that is worth the trouble of being sought for when she is once lost   13.705381493607389
in the name of heaven my lord   12.747358113949634
faria sat up to receive him avoiding all gestures in order that he might conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half stricken him with death   12.331641413288768
you are right said the countess and my fears are weakness especially when directed against a man who has saved your life   18.265155508413702
la ramee began to be uneasy   12.408728884597618
i wish to be sure of my revenge   5.869111512598894
your majesty on your side said d artagnan is as much mistaken as to our intentions as the cardinal mazarin has always been   10.682302244287904
it is a brawl   15.88422886747066
but you expected some one then   17.91752678363271
and you will submit to the reparation he may require   7.255486355348586
what a noise about a musketeer   14.783186537734164
in the queen s name   8.688461690911884
as soon as monsieur had left and disappeared round the corner of the street monsieur bonacieux took his hat shut his door and set off at a quick pace in an opposite direction   7.0552644390716095
but you were right to return as soon as possible my boy   14.266432059069821
a garrison life is fatal even to the most aristocratic organization   12.379230178852886
of that spark i will make a flame that shall devour him   11.029664628494599
no indeed sir answered raoul   9.539234139539811
we both are servants of the queen are we not   12.631225065173242
at five o clock in the morning the straw was worth eighty francs a truss and there was no more to be had   8.615007158347357
this thought the house of morrel is about to stop payment bent him to the earth more than twenty years would otherwise have done   11.885992323624059
for your majesty can not be ignorant that the musketeers who belong to the king and nobody but the king are the natural enemies of the guardsmen who belong to the cardinal   10.886951102144025
for it is evident that your happy return has something to do with the joy of the king the triumph of the queen and the humiliation of his eminence   13.843142363458563
then turning toward planchet he made him a sign to uncock his musketoon   13.439097244791933
you were still fast asleep and i did not know what to do with myself   12.585052256889572
milady smiled with joy   9.744155000934493
monte cristo perceived that the young man had turned around   12.690836010167226
he even told me he had not the slightest doubt that my father would give me the capital instead of the interest of my property   11.632994674004035
and what is more however the man speaks for himself my preserver   17.935848564064447
indeed i do   17.220197376657204
the article was not inserted by me i was not even aware of it   12.04042887433917
they entered   13.264872674012473
the two men followed the company and on leaving the faubourg st   13.98175888859543
his features were no longer contracted and now wore their usual expression but there was that in his whole appearance that bespoke one who had come to a fixed and desperate resolve   13.303832305587944
the proverb was but too correct as regarded benedetto and even in his infancy he manifested the worst disposition   9.792907744941202
captain said felton this is the person of whom i spoke to you and whom you must convey safe and sound to france   10.030976960967724
said debray who had not failed to notice the agitation of madame danglars   13.937847386618389
the weather was mild but dull and in harmony with the funeral ceremony   7.054157308734946
the lackeys followed armed to the teeth   15.820162884849736
oh then i remember as if it were but yesterday sitting under the shade of some sycamore trees on the borders of a lake in the waters of which the trembling foliage was reflected as in a mirror   10.999547217878835
said madame de chevreuse with a slight sigh and a little movement of her eyebrows that was peculiarly her own since that time everything has changed   10.043413068863872
we will see my dear monsieur if you can handle a sword as skillfully as you can a dice box   10.505542917877158
put your other hand here   8.184343226646973
most decidedly said he men are not equal and i must beg my father to develop this theorem in the chamber of peers   11.650719188775055
that is cruel indeed   12.353015791020212
i am afraid for the king s safety   11.730130217156926
all paris seemed to shout with joy and then the air resounded with the cries of long live broussel   13.673779008374918
then drawing in the open streets as if it were the best of all possible sports   11.918872190655255
read the letter again from the commencement   10.238710888868667
oh i see you prefer peregrination   0.37057582752786367
robert le diable the pretext of an opera engagement was so much the more feasible as there chanced to be on that very night a more than ordinary attraction at the académie royale   11.680193639778048
he has arrived from amsterdam   15.597211679049373
you will do as much when the opportunity occurs will you raoul   9.985172535512302
pull down the blinds said d artagnan   10.13760392178532
monsieur had just retired and the youthful louis remaining the last was amusing himself by placing some lead soldiers in a line of battle a game which delighted him much   15.833717506009553
i am for no one   13.053615288743373
are you there now   9.773526855960881
that who was here   14.790624152971901
my vocation commands me   12.763813091840575
i can just suit you   8.447044311199441
you very well know porthos that i continue to study theology for that purpose   9.540040834454754
the chances always balance and at the month s end nothing is gained or lost   13.175249904047554
nevertheless it is quite true   11.877081896031015
and why parry   15.730429794194876
then you refuse me   8.640766088708087
only continued m   16.036923758491557
good muttered mazarin sitting down we shall soon see something startling   13.103125071672029
the more she has forgotten the high position in which she was placed the more degrading is her fall   11.69356499753449
the procurator s wife shed a tear   10.050324965108736
i have not and i can not make three copies of that letter because it is sealed   11.955438424654504
and you are quite right said the notary who feared to lose his fee   10.529526303733418
no your excellency i had never heard of him before and never but once afterwards and that was from the abbé busoni himself when i saw him in the prison at nîmes   6.0417992359179715
monsieur de chavigny who at heart detested the cardinal took pains to tell the story to two or three friends who put it into immediate circulation   7.1309404738770805
your eminence may perceive that if we had not taken this precaution we should have been exposed to allowing you to pass without presenting you our respects or offering you our thanks for the favor you have done us in uniting us   6.588729179723137
i really am quite ashamed to have been the cause of your undergoing such severe self examination   9.853864910920814
it was a model of taste and simple elegance   14.877962153576325
it seems to me the first care of government should be to set at liberty those who have suffered for their adherence to it   6.767400106707658
the flash extinct all remained in darkness   14.571236009081256
but shall you be allowed to go into normandy   15.225429987194874
asked the bandit   14.932826929753466
now said the deputy answer me frankly not as a prisoner to a judge but as one man to another who takes an interest in him what truth is there in the accusation contained in this anonymous letter   15.69481614111092
another hope defeated   8.934025538198874
ah you surprise me   14.290659904907987
i showed you this morning that i had a heart did i not count   13.207266900168294
at this instant a second cry less piercing than the first but followed by prolonged groaning was heard   7.757525560496996
be satisfied replied d artagnan   11.257022184572993
de villefort and not the prefect who returned to the house of m   15.318098886596378
i confess i prefer the convent of noisy   16.647385395475197
the two brigands looked at each other for a moment the one with a smile of lasciviousness on his lips the other with the pallor of death on his brow   13.311884462534188
how my friend planchet   11.8725302266277
as next to the queen she was the most considerable personage of the fête she was received by the city officials and placed in a box opposite to that which the queen was to occupy   10.11582279645408
albert looked around him   10.20367155939625
the moment i understand it there will no longer exist a telegraph for me   13.623651754484193
they wandered about the streets looking at the pavement as if to see whether the passengers had not left a purse behind them   16.528378525129
as for me replied athos to this recital i am quite at my ease   9.183633549171846
i was conducting some friends musketeers one of whom by the by had a dispute with a stranger a man who sought a quarrel with him for i don t know what   10.958682775898225
content with making me pay for my hat   15.934915499816183
the monk recovered his usual expression   14.151032106929907
listen said morcerf if mademoiselle danglars were disposed to take pity on my supposed martyrdom on her account and would dispense with all matrimonial formalities between our two families i am ready to agree to the arrangement   7.938198820052509
and i advised him to invest all he had in an annuity   13.86191509220716
are they going to put him in the ministry   11.583909688532874
it had evidently been rolled across the pass by some arm of giant strength   11.08716004249787
20049m august rolled by in unceasing efforts on the part of morrel to renew his credit or revive the old   8.761174717406128
she was thinking of something else   10.727478174211967
he then returned to paris and although in the same carriage with château renaud and albert he did not hear one word of their conversation   10.835087556823021
he was a man of twenty five or six and held a piece of cloth which being a tailor he was about to make into a coat lining   9.894270393590046
i command thee   19.39585249587215
i will depart   13.13943291869764
he promised to be back by eight o clock and eight is striking   10.543651908244597
a stretch of smooth turf extended down the middle and at the corners were clumps of trees with thick and massy foliage that made a background for the shrubs and flowers   8.09896767808583
she could scarcely believe in her happiness   12.07354746497883
then you believe the papers   15.864123152897058
but i will answer for these two words being delivered to their address   4.211106706884578
nay madame   7.65432505566068
and he richelieu the french minister the national minister would be ruined   14.154057832111203
milady remained thoughtful and undecided for a moment   6.595310299229855
one minute that knife one minute a single minute and i will restore it to you through the grating of the door   12.36121297051961
wait till i assure myself that nobody hears us   13.561695313720673
he turned and was about to utter an exclamation of surprise when the other made to him a sign of silence   5.689479417345126
then they fear me   12.000066910988041
they know my habits   8.944456334872482
like women not like queens   11.795693510441739
asked morrel quickly   12.379797348990772
to travel either way a passport was necessary   11.718585903060744
high cheek bones a sign of sagacity   14.043203156036785
but that command must come from the queen herself   13.758311831982233
a venetian   11.99686890694346
and while he spoke with a lofty air and twisted his mustache disdainfully all admired his embroidered baldric and d artagnan more than anyone   9.690861245794693
what new victim is going to accuse you of weakness before god   12.198185383700288
finally he promised that he would leave her mistress s presence at an early hour that evening and that when he left the mistress he would ascend with the maid   11.373634425411053
at night in addition to complines and matins they were further obliged to leap twenty times out of their beds and prostrate themselves on the floor of their cells   11.991486142158314
villefort placed the arm of madame de saint méran within his own and conducted her to his apartment   13.55235851065797
d artagnan knocked and upon the bidding to come in which came from inside he entered the chamber   17.109236865856246
but you can place me in one of the provinces with some lady of your acquaintance in your own country for instance   11.635478071063327
then tell me haydée do you believe you shall be able to accustom yourself to our present mode of life   11.737160869212325
and yet notwithstanding these precautions i remained for some time in a terrible agitation of mind   13.820726037507868
they are ready to open for you make use of them   9.621717828036203
i believe i am courageous and since yesterday i have learned the power of will   17.230711685551064
meanwhile monte cristo had rapidly taken off his greatcoat waistcoat and shirt and one might distinguish by the glimmering through the open panel that he wore a pliant tunic of steel mail of which the last in france where daggers are no longer dreaded was worn by king louis xvi   8.73970362310148
oh as to the robbers said joannes here is something for them and he drew from his pocket a pair of small pistols loaded to the muzzle   8.7662390639467
we will charge upon you then said he if you disobey   18.646857641787157
said athos emptying and refilling his glass   13.891749577122438
do you wish to go on the water sir   16.89764027776052
shall i call on him as i pass   11.788619998545494
i believe this man paid his predecessor a hundred pistoles for his   15.171214688457592
they then at the same instant perceived a large lantern carried on a pole appear on the deck defining the forms of shadows behind it   10.63521569677912
i am here said the monk quickly coming back to him   16.841134259779505
sir said mazarin to him an emeute is spoken of in paris   12.513386172811856
gentlemen i will see the king this evening   9.403682489728608
but how to take them sire   12.376898021411652
really monsieur said madame de chevreuse unless you are the devil in person i don t know how you could become acquainted with all these details   13.702026085333141
the first squadron moved off   9.342267993521496
jump then monsieur pistache   15.462884975950875
i live as it were between two graves   11.073029469710175
hold your tongue hold your tongue madame   11.844261224633739
have you no particular commands to leave with me my father   12.835424365825656
to their great surprise they found the citizens still encamped there drinking and bantering each other although doubtless mourned by their families who thought they were at charenton in the thickest of the fighting   8.52047133448508
he rose to his seat and found himself lying on his bournous in a bed of dry heather very soft and odoriferous   11.682132593680592
but you have then a valet de chambre who knows paris   21.561250695360165
there there midnight sounds   16.268905998331416
they menace you with two wars if you do not dismiss me   2.6853853512309342
but as he was standing before the half of the door which was shut the obstacle compelled him to keep his place   12.707706098141747
god will punish you   11.904967244126484
soubrette and mistress meantime as we have said despite the cries of his conscience and the wise counsels of athos d artagnan became hourly more in love with milady   11.032987272924215
he has rendered the whole life of one who had the right to expect from heaven that portion of happiness god has promised to everyone of his creatures an existence of misery and infamy   13.312982576034994
it was easy to ascertain this   13.418997932457797
franz may after all die before that time a thunderbolt may fall even on the altar as you approach it nothing appears impossible to one condemned to die and miracles appear quite reasonable when his escape from death is concerned   15.6933948928226
i think that the adventure is assuming a very agreeable appearance   15.80126360197228
but one thing i can tell you of which i do not think you are aware   7.251550304716623
the latter wished to detain him by darting certain tender glances   14.064376485275481
but this examination was as useless as the first and with a bursting heart i returned to the thicket which now contained no hope for me   12.171328082354337
let us then hope for the best   11.058281919513828
you know something about him do you not madame   7.462112547861974
villefort immediately despatched a messenger   15.33903018741654
do you mean to say that it was he who bestowed that severe thrust at jussac   9.822902726660741
dried plants minerals and stuffed birds their flame colored wings outspread in motionless flight and their beaks forever open   11.948921099310436
a clump of trees concealed me   12.14650662579828
bonacieux against buckingham but above all against d artagnan projects lost in the distance of the future   10.418279323814808
suddenly a terrible cry a cry of despair was wafted through space   10.840547204925974
see see   8.611353502747093
30233m good   11.755556521807842
the count was erect and triumphant like the avenging angel   10.72971070568265
i have the means of making myself feared   10.791339817906678
for after five or six years of imprisonment it is natural to feel some curiosity as to one s destination   12.49311414548928
have you   8.364103046535323
do you need money   15.693009396822823
she came three times whilst i was a child to my nurse s house   11.923309054501546
the king smiling turned a few steps back   17.36502099051042
i thought i had said porthos resuming his melancholy air   11.157975766184084
and as a proof of what i say she commanded me to show you this diamond which she thinks you know   13.323894832031854
40294m at the moment when d avrigny was returning to valentine s room accompanied by villefort an italian priest of serious demeanor and calm and firm tone hired for his use the house adjoining the hotel of m   15.044342348172007
but he thought of that courageous woman who had come to plead for her son s life to whom he had offered his and who had now saved it by the revelation of a dreadful family secret capable of destroying forever in that young man s heart every feeling of filial piety   10.953560206794641
to see him so self satisfied reconciles me with myself   14.715513586487205
only i tell you beforehand the carriage will cost you six piastres a day   9.863423968478186
on the other side of the house to match with the library was the conservatory ornamented with rare flowers that bloomed in china jars   13.016899341293605
he has been running very fast on an errand with which my grandfather charged him and when he returned took nothing but a glass of lemonade   7.298815416503925
every one shuddered and there was a moment of silence during which the queen pressed her hand to her side evidently to still the beatings of her heart   10.56023432073312
d artagnan followed them   8.43446790159271
had d artagnan continued his intimacy with these three men he would have become a superior character   11.74183404675219
caderousse remained for a moment aghast under the weight of such an idea   12.666730318110766
revolving all this in her mind she cast her eyes around her and arranged the topography of the garden in her head   8.875522769317833
then bowing to the two musketeers with his most gracious smile he re entered his closet more calmly for on the departure of de gondy the uproar had ceased as though by enchantment   15.022740192400844
on arriving at the hotel de bouillon they came across a little troop of three cavaliers who seemed to know every possible password   7.257678084158821
andrea read in a low voice you are poor   7.887975109103079
cried d artagnan pale with anger and with the sweat on his brow it is he   13.632747955548064
said rochefort   9.489993239681711
then in accordance with his usual custom and judging from experience that few people could hide anything from him when he began to question them fixing his eyes upon them at the same time he thus addressed the messenger you are very young monsieur mordaunt for this difficult task of ambassador in which the oldest diplomatists often fail   8.895423042606643
about a hundred tons   10.502907189353138
as for andrea he was launched and when he was once launched nothing stopped him   14.740399629915409
demanded debray   7.865710178346987
one might have supposed him thunderstruck   14.940115292711816
the hand of god chapter 84   11.76537368173691
i was not aware that you were so intimate with her   12.727779163027511
but carlini would not quit the forest without knowing what had become of rita s father   10.225517712654995
mademoiselle de villefort may retire during the prescribed three months to her estate of saint méran   13.977654925999046
50219m there had been no prisoners confined in the château d if since the revolution of july   8.500730965925028
the deputy   9.766213687777764
brave as you are and strong as you are you could not kill them all   8.345678790348597
i am tired cried d artagnan sitting down   10.938833821762524
can he be afraid of this boy   9.31351645918558
but at crèvecœur aramis declared he could proceed no farther   11.277848281619374
he is cold said debray   14.106980369650493
morrel mechanically followed the count and they had entered the grotto before he perceived it   12.222464758601872
patrick went out   10.610565249938304
i have therefore believed monseigneur knowing your prudence and your personal relation to the events of the present time that you will choose to hold your forces concentrated in the interior of the french kingdom and leave to her own the new government of england   11.83426813477126
she has fostered my independence by professedly indulging my love for liberty   15.979495305899466
and then he had the two hats to sell besides   14.52441638452431
god who can read my heart all the gratitude i feel will reward you   11.089224804259818
then they allow the lackey to remain with him   16.048810375460405
he was a man of twenty five or twenty six years of age of unprepossessing countenance obsequious to his superiors insolent to his subordinates   16.42883868192813
he will starve it out and force it to surrender at discretion   13.886983194147152
the general s carriage was ready but the president told him it was impossible for him to use it since it was useless to blindfold the master if the coachman knew through what streets he went   5.76524979754541
the person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund   8.610870314050112
no sire replied athos   18.328781834103346
you shall however have his answer   10.110719324521158
believe me to seek a quarrel with a man is a bad method of pleasing the woman who loves that man   8.105402668088427
four and a fifth whom they carried away wounded   15.077263140426837
we consent to that   10.545155603973132
why good lord   13.201271646537743
he has shown very great courage and resolution for he exposed his own life to stop the horses that were running away with us and would certainly have dashed the carriage to pieces   10.805858917496703
milady put him from her slowly with her hand while drawing him nearer with her look   14.198744079168996
do you not understand   16.04290485022091
are there then in england two men to whom such an epithet can be applied   17.017523182056877
they are two hotheads the one a gascon the other from picardy   11.662177281132431
delaunay in which he offers to purchase the good will of the house to unite with his own for 300 000 francs   12.882167491405683
i will give you 45 000 said he but not a sou more   10.172203185677382
fire   10.129202766406078
once or twice the thought crossed his mind that he might be separated from this unknown whom he loved already   15.549834130295098
busoni turned around and perceiving the excitement depicted on the magistrate s face the savage lustre of his eyes he understood that the revelation had been made at the assizes   14.516856926387
ere long the door opened and the marechal entered followed by the coadjutor   12.769278957953281
the rest of the night was employed by these cavaliers in traveling with the wonderful rapidity of former days   14.787343246116695
in france people fight with the sword or pistol in the colonies with the carbine in arabia with the dagger   16.286905168073318
no doubt she belongs to the same horrible race he does and is like himself a dealer in magical arts   10.960025381043987
the coadjutor let the storm pass over his head and resumed still with the same tranquillity madame if the opinion i have submitted to you does not please you it is doubtless because you have better counsels to follow   9.42457459187907
how should he have been otherwise   10.024771932677227
she will not hear what we say   14.592585282160869
he escapes us   20.015782041961298
monte cristo wrote two or three notes and as he sealed the last the steward appeared   14.160874192527352
my mother inherited an estate from her husband you have assassinated her   13.849215658380212
am i to say what you told me   17.355772973920054
what can cardinal mazarin be to us to four men who compelled such a man as richelieu to act as we pleased   13.410000085781064
then i wrote   12.489262714731069
hear me said the novice   10.31998630335887
i kept the third for myself and i had it hollowed out which reduced its value but rendered it more commodious for the purpose i intended   7.6067696787336
i go into the garden i plant i prune i trim i kill the insects all day long   10.366961224600328
retire within bertuccio and tranquillize your mind   6.098904031700984
that is a child s reason monsieur blaisois said mousqueton in his most patronizing manner   11.370614015992757
but let us be united as we were to have been and then leave it to lord de winter to maintain his own honor and that of his wife   9.36636227438063
and then the comte de morcerf is a soldier and it is pleasing to see the integrity of a bayard united to the poverty of a duguesclin   10.296083667751368
i like your manner raoul and your politeness has touched me   12.646142982293451
so much the better young man   9.756500135263353
i should like another sort of oath better said d artagnan to himself   8.649349267944196
this supposition appeared to her most reasonable   8.570983308443353
but sir said hermine suddenly if all this is as you say caused by m   12.328010658781654
ah these musketeers of yours are very devils fellows to be hanged   8.858491961615481
demanded the host   13.602259935521474
the two assistants carried andrea up to the scaffold   11.396058198897354
but you forgot to leave me the key   18.567094420181814
you were deceived sir   9.726297655622364
it is a long time since we have had a skirmish with the guards of monsieur the cardinal   9.41350530367804
yes gentlemen the king in person the king who has come to ask for some account of what has happened   12.42796545447417
i will blow the brains out of the first man who leaves the pump said he   11.200009802843672

50025m no one could deny that the rooms were splendidly illuminated   10.868603326919601
a second time he was disappointed in his expectation   9.763065076194124
my friend d artagnan interrupted as i don t understand english and we all understand spanish have the kindness to speak to us in that language which since it is your own you must find pleasure in using when you have the chance   13.053827285199688
then having renewed his injunction not to give valentine anything he went down again to noirtier shut the doors carefully and after convincing himself that no one was listening do you said he know anything of this young lady s illness   8.476825930948358
but proceed i beg of you   14.324145700386369
a table which had been covered with an elegant supper was overturned   10.043789946346658
oh second father he exclaimed thou who hast given me liberty knowledge riches   15.876127659525109
to marseilles   11.21937427507343
the orders are issued   16.74320108641085
but danglars instead of receiving this address in the favorable manner which morcerf had expected knit his brow and without inviting the count who was still standing to take a seat he said monsieur it will be necessary to reflect before i give you an answer   8.963075526314867
i will make planchet brush my boots   7.796314377602433

your history is quite a romance and the world which delights in romances in yellow covers strangely mistrusts those which are bound in living parchment even though they be gilded like yourself   6.341955370603288

but with the duc de beaufort the ducs de bouillon and d elbeuf   11.818258557596934
whilst saying that to himself monsieur de beaufort smiled pleasantly and imagined himself already outside breathing the air of the plains and the forests pressing a strong horse between his knees and crying out in a loud voice i am free   12.560916985601908
that you have proofs of the interview granted at the louvre by the queen to a certain italian astrologer who was no other than the duke of buckingham   11.3921299721071
and he passed the paper to the officer commanding the carbineers who read and returned it to him   11.380079745606107
scarcely was the count alone when he drew from his pocket a book closed with a lock and opened it with a key which he wore round his neck and which never left him   15.598440402275932
cried d artagnan irritated that any one could doze during the day when he had the greatest difficulty in sleeping during the night   10.361416208486533
that s another thing said d artagnan and i should not mind waiting in london a whole year for a chance of meeting this mordaunt in question   13.269969733128583
everyone looked at monte cristo with astonishment   11.636537131484191
our friend will see you soon and he will only see you to release you from that imprisonment in which your safety required you should be concealed   10.024402824391561

the host insisted   9.80414447231555

but as though to prove the truth of the fanciful ideas in heathen mythology its indiscreet rays reappeared on the summit of every wave as if the god of fire had just sunk upon the bosom of amphitrite who in vain endeavored to hide her lover beneath her azure mantle   16.15743709567191
the quick eye of monte cristo however marked his coming   12.326589607369325
was felton suspected by the baron about to fail her at the decisive moment   9.041898614969288
valentine clasped her hands as if in prayer   14.573638533713083
said a clear voice which seemed accustomed to command   11.079258114681405
monsieur bertuccio said the count you have procured me windows looking on the piazza del popolo as i ordered you yesterday   12.03058093436214
indeed i imagine that mademoiselle danglars is as good as m   14.356535371045155
it must be indeed a dreadful blow which would deprive him of courage to defend himself   10.349548771164276
about a hundred paces from the palais royal a patrol stopped the carriage   8.937347835778477
his interview with that personage and his receiving in place of the packet brought a letter addressed to a monsieur noirtier his arrival at marseilles and interview with his father his affection for mercédès and their nuptual feast his arrest and subsequent examination his temporary detention at the palais de justice and his final imprisonment in the château d if   13.210264973422646

and you know said aramis that it was our friend mordaunt who made if not the bargain at least the overtures   15.277431956276624
indeed count said madame danglars i am ashamed to own it but all your frightful stories have so upset me that i must beg you to let me sit down   11.09119710916999
she is the prettiest little creature in the world with flaxen hair blue eyes at once saucy and languishing   7.5217958755761
by degrees athos gave himself up to the charms of his reverie in the proximity of youth so pure so fresh   13.187296390640252
he moved away walked up and down his cell to collect his thoughts and then went back and listened   10.259182918783127
kitty drew a little note from her bosom   14.074129759355102
several times with terror no doubt the cold sweat burst from her burning brow   13.677971381524497
jackson replied buckingham   16.900644376352762
it is du vallon and i who have insisted and even in a manner somewhat impolite perhaps so great was our longing to see you   8.702955126523237
that depends   7.700119626959223
aramis was right   13.208478014069408
but my good gentleman resumed the old man upon whom this mute despair certainly produced a greater effect than cries and tears would have done do not take on so   7.6466490708126855
to the dungeon then said the corporal   11.886388546578178
suddenly he arose lifted his hand to his brow as if his brain were giddy paced twice or thrice round the dungeon and then paused abruptly by the bed   11.382933689769823
cried d artagnan as if carried away by his enthusiasm   8.451406065842345
no the sound of a bell announcing a visitor will but accelerate the resolution of one in maximilian s situation and then the bell would be followed by a louder noise   16.23716798889337
here is monsieur d artagnan   16.75166688005877
it was a letter addressed to you baron   14.202909486713779
no no my dear fellow do not confound our plans   14.560660013679652
30225m monte cristo felt the arm of madame danglars stiffen while that of villefort trembled   13.255424669186015
mercédès remained therefore by his bedside and m   12.913233386444762
monte cristo took bertuccio into his study wrote the letter we have seen and gave it to the steward   9.90467834719683
you are a man of taste   12.959113421929073

the post chaise was happily bought three days since   6.638126665490739
has he taken off his doublet   12.446394491234903
d artagnan took charge of it   13.394929699477647
cried aramis transported   12.670895252227877
a blasphemy   8.025479378341254
said porthos admiringly   21.28793595073428
is the deed of sale ready   14.793950029204805
said he this has a bad look   10.445813333368505
my lord one last favor   10.744073292951217
the balls passed and whistled all around him   8.818226828418585
continued athos shaking his head mournfully upon my soul you make me the most miserable of men   14.42444932943931
if you will only repeat that avowal now and then i can endure anything   10.006468860491522
the ballet of la merlaison on the morrow nothing was talked of in paris but the ball which the aldermen of the city were to give to the king and queen and in which their majesties were to dance the famous la merlaison the favorite ballet of the king   16.094404067679765
monte cristo looked at the room   12.314794619282605
only she did not respond to them   10.23138829193756
have you slept well   7.181586234464592
in the country people alter   11.600529793113319
the lady was surpassingly beautiful while the rich magnificence of her attire drew all eyes upon her   17.88971846411109
ck from the small creek to the east in a right line   11.729941851344396
did you fear that we should forget it   13.880866835520774
your grandfather knows then that a poisoner lives here   11.190022477303595
only remember this if you speak a word of what you may see or what you may hear for you will look and you will listen i am quite sure however we may threaten you you are lost   8.185755743860327
and during that year another skilfully placed 1 000 piastres will afford him the means of escaping from his prison   14.114555348944958
ah exclaimed d avrigny in a voice in which the horror of a judge unveiling the truth was mingled with the delight of a student making a discovery   8.129087471281803
hardly had d artagnan seen through a crevice in his closet that the whole apartment was in obscurity than he slipped out of his concealment at the very moment when kitty reclosed the door of communication   14.451919590637033
be it half a million then   10.476290683408793
turning impatiently towards her husband madame danglars demanded is this true   9.615016852812996
every one therefore believed him to be dead especially those to whom his death would give promotion   11.240194476999378
this morning i ventured to run along the gutters and well interrupted d artagnan i am delighted that de rochefort is free but as for thee if thou shouldst fall into the hands of the king s servants they will hang thee without mercy   7.34365230073767
noirtier looked at the door where the servant had gone out   9.93817607310676
thus the soldiers of other companies than those which belonged to the red duke as aramis had called him often took part with the king s musketeers in these quarrels   11.062348433652486
anne frowned   10.060781565886908
cried madame de villefort it is really frightful   15.114242696764466
the count could only stare and his gaze fixed as if unconsciously on haydée seemed one of fire and blood   13.402650592939231
as soon as she perceived him she cried you have promised your protection   12.018302789229459
grimaud dictated   11.051204815166853
do not let a sound escape you and feign to be asleep   16.189822637453677
an hour afterwards a physician declared they were both poisoned through eating mushrooms   8.714246361202857
that is a long time   7.324988673718275
grimaud said athos coming out of his apartment in a dressing gown grimaud i thought i heard you permitting yourself to speak   11.38047757779944
are you alone athos   13.885194858078883
this first sound or rather this first grinding was followed by a second then a third   14.593933858710718
and we say proud as a gascon replied d artagnan   17.609259800798824
but to the great astonishment of the captain of the musketeers he was informed that the king had gone stag hunting in the forest of st   12.550400834550743
it is impossible to know   16.262544140271363
from la rochelle   9.651311134503528
i have not said adieu to him   14.180013047093315
morrel yes   10.532171697036958
the old patron who was obliged to sail in the morning in order to land his cargo on the frontiers of piedmont and france between nice and fréjus urged dantès to try and rise   14.731742905904131
morrel i hear you insinuating dog you   11.565026753949764
he thought of that young and pretty mme   7.66712609426514
said porthos as for me i could go out with that purity and that simplicity which it seems to me you despise too much   11.10386958155756
as he spoke he rode toward the tall horse to the man of importance and his valets   14.126799468082936
search search   14.353869619370062
but that horrid man had made me feel quite uncomfortable and i longed to be alone that i might compose my startled mind   8.125330485896075
another glance between the young men convinced them both that neither had any wish to go back and as the tutor had already turned his horse s head they both spurred forward raoul crying follow me olivain   14.135421062414776
do not let a shade of suspicion or uneasiness remain in your breast   13.217175482007015
your wife has escaped   10.54261930765612
the surgeon approached the dying man who seemed to have fainted   5.9128358748558405
with patience one must succeed   10.31594300529833
i know that there is a secret of luxury and pain in death as well as in life   11.826099417570296
tell me he said tell me what you want   16.26456846417951
the apartment destined for the purpose was spacious and lighted by a number of windows over each of which was written in golden letters for some inexplicable reason the name of one of the principal cities of france   11.477774476460175
it is that there was with her majesty the queen of england a gentleman who when i pronounced your name uttered a cry of surprise and joy   12.473954886301732
quick the ladder   7.027766854371258
allow me to introduce my friend baron de château renaud one of the few true gentlemen now to be found in france and from whom i have just learned that you were a spectator of the races in the champ de mars yesterday   9.818929265101941
i thank you sir replied the prisoner humbly   11.393900398417145
milady uttered a deep inward shriek and retreated to a corner of the room like a panther which crouches for a spring   6.973229757727406
i must have time   12.823984230396507
mousqueton followed him upon an auvergne horse small but very handsome   11.193096254497691
the boy triumphed and this victory rendered him so audacious that all the money of assunta whose affection for him seemed to increase as he became more unworthy of it was spent in caprices she knew not how to contend against and follies she had not the courage to prevent   10.551513328719299
athos you make me shudder   11.807944890508653
yes to go and meet him   8.460894741598196
why the devil then do we plague ourselves about money when there is a diamond   12.754476783545497
inquired the latter resuming the interrupted conversation   12.869601770943934
and they all formed a circle round the fire while diavolaccio disappeared   18.624062847248595
one of those three members was the coachman who had driven them there   6.664970125754525
still when morrel had finished he shut his eyes several times which was his manner of saying no   12.189859563535343
50099m yes answered the doctor laconically dropping the sheet he had raised   14.294744830002625
monsieur d artagnan continued the cardinal you performed sundry superb exploits in the last reign   12.369758499306188
anne questioned d artagnan by a look   16.998313879737676
andrea blushed imperceptibly   8.362249128884232
at the same time pointing to the corner of a street   7.475783482820379
a handsome young man three or four and twenty years old mild amiable and well made   14.438087376155469
so in twelve times you thrice missed the mark   11.064957653429234
the three friends drew near and discovered a young man stretched on the ground bathed in a pool of blood   12.962799223909567
cried athos and laughed aloud   15.602819770789345
asked eugénie rising   11.337772406185314
d artagnan appointed eight o clock at athos s residence   11.99270535517763
valentine kissed eugénie bowed to madame danglars who had already risen to take her leave and went out   9.262311300934668

if she dislikes that so much why did she ever marry herself   11.504304687671443
all four came up together   8.190977435225944
replied monte cristo shrugging his shoulders   9.327082277011018
you are wrong to speak thus said the abbé   14.523825703288963
the scaffold will be ready by to morrow but the headsman will be wanting and they will put it off till the day after to morrow   10.238754798503528
there said he there is the work complete   14.863866561695193
it was at night   13.70566354149527

the executioner   9.936750682037335
what is become of them   15.209256105325162

the seamen followed him and emmanuel brought up the rear   13.878206964648212

murmured milady   11.004310623478306
then how do you hope valentine will escape   13.861137928249404
and how many men had he with him   15.688113362344605
the prisoner whom you there see pale agitated and alarmed instead of as is the case when a curtain falls on a tragedy going home to sup peacefully with his family and then retiring to rest that he may recommence his mimic woes on the morrow is removed from your sight merely to be reconducted to his prison and delivered up to the executioner   12.079961947456566
in the first place i have as a precaution shut up at rueil near me under my own eyes within reach of my hand the two most intractable ones   14.10394971453191
when the door was closed behind them   12.225030262001122
the young girl to whom this question was addressed drew from an inlaid secretaire a small portfolio with a lock in which she counted twenty three bank notes   13.440636949920275
and she fell into a chair   10.218404898748975
grimaud said athos pointing to the bodies which lay under the wall of the bastion take those gentlemen set them up against the wall put their hats upon their heads and their guns in their hands   16.356571143393165
i know them by their romantic imagination   9.12820865911003
we do not think ourselves worthy to stand near such great names   14.089859543447346
oh it was in vain she told me you would not come   11.53798064387679
0119m how long has he left it   5.907394038277099
aramis will follow us by that of noyon   11.238935334748192
athos was pale and trembled in every limb   10.432036887702182
i shall not sell it do not fear   10.813114432232812
no sir neither of those   11.974153537898466
as for you you have acted like a barmaid   13.027646069762548
i am lord de winter brother in law of that woman   14.070853984600937
the cardinal has some good in him and if he were not a foreigner well he would be more justly estimated   18.73470270712967
it is she who has nursed and tended him for six years and has by her devoted attention fully secured the affection i had almost said the gratitude of her grandfather and it is but just that she should reap the fruit of her devotion   11.000066905106866
signor pastrini had already set about procuring their disguises for the morrow   4.693283931763727
the count soon heard the rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys such as the locksmith brings when called to force a lock and which thieves call nightingales doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they grind against the bolt   11.76607512434773
but you aramis who were close to him   10.35673493515923
i will try and think over what is the best thing to be done   12.040204531174169
at nine in the morning he reached nanteuil and stopped for breakfast   17.355879927409042
even under this disguise   11.970111781122966
i have an idea said d artagnan   18.886929793067665
but if you stir you are dead men   13.377207585836606
then quickening their steps they passed the three men but turned back immediately and d artagnan walked straight up to the butcher and touching him on the chest with the tip of his finger said to athos say this to him in english you are a coward   12.195265127346872
that will do me great honor said the leader of the posse and i accept thankfully   11.32106894310943
the two grooms held the horses that they might take a little rest without being unsaddled and grimaud was posted as sentinel   10.479123136554652
we invite him to play to night   10.20521261063844
the terrible office he had held for twenty five years had succeeded in making him more or less than man   7.461809474940978
what have you to say in your defense   10.395481735938693
all now replied la ramee   16.500846450107026
they merely attached a heavy cannon ball to the feet and then threw them into the sea   19.817434406038583
you are the best companion that i know d artagnan he said offering his hand to the gascon   13.522200304805398
you are late my dear porthos   10.985245711944273
then when he had arrived at the end of it he read it a second time   14.02416269366081
albert was charmed with the count s manners and he was only prevented from recognizing him for a perfect gentleman by reason of his varied knowledge   7.407567740785359
i might have gone up to him and killed him   7.996885610688541
they then dressed themselves   10.291491202742641
they are all here said caderousse briskly   16.63574856599697
but said the irritated president you called yourself benedetto declared yourself an orphan and claimed corsica as your country   13.738415261981832
the congregation went out to get stones to stone me with but whilst they were away i found means to conciliate the priests who were present so that my foe was pelted instead of me   13.17037106983682
come now i have hopes of obtaining what i have been for years endeavoring to persuade the marquise to promise   9.71525232461304
you child why there is not a man who has not believed as you do that his mistress loved him and there lives not a man who has not been deceived by his mistress   13.740275264933652
let each of us wait at a gate of the palace with three musketeers behind him   9.9715261350897
i have just left the count sir said he   12.583327438794997
did i hear rightly monsieur said monte cristo that you served at yanina   14.212085568692341
what think you of that   13.043142737322478
had madame de saint méran any enemies   5.263883996753192
the door of the guardhouse opens as you see   9.656882608698103
my dear athos cried aramis i think you consented to accompany me only to give me a lesson god forgive me   13.293832410077837
do you know   12.018459432594288
continued the old man   11.893832653919693
it seems his former master accustomed him to that   10.648487853713569
we set out last evening and here we are   16.843364326735003
and then on the day appointed as the dinner was fixed for midday d artagnan sent planchet at nine in the morning to assist in preparing everything for the entertainment   12.883624063834375
she then made an extraordinary effort to receive him but never did a more distressed countenance give the lie to a more amiable smile   10.68819233849722
how he had responded   14.691784562822837
and wonderful to see in front of the tower of saint jean was a ship bearing on her stern these words printed in white letters the pharaon morrel son of marseilles   15.27167267291976
the study does not take long   9.894283788543534
but only her   10.614512490847249
i swear he said with a calm brow and kindly glance but in a voice still trembling with recent emotion i swear that i no longer bear animosity to those who were once my friends   12.557680162506827
the ball fired by porthos s foe went through the throat of his horse which fell groaning   9.628165476920909
it is running now   8.52702103516807
and for myself i will write to you depend on me   11.620890943426197
it is that we are each of us twenty years older   12.093314040466918
the king waved his hand to tréville who left him and rejoined the musketeers whom he found sharing the forty pistoles with d artagnan   14.56814363771628
edmond resigned the lugger to the master s care and went and lay down in his hammock   11.730346286546853
gentlemen i have not forgotten the night in which you served me as an escort to the red dovecot   13.506080365960187
oh look at me continued she with a feeling of profound melancholy my eyes no longer dazzle by their brilliancy for the time has long fled since i used to smile on edmond dantès who anxiously looked out for me from the window of yonder garret then inhabited by his old father   16.902706008500026
do not give this key to your father said he and tomorrow morning if possible do not quit him for a moment   8.166641749836142
during the night between the 4th and 5th of september madame morrel remained listening for every sound and until three o clock in the morning she heard her husband pacing the room in great agitation   14.491165625334576
the quarters of monsieur were at dompierre   8.691778019402234
good so much the better said caderousse his eyes sparkling with avarice   14.01079071975504
this burn in the heel is decisive   9.473465674091276
and both with free use of the spur arrived at st   10.067380919140941
the officer looked at me with astonishment and then said what is your business with me monsieur   12.697481851114226
he paraded his musketeers before the cardinal armand duplessis with an insolent air which made the gray moustache of his eminence curl with ire   10.785408019526592
the latter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl absorbed by her affection and he also like morrel followed those traces of inward suffering which was so little perceptible to a common observer that they escaped the notice of everyone but the grandfather and the lover   10.460236245318782
as easily found as the cart   12.861686269403169
it is no doubt the same said he   10.07950092925352
broussel had been conducted out of paris without further resistance and was at this time in the prison of saint germain   6.60202176781771
and you really believe the result would be still more sure with us than in the east and in the midst of our fogs and rains a man would habituate himself more easily than in a warm latitude to this progressive absorption of poison   9.878477003082306
the boat moved off toward the left hand shore of the lys bearing the guilty woman and the executioner   13.365102511887585
they reached saint german without any accident   11.98780176165439
then come back here and clap your hands three times and we will give you wine and food   10.070845769490457
laughed the three friends not a bad bargain   13.75530411098412
d artagnan mm   15.05482828036347
it was very natural he being the only person in the whole assemblage except the king the queen and the duke of orleans who slept gratuitously   10.372280404442908
their jaws moved preliminarily with fearful threatenings   22.155457162744952
these two instantly mounted the coachman of the latter replacing d artagnan on the coach box of the royal coach   11.261638727463895
i shall not have time today   6.835300516318034
grimaud made a sign that he was not   11.816901991327367
we have circumvented cromwell mordaunt and the sea but we shall find a certain difficulty in circumventing mazarin   12.30818643601819
at last he made his way through the mob which was continually increasing and getting more and more turbulent and reached the hotel   9.191276073226048
directly afterwards the distant sound of a heavy weight falling on the ground was heard but no one paid any attention to it   11.32594259788776
mistrust everybody your friend your brother your mistress your mistress above all   9.603644994199612
she is a foreigner a stranger   9.988657532602998
the abbot ch   9.857603913746825
i told you this i am now grieved i have kept my word   11.718765905445775
you have written it   14.028449951354963
well then you should go and bring your count of monte cristo to us   7.567569210062963
de tréville received him as if he had seen him that same morning   8.178633002525585
this woman must be tried not assassinated   15.583924210128023
tréville bowed very respectfully with a joy that was not unmixed with fear   12.76076248236157
bring her in said the president   10.738616345772932
d artagnan stopped to look at a sideboard on which was a superb ewer of silver   14.429179254373018
now what is vague is doubtful   9.350411401271874
he had started the previous evening and had only returned an hour since   10.26092907886931
i have been told said the count that you do not always yourselves understand the signals you repeat   13.270432947727205
de boville but not for the survivor   16.693539368117086
whence can it arise then   7.000149277615973
to the swords   15.282873862217514
well sir you have in your establishment or in your family perhaps one of the frightful monstrosities of which each century produces only one   11.348129814103919
possibly my father in law trusted to its general notoriety   14.268972712632099
we are all mortal my poor friends   13.287312372860695
well here is an opportunity made to your hand and it would be difficult to contrive a better   8.689749113321508
so much the worse for them said porthos   14.161795032402217
athos she is your wife i tell you repeated d artagnan   13.659844743642186
murmured kitty he has not even waited for the hour he himself named   12.260032857941898
and yet bowing his head as if humiliated he said yes yes my dear count i feel that you are right   11.646142437922641
what i do know is that he is a creature of the cardinal his evil genius   12.364963014301516
one of the most charming persons that lives mademoiselle frances d aubigne   7.231956809171435
tis that which has made me so cross since yesterday   17.204613216174586
as he left the room debray called out loudly my carriage   14.02512412499659
i know that sir   10.578222854785546
these protestations were nothing for mme   19.24863677497082
the servant announced m   11.221466432433154
your conversation is full of instructive things   11.989068645045354
really said d artagnan these people are very ingenious   14.267326477801173
and madame danglars and m   12.541149932008091
andrea made a low bow to the count and entered the adjoining room   12.551054440914555
speak not of it reverend sir   10.570182333310052
asked comminges who putting together what mazarin had said of his prisoners and what the comte de la fere had said began to feel a degree of uneasiness   12.053600599061603
i am doing a little sum in arithmetic   9.401823280338707
well but then you will not be able to fulfill your commission said d artagnan   11.633326111383997
in a word and i repeat it because it expresses all i wish to convey we will wait   13.784498987766518
she must have a long arm   6.764417642850957
she is to speak to no one but you if you will do her the honor to address a word to her   12.584382894375468
the waves dashing themselves against it wetted him with their spray   17.269616800436403
besides said d artagnan pardon me madame if guardsman as i am i remind you of prudence besides i believe we are not here in a very proper place for imparting confidences   13.685967795395381
brail up the spanker   20.159760667599365
but as i am very ignorant in matters of this kind and as the humility which i profess obliges me not to rest on my own judgment but to ask the opinion of others i have inquired eh   10.644723784935481
well my lord   11.199179875631817
will you be good enough to explain your meaning   11.246901957028543
at the foot of the hill the count dismounted and began to ascend by a little winding path about eighteen inches wide   12.040827364553977
franz presented albert as one of the most distinguished young men of the day both as regarded his position in society and extraordinary talents   14.151027815827165
caderousse shrugged his shoulders   11.340536883434416
so rocked by them she soon fell asleep   15.257481078565656
this garden has never been a cemetery   7.421778879451907
angelo   15.265308696753785
but one of these balls launched by porthos herculean hand passed so close to d artagnan s face that he thought that if instead of passing near it had hit him his audience would have been probably lost as it would have been impossible for him to present himself before the king   7.98319861920107
should i not receive a reply in the space of fifteen days i shall presume my letter will have miscarried   8.405865462050313
it was his token reserved for the morrow   9.965006473275134
two methods of self destruction were at his disposal   7.7541337762363645
that may possibly be true said maximilian and he again subsided into his thoughtful mood   12.406815050632607
and he saw that the complement was not half empty   6.275856452521094
that s exactly what my wife said monseigneur   19.87430235804498
d artagnan has conquered her her that invincible power of evil   8.319415184547918
in the middle of the lawn i stopped to light it then i continued my path   9.799067663920123
however replied the abbé with an affable smile when that report is in accordance with the truth everybody must believe it the police as well as all the rest   15.127240699447233
our safety lies in our obscurity   10.023431863146936
now my young friend said he england is all our own   11.647643294083814
he fell back almost fainting in his chair   13.694612875883163
the baroness who had signed returned the pen to the notary   14.485344396062423
d artagnan profited by the circumstance to speak to m   12.225716822952855
god who might have directed the assassin s dagger so as to end your career in a moment has given you this quarter of an hour for repentance   10.455555364540848
my dear friend said d artagnan if you annoy us in this manner we will all four go and shut ourselves up in your cellar and we will see if the mischief is as great as you say   6.243092071271759
what dost thou there rascal   16.340417149563162
the others are on the mantle piece of your excellency s bedroom   12.294760947232588
said madame de villefort there is not much doubt on that subject   12.268402780684944
will you have two three five per cent or even more   15.561088426844567
it may be imagined that d artagnan listened to these details with increasing interest   9.4246683354069
he must have been dreadfully hurt for he did not stir from the place where he fell   7.6390080849757815
come come with me gentlemen   12.082493825343803
yes you were thinking of it and with justice   12.454489058973534
d artagnan took possession of his command   12.520600357114809
but when they touched him although under jacopo s directions he declared with heavy groans that he could not bear to be moved   15.290064817937271
yes they might do well if they had any leader to unite them in one body   12.713585178441154
at a few minutes to seven returned the duke suiting the action to the words i raise the crust of the pie   10.37533631210567
ah true said monte cristo there is a postscript   12.068046145649854
do you know with what design m   14.377784613100534
so he opened the door and beckoned the young man in   10.650345400456697
yes but he has forbidden me so strictly to say so   6.907702678812103
in a minute the young man darted through several rooms till at length he reached valentine s   12.269215866088087
listen to me my son has also guessed who you are he attributes his father s misfortunes to you   14.847293826987006
this must be impossible   14.528920223037698
after several blows he perceived that the stones were not cemented but had been merely placed one upon the other and covered with stucco   13.119025597958299
i hear a noise   14.029004358765565
i should be ungrateful said athos and i regard ingratitude not as a fault or a crime but as a vice which is much worse   12.185397213787613
you see m   9.17668950513404
hated by many but warmly supported by others without being really liked by anybody m   14.803456513503466
turning around he saw near the door a beautiful fair face whose large blue eyes were without any marked expression fixed upon him while the bouquet of myosotis was gently raised to her lips   17.73424068406857
villefort drew back and looked with astonishment on the young man who almost a stranger to him called noirtier his father   16.42634991801245
all he possessed was 15 257 francs   15.821929571219874
this house isolated from the rest had besides the main entrance another in the rue de ponthieu   14.035890246608599
will the marquis honor me by a few moments private conversation   10.769069841300137
but i perceive i have not much to teach you   10.143193833300732
milady put her charming blond head out at the window and gave her orders to her maid   11.835457278112155
no only add two bottles of champagne and the difference will be for the napkins   14.650963084682084
how delighted i am to have found you   14.945392961635207
but the well is now so completely choked up that i scarcely think it would be possible to add another handful of dust without leading to discovery   13.419322850377018
and so edmond s father died as he had lived without doing harm to anyone   10.627511876157648
don t be afraid you idiot   12.294268236471725
a change of ideas presented themselves to his brain like a new design on the kaleidoscope   13.297609114608312
impossible my lord   11.415008664504773
besides if he will do nothing officially he will answer any questions you propose to him   10.318089984458584

they parted laughing she turning back to gaze at the poor paralytic man with interest he looking after her with eyes of love   17.150368517549182
but who said it was buried alive   18.111894180124384
madame answered the count you are under the roof of one who esteems himself most fortunate in having been able to save you from a further continuance of your sufferings   14.98825408089549
and planchet ran to inform the other sentinels that it was useless to keep guard longer as his master had come out safe from the palais cardinal   9.667033959080097
and athos like the spectre of vengeance leaped into the room   7.248640004914265

they had just finished their double prayer when a nun softly tapped at the door of the cell   15.339716606476943
that poor count de rochefort   17.703782122186695
after approaching milady with a slow and solemn step so that the table alone separated them the unknown took off his mask   14.181520194772222
i replied the gascon i believe in devotion as a word at one s baptism for instance which naturally comes before one s proper name   5.782458502720756
allies   12.176332505622517
he went to a corner of his dungeon detached a stone and with it knocked against the wall where the sound came   12.465912806315458
he had read in the countenances of luigi and teresa their steadfast resolution not to surrender him and he drew from his pocket a purse full of gold which he offered to them   16.252704681299228
the abbess suspects nothing and believes that i am taken by order of the cardinal   17.679374674299773
his face had lost the expression of careless gayety it had worn like a mask the whole day   8.878134161116732
rochefort had returned to the chevalier d humieres his fifty horsemen less two missing at roll call   13.788118656302233
why that is that you would have acted much more wisely if you had not required me to make myself known   11.24175322693683
at the end of three months he had learned to write   14.34550993176014
he is a millionaire and they have made him a baron and now he is the baron danglars with a fine residence in the rue du mont blanc with ten horses in his stables six footmen in his antechamber and i know not how many millions in his strongbox   9.378776203839545
you see i can not escape even if i intended   15.391240569395466
villefort caught his arm   12.981660714145173
but what then is the noise   10.898142029840237
de blacas and the minister of police i have no further occasion for you and you may retire   12.70509009792254
there is myself replied milady   11.529317092959708
very well sir said the host i ll give the pie and the bottle of wine to your servant and in this way you will have the pen and ink into the bargain   10.947563040636439
at length i received this letter from your friend which states that my father is in paris and authorizes me to address myself to you for information respecting him   13.740599502857705
but she as her only reply drew a letter from her pocket and gave it to him   10.412931146175806
the marshal then entered the rue saint honore but there he was opposed by the barricades of the mendicant of saint eustache   10.03638407250103
that promise is pledged to you that heart is also yours   13.05948809723103
ah replied he sighing that is not very surprising   13.477513992133478
but you tell me also that the house of thomson french have constantly denied having rendered you this service   10.332275174254855
or kill yourself   15.961827239601664
by the governor s orders said he conduct the prisoner to the tier beneath   10.753135467616687
there caressing as he pretended the animal with his hand he put this bit of burning tinder in his ear   10.362713126020035
but that ought to be visible   6.68497952245029
i invite you with good will   9.034959684437732
is this young man an assassin by profession a murderer in cold blood   17.88062753519702
and what else does your worship wish for   8.263054165520593
yes said the major i did wish this fault to be hidden from every eye   15.370146472919524
he has gone to make his report and to say that all the pigeons are at this moment in the dovecot   16.094663034966047
aramis hesitated   10.969030996579018
but you promised me whispered the poor mercer   9.1552054537098
proceed was heard on all sides   15.33723725717789
she had almost all the honors of the quadrille and if she were envious of the count of san felice s daughter we will not undertake to say that carmela was not jealous of her   12.509077567135492
the darkness lasted two hours longer   11.181966723328522
you have merited it more than any of us by your wisdom and your counsels always followed by such happy results   13.496780005792445
and you approve of what she said that is to say you declare that the signs which she mentioned are really those by means of which you are accustomed to convey your thoughts   4.661707425376234
your eminence said comminges as i was re conducting the young man for whom you have asked he approached the glass door of the gallery and gazed intently upon some object doubtless the picture by raphael which is opposite the door   10.169890387362365
d artagnan understood for while replying the captain had raised three fingers   13.394224198160618
do you understand now said the captain why no complaints are made to the government and why the vessel never reaches port   10.287074534420075
reiterated the duke   8.608299345654526
the soldiers pushed back by these living walls were in danger of being crushed against the spokes of the wheels and the panels of the carriages   12.75283913091804
that is that i have always been opposed to this marriage and that the contract was entered into entirely without my consent or approbation   10.905679923267988
noirtier directed their attention to a waiter on which was placed a decanter containing lemonade and a glass   9.113819986176692
aramis who had the third canto of his poem to finish behaved like a man in haste   12.57060471630248
in the evening julie told her mother that although he was apparently so calm she had noticed that her father s heart beat violently   10.67877245899778
where do you live   8.421956566750524
i am a gallant fellow   16.76249850790873
what then said vampa raising his hand with a gesture of disdain while teresa no longer able to restrain her alarm clung closely to him do wolves rend each other   12.615944048020564
the duke counted two stories   16.927249386815305
the history to which m   10.810729632208718
athos in his hours of gloom and these hours were frequent was extinguished as to the whole of the luminous portion of him and his brilliant side disappeared as into profound darkness   6.295700950472667
a few shots were fired and one musketeer was wounded   10.038463207846888
he was to find out whether he could recognize himself as he had not seen his own face for fourteen years   12.093555983147704
he eagerly advanced and with the quickness of perception that no one but a prisoner possesses saw that there in all probability the opening must be   15.231760086044883
asked madame de chevreuse   10.383732099402964
well said the doctor after a moment s silence i will wait   17.03821546002427
d artagnan knew what she wanted   16.183571080861064
she had business to transact with linen drapers to whose houses i conducted her   15.053600342238092
fortunately as d artagnan had thought it was not dangerous   15.813329164150959
at the third knock however steps were heard inside   5.258801697314778
a vision at four o clock the four friends were all assembled with athos   12.006406056280172
the child did not answer   15.321111178643676
now then in this difficulty a bright idea has flashed across my brain   9.90990228328805
yes sir you are right in every particular   13.77817756771811
but at least if i am killed i shall be killed by a musketeer   15.098097794831471
monte cristo nodded his head in token of assent   10.461966984850472
copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change   11.527232662605428
instinctively fernand drew back his chair   5.088670815929221
the shoulder of athos the baldric of porthos and the handkerchief of aramis d artagnan in a state of fury crossed the antechamber at three bounds and was darting toward the stairs which he reckoned upon descending four at a time when in his heedless course he ran head foremost against a musketeer who was coming out of one of m   10.798935742783986
and i must take care of it for him since i only lend him my name   17.474335403066757
the queen did not wear her diamond studs   15.613644361142095
fortunately you have the sapphire   7.72859992982268
when he reached the landing he placed the armchair on the floor and rapidly rolled it into valentine s room   19.707065645891724
and as i said before let us speak of yourself   13.063373964163532
are you strong   8.049322993345616
said albert do you think we are going to run about on foot in the streets of rome like lawyers clerks   15.637552655665447
gentlemen cried aramis listen to this   15.012194595955812
he said this madame mazarin is a stumbling block   10.185293267718999
i shall very soon learn that language by signs valentine and i promise you solemnly that instead of despair it is happiness that awaits us   12.716839209999442
this amusement lasted from the barriere des sergens to the place of notre dame and friquet found in it very real enjoyment   16.89298076833679
they asked together   13.458621717294998
ask that woman said the man in the red cloak for you may plainly see she knows me   5.692207574828736
how will this end   11.485294677260828
when your turn comes i shall have the honor to inform you of it   10.631204127657764
he therefore returned by the subterraneous gallery and arrived in time to hear the exclamations of the turnkey who called out for help   12.077930831470887
i thought so too   9.44943519726042
as a reply he wrote the following letter do not depend upon me madame for the next meeting   20.48764996057004
it could not be said that it was wine which produced this sadness   10.879856441146107
chapter 10   12.661848890975733
his banker   8.306985632571578
remain   19.93028227654723
but i solemnly promise you to restrain all this ardor this fervor and intensity of feeling until you yourself shall require me to render them available in serving or assisting you   11.43739160592581
you know they are select affairs   9.81370095747832
how was this jealousy manifested   13.340342982685186
but since the end of the month m   17.169633314913057
by all means   10.169491329789233
nevertheless if the affairs of our family are arranged as we hope they will be i believe she will run the risk of being damned and will return to those she regrets particularly as she knows they are always thinking of her   13.791204495588056
may i inquire if you are acquainted with madame danglars   15.46029182395089
what you know   16.64078038402799
the london executioner has vanished   10.074123487236154
where are your musketeers   11.148391205169592
roman bandits the next morning franz woke first and instantly rang the bell   13.116289759565094
villefort being called on to prove the crime was preparing his brief with the same ardor that he was accustomed to exercise when required to speak in criminal cases   13.297315338335398
just ask yourself my good fellow whether there are not many persons of our acquaintance who assume the names of lands and properties they never in their lives were masters of   14.493321428510011
raoul at the same time seized one of the young man s hands and placed it on the mane which it grasped with the tenacity of a drowning man   12.746579145323837
villefort s father laughed   12.091019589240286
tomorrow my angel   11.260464921990367
sir replied the mayor   8.814671823448194
but better so than die of shame   13.110111085261703
then turning around and seeing that morrel still on his knees had thrown himself into an armchair he added in a low voice pressing emmanuel s hand significantly watch over him   6.362121284203843
at that moment i encountered the eye of the prince   12.201132295656915
he was in bed but surrounded with all the paraphernalia of war   10.783258820330136
collect all your courage for you have not yet heard all   13.698394639751099
i will sign it to morrow   13.875454397174934
he gazed doubtfully wistfully on danglars and then caution supplanted generosity   5.728455925673039
i will perish if i must but i will know it   12.543367678368053
yes but it does not   13.180288762664642
so much penetration so much frankness created admiration but did not entirely remove his suspicions   13.314252353856869
well then madame yes i did feel fear   8.373413391624792
you leave me then   8.46485169798881
jesus dieu   10.989415920472899
the monk exclaimed   9.363517021216401
then if i should require more continued monte cristo in a careless manner why of course i should draw upon you   12.828098256419022
the island of monte cristo thus at length by one of the unexpected strokes of fortune which sometimes befall those who have for a long time been the victims of an evil destiny dantès was about to secure the opportunity he wished for by simple and natural means and land on the island without incurring any suspicion   10.067094442082732
and believing that no one could execute the commission better than himself grimaud set off at full speed   13.415946489592127
valery he found a horse quite ready and awaiting him   9.691825459394309
while the august spouse of your majesty is anne of austria queen of france that is to say one of the greatest princesses in the world   13.644776039965743
he therefore approached the bed and while his companion was dipping the fingers with which he had touched the lips of the corpse in chloride of lime he uncovered the calm and pale face which looked like that of a sleeping angel   12.46328143602864
follow me said an officer who came up behind the guards   16.211585885809416
the count took out a small quantity of this with a gilt spoon and offered it to morrel fixing a long steadfast glance upon him   13.749628385062465
these are mademoiselle eugénie danglars and mademoiselle louise d armilly   14.852044814794777
how did danglars usually write   13.298282337740718
but apropos you belong to the fronde do you not   13.09269238546646
perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no room for such thoughts   17.32912416594235
well then so i will   11.559126419024063
ah no no   9.902859519499462
very true but you introduced me at m   6.894019655714787
they were within fifteen miles of monte cristo when the sun began to set behind corsica whose mountains appeared against the sky showing their rugged peaks in bold relief   7.98171276237256
d artagnan thought it would suffice for him and he sprang forward like a dart between them   14.67594204861855
it was noon and monte cristo had set apart one hour to be passed in the apartments of haydée as though his oppressed spirit could not all at once admit the feeling of pure and unmixed joy but required a gradual succession of calm and gentle emotions to prepare his mind to receive full and perfect happiness in the same manner as ordinary natures demand to be inured by degrees to the reception of strong or violent sensations   13.764795518067173
the good abbess had naturally consented to her request   16.292633612323293
well now my dear gérard said he to the young man with a very significant look do you know you seem as if you were not very glad to see me   9.624683410160381
but your age reassures me   8.211292462694031
he had only to turn his eyes on one side and allow andrea to fly and follow up the crime under that shadow of guilt called contempt of court   15.048793264341725
these are distinctions very suitable under a constitutional government   13.92144456002263
fourteen years   10.838958325109292
i was about to be mustered into the royal marines when he fell   10.135647681456287
how fortunate that the ornaments were worth more than the watch   12.755711319662055
added she to comminges   11.287237638950947
so that for a trifling sum he was as well lodged and as perfectly shut out from observation as the inhabitants of the finest mansion in the faubourg st   17.875154105225963
i can not tell you that replied the inspector   14.59913328224474
at the end of an instant the poet closed his manuscript upon the cover of which was written mirame a tragedy in five acts and raised his head   12.884713548403624
well picture to yourself a future more gloomy still certainly frightful perhaps sanguinary   12.5490069287124
asked danglars in amazement   14.522599926031292
noirtier s eye began to dilate and his eyelids trembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an individual about to speak and he darted a lightning glance at madame de villefort and his son   20.156224489329922
i pronounced no name for i knew none except his mother s as a young girl and it was by this name that he recognized her but he knows that his uncle was among her judges   11.979526586564898
the next two days passed in much the same way   9.997236098452063
here is the paper   11.361379210986929
all these he bequeathed to me with a thousand roman crowns which he had in ready money on condition that i would have anniversary masses said for the repose of his soul and that i would draw up a genealogical tree and history of his house   12.22872761601684
and what said the abbé   13.229561713585014
for the rest in the memoirs of this period which has left so many memoirs one does not find this worthy gentleman blamed even by his enemies   9.347142059119125
with your talents you would make your fortune in three or four years   9.64802610473243
debray instead of answering allowed her to remain in an attitude of nervous inquiry   7.372627334104275
the face of the steward despite one slight shade of care light as a summer cloud seemed a physiognomy of absolute felicity   7.6036056620623
but quick as it was it did not escape d artagnan s observation   11.193661261477839
since that time many things have happened to you   13.892541865647242
as for me thought porthos giving mordaunt his whole attention were it not for breaking in on the majesty of the situation i would leap down from the bench reach mordaunt in three bounds and strangle him   12.423958127570149
for on my word you haven t reached the end said the gascon in a jesting tone   6.959344493082799
30083m the curtain rose as usual to an almost empty house it being one of the absurdities of parisian fashion never to appear at the opera until after the beginning of the performance so that the first act is generally played without the slightest attention being paid to it that part of the audience already assembled being too much occupied in observing the fresh arrivals while nothing is heard but the noise of opening and shutting doors and the buzz of conversation   12.080658619676521
then he added monsieur you may rest assured i shall perform my duty impartially and that if he be innocent you shall not have appealed to me in vain   11.665698396214454
so then the rabbit dies and justice takes no notice   14.05631365283045
you are right sir replied the governor   8.24858151143604
amongst us you will not meet with any of those episodes with which your adventurous existence has so familiarized you   11.26782026377818
at the moment when he opened the door such a gust of wind came in that the lamp was nearly extinguished   13.85347781167147
it is past noon said she and today is saturday   12.929609313520254
there were not lacking however evidences of what we may call the intelligent egoism of a youth who is charmed with the indolent careless life of an only son and who lives as it were in a gilded cage   8.868603784208753
and i will wait   5.151456333882328
it was then three o clock in the morning   14.660777081334095
gentlemen said d artagnan addressing the guardsmen you may easily comprehend that such a feast can only be very dull after what has taken place   16.196630942901265
alas sir replied the queen i have lost the habit of commanding and have adopted instead that of making petitions   13.788705360957085
mazarin contemplated these proceedings with a thoughtful glance   11.284345443463637
besides what a charming outlook it would have been to serve the cardinal   9.813899988826519
danglars who had listened to all this preamble with imperturbable coolness but without understanding a word since like every man burdened with thoughts of the past he was occupied with seeking the thread of his own ideas in those of the speaker   13.71938942710279
your betrothed valentine de villefort   17.96790242360452
yes doubtless replied d artagnan who had never been able to cram the first rudiments of that language into his head and who had by his ignorance driven his master to despair yes doubtless there is one   15.167738167545751
she resolved therefore to seek hospitality of the priest   10.216916842465329
how useless   15.476224951172895
follow me said morrel   8.423203818896576
demanded he of the cardinal   12.879307594750854
monte cristo exchanged a ceremonious bow with m   16.447040360219056
at the hint from the mendicant his master made him a sign to retire and he was obliged to obey   13.885966877057303
take your glass then and let us drink   18.042865787177853
look at me madame look around me   7.8523831947753
he had stanched the wound and the man was better   12.865916765351098
cried the man in the name of heaven put your sword back into the sheath and don t kill me unheard   13.87577035470995
nor indeed had she fallen into that state of depression where it is impossible to conceal the garb of misery   15.333184823830114
who i believe is the mainspring of all this i confess said the cardinal   14.910533832452
i know that i suffer that s all   12.860438528064295
poor dear man he is innocence itself   13.496838313518213
alas what would become of me who can only atone for evil by doing good   12.136399695795605

beppo told him he was going to take him to a villa a league from rome   11.031327274739212
the conversation between milady and the cavalier was so animated that d artagnan stopped on the other side of the carriage without anyone but the pretty soubrette perceiving his presence   10.483952199517637
one evening he cast off the painter of a sailboat from the iron ring that secured it to the dock at leghorn wrapped himself in his coat and lay down and said to the crew to the island of elba   9.004139919000226
the young king slowly raised his little hand and held it out to the musketeer   11.90133162716416

at these words there appeared in noirtier s eye an expression of such deep meaning that the young girl thought she could read these words there you are mistaken   13.560753565484175
this uneasiness amounting almost to frenzy arose from the report morcerf s adventure had made in the world for the affair at the opera was generally known   9.53065267552448
d artagnan stopped before them and they stopped before him   14.346571388094853

my wretched curiosity has brought all this about pursued the lady   10.559855974824242
he has done us the honor to remain here   12.233683815934855
his dogs whose caresses he loved welcomed him in the antechamber   15.048835633145838
so d artagnan began sir he said with desperate politeness it seems to me that you change your costume almost as rapidly as i have seen the italian mummers do whom the cardinal mazarin brought over from bergamo and whom he doubtless took you to see during your travels in france   9.495100538551622
he is in the small salon excellency returned bertuccio   13.724710302920654

my son he said to him you saw a great number of people in the streets as you came here   12.780471159536429
and he is dead   10.67326643591046
the guests were still at table and the heated and energetic conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then agitated each dweller of the south where unhappily for five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the violence of party feeling   10.528492165674605
come said the abbé closing his hiding place and pushing the bed back to its original situation let me hear your story   8.227724911513164
you do not know your own good fortune   6.785810105010959
i shall then be far away   16.905093776289227
but milady felt herself denounced even by his terror   15.726888089187042
he remained motionless on the spot pressing with his left hand something he had concealed under his coat   10.707770002187235

but if you are very well behaved you will be allowed to walk about and some day you will meet the governor and if he chooses to reply that is his affair   11.337277969217533
and if he had heard him in the disposition of mind he then enjoyed he certainly would not have remarked it   10.613346824148586
but notwithstanding the serene sky the gracefully formed boats and the golden light in which the whole scene was bathed the count of monte cristo wrapped in his cloak could think only of this terrible voyage the details of which were one by one recalled to his memory   8.131319096219848

the guards were unable to help any one each one was occupied with his self preservation   12.457027415448213

death alone can separate them remarked fernand   17.661298662748155
mazarin started   10.405225677731213
only i fancied that the honest messager was an exception to the rule and that it only announced telegraphic despatches   8.259836601139696

sparks were emitted from the swords like water spouting forth   12.345494027053995
besides remember that alexander was lame and hannibal had but one eye   9.911420565553442
and where was that   8.862978096665179
he fixed his haughty eye upon the stranger and perceived a man of from forty to forty five years of age with black and piercing eyes pale complexion a strongly marked nose and a black and well shaped mustache   21.16478765559056
i swear it   12.70319138611204
but it seems to me that you are tolerably familiar with coats of arms a certain embroidered handkerchief for instance to which i owe the honor of your acquaintance   11.56713027529571
the englishman delighted at having to do with a gentleman of such a kind disposition pressed d artagnan in his arms and paid a thousand compliments to the three musketeers and as porthos s adversary was already installed in the carriage and as aramis s had taken to his heels they had nothing to think about but the dead   15.937768443277594
maximilian in his devotedness gazed silently at her   9.52599342916912
cause her to lose a hundred thousand francs and that would teach her prudence   5.956324118258717
the carriage rolled with a thundering noise over the pavement and everyone turned to notice the dazzling meteor   12.59354980601135
de quesnel replied that he wished first to know what they wanted with him   13.739656186043996
would it not be a sweet revenge for him when he found that i had not died from the blow of his dagger   9.59059423465623
the four friends exchanged a joyful glance   9.720267205696679
and your first is still living   10.349989017958192
what dreadful sufferings   9.756811178558056
i will not harm you   15.872243874529389
we dined so very late hastily interposed la carconte   9.872212005127418
that will do said he   13.161158829688638
he fixed his eyes upon d artagnan even more earnestly than before   9.88724596424668
the cardinal alighted   22.05333113252472
really this is frightful   8.855179839004382
you belong to the court doubtless yet i have never seen you at court   14.926441831990626
intrigues terrify me   10.750502754138445
and yet if we burn it who knows whether monsieur cardinal has not a secret to interrogate ashes   10.532076362498696
farther on a still greater terror seized him on passing by the cemetery of st   12.415617114512273
while the rest slept then we went away a short distance   9.908623662180627
i tell you it is too late   8.466395354911874
do you think she said with a ghastly smile that i shall be inclined to reopen this coffer to answer any future accusations   14.66505430567751
before a woman you would dare not fly i presume   12.66201484417716
noirtier made such an effort that his lips expanded into a smile   12.96957082727715
and yet you spoke of him at once   16.220298380004003
have what time you require dantès   12.126485893110239
at the sight of papers of all sorts titles contracts parchments which were kept in the archives of the family all descending from the poisoned cardinal i in my turn examined the immense bundles of documents like twenty servitors stewards secretaries before me   15.092912695698711
but they may do as they please the brave gentlemen   18.1860741762823
during ten minutes he alone kept the crowd at bay   12.063212350091296
i thought i must confess that these tales were inventions of the middle ages   11.943215869155548
come said beauchamp taking both his hands take courage my friend   8.321271269994075
your italian prince   12.54358175054994
adieu dear friend   12.329744612538915
parry too started and stopped reading   14.235412217800999
no for i will not allow you to do so   12.1106137511901
i have chosen my visit at a wrong time and will retire   17.624405987565712
and have you forgiven her for all she has made you suffer   11.586990291610878
he dismounted and knocked on the door   12.858347952468401
he and the count de guiche are like each other s shadows   9.757108220756123
here is the prisoner   12.419200701955747
and as he had foreseen the queen gave orders to introduce monsieur d artagnan at once   7.593103713499952
a proof   10.211132338707824
we shall be murdered there said aramis   14.005701695038521
athos arrested   10.993454585290978
sell this ring a ring which comes from my sovereign   11.055101685403985
this gentleman was a young man scarcely sixteen years of age now white with anger   8.187192141663111
i think i know what you want replied athos   9.216495387169614
unfortunately i have just breakfasted   6.131166091763502
that the owner of the horse was lord ruthven himself   11.223737757058922
the right idea has just occurred to me   12.08293868039984
their number was great   7.140315110768733
then he added so my friend it s your opinion that monsieur de beaufort will escape   14.02929064881227
dresses in fine style   13.78970296560551
a man of talent and merit whom you will like as i and monsieur de chavigny do i am sure   9.84240260987358
my faith my good host said d artagnan filling the two glasses i asked for a bottle of your best wine and if you have deceived me you will be punished in what you have sinned   11.039559777832327
listen said monte cristo   12.418165258753817
count   14.990583525719824
and improbable as it seemed at first it may be true   11.796262563994624
to yours my gentlemen   8.961007676695502
my dear friend said the baroness while the two young people were shaking hands i and eugénie are come to be the first to announce to you the approaching marriage of my daughter with prince cavalcanti   8.036288563070952
and he awaited with impatience the moment always in the future when aramis would throw aside the uniform and assume the cassock   11.717698777299177
felton cried she you are as great as judas maccabeus   12.924358973064928
each of you take a horse by the bridle he said to porthos and mousqueton   13.348550945568332
this first moment had been delayed five days which under any other circumstances might have appeared rather long to m   11.889784705704429
scarcely however had he touched edmond s hand when he felt he had done all he could do and rushed hastily out of the house   6.2231414163177385
he then took villefort s arm and at the same time holding that of madame danglars under his own he dragged the procureur to the plantain tree where the shade was thickest   10.127642460664202
germain or in the pré aux clercs   14.154439049780006
pardon me d artagnan he said   12.499484325595708
the vessel resembled a swan with its wings opened towards the wind gliding on the water   12.797483990720114
an infamous scoundrel monseigneur a scoundrel   18.89404187896021
grimaud gave a grim smile   14.85905928413563
father and daughter we saw in a preceding chapter how madame danglars went formally to announce to madame de villefort the approaching marriage of eugénie danglars and m   9.852928322952572
that the enemy have left the town and are now closing the passages of the tyne against us   10.985896395239786
de tréville had the right of entry at all times   10.551986533227549
here are more than 4 000 francs settled on you   12.042889043339992
to calais said d artagnan   9.148245621058095
signed el kobbir   10.48275841245766
my friend said morcerf let us enjoy the present without gloomy forebodings for the future   16.254615562802893
vade retro satanas   16.50123747963799
faria had now fully regained his consciousness but he still lay helpless and exhausted on his miserable bed   13.0584225922358
all these preparations had collected a number of idlers round the door of signor pastrini s   9.705890650082758
dessessart pointing to d artagnan   10.251118966053076
i learned it since i have been in prison and that from the conversation of monsieur the commissary an amiable man   9.584872395454713
cried the young queen affecting surprise you are giving me then two more i shall have fourteen   11.253665936681735
i understand that mazarin is at this very moment extremely uneasy as to the state of affairs   7.475675640157262
they will not be strangers they will be friends   11.233956749243037
and it was of this man that i intended to ask shelter   14.748044756982367
yes said porthos smiling at the remembrance of his former exploits   10.623549266232452
ah he exclaimed it is no longer brucine that is used   12.194029220517328
he told me everything and desired me to watch instead of him and in his place to conduct wherever they wished to go the gentlemen who should bring me a handkerchief tied at each corner like that one which you hold and one which i have in my pocket   10.391882198507732
would it be impertinent signor sinbad said franz to ask you the particulars of this kindness   13.578798850327413
and withdrawing the knife from the wound in rita s bosom he held it out to the old man with one hand while with the other he tore open his vest   9.410869827637967
on the steps of the scaffold death tears off the mask that has been worn through life and the real visage is disclosed   13.416179435362036
but doctor you see me already so grieved how can i introduce into my house so much scandal after so much sorrow   12.956088440854273
but even this would have availed little against a more deadly medium of death employed four days ago which is generally but too fatal   11.107364030785762
arrested   12.011858329002404
and what a coat sir for a prince of the cavalcanti   6.525116808744478
what a noise behind us   11.869088309914885
my dear d artagnan you will never make anything but a very bad secretary   12.726321836148298
that is true murmured mazarin in a low tone but as thy life is not mine i suppose i must buy it must i not   12.995162168940334
the pistol fell from his hands   14.289666773815014
i forgot you and m   12.184681464993284
morrel the justice to say that he ran still faster   12.480528523951113
haydée s learned reference is to the behavior of an actor in the dionysian festivals   9.147309058302785
i will show you the way and he went in first   14.848381124386835
he cried this time we shall be pursued   15.489826843123549
the count again struck the gong   11.445702170564534
we must not do so   7.514735110102983
he had at first an idea of crossing by the ferry   15.282010252677066
and with this fearful injunction the count disappeared through the door which noiselessly closed after him   15.036567352943258
in the midst of our misfortunes we are still rich enough not to require assistance from anyone   11.645624561917979
and if ever i am reconciled with the court i shall prove to you i hope that i remain your friend as well as that of what the devil are their names d artagnan and porthos   13.977021307146982
your excellency said the man you are fully persuaded of my entire devotion to you are you not   10.797348720480208
it is a quarter of an hour s journey from here to the city consequently a quarter of an hour s journey from the city to hither   8.388959176202542
thank you madame said mazarin   11.68825722869646
from what you relate i suppose it to have been the evening of madame de saint méran s death   12.552181038578736
it would be difficult to say whether his emotion were caused by fear or passion   10.826077803459917
well monsieur la ramee you shall judge of it yourself and at once   9.43192870374155
i am dipping a biscuit in a glass of spanish wine   9.007046749394881
ough   4.563532702201127
to know if you have seen a young man pass fifteen years of age mounted on a chestnut horse and followed by a groom   11.283727379235085
i only love him and a young girl called mercédès   14.029514462568422
but i shall explain to him your state of health and make excuses for you for the scene can not fail of being a most ridiculous one   12.032913547036742
then suddenly pausing he added your pardon sire but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget not the respect i have for that is too deeply engraved in my heart but the rules of etiquette   6.558085845175795
but apropos of debray how is it that i have not seen him lately at the baron s house   4.005540593606508
i once thought continued faria of removing these iron bars and letting myself down from the window which as you see is somewhat wider than yours although i should have enlarged it still more preparatory to my flight   16.3278931695793
i had a bad opinion of him the moment i saw his wound and since he asked for a monk you know that it was his opinion too that death would follow   12.474740177275834
they did not know if it was a comedy monte cristo was playing but every word he uttered had such an air of simplicity that it was impossible to suppose what he said was false besides why should he tell a falsehood   17.045948933959835
andrea assumed his most charming smile and asked if he could have no   7.305039256938685
de salvieux   14.121869399928608
let us push on then to noyon   14.7031446813064
that mood lasted some time   6.751003196680383
come porthos   14.333893248250655
he preserved his melancholy and motionless position for some time after his two friends had regained their carriage   9.374039392706585
pardon my dear monsieur bonacieux if i don t stand upon ceremony said d artagnan but nothing makes one so thirsty as want of sleep   12.16513793496515
then overcoming his manifest repugnance he pronounced the required oath but in so low a tone as to be scarcely audible to the majority of the members who insisted on his repeating it clearly and distinctly which he did   17.481441111504985
i however do not understand said porthos   12.363327985147446
i do not quite understand you replied franz   14.508468421320096
in the first place do you accept   14.46273437939209
but scarcely had she done so when pride burst forth and she began to weep   11.033321959674161
chapter 99   9.24948668046934
yesterday he wrote again   9.896941815113804
i can not tell you my name since i do not know it   11.035862326071564
not exactly replied the mendicant   14.248991727890244
you will find mousqueton there   5.887432781259127
i myself had occasion to see this man in 1816 or 1817 and we could only go into his dungeon with a file of soldiers   15.361168331571712
it was still about a quarter full as we before stated   16.021321779499083
rise and answer   13.698337611634708
well then at the end of a month when drinking water from the same carafe you would kill the person who drank with you without your perceiving otherwise than from slight inconvenience that there was any poisonous substance mingled with this water   7.598199402024527
approach and tell monsieur that it is possible to know beforehand all that he has not known   10.307883922806818
as soon as the identity of my brother was proved i was set at liberty   10.179762799580313
meanwhile albert had arrived within ten paces of the group formed by the five young men   10.151626298897623
on the contrary let us speak about it   14.841556799912818
but first let haydée be informed that i have returned   10.304193224619436
oh fear nothing said the skipper showing his face   10.280187803034265
take my arm and let us go   15.699082498595603
he extended his hand and rang the bell thrice   8.289196872539241
you are i am edmond dantès   13.254113534865155
at that moment porthos entered   17.09244076981054
lord winter s tent was pitched by the side of the royal marquee a kind of corridor communicating between the two   13.80535225189001
you looked more like a brigand than an honest man with your beard six inches and your hair a foot long   11.65922524104564
yes yes guitant said mazarin   8.52063480298296
someone was walking down before them and this person hearing the rustling of a silk dress turned around   8.07061561230715
i will not torment you much but only on condition that you become a frondist my young friend and a hearty frondist too   16.58118115942724
doubtless madame de villefort had just put out her lamp and the nightlamp alone reflected its dull light on the window   14.048884138983794
his horse had received a bullet in his neck and he had difficulty in controlling him maddened by pain   10.23673368883504
de villefort sent to tell valentine to be ready in the drawing room in half an hour as he expected the notary and m   11.746437171894584
then bending his face down to athos s ear what is the object of this visit   12.0103719249853
said he it is a pity they are not really related   16.9000207179686
said d artagnan to the youth   11.343612201440521
the woman gazed at it a moment and then said in a gloomy voice suppose it s false   16.550960260138716
on my soul handsome stirrups   17.519749150262967
but how the devil would you have me retire on twelve hundred francs   12.038378126352782
and how does it concern me what you have learned   13.521803175776853
but time fails me   10.432287987474163
you know how difficult it is to discover the truth   7.409465284666433
for as i am a good catholic i firmly believe i am acting justly in performing my functions on this woman   13.621107973557503
then in spite of the failure of his first search he began a second after having told gaetano to roast one of the two kids   11.866823232507773
we will send the carriage to wait for us on the piazza del popolo by the via del babuino for i shall be glad to pass myself through the corso to see if some orders i have given have been executed   5.768277119208311
notwithstanding the judges were so few the trial was to continue   17.103735669204575
i believe i see double   11.411778562804127
believe me madame as true a thing as it is that a heart beats in this bosom a heart devoted to you believe that you have been the idol of our lives   12.302384640341298
thanks to the influence of m   8.829033464172333
but a most enormous price was offered me this morning for them   15.15370902233382
now then said d artagnan this is something like   7.94633954370064
yes said porthos let us take the opposite direction   9.398787463826437
with regard to d artagnan we know how he was lodged and we have already made acquaintance with his lackey master planchet   16.118887114809773
he proceeded slowly and in deep reverie   13.220337455734782
fortunately deceived by d artagnan s trick they neglected to reload their guns   12.352664658294987
i have something important to reveal to him   11.54214807186723
she saw albert attempt to persuade the count but he obstinately refused   16.078214004786602
yes and your conversation is most interesting   12.739441026626004
and bernouin do i not take him with me   9.289578998150965
and i shall be together with my brother in law emmanuel at the disposition of the count whenever he thinks fit to honor us   15.701298814843039
and he added with a smile he will consequently make a few changes in his personal appearance   12.404025905747114
it was morrel alone who remembered with alarm that if he had to repay on the 15th the 50 000 francs of m   7.5469365993676405
she has always believed me sire to be her enemy   11.076025125780864
so you see my lord since i am hungry i would with your highness s leave and la ramee bent low   11.668650914972401
d artagnan stretched out his arm in which he held the lantern put his head in at the half opened door and seeing that the cabin was nothing better than a shed good he said   10.16996495179512
you will enter by the rue neuve sainte catherine   5.969669530382385
at the same instant four men armed to the teeth entered by side doors and rushed upon athos   4.663945691282411
let us go in said monte cristo   12.094099065190354
you forgive me then sir said raoul and you will deign to tell me who is the person that you call the young indian   11.278693907250998
fortunately as we have said they were within a hundred paces of the city   13.13172694159792
that is because we are talking spanish my dear friend said athos   8.105874893744442
and walking in a straight line he went to the wall at the foot of which they all four arrived at the same instant   11.101947454434496
he heard me patiently and when i had finished burst out laughing   19.772109897856932
it was the first billet he had received   10.299779679626482
that would be invaluable to us in africa who have not always any food to eat and rarely anything to drink   15.924532228658652
and once more he bowed low before his highness   11.399272398870373
it is unfortunate returned he that you have never visited the environs for i wish to see my new property this evening and had you gone with me you could have given me some useful information   10.514143154193404
athos in his turn rising without speaking went and unhooked his sword   7.325642631885836
that is to the purpose   11.924873838994593
this brought back to franz in spite of himself the recollection of the terror with which the count had inspired the countess g and her firm conviction that the man in the opposite box was a vampire   9.20779312505676
better then pursue our enterprise   18.82376094246444
they all left in spite of prayers and entreaties testifying their regret at leaving so good a master and mistress and especially mademoiselle valentine so good so kind and so gentle   5.8662681166211605

long live the emperor   12.798427213263176
i will think of maximilian   16.805874061077542
in his arms he held the child whom no skill had been able to recall to life   10.236400459943482
albert however hoped to indemnify himself for all these slights and indifferences during the carnival knowing full well that among the different states and kingdoms in which this festivity is celebrated rome is the spot where even the wisest and gravest throw off the usual rigidity of their lives and deign to mingle in the follies of this time of liberty and relaxation   13.592174408760382
a probable thing   12.885829359887913
he would break you like glass   9.322658365921365
he had but one thought to go forward   8.918520080225132
i do this oh my god said he with his eyes raised to heaven as much for thy honor as for mine   18.007780171871698
this letter as he spoke maximilian drew a letter from the purse and gave it to the count this letter was written by him the day that my father had taken a desperate resolution and this diamond was given by the generous unknown to my sister as her dowry   15.003057928549012
but would it be just to allow me to go to a possible death without having given me at least something more than hope   13.760678403089964
and then he like the first saluted the nocturnal visitors making a sign that they might proceed   11.737866762250755
so i will not abandon this bouquet   13.809074332876646

my friend my father said morrel with excitement have a care i again repeat for the power you wield over me alarms me   10.439191648758054

old pastrini our former acquaintance received the traveller at the door hat in hand   8.948280282896064
if you repent there is still time   18.398448744345345
i doubt it planchet replied d artagnan but what are you thinking of   10.733836908684282
he proceeded toward his abode very thoughtfully looking behind him from time to him to contemplate the dark and silent frontage of the louvre   14.360238085825689
the nocturnal visitor ignorant of the fact that the count had removed the staples might now think himself at home and pursue his purpose with full security   11.629323144402264
for the first three days i heard him walking about as usual but on the fourth i heard nothing   13.283699387178478
i am all attention said d artagnan   13.767506087660673
were you condemned were you innocent were you a martyr replied felton the greater would be the necessity for prayer   11.121949119190141
d artagnan looked at the two women one after the other and was forced to acknowledge that in his opinion dame nature had made a mistake in their formation   8.3867242344636
come then said the prince   8.409511582717768
i saw my father s hand tremble   10.376254080295316
it matters little   13.446697776605504
i am not difficult of access sir   12.428837105100735
but why don t you come there also   11.779410126934392

that is it madame that is the same   17.624179710667036
but i conjure you do not abandon me   15.264464236056291

i shall get them all in time   14.999317661170444
he was telling me this morning that tired of letting his property lie dormant in italy which is a dead nation he wished to find a method either in france or england of multiplying his millions but remember that though i place great confidence in busoni i am not responsible for this   12.001510701212595
at this moment one of those heavy wagons drawn by bullocks which carry the wood cut in the fine forests of the country to the ports of the loire came out of a byroad full of ruts and turned on that which the two horsemen were following   13.229770469905873
he recalled to his mind the details of the first night and with a beating heart and a brain on fire he re entered the hôtel and flew toward kitty s chamber   11.068987208428359
because i am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps replied albert laughing   10.89087859168104
the accusation m   11.497533973503458
say no more i entreat you   12.34735935963631
and what was it   11.106169801321464
mordaunt made a last effort rose seized the hand thus extended to him and grasped it with the vehemence of despair   13.3514984100882
how can we be implicated in any way   4.967277366303058
and the tremulous voice of dantès surprised in the midst of his happiness struck a sympathetic chord in his own bosom he also was on the point of being married and he was summoned from his own happiness to destroy that of another   12.854839368038377
there they are coming out   10.437241795546212
have pity on me doctor   17.872473881896997
chapter 46   10.387782391079165
but you sent for me my dear child   17.495473137323017
too many diamonds too much gold and splendor are now reflected by the mirror in which monte cristo seeks to behold dantès   11.336044916018873
for that party no one dares openly to recruit and when people recruit for it it is with averted eyes and humble voice   11.029024635531833
by degrees the passage narrowed yet the duke continued his course   9.685401594959359
you may madame said he with emphasis   13.831658835742978
this time the lieutenant did not wait for the opposite party to speak   10.95515551394681
that may happen one day   11.63503324503263
have you decided   10.629582592794833
but can you find your man   16.53478114226598
all the servants surrounded her offering her assistance   11.649477160071346
that s all that is necessary said athos   13.641452969853075
but i have you must know always had in spite of my bands warlike inclinations   9.945579096399099
the very madness of the abbé faria gone mad in prison condemned him to perpetual captivity   8.776078412897059
and have you placed the letter before him as i ordered you to do   8.52667704660623
franz found himself in utter darkness   11.212600707536463
valentine shuddered   9.540607928297096
when one is going to be married there is nothing like implicit confidence   11.90760443221116
that s true murmured the commissary   11.515729658029638
will it be the same this evening   16.08943279272106
you think of everything   15.607919109387986
he remained in his cell and this visit only increased the belief in his insanity   13.239671441003876
let me see continued the stranger i am one of your largest creditors   7.273383027842588
because it has awakened and has begun to beat again because i have yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast by a woman s voice   16.815783927718616
stir but a step said they and you are a dead man   17.14690136851026
what does she say   15.801584237485649
his thin face deeply furrowed by care and the bold outline of his strongly marked features betokened a man more accustomed to exercise his mental faculties than his physical strength   11.207679889728677
shall i see you again before your departure   14.010345317774723
a favorite   10.537781434606085
murmured m   10.448137159317936
inconvenience us   7.991905012445347
some time has elapsed since our plans were formed and they are not yet executed   9.550310866184908
de tréville announced this good news to the three musketeers and d artagnan inviting all four to breakfast with him next morning   12.905882830947919
he must be indeed a strange man   13.526192774502436
but you are wounded it seems said planchet   9.221970344359697
not a sound was heard in the castle except of a footstep up and down in the chamber above as he supposed the bedroom of athos   9.561167764781324
but let us see   9.32545744983615
now sir said the count you are safe calm yourself   8.600788970005123
believe me i know the people   8.445959001470452
why should that man give me a false diamond   10.271982334674298
monte cristo smiled as he nodded to albert then remained a moment absorbed in deep meditation   10.196341679641376
three days are a short time and france is large   9.55092134938055
on saturday if you will yes   11.143604482700557
then said the young man with anxiety i shall be sure to be placed in an agreeable position   9.876082481846632
don t be distressed   14.092752869372264
the deep glow of indignation suffused the cheeks of dantès   8.818274752636569
i recognized the presence of this poison in the case of poor barrois as well as in that of madame de saint méran   14.812630132704658
the coal black hair large bright glittering eyes in which a wild unearthly fire seems burning the same ghastly paleness   7.3498341294909295
meantime aramis had drawn near to the coadjutor who smiling all the while contrived to drop some words into his ear   15.17668267946318
sire it was impossible to learn   8.256228258462613
oh blind self love   15.54914935330543
yes but you understand french and mazarin laid his hand upon guitant s shoulder   9.772984007916598
planchet grimaud bazin and mousqueton presented themselves and received clear positive and serious orders from athos   15.66950305125093
the town is in open revolt and just now as i was crossing the rue montorgueil with monsieur du vallon who is here and is your humble servant they wanted in spite of my uniform or perhaps because of my uniform to make us cry long live broussel   11.071339977900616
she had just poisoned a young woman who was her rival and before leaving england she had it was believed caused the favorite of the king to be murdered   15.92843954696362
estafania give up the keys of my drawers and my desks   16.034757375735587
and abbés who give diamonds worth two thousand louis are rare   7.442419564945315
well said milady if you keep your word instead of five hundred i will give you a thousand pistoles   10.595238621830159
their apparent bickerings are only feints to deceive fools   14.537669241003158
but why should it   14.79016088263517
with a heavy heart d artagnan again bent his way toward the ferry   8.13535094953924
ah said he we have at pisa ugolino s tower   8.551348160884727
and that is what is amusing you at this moment   11.918560304845276
during the days of his prosperity not a festivity took place without himself and wife being among the spectators   19.8179757433849
i heard they had fallen victims to their sorrow and perhaps to their poverty   10.073304252381698
how long did the queen remain out of the chamber   13.91017733863238
the cavalier addressed some words in english to his sister   9.789374760570263
why from the french government   12.399664971779291
this silence self control and struggle lasted about twenty seconds then the count raised his pallid face   9.01496622540482
d artagnan still unperceived supported himself against the other side   13.067924856688094
these men are the ones who saved her   11.235591145692323
in the course of a quarter of an hour everyone had assembled in the chamber of the paralytic   10.889406207521137
but her majesty has no property interposed aramis   9.005229054738404
and what effect does he produce   8.46546447109035
and you see you would have been deceived   11.926867752441687
but if it should occur to me presently i will tell you   10.069900631781046
the spectators followed the little vessel with their eyes as long as it remained visible   6.532032143325447
and i keep my word   10.314276195397818
seven or eight leagues at the most   11.890015476098558
you come at a fitting moment   15.316898000360707
when the emperor returned from the island of elba my brother instantly joined the army was slightly wounded at waterloo and retired with the army beyond the loire   8.48794313817973
ah good heaven   13.615857753406233
friquet had put on his sunday clothes under the pretext of having a swollen face which he had managed to simulate by introducing a handful of cherry kernels into one side of his mouth and had procured a whole holiday from bazin   8.76561240304623
the soldiers seized dantès who followed passively   14.480005002478595
an old man who was digging busily at one of the beds stuck his spade in the earth and approached cap in hand striving to conceal a quid of tobacco he had just thrust into his cheek   14.211474109925918
you should install yourself here and cheer my solitude   11.852897366288216
no but it may be sent in something else   13.402482990962957
valentine looked at him a moment with her large scrutinizing eyes endeavoring not to let morrel discover the grief which struggled in her heart   9.610142532660845
sit down at the table and let us drink   7.433786301283279
said d artagnan to raoul you were just in time to stay my hand   10.325926753688144
pierre obeyed   8.98791896212722
i beg you therefore to excuse if you find anything in me too turkish too italian or too arabian   10.204860807239392
his room like all those on the same floor had but one outlet to the gallery in the sight of everybody   9.40154467786454
bazin my friend said aramis i believe you meddle with my conversation   13.853263526165144
tell your good superior that in order that we may be as much together as possible you ask her permission to share my repast   11.72614290445828
well observed franz this chief is very polite and i see no objection the more so as i bring my share of the supper   16.065536389245615
why bind thee   8.116855193762467
and you abuse my love   11.52824700391027
i shall buy a chestnut colored suit   12.725685275776138
you will have the horses fully equipped monsieur   14.276740494285223
has it ever happened to you   10.959340357398377
raoul went out and when athos heard his young joyous voice calling to grimaud and olivain he sighed   15.617252610768743
everything is possible said monte cristo rising from the bench on which he had been sitting   11.031309101614477
sir said the baroness humbly are you not aware that the man employed there was dismissed that they talked of going to law with him that orders were issued to arrest him and that this order would have been put into execution if he had not escaped by flight which proves that he was either mad or guilty   6.67745314791118
exclaimed the countess   9.745293378316655
danglars sighed while he carved the fowl   11.6004136580793
i will give them to you on condition that you let me go   13.849751480308655
be christians   12.251618241086604
but still he is charged with what   13.89493449339207
farther still perhaps   11.915808368774343
the young officer stood upright before her awaiting her words as if to devour them   9.031387483383554
and what i have told you is really the case added to the ill humor you remarked but which i did not think it worth while to allude to   7.80807978571852
richelieu whom they hated during his lifetime and whom they now praise after his death was even less popular than i am   5.632536418930361
help help help   13.547844293060725
for i am aware that m   8.945986269994178
i am going said albert as he made his parting bow   9.474735453688591
a dripping pan immediately that i may not lose a drop of the fat of this estimable bird   8.20308352496538
the other was a convent of jesuits and was the property a by no means unusual circumstance of these worthy fathers   14.180120584348558
you have called haydée your sister let her become so indeed valentine   6.828946955477064
oh pray name it   14.119260659533852
i mean that behind the misfortune which has just happened to you there is another perhaps still greater   8.438701082017294
we have a rendezvous you remember at the place royale   9.726146051926701
i paused but i had already drunk half a glass   8.240821855689969
i then perceived that he was hiding something under his mantle which he laid on the grass in order to dig more freely   9.66897327628449
behind a glass window by the light of the cardinal s lantern which had been placed on the floor in the midst of the gallery they saw the orange and pomegranate trees of the castle of rueil in long lines forming one great alley and two smaller side alleys   11.592623932910719
he was a man between thirty nine and forty years of age of medium height but a very well proportioned figure   9.470125419676588
if he made the compact with the cardinal which he required athos would no more give him his hand athos would renounce him   13.7879240718811
as well as i could judge by the light of the sun the day was already two thirds gone   15.985847320432153
women fancy they have talent because they have managed two or three intrigues without being the talk of paris   6.915533154106884
from dieppe   11.143742047950793
he took from the duke all the steel knives and silver forks and replaced them with silver knives and wooden forks pretending that as he had been informed that the duke was to pass all his life at vincennes he was afraid of his prisoner attempting suicide   9.940994808219907
then wishing to make the best use of his time while he had the means of labor he continued to work without ceasing   11.416516015806002
i speak of the adventure eh you know well what i mean   13.594992984347456
take for yourself the better of the two and give me yours   11.069480624402376
follow us planchet   7.868252694587419
the second interview between the former musketeers was not so formal and threatening as the first   11.843987422146267
he shut himself in his room and tried to read but his eye glanced over the page without understanding a word and he threw away the book and for the second time sat down to sketch his plan the ladders and the fence   15.547609501618917
yes i recognize the features of the angel who appears to me every night crying to my soul which can not sleep strike save england save thyself for thou wilt die without having appeased god   13.756292701071544
milady waited then with much impatience for she feared the day would pass away without her seeing felton again   18.647434297314962
let my lord at two o clock ask leave to make up a game at tennis with la ramee and let him send two or three balls over the ramparts   14.416366738462724
what is that line   10.569428063541144
the cemetery of père lachaise chapter 106   8.760535756891915
well what   16.68407547384249
but said d artagnan now i think of it what is to prevent our beginning to night   10.370729225720673
this time it was the hour and from this moment milady waited with impatience   13.492013768745437
the pupils of his eyes as he gazed at monte cristo dilated horribly   10.888965149837762
although our friends were expecting that condemnation it filled them with grief   9.688548278221791
he is said monte cristo   12.368986603805832
de morcerf so early   8.117743301083902
in a month then on your honor if i am not consoled you will let me take my life into my own hands and whatever may happen you will not call me ungrateful   11.2954332935313
and grimaud threw the dagger on the table   11.36264533229457
only this cellar has a ventilating hole   9.743475494935673
philosophy m   12.27411861694826
the cardinal listened with a smile to this vociferous manifestation of the feelings of m   10.357471163249489
good heaven said planchet what a misfortune   12.487907200376588
cried porthos like the crows you always bring bad omens   8.891710592085325
you will have the goodness to furnish me with the address of both fernand and danglars in order that i may execute edmond s last wishes   12.32625602663435
i am he   7.50915744721404
but what is the matter albert   10.812789842422386
his eye rested longer on the president and still more so on the king s attorney   15.806416521637514
believe me we are as well informed as you and our police are as good as your own   14.660814597085887
while on the other side was a black mass of trees profiled on a stormy sky invaded by large coppery clouds which created a sort of twilight amid the night   10.373682614341284
exclaimed athos smiling you have a duel in prospect   9.18024148889463
i had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a hillock and in the light of the sun its black arms bending in every direction always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle and i assure you it was never without emotion that i gazed on it for i could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the opposite extremity and all this effected by a simple act of volition on the part of the sender of the message   14.021857804011297
but i have since learned that you had that right   12.731783537919585
pray don t heed him sir   8.738719614842019
edward endured the accident with miraculous courage he did not utter a single cry but fell lifeless into my arms   14.986892891112976
then my dear mother said albert putting his hand to the bell they must be taken into the antechamber   8.57594870349632
but what do i see in the water something struggling   12.657544173446281
she turned upon him no longer like a furious woman but like a wounded panther   9.795228553813834
how strange that it should not have occurred to me before   2.482031872854913
monsieur and dear friend ah yes   8.992248213907951
the tiger whose nature teaches him to delight in shedding blood needs but the sense of smell to show him when his prey is within his reach and by following this instinct he is enabled to measure the leap necessary to permit him to spring on his victim   5.2590948040558665
oh the champs élysées   11.12189471639562
the procurator s wife uttered a groan   15.376521856328518
he s too stupid to imagine such a scheme   15.936468774372628
sir said villefort have you any enemies at least that you know   11.325399746528404
what comments must be made   15.977528340258077
to love you cry fie   10.484363817129283
i say sir you sir who are hiding yourself behind that shutter yes you sir tell me what you are laughing at and we will laugh together   15.592519390612864
you are an intelligent fellow my friend   9.465081041418074
said athos sipping a glass of sparkling wine   18.662014466904793
now i repeat beauchamp i wish to return to human and material existence and if you are still the friend you profess to be help me to discover the hand that struck the blow   9.639799714899159
madame de vernet was driven from me putange was exiled madame de chevreuse fell into disgrace and when you wished to come back as ambassador to france the king himself remember my lord the king himself opposed it   13.82061860508483
they can move their arms they can and that is much   11.828072950261923
i am not willing that a compatriot a handsome cavalier a brave youth quite fit to make his way should become the dupe of all these artifices and fall into the snare after the example of so many others who have been ruined by it   8.003389730673401
but as he could serve us in other ways i wished to inform him   14.336347133996593
and as the invitation was for september 1646 i couldn t accept it   13.575645760061661
but what changes occur   13.656643297907623
for that reason i wished to see you to speak to you to warn you against everyone but especially against him   17.494205608737992
considering the gravity of the occasion i permit you to speak my friend   8.686699850371458
this letter was read publicly in all parts of the city   10.656203442847902
my very good friend and excellent neighbor replied the count with a smile you really exaggerate my trifling exertions   12.939530826223251
my wife s brother is my brother said edmond   10.189036511230391
because the rupture or fulfilment of this engagement is connected with the person of whom we were speaking   6.5786618648707496
the fragments of the jug broke and after an hour of useless toil dantès paused with anguish on his brow   9.79378808285559
well then a good journey to you said caderousse   13.675383967378565
not to my knowledge   9.964000864316736
asked the young girl with an authoritative tone the count had never observed before and which startled him   18.701237029872587
oh he said he is mad   12.642993459759216
but i have already met m   10.008708479771897
and now i think entirely as he does   13.96261088681253
mademoiselle replied morrel with a bitter smile i am selfish you have already said so and as a selfish man i think not of what others would do in my situation but of what i intend doing myself   15.680176880737879
his hair had turned white time and sorrow had ploughed deep furrows on his brow and his look once so firm and penetrating was now irresolute and wandering as if he feared being forced to fix his attention on some particular thought or person   10.157905113568312
you receive 1 500 francs per annum for your services here more than many a brave subaltern who continually risks his life for his country obtains   12.76949111957742
i am perhaps come too soon count said he but i frankly acknowledge that i have not closed my eyes all night nor has anyone in my house   16.32631649551319
we separated as you know   12.796227054189469
d art exclaimed athos whilst the gascon covered his mouth with his hand   15.911288156422863
that i may be sure i have the right man   13.78238012142472
but felton did not give him time to draw it   13.173589333916587
said d artagnan to athos your king has thoroughly taken me and i am quite at his service   17.2948633907732
albert de morcerf said beauchamp rising in his turn i can not throw you out of window for three weeks that is to say for twenty four days to come nor have you any right to split my skull open till that time has elapsed   9.83317672918782
several persons are invited and among others m   16.387237344329073
we shall see each other again after the campaign   5.975167969065598
afterward we shall see   11.194124717974118
in the meantime they were advancing toward the square and the moment the coadjutor and the curate put their feet on the first church step the mendicant arose and proffered his brush   16.002322612341988
but i assure you mother i have a strong intention of defending my person and i never felt half so strong an inclination to live as i do now   14.556414141985902
i was within two paces of you monsieur replied the procurator s wife   10.71827909397123
no sooner said than done   14.733495870931662
suppose there were a window in this wall   12.891024218093825
but i serve the one with joy and the other against my will   12.49898866177792
posterity will find a difficulty in understanding this character which history explains only by facts and never by reason   14.877944513839367
no sir no said grimaud   11.691868279484321
i feel it monsieur and that impels me on   11.97097777439408
it will refresh you   12.469112960409202
cried aramis that accounts for the cry i heard   13.191368186608987
make use of it i pray you for your pleasure or your business   13.440060966679345
today even   6.219513973292208
write my lord he said   10.298472198545952
on our arrival we began to discharge our cargo in the night and to convey it into the town by the help of the innkeeper with whom we were connected   14.806209269405928
now sir said monte cristo addressing andrea make your confession   11.579761515823812
what were you doing on that armchair   16.424948644601898
after supper when they are perfected i will communicate my plans to you   9.00224581530903
and have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody   8.686431574886361
quite attractive by jupiter   8.20861085953212
dantès obeyed and the conjointed pieces gave the following 0245m this 25th day of april 1498 be   10.102592459000451
i had been tracked by a customs officer who had lost sight of me near the tavern   9.681797781771255
i should think so indeed almost as high as a tower   11.339560150493455
then albert launched out in praise of mademoiselle danglars voice and on his regret after what he had just heard that he had been unable to be present the previous evening   13.02356640043806
oh mother he exclaimed such a misfortune has happened   16.53174632580955
shall two members of the house be sent to yanina   12.98650351725002
but his place was well filled by the duc d elbeuf and his four sons ranged around him like a staff   10.002044313741763
morrel replied the young man a great misfortune for me especially   9.102096881369029
this state of mental anguish is however less terrible than the sufferings that precede or the punishment that possibly will follow   11.45137375945908
the abbé once more bowed as he opened the door the stranger bowed and took his leave and the carriage conveyed him straight to the house of m   11.041799681763433
i received a letter from him yesterday but i do not think the hour was mentioned   9.506826785540033
no said villefort   14.329764011175286
but you might have shown more confidence in me   14.91129769945335
de villefort was the first to give the signal of departure   6.820627042306734
from being suspected they have become suspicious   15.464989448544326
happily i am neither charged with the power of pardoning nor punishing   13.778920761057151
see how regularly i live and how easy i am here   8.579781245879646
mercédès said caderousse eagerly   9.586667981311836
by the way this is merely a simple question when this sort of people marry their sons do they give them any fortune   9.269964884457242
whereas the stranger on the contrary in spite of all his rodomontades quickly threw him on his back   10.914990712036843
you must have a ladder   13.603707503589446
that s correct said the captain   8.859728059018797
let us save them half of their journey   10.465471773800754
but tell me what do you ask   8.743770340230654
as to the horse we can easily find some excuse for its disappearance   16.791401039973486
then he advanced to the door and asked whether there were any rooms to be let   16.41828865425918
he approached the other door and taking off his hat respectfully said madame will you permit me to offer you my services   13.098812278506202
monte cristo glanced at bertuccio who became whiter than the wall against which he leaned to prevent himself from falling   7.585610427505577
they were descending the steps leading to the cavern   8.609297792661913
you are charged with having surprised state secrets   12.810177563090562
the king s musketeers and the cardinal s guards chapter vi   13.751628543231545
my lord continued felton becoming more excited as he spoke my lord beware   13.124722166303592
and what may a myth be   17.933757042962323
the first was just disappearing in the straits of bonifacio   11.431507871121847
but what can you expect from the brother of a capuchin monk brought up in the school of cardinal richelieu   12.450076555190735
but what is the matter with my hands   7.917191521191139
i will take him dead that s all   8.2850390129036
we will simply settle our hats on our heads and we will escort his eminence   8.097132243881916
he was merely a poor shepherd whose only crime consisted in furnishing us with provisions   12.359350739492088
exclaimed an old puritan soldier whose eyes flashed at the sight of the man they called the tyrant   6.470060563634557
the queen took the two hands of the young woman with a burst of emotion gazed at her as if to read her very heart and seeing nothing but sincerity in her beautiful eyes embraced her tenderly   11.12978110995577
for though the child went to school during the day his mother could not allow him to be separated from her at night   14.19001710158733
from that point the passage became much narrower and barely permitted one to creep through on hands and knees   10.995269038615003
you think that it was a good deed to kill my brother who was a bonapartist because you are a royalist   12.361261496851755
edmond said she and her eyes were wet with tears while looking at him to whom she spoke how noble it is of you how great the action you have just performed how sublime to have taken pity on a poor woman who appealed to you with every chance against her alas i am grown old with grief more than with years and can not now remind my edmond by a smile or by a look of that mercédès whom he once spent so many hours in contemplating   8.474579285705019
i heard you cry out without understanding what you said   4.145617242189034
as long as the procurator s wife could follow him with her eyes she waved her handkerchief to him leaning so far out of the window as to lead people to believe she wished to precipitate herself   9.365707545353839
it s my spanish wine that has got into your head is it not   13.391200817697236
and nervous tremblings which agitated her frame disappeared and she remained folded within herself like a fatigued serpent in repose   11.324341393054086
she had a son observed athos   14.436034085569071
come he said you have me in a snare gentlemen   9.990971681706014
just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be called upon to prescribe for headaches measles and the stings of wasps or any other slight affection of the epidermis   11.026424942008191
i am at your service madame replied lucien coldly   14.394634595666536
it is because he has a wife and family and ambitious desires for himself and them   11.550144599017655
the messenger is welcome   13.569625019418927
then a rattling in his throat was heard and he lay down to die   10.377994548601285
we have seen that on the first rumor which reached the salon he had gradually approached the door and crossing two or three rooms at last disappeared   13.362333534747892
cried one of the guests   11.01730996435765
my scruples do not go thus far   9.884652084842726
while announcing his departure the count fixed his eyes on morrel and remarked that the words i shall have left this country had failed to rouse him from his lethargy   10.221971267296235
it was evident that she was making unnatural efforts to subdue her anger   18.69969264345507
ah but madame does mankind ever lose anything   12.44431004428897
her carriage was that of a queen or a goddess   13.401619618277104
day gilded the tops of the houses   16.276242132137263
it is nevertheless conclusive to my mind   12.63506340297066
athos had followed him with a glance in which the deepest melancholy and pity were expressed   12.02755525648136
do you not think on reflection said he to him that you have done wrong in thus speaking of your mother in law in the presence of m   13.214910772487901
and who is the countess g   12.996134486084134
ali smiled with triumphant pride as he signified that he had indeed both chased and captured many lions   12.875959816770537
franz felt a shudder run through his veins at observing that the feeling of the duke and the countess was so much in unison with his own personal disquietude   15.995533754740395
are you not his confessor   8.730513867386158
you have this evening carried off and conveyed hither the viscount albert de morcerf   14.597798632473385
from pontoise another express was sent to the next stage and in six hours all the horses stationed on the road were ready   13.984929153192159
his smile is so sweet when he addresses me that i forget it ever can be bitter to others   11.933589326995008
my faith said d artagnan it appears that i was more drunk than you since i remember nothing of the kind   14.154693187644158
nor i said aramis   15.625051370352445
and from that date up to the present day a hundred times perhaps   14.255835491444369
said d artagnan you are insupportable   8.991620816543534
laporte could not leave the louvre   16.36291599760296
woman is fickle   11.868088465838325
besides the wheels of a carriage which appeared to have come from paris had made a deep impression in the soft earth which did not extend beyond the pavilion but turned again toward paris   14.54479625156474
resumed the procurator s wife with a sigh   13.428601180246332
yes look at yourself in that glass   11.54582022613444
hello grimaud   7.191579089794154
very good said d artagnan   14.601762393419731
they are indiscreet   12.793648117875001
they rode on for an hour till the horses were covered with foam and dust   13.99701783416976
come shall we take our luncheon and then pay a last visit to st   17.668122308813615
he remembered in what a strange manner this woman had hitherto been mixed up in his destiny   10.381996569312486
he is a bully and so am i   9.077422987335662
cried d artagnan i see black points and red points moving yonder   12.561222363795714
can they have received any news my lord   16.403025485073336
faith you are indeed right not to return to it   13.09036547216358
they all cried out straw   13.723933180186634
he knocked and the door was opened   9.318864665563162
then you suffer a great deal   12.338155505880138
franz perceived how completely he was in his element   11.015225133363376
the door opened and a dim light reached dantès eyes through the coarse sack that covered him   11.510192229087055
for i swear to you that you are as safe here as you were twenty years ago you athos in the rue ferou and you aramis in the rue de vaugirard   6.902439434653983
monsieur said morrel whose uneasiness was increased by this examination you wish to speak to me   13.771305532999028
but i repeat i am made up of contradictions   18.25903492457091
the dining room was scarcely less striking than the room he had just left   12.734355042010419
i think albert you have adopted the system of feeding me on smoke this morning   13.878582986629413
she will remain at home read novels and speculate at cards since she can no longer do so on the bourse   11.366450094324966
you want me to throw again do you not   17.934439116792575
and this elixir where is it   9.290004418960802
i then resolved to go up to him at all risks   9.056517779870536
i go before you to a kingdom which knows no storms   7.641894763474825
do you think it is worth while   13.530973638128037
i have known him for ten years the last four of which he was in my service   8.819435621896666
fly   7.078608212355911
the sergeant began to laugh   10.462002800476107
although this man was scarcely thirty six or thirty seven years of age hair mustaches and royal all began to be gray   11.775183702122009
still if people will shut themselves up said albert and can not be seen because they are bathing dining or asleep we must avail ourselves of the opportunity whenever they are to be seen   15.673066300399366
oh my dear count said albert gayly arranging his cravat and wristbands you are really most kind and i hope you will consider me as under eternal obligations to you in the first place for the carriage and in the next for this visit and he put out his hand to the count who shuddered as he gave his own but who nevertheless did give it   14.80587857026875
danglars was there also you recollect m   11.756973160594866
two ladies sleeping in one bed were awakened by the noise and fixing their eyes upon the spot whence the sound proceeded they saw a man   7.6268420076919465
neither of them spoke to him   16.07043727826179
de tréville a request which the other with an air of protection promised to transmit in due season   10.932987558320303
you have done this i hope so at least   16.892343916932777
i gave my sister who constantly defended the unfortunate boy good advice and as she confessed that she had several times missed money to a considerable amount i showed her a safe place in which to conceal our little treasure for the future   6.068332811188302
the same as ever my friend   12.661641588228797
he was told my lord will pardon me certainly speak   9.402123379344676
he turned up his cuffs neatly and rubbed the sole of his right boot on the floor but did not fail however to remark that mordaunt was looking about him in a singular manner   14.221166509974104
at the end of five hundred paces more or less they came to a rivulet which they forded   16.24845459184083
i listen to you and i wonder at you sir said the queen   16.569411308530487
franz and the count descended these and found themselves in a mortuary chamber   12.571587274313478
and you go in an hour time to eat a morsel during which i shall send for a post horse   12.779645548519639
all this was answered by an expression of d artagnan s   14.447880525139576
monsieur du vallon and i are the only two who are armed   9.763048342415718
in the place of the palais royal d artagnan saw a sergeant who was drilling six or seven hundred citizens   19.45292577245391
it would be better to take her to her carriage   7.594633162405918
asked the editor of the ministerial paper   16.85193840504997
but if you have entertained any doubt as naturally you may i feel that i am ruining myself by speaking the truth   13.579331221206688
porthos rose always ready for this kind of adventure   9.541389440843568
i am rancorous the only stigma that proves me to be a churchman   8.582406392355168
worthy fellows   15.303862460722371
athos offered the man half a pistole to accompany him but the man refused   15.123695383805003
dear friend i shall sacrifice myself and go and see anne of austria   15.109524012646075
on the staircase they met a beautiful girl of sixteen or seventeen who looked with anxiety at the stranger   13.248552192867875
it was more especially when this man was speaking in a manner half jesting half bitter that franz s ear recalled most vividly the deep sonorous yet well pitched voice that had addressed him in the grotto of monte cristo and which he heard for the second time amid the darkness and ruined grandeur of the colosseum   15.012000720674147
upon my soul everything degenerates   12.634229549835906
from the day i first saw you all my hopes of happiness have been in securing your affection   15.322480319120979
demanded the musketeer recoiling a step and with a foreign accent which proved to d artagnan that he was deceived in one of his conjectures   11.334577379535533
oh no no i declare it is not   13.489592747604934
i ve still two pistols charged   12.730460938805772
mazarin sent us to cromwell   13.544456196129556
section 1   17.62293955028435
i had a betrothed albert a lovely girl whom i adored and i was bringing to my betrothed a hundred and fifty louis painfully amassed by ceaseless toil   8.763240959118935
the article relative to morcerf   10.088882518087416
the king has spoiled him of his name and property   3.143610759744762
i accept it interposed d artagnan proudly   18.161079896618375
he will do everything wrong   12.59033365432342
finally he slept   13.230428911787694
i can not help thinking that he has brought his son to france to choose a wife   12.635457250347729
and you have them   12.043740681490988
that little stratagem may serve to keep off interlopers   8.807165523241363
i have looked around me said mordaunt and i have seen neither goat nor kid caught among the bushes of the plain   9.678430834212877
why you see edmond replied the owner who appeared more comforted at every moment we are all mortal and the old must make way for the young   13.154031123379134
and you say you will wait for me at armentières   12.101415703983395
did the people shout at all   11.671020892323313
i shall kill him i can not help it   11.502390285260672
knock said the count and announce me   13.036799584890751
tried on before the glass a narrow brimmed hat of his son s which appeared to fit him perfectly and leaving his cane in the corner where he had deposited it he took up a small bamboo switch cut the air with it once or twice and walked about with that easy swagger which was one of his principal characteristics   10.941537083255032
i took the mule and the horse for what he owed us   12.004528698220206
noirtier watched the expression of each one and preserved his dignified and commanding attitude   10.215919511052647
good the luxembourg   7.606380812881093
the true nobility laughed at him the talented repelled him and the honorable instinctively despised him   10.283855640173229
i love him devotedly   14.515749352574154
an englishman said monte cristo who grew uneasy at the attention with which julie looked at him   11.793817032173465
i can believe that it is the dignity of your rank alone which makes you cruel to me   10.556207258346994
then milady attempted to tear down the doorcase with a strength apparently above that of a woman   14.246720804413723
it was danglars   10.640754402918898
fine sport by jove   7.945313457208256
said the verger   10.702800470424894
but if you bring him back to me dead or alive you may ask all you wish   14.974616089899117
because she was in fear of being arrested   13.572077257172278
and it seemed to me that he was borne away with his two companions   14.32586663622887
the prince assigned to every one his post   12.09174229126317
that s strange   15.373283153932793
does she wish that   9.419615665361018
is mine   13.956283580387101
finally athos undertook to provide in any event the means of leaving england in case either of failure or of success   11.17402159462909
i answer   14.389053702476158
the baron took the young officer by the arm and turned his head over his shoulder so as not to lose sight of milady till he was gone out   8.692218780158054
did you witness the injury sustained by comminges   10.952468758393959
next moment d artagnan entered   13.627137441766846
madame de villefort   15.592013061034718
oh as to that i shall take care i assure you   15.232299743340604
and you monsieur d artagnan what do you want   12.751673007426131
i waited for him until this hour replied franz   6.8255664127397
he had scarcely arrived at the top when he heard a heavy splash in the water it was the general s body which the witnesses had just thrown into the river after ascertaining that he was dead   13.041653052627826
can it be with me   14.985358451698024
beware of what you are about gentlemen   16.25648509301533
i have heard talk of him   14.392160147649427
exactly opposite the other   10.370248050105145
the sudden departure of franz after being summoned by m   10.556482159076037
bertuccio had outdone himself in the taste displayed in furnishing and in the rapidity with which it was executed   10.756838139378903
argumentum omni denudatum ornamento   7.11150679062346
the sitting commences at two   10.748354661154265
shall i tell you each ornament of your toilet   16.055170045786404
i make no account of the harm mordaunt can do   6.2670351131793
ah monseigneur how dearly have i paid for that fault unhappy wretch as i am   6.048853443490824
on account of the bastile sir which is so strong and so secure   12.782490383142457
in this waiting room were five or six of the cardinal s guards who recognized d artagnan and knowing that it was he who had wounded jussac they looked upon him with a smile of singular meaning   11.013639168939145
cried the marquis   13.498714895832286
give it to me said d artagnan who when the gate was open deposited the key in his pocket reckoning upon returning by that gate   8.823859092233457
when the wind shook all the doors behind which i continually expected to see some spy concealed i trembled   9.998257067640752
you have no right for you are not my father   14.898611052906295
but i have neither my women nor my servants   11.315602198412993
he has but a handful of men with him and armies will be despatched against him   13.499883662172623
really this is too absurd said villefort   14.160604353592285
the old man who had preserved all his usual coolness made a sign to him to do so   9.203266925575887
there is one thing the queen has not signed her assent to the treaty   14.22421094977034
at this name a murmur of astonishment passed around the group of spectators of this scene   12.354864217119504
death to the guards   13.541619190555634
and if it is simply what i think that stops you i can obviate the difficulty   10.949338784658494
but when you leave him for instance   16.28386868172865
no no cried dantès   14.431771017433775
cromwell makes you an important person as ambassador   12.754544687659054
do i not hear a carriage in the courtyard   13.820011578903134
the horses impelled by fear flew towards the house   12.905656322535428
then the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it   16.49638695358924
that i had none as yet   14.62766074356167
then the bandit thrice imitated the cry of a crow   13.876296699843758
well that is scarcely the question   14.696745381042897
the host will tell you i have three or four more so that you will not inconvenience me in any way   11.343978261733236
very droll he muttered very droll indeed and he again began to carve the fowl when peppino stopped the baron s right hand with his left and held out his other hand   14.64302808030439
that is understood said d artagnan   15.589939813033842
go sir said the queen   8.562062458070269
have they allowed the headsman to escape   12.719359977975383
but added he glancing an inquiring look at ali   15.39199656624039
outside this door a spade was placed against the wall   18.200786981501025
then i consent to cut throats with you   13.539014119981656
all is ready sire said he   13.920482490057264
it was only a way of speaking   10.370860023727161
and i have come at once to see you   8.924200375096042
i know nothing certain   10.445134420411554
and he fixed his eyes upon edmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts   15.480722073945092
let us therefore strike at wickedness   10.343307034756558
but as he had not forgotten that it was in presence of this young man that m   13.015952215603434
i am not so sure of that   10.284060678927634
cried raoul feeling an unknown enthusiasm for that young general who seemed to him so worthy of his renown   8.787266679070274
villefort himself was obliged to open to them   14.145978613710335
anne de bueil murmured the wounded man   9.63398061191802
but you guess it now do you not   18.01007250823256
on the contrary said the count we know so little of each other   14.312743564926137
there is the mark of my blood made when one day i dashed my head against the wall   15.033988925040065
we ll have a supper here under your direction   12.560586358871706
take courage   12.048568838318598
the bracieux estate was a few leagues from villars cotterets   6.97650390412302
gone said morrel   11.625812054110744
the baron appears thoughtful today said monte cristo to her   9.1142649707687
trembling and awe struck caderousse hastily shut the door and returned to his guest while la carconte lighted a candle by the smouldering ashes that glimmered on the hearth   10.541131693779093
these leaders had corn in abundance and would not let them partake of it   10.563074129126258
well never mind how it is answered albert it comes to the same thing in the end   15.88038672617235
what have you done with monsieur de beaufort   10.359088822365075
it is monte cristo and his greek   8.367474400253117
la ramee knelt down and made a hole in the floor   12.409220809333934
but i knew his step i knew his voice i knew him by that imposing bearing which hell has bestowed upon his person for the curse of humanity   17.23364553855357
this caused a universal burst of laughter   14.634931690426694
and he threw away his pistol   13.769117748219685
i will keep my word   15.023585073732612
it is not of him that i am now thinking   13.131236522225432
the swiss refused by shaking his head and drew his sword   12.889581719590273
mockery muttered athos savagely   13.432287187297225
a frondeur   10.572488028483527
they are hot royalists said groslow   14.642571635205748
i will depart from the strict line of my duty to aid you in discovering the author of this accusation   14.485820301977379
how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that eat his peaches not on the same night as he had stated but the next morning the count of monte cristo went out by the barrière d enfer taking the road to orléans   12.025885913661636
at the door he paused for a moment to wipe his damp pale brow   14.111283246001843
de tréville s entrance he turned round   12.898808355821602
then said milady since you are as generous as you are loving she stopped   13.82281506678811
fortunately the storm began to subside but still the sea was disturbed   12.019321376652897
by my soul said aramis she is charming   14.637901770929108
i will go and find buckingham   9.934149233210768
surely so trifling a circumstance can not deserve a place in your remembrance   11.960681501275076
said milady who had already overcome her agitation and recovered all her presence of mind   10.852603374969082
they told ten other stories of this bandit chief each more singular than the other   12.551173122006233
there are three others do you know anything of their situation   10.923860038039301
when his patience was exhausted he called his valet   12.742776186663068
exclaimed the man with gray hair   11.661225694693895
at that moment they heard the gallop of a horse   15.970379655984365
the sand with which the alleys were covered deadened the sound of footsteps   11.138670649409034
what for me only   13.231326760160524
a french nurse who sent me away when i was five years old because no one paid her for me telling me the name of a relation of whom she had heard my mother often speak   13.015204784878682
athos on horseback without his sword and kept in sight by comminges followed the cardinal in silence   6.940873818112406
i do not know whether the wine of chios produces melancholy but certainly everything appears to me black in this house said debray   12.850899410200766
meanwhile i am the bearer of an order of arrest and although i most reluctantly perform the task assigned me it must nevertheless be fulfilled   8.368999885628243
no indeed i am not   7.818158399074953
bank notes   10.795417875301471
run and seek athos porthos and aramis   11.191516709266706
the abbé the abbé   7.730250083804053
oh said she seizing the count s hand and raising it to her lips   12.028754114885295
that s right said athos   6.182214541125941
but is this little woman then to escape his eminence   10.630508664454897
yes before witnesses   10.811627785894247
but i wonder she is not here   8.798608685533816
50239m ten minutes afterwards the baron entered his apartment and peppino stationed himself on the bench outside the door of the hotel after having whispered something in the ear of one of the descendants of marius and the gracchi whom we noticed at the beginning of the chapter who immediately ran down the road leading to the capitol at his fullest speed   9.262512541402529
what said debray laughing   11.908818156804834
ennui is the mortal enemy of prisoners   7.313398196847814
said the brigadier   15.525943660622687
many men might have been handsomer but certainly there could be none whose appearance was more significant if the expression may be used   10.344638659781669
at this moment the coadjutor was announced   10.8729208816688
we shall see the windows open and the lady enter by escalade   12.134716809454849
exclaimed villefort   12.327468673861624
and he returned to his guests while bertuccio leaning against the wall succeeded in reaching the dining room   12.55025360948315
whistled planchet   10.633593816174425
the young man was thrown from the top of the rock   14.984592052572953
if a thunderbolt had fallen at the banker s feet he could not have experienced greater terror   13.801339379931296
well this is what actually took place one evening after an orgy in reinard s apartment at the tuileries with the duc d harcourt fontrailles de rieux and others the duc d harcourt proposed that we should go and pull cloaks on the pont neuf   10.0151831612372
oh no answered the abbé   11.467379060056036
well to take his part   6.650508826189221
however as porthos had first found an idea and had thought of it earnestly afterward he was the first to act   10.536230249391963
said felton making a step toward the duke   12.94453025359455
he would no longer be alone   14.26649215784475
here are some lozenges which i have made up on purpose   14.646636437747366
and i said the marshal what am i to do   9.756843611313649
everything goes on capitally my dear monsieur bernouin but here is a man whom i must beg you to put in a safe place   11.369369530588795
shall we return to the camp   9.260853612411468
i am not forgotten   6.798435646174015
english and french the hour having come they went with their four lackeys to a spot behind the luxembourg given up to the feeding of goats   8.802661452384008
five hundred pounds   10.62327783851383
it is i who cherish no resentment   9.396562403870082
oh as for the composition of the letter there is nothing to be said   10.994533717169393
he read preserve my memory   14.461121238078325
you intend visiting il colosseo   12.504738139883766
yes replied aramis and the sloop out there making ready to sail must be that which is to take us to our destination   13.059880248927826
how much do i owe this gracious prince   19.2012880714123
come let us talk a little about my father   16.04998107490652
but when you held her in your power why did you not drown her strangle her hang her   11.63658362199624
i have not a penny about me   14.042435394249514
what are you saying doctor   8.809062906199028
but before the notary could answer villefort had drawn him aside   12.752161634813975
of the d artagnan checked himself   11.758197010084315
franz s only reply was to take a teaspoonful of the marvellous preparation about as much in quantity as his host had eaten and lift it to his mouth   9.518842896410677
said albert seeing that beauchamp hesitated   11.861435085641263
but it is a glorious day for me continued the young girl raising her ardent gaze to heaven that on which i find at last an opportunity of avenging my father   14.078277641358326
are you likely to be more humane to me than others were yesterday   11.434847907592188
not even before you philip   11.295378978287475
did you see nothing there   9.757298716132993
3 he is an atrocious villain who murdered the priest who brought him up and deserves not the smallest pity   13.28012722164877
the marriage will take place in less than three months said villefort   11.75245492564066
but the procurator would listen to nothing he would be taken to his room and was not satisfied till he was close to his chest upon the edge of which for still greater precaution he placed his feet   9.900157084716485
then turning to aramis he said it is now your turn monsieur le chevalier   10.490542671900803
but the three millions   14.999313556920482
her disorders i know them not   13.87606881366956
and the count who was assuming his masquerade costume   9.29768203416299
and the expression of the deep and tender compassion which throbbed in his heart was pictured in the moist eye with which he gazed on the young man   11.588965537885857
what the devil do you want with a member of the parliament   10.665761806828403
the telegraph chapter 61   16.278173176019976
perhaps he would say nothing but he would see   9.818860149238416
cried porthos almost choked with dust and chewing his bridle as a horse chews his bit   15.209665051300473
if that is what you meant by your observation my worthy friend you are right   10.385318416748916
my dear athos i admire you but nevertheless we were in the wrong after all   10.038289982014248
that of dying together   9.922661970223242
asked de winter turning around   7.896191611251767
but madame henrietta is a daughter of france and was entitled to the hospitality of france   10.672347638652624

do you know that his eminence has been making fresh complaints against your musketeers and that with so much emotion that this evening his eminence is indisposed   15.145642114834022
he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife into me   5.235511774196092
exclaimed villefort unable to repress an exclamation   8.143117264734277
and those two equally fine thrusts at bernajoux   12.22549560885499
who was the invisible chief   10.448136349307845
so great was the contrast between the sombre aspect of m   11.005644291677461
at this time athos came up to d artagnan   14.323163582782719
it was you who finding the balls had missed their mark sent poisoned wine with a forged letter to make your victim believe that the wine came from his friends   12.888055256726014

yes milady replied athos   8.519710815336365
you are charged with a letter of introduction addressed to me are you not   15.12346395717393
baptistin bowed   11.655899687510443
he went therefore to his appointment with athos without a second determined to be satisfied with those his adversary should choose   7.043257585017335
the name of porthos produced its effect upon the clerks who began to laugh   8.580560064371008

the duke was the grandson of henry iv   10.040390136019726
so much the worse or rather so much the better   16.912279059328576
valentine shook her head   8.697034933827215
and you hurt me devilishly i can tell you   18.917617234656635
how you will go   9.153368498332654
d artagnan went instantly in search of the inn and easily discovered it by the riotous noise which resounded from it   12.415595943135276
she fainted   13.908100930972605
that is of no consequence   14.018112285370648
blaisois a tall simple youth who understood nothing but what he was expressly told asked therefore for the abbé d herblay and in spite of bazin s assurances that his master was not at home he persisted in such a manner as to put bazin into a passion   9.383216390714713
we consider it useless to draw a physical or moral portrait of grimaud   15.671365376939512
speak out   11.0887775982875
said buckingham becoming so pale that d artagnan feared he would faint as he broke the seal   13.785267817671507
his consent would be your justification in god s sight   18.911452108573826
and with the door locked and orders given that he should not be disturbed excepting for important business he sat down in his armchair and began to ponder over the events the remembrance of which had during the last eight days filled his mind with so many gloomy thoughts and bitter recollections   7.707989957901876
they awaited while gratifying the eyes a destination unknown to their owner himself   9.939189401331143
this knife is the knife with which felton stabbed him   11.248701122141702
doubtless one of the charming females albert had detected beneath their coquettish disguise was touched by his gallantry   6.163354797438233
she asked in great distress   8.753191821626723
my leave is at an end   11.128825726779601
no said valentine you might meet someone   12.106226470990777
said the patron   10.226113591742353
you are a brave soldier one of the few remaining veterans of the days of henry iv   19.061298179923842
the master of la jeune amélie who was very desirous of retaining amongst his crew a man of edmond s value had offered to advance him funds out of his future profits which edmond had accepted   12.593866812492706
you you   14.77969641607611
if your excellencies will please to be seated said the man i will let the count know that you are here   10.822564601369711
go along this corridor down a little staircase and you are in it   8.751978966481673
oh murmured the count shall i then be permitted to love again   12.139724412354404
as for you who are young and active delay not on my account but fly go i give you back your promise   9.166212530852189
yes but i could give him the order i guitant and i preferred to give it to you   12.87396403070852
grimaud alone was calm as ever   10.862737695227992
maximilian we said we would be to each other as two voices two shadows   10.338962726241801
at that period i did not even know what time meant   10.74673976809417
all would then be easily arranged if the baroness and her daughter are willing   17.536143628439895
he was thirsty and dragged himself towards it   9.270173684811619
you are alone one alone shall answer you   16.634215381622454
look at his uniform monsieur commissary look at his uniform   16.28170595318223
if we ever escape together half this treasure is yours   14.309514295509015
at this moment grimaud came in   9.92442223412708
to form the slightest idea of his feelings one must have seen his face with its expression of enforced resignation and its tear moistened eyes raised to heaven   17.578967679186814
as soon as we are married he shall come and live with us instead of one child he shall have two   11.142950080365297
the death of buckingham was written there at full length   11.22132730392372
haydée will soon be here   8.576407990677637
i told you so athos said d artagnan shrugging his shoulders   9.978362067100104
i defy your eminence to prove it cried tréville with his gascon freedom and military frankness   8.644328843869378
now if i entreat if i order you to live morrel it is in the conviction that one day you will thank me for having preserved your life   13.921622835721035
why he imprisoned himself i swear to you he did   10.93845200858966
what did he answer   12.054780912196675
by my faith twould be excusable in him to tremble replied aramis for even i feel a shudder at the recollection   10.815052904329962
at this moment the countess perceived albert and returned his salutation with a smile   10.40805587847961
your friend albert de morcerf   13.452706714428999
noirtier brucine for his paralytic affection while the assassin is not ignorant for he has proved that brucine is a violent poison   15.263554362761333
you must nevertheless make up your mind to go and get it or i swear you shall die by my hand   15.333430346221661
then no longer able to resist he called out   12.175405274838463
i beg you to excuse me and propose to the chevalier   6.098707398226719
so serious that i come to beg you to render me a service   13.641996208643393
he uttered the most dreadful sob which ever escaped from the bosom of a father abandoned at the same time by his wife and son   13.788734420777494
the duke vouchsafed no reply but sitting down at the table made a sign that la ramee should seat himself opposite   13.735922216547419
the muskets are for us   15.243700459266098
i have still fifty pistoles   8.994651697767791
you do not understand continued the inspector   13.12798361712
by a miracle monsieur i must acknowledge with a sword thrust in my breast and by nailing the comte de wardes on the byroad to calais like a butterfly on a tapestry   9.282228943691262
had you then that sum   7.801102593387145
this affair made a great noise   15.64183710594892
he is a very strange man she said and in my opinion is himself the adelmonte he talks about   2.705987123386251
de boville retired with this exclamation after expressing acute sympathy with the father   15.698590929420456
something connected with this story   14.671821792838577
from the queen   14.360491269263068
beauchamp one of the kings of the press and therefore claiming the right of a throne everywhere was eying everybody through his monocle   7.557628453453502
noirtier cast an appealing look on valentine which look was at once so earnest and imperative that she answered immediately   12.623694313975983
i was not willing to fly   15.263555578460917
they all rushed towards him for all loved edmond in spite of his superiority   14.395256440626314
the wretch is dying and it is horrible to let a man die without extending a hand to save him   11.493979262917588
well what good wind blows you hither at this hour   15.660975293071768
when you return i will set the fuse myself but be careful to conceal your face so that you can not be recognized by them   16.806410362968066
you will then be convinced that the resources of the house of danglars however limited are still equal to meeting the largest demands   14.498437774826977
since you have no further interrogations to make leave me i beseech you she said   11.841627485457305
you are the master   13.6683831423938
murmured fernand   8.245055161799726
now said d artagnan for the actual man   13.69516870830353
oh this is very interesting said debray   12.999530113433677
they found the door ajar   10.8506107513294
said i are you pleased   11.161934171873956
beautiful   9.868002594501036
tis mordaunt   13.521978471997343
de guiche as we have said before had been educated at the court and the intrigues of this court were not unknown to him   8.886889725033669
if an angel appeared to that young man as an accuser of milady he would take him in the mental disposition in which he now found himself for a messenger sent by the devil   13.076515120605306
julie trembled at this request which seemed to her of bad omen   10.342752252911279
for like diana of poictiers and ninon anne of austria enjoyed the privilege of remaining ever beautiful   9.100742359787274
provided i understand your perfidy sir and succeed in making you understand that i will be revenged i shall be reasonable enough said albert furiously   16.71177596784667
de tréville captain of the king s musketeers he met in the antechamber three young men serving in the illustrious corps into which he was soliciting the honor of being received bearing the names of athos porthos and aramis   17.991164739182274
and this french generosity repeated by lord de winter and his friend was highly applauded except by mm   18.254645043187747
mistrust athos therefore who will not prosecute the affairs of any one even his own   11.334967507883922
they did not come   9.888744440339272
but he also was spurred on by a ferocious desire of vengeance   8.62493044904453
the lackeys were sent on before with the baggage and they set out on the morning of the sixteenth   5.840282117799868
and gabrielle d estrees as good natured as brave as proud and above all as gascon as his ancestor but less elaborately educated   11.08824076760974
i had two hundred thousand francs placed in the hands of morrel son   13.255201462175162
40026m i am prejudiced against beauchamp said albert drawing franz away and leaving the former to finish his philosophical dissertation with debray   11.440167053802524
what is the use of boring one s self with so many things   13.826303575764413
there was no end to the inextinguishable laughter at the rochellais   12.794719470771517
mademoiselle said albert replying to this direct appeal i can give you very exact information on that subject as well as on most points relative to the mysterious person of whom we are now conversing the young woman is a greek   14.796369044937595
so i summoned up all my courage and read it as firmly and as steadily as i could   10.49440912892238
after having deprived me of my liberty after having deprived me of death after having recalled me to existence my god have pity on me and do not let me die in despair   6.7265509848953595
the old man obeyed   15.485765720908873
and for that reason i did myself the honor of calling upon you in order to beg for an explanation   14.635083235296003
and ask the uncle whether i was wrong to rid him of his dear nephew   14.770988368090794
he fancied that these two forms were looking at the sea   7.253773534472316
certainly remarked porthos   13.499751585969225
she had her portrait painted thus six or eight years ago   11.141364509064328
valentine groaned   12.718080698542881
he must be a prophet then said valentine smiling   11.346514651093965
you are only the victim of perfidious plots   5.335997067064142
it was not fatigue that stayed andrea here   8.787242688138035
that is to say she was there replied milady   13.951385116327783
the next day just as debray was signing the deed that is about five o clock in the afternoon madame de morcerf after having affectionately embraced her son entered the coupé of the diligence which closed upon her   10.661751292222936
chapter 39   9.928939861289521
no you sounded me nothing more   8.098760935812827
it is war said the prince   10.289878355588778
have you any weight on the chest   9.774957913729832
in the cellar   8.626514819460423
well let us see what is to be derived from this gloss   14.753329832904889
grimaud my friend said the viscount will you leave me thus in such anxiety   14.488793553131945
you will not abandon me   14.397690251883013
tell your mistress he at length answered that i wish to speak to her and i beg she will wait for me in her own room   10.368002726430646
it is only used for political prisoners   16.34215170037622
they therefore began operations as soon as the telegraphic despatch arrived and the bell and bottle being the best known hotel in the town they had naturally directed their first inquiries there   7.831595255850536
but as m   14.338060226370672
rejoined caderousse quickly   14.81558014641212
to me   14.353263782693006
the king was winning   13.207619559988606
i speak to you in french said d artagnan   10.751987017552633
ah what a misfortune   11.724417680059188
he had but one fault he was a gourmand   12.619522451397579
after breakfast the abbess came to pay her a visit   9.732214072573285
adieu brother   7.66714674023418
i know it and i have nothing more to say   12.146923054030545
you of those whom you love and i of those whom i love   15.307709731255652
no said she you will avenge me   10.097485063352497
d artagnan remained therefore alone   16.802671326256586
repeated the astonished caderousse   10.009822623500764
oh cried she without losing any of her cheerfulness this is singular   12.244277580105061
and perhaps become even less than he is   12.777135442351263
they were the men of the beggar of saint eustache   13.324669986568285
and the only difference was that instead of entering by the doors people entered by the windows   10.398863426613758
but this last circumstance was not striking as the queen since her marriage had slept badly and wept much   12.681378261537459
i did not say that the owner was a smuggler replied the sailor   10.573069206073543
at the moment he was about to go out lord de winter appeared in the corridor followed by the soldier who had been sent to inform him of the swoon of milady   8.89761498421347
it is only the dead who do not return   11.528819597477348
devil take it my lord   14.783385166617315
and at the first sound of the leader s bow across his violin franz observed the sleeper slowly arise and approach the greek girl who turned around to say a few words to him and then leaning forward again on the railing of her box she became as absorbed as before in what was going on   10.87070253373033
oh it is impossible said he i must be dreaming   10.791518141036148
but that they give me no uneasiness since at the first step he takes i will ruin the queen   8.23060898486921
if when you have seen me again you still persist well then you shall be free and i myself will give you the weapon you desire   13.003583744070015
this was because his love so strange so new and so ardent made him view the infamous and imaginary accusations of milady de winter as through a magnifying glass one views as frightful monsters atoms in reality imperceptible by the side of an ant   11.19204119073177
muttered mazarin i do believe he is going off with the diamond   10.696636492091496
he saw in fancy the burial of his father and the marriage of mercédès   17.940453830876713
i have my pride for men serpents always ready to threaten everyone who would pass without crushing them under foot   8.678962558253088
it was indeed the same color as the draught she had poured into the glass and which valentine had drunk   18.323732900488736
they must set out the next morning at daybreak and go to armentières each by a different route   11.891733454728588
still further monsieur de tréville gains ten thousand crowns a year   15.738422917393951
on the azure dome of heaven still glittered a few remaining stars   13.756309617529467
bartholomew they sometimes came to seek refuge   10.122115163702741
why should you not be there   12.41777223821646
willingly monseigneur said the executioner   13.780551950374456
now as they had already traveled eleven leagues d artagnan thought it time to stop whether porthos were or were not in the inn   14.280335126721818
no no dear friend   12.57354317712764
he was intently watching for a shadow to appear among the trees and awaiting with anxiety the sound of a light step on the gravel walk   14.368425457631352
this time maximilian was the first to arrive   14.445389840793734
you would have been summoned to the gate   13.785871970085768
no replied morcerf my father is most anxious about it   12.67080915821445
armentières read porthos   13.893347479577468
now i am going to show you how sincere i am   9.613465931015622
nothing said milady smiling with that painful expression which she knew so well how to give to her smile   13.862449059065863
as to my health since it has stood five years of prison with monsieur de chavigny to boot tis excellent   12.441316770275574
yes said groslow bursting with his usual coarse laugh i know you frenchmen want nothing but cuts and bruises   8.591647411097046
but on the contrary to his great surprise it grew darker and darker   9.429607469465033
but first tell me were you going out or just returned   14.515627071019452
and i would hold out before an army if we had taken the precaution to bring a dozen more bottles of wine   10.811313590801507
she comes from india also   15.923527626839645
the work of revolt continued the whole night thus   11.619635356962982
to be sure there would only be a swiss the less in the world   11.363916625760789
chapter 110   7.160030780795693
the departure for belgium chapter 98   14.889507890041724
cease then to allow yourself to be duped by vain hopes that even your own excellent heart refuses to believe in   14.012116221999378
anne of austria was then twenty six or twenty seven years of age   12.887628646311347
and i also i was also wretchedly off he answered moving backward and forward as he spoke   14.591771183143695
what are we to say to this   13.729782649189378
d artagnan sprang up with a bound and at the same instant the ball from the other musket tore up the gravel on the very spot on the road where he had thrown himself with his face to the ground   7.823732506421233
there were four musketeers on the bottom steps amusing themselves with the following exercise while ten or twelve of their comrades waited upon the landing place to take their turn in the sport   9.47431443795777
how madame   11.059711063859146
the officer took from the table the papers pointed out gave them to him who asked for them bowed to the ground and retired   6.973460167484017
danglars seeing his daughter smiling and proud even to insolence could not entirely repress his brutal feelings but they betrayed themselves only by an exclamation   10.713325694997664
porthos and aramis trembled with rage   12.72685111110436
dost know where porthos is   10.117369901595174
not to me i hope   11.537163820779705
permit me said the notary turning first to villefort and then to valentine permit me to state that the case in question is just one of those in which a public officer like myself can not proceed to act without thereby incurring a dangerous responsibility   11.454456509055715
and while we are still gaping with wonder at the news you come and tell us today let us say no more about it   14.338656662600375
à propos of the cardinal monsieur de tréville i am vexed with you   13.405709401407293
there are the acts signed   12.104997905826094
now i can not for one instant believe you so devoid of gallantry as to refuse a lady your escort when she even condescends to ask you for it   11.931067983402798
you were sent by some other person   10.596411206123346
opposite the scaffold   11.51312346824379
for a mind so perspicuous as that of d artagnan this indulgence was a light by which he caught a glimpse of a better future   8.452225460234766
the banker was enthusiastic in his applause   19.00514019635402
and as m   13.785395334003557
and you were wrong madame   10.845930765286033
because i did them all the harm i could and they returned it to the best of their ability   10.988158121403055
what the devil my dear do you think you can wear a star from heaven on your finger and nobody observe it   11.659148699405385
what is yonder   13.52786413040624
repeated mousqueton   10.07562164403356
you wish me to get out at that window   8.445866959562847
but we must say farewell edmond and let us part   11.508035628908507
oh no it has not   14.079412236390048
i really don t know what hotel it is   14.669911287520359
possibly this one who asks nothing or seems to ask nothing has asked more in the eyes of heaven than those who tax the country and steal the bread of the poor   5.586332083640718
at daybreak he awoke and took a turn around his room   14.55350294855047
the captive who was the source of so much alarm to the cardinal and whose means of escape disturbed the repose of the whole court was wholly unconscious of the terror he caused at the palais royal   10.222295712590707
pray reflect a little   12.360794639810255
and besides as matters were it was much more to his advantage that the prefect of police should triumph over him than that he should humiliate the prefect   15.945256391869588
at the end of his speech the king looked tenderly around upon the people   13.926707081729658
he looked around   8.849849931030933
he would be in despair if that should come to the ears of the king   8.57339443457522
you are right athos said aramis   12.270576104227281
but i heard that a marriage between the prince of wales and mademoiselle d orleans was spoken of said de winter   9.008564673037036
ask of me as mayor what is my opinion of m   16.334775401857897
d artagnan did not love his son who was his only offspring but m   14.570187363321411
de morcerf opened the door himself and as the carriage rolled away he passed up the walk rang and entered the open door with his servant   11.803354537512519
he offered a seat in his landau to madame danglars that she might be under the care of his wife   14.063136681586872
my mistress sir   14.659300333119361
de flamarens and de chatillon continued on their way and athos and aramis dismounted   16.94377691504582
he was in a most elegant hunting costume   8.745571179432462
he possesses a noble heart madame replied the count and he has acted rightly   10.83217084024011
answer or we charge   9.342795883794839
so cried milady as if she could not resist giving utterance to a holy indignation you a pious man you who are called a just man you ask but one thing and that is that you may not be inculpated annoyed by my death   9.440989527314104
and he set off to follow the two friends   12.298538748164377
when her hands were loosed he took some sea water and sprinkled it over her face   10.207568254700544
agreed returned albert   16.265389870509345
has the sun done anything for me   10.801915765712732
of danglars   11.058927377123972
then bending double for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the window so as to be able to command a perfect view from top to bottom   11.608904400652333
it must be so my son said anne of austria   11.773907562489118
athos jumped and disappeared on the other side of the wall   10.752592866957604
i am coming mademoiselle replied he   18.388120363057666
if i had but the time to train pupils   14.389611953678436
his voice yet echoed in the archway when a handsome graceful and half naked young man appeared bearing a fowl in a silver dish on his head without the assistance of his hands   6.146822542263212
gentlemen said château renaud it is not morcerf coming in that carriage   8.42065526543513
my brother is only your second husband   9.957780348376362
she entered by one door at the time when mercédès appeared at the door   13.21433578511935
he was already enjoying the sweet dream engendered by the possession of two hundred and nineteen louis made in a quarter of an hour when a voice was heard at the door of the hall which made him stir   13.006945438301445
for the comte de la fère it is too little   15.725706764884494
on his part the king returned to his apartment   12.135470330122764
the englishmen bowed and went upstairs   12.615041687831827
and the man held the torch to the wall   9.36616298905409
i certainly am surprised replied m   14.059139521953389
i went to tortoni s where as i expected i found beauchamp and château renaud   13.263477552903328
she was a nun in the convent of the benedictines of templemar   9.97669527721827
from that time i looked upon this fortune as something confided to me for a particular purpose   10.616643989264212
shortly a human form appeared in the shade of the corridor and the young lieutenant with whom we are already acquainted stopped at the threshold to receive the orders of the baron   10.211876040711193
and he measured ten double handfuls of pearls diamonds and other gems many of which mounted by the most famous workmen were valuable beyond their intrinsic worth   6.512086077184392
said porthos opening his eyes in astonishment   14.899119013609742
at the end of three quarters of a league within fifty paces of festubert a larger bloodstain appeared   14.742563454639736
buckingham conducted the goldsmith to the chamber destined for him and which at the end of half an hour was transformed into a workshop   12.126975476600142
i will go away   11.306639976898557
maximilian morrel captain of spahis   7.1761218296254
you are abused sir   13.942849018280468
and i will save them all   6.921630282285412
the curtains were half drawn and only admitted the mysterious light calculated for beatific reveries   10.759616332877464
the captain pointed towards the island up the side of which ascended a volume of smoke increasing as it rose   17.284770825294395
said he addressing d artagnan don t you remember that face which is blinking yonder   10.729301320699816
dantès waited expecting a question but in vain   12.552367052770279
d avrigny in the same pitiless tone m   13.964675020720142
besides they are to come to paris in about a month and valentine after the affront she has received need not consider it necessary to continue to bury herself alive by being shut up with m   5.534334837752677
monsieur bonacieux chapter xiv   8.169218750183063
and can his majesty count upon many such subjects as yourself for his flight   8.669144087646142
de tréville s stables one for himself d artagnan and one for planchet and bring them to athos s place   12.542484949772211
two   11.705253411437912
the host drew back and burst into tears   11.210497512797032
sir replied m   2.2443032167909376
villefort therefore gained nothing save the king s gratitude which was rather likely to injure him at the present time and the cross of the legion of honor which he had the prudence not to wear although m   7.721546499981999
so that our hostelry is daily going to ruin   13.656098916329759
and pray what may it be   9.68481750876873
what do such as we desire but a good wife and careful housekeeper and where can i look for these better than in you   12.882473087053718
i will do everything in my power to carry out your wishes your excellency   8.564067243824313
they all alighted and hastened to pay their respects to the king and queen in their coach   14.459230315002923
bravi   4.668406764987642
a superhuman joy expanded the old man s eyes which were raised towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude   14.046833822788042
franz was fascinated by the horrible spectacle   8.204130370052557
martin the same at which they had stopped on their first journey   13.090068988594027
come back sirs back   8.96086247366237
noirtier looked the permission which she solicited   16.941522971388167
coquenard entered pushed along upon his armchair with casters by mme   9.691180920303175
she is amiable and well behaved   13.351443039027695
what do you wish me to do   11.747649027954319
exclaimed the young girl enthusiastically   6.956596353795103
but this counsel effectually decided mademoiselle danglars never to commit herself by being seen in public with one destined for a theatrical life   13.646882629882272
because they failed   11.527593222771655
let us see said athos   11.810060875181604
but rochefort who had passed five years in prison had become old in the lapse of a few years   10.339515120830292
it seems to me said emmanuel that i see two young men down there who are evidently waiting   11.68778396874519
pardon me excellency said peppino placing his hand on the banker s shoulder   11.234805656618358
by the streets   14.422126051692839
and i own that if you have no stronger proof to give me i have another replied maximilian   12.556570693825751
and in that strange manner they approached the louvre   13.335934100726881
penelon had it would seem made good use of his money for he was newly clad   10.268656217441816
the officer went off with an eagerness that showed the gascon that he had some personal interest in the matter   13.750435782366312
with a blind valor a quick eye and a prompt hand   9.630776525791065
it was useless   17.683379595299613
and in half an hour said maximilian in a gloomy voice our name is dishonored   12.742031989860719
a violent blow from the butt end of the musket burst open the lock two more forced out the bolts and the broken door fell in   15.819724853914263
well then we will put simply my lord do you remember a certain little enclosure where your life was spared   9.969121493237065
i go far from men who thus so bitterly injure each other   13.137956791672497
each word that fell from his companion s lips seemed fraught with the mysteries of science as worthy of digging out as the gold and diamonds in the mines of guzerat and golconda which he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his earliest youth   6.633599439867606
and as he had already perceived that these men were musketeers he did not doubt that the three others were those called the inseparables   10.59797270807265
d artagnan was chewing the stalk of a flower unable to reply and thoroughly uncomfortable   9.029315893933624
it may be judged whether d artagnan looked or listened with avidity   8.386399543986723
we must be expeditious   12.275536309549413
hold your tongue porthos said athos   13.608676302268233
bonacieux had flattered himself in believing himself worthy of st   12.17714427325534
i faith yes   8.29026432899186
she then crossed the corridor and led the way down a narrow staircase to m   12.809201216446672
exclaimed cromwell   11.232164570159998
the swiss were drawn up along the road but as the road was long they were placed at six or eight feet distant from each other and one deep only   14.486922996580917
inquired the countess   11.066290756218436
not been there i would have cut off the head of that infamous being without thinking of it or even after thinking of it   14.928083102182027
when he is absent i am there   12.543055624698106
athos as a diplomatist   16.881575807902887
i left him five days ago said d artagnan and he portrayed with gascon wit and sprightliness the magnificence of porthos in his chateau of pierrefonds   10.35072907600625
what could i do   7.41682474485729
what must the mistrustful restless suspicious cardinal think of her silence the cardinal not merely her only support her only prop her only protector at present but still further the principal instrument of her future fortune and vengeance   10.361631983088335
dantès saw the light gradually disappear and fearing to be surprised in the cavern left it his gun in his hand   12.20257747166079
this is fortunate said the guide   8.037737714209534
ah he has a niece   11.19918927791276
they continued their route   14.153666525067347
the lieutenant remained standing in a dignified but respectful posture such as became a man of good birth who had in the course of his life been frequently in the society of the highest nobles   17.023324292321945
go to the assistance of madame de villefort he said to the nurse   9.288538613843809
aramis bowed rather with respect than pleasure at the compliment   11.105445289167582
de villefort who sat half bowed over in his chair offering him consolation encouragement and protestations of zeal and sympathy   9.834582971619938
arrest musketeers   1.9330072653007928
nothing escapes him   8.265988958414612
stop said he i have an idea   10.460686855251408
of course naively replied the servant   12.017381031616694
sire the usurper is arming three ships he meditates some project which however mad is yet perhaps terrible   9.54539405324558
mordioux   10.090107666381302
great heavens   15.648537458498291
zaccone s youth   16.411059740985507
i doubted from the first   7.414957678064545
the door of the back staircase opened then the side gate of the garden and ali and his master were on the spot with lights   17.304342176729236
you who know his life and his crime   13.02653702238173
monsieur de chavigny handed his cane to monsieur de beaufort   8.006796453512589
0029m right dantès quite right   6.709726140916431
and don t you know where he is   8.122699749185983
i read it a little while since   13.161016263205429
i am a prisoner then   13.621998257536166
napoleon certainly he knew something of inasmuch as he had seen and spoken with him   10.323034641052054
cried bertuccio   10.447734736610897
yes that is true as the gospel said porthos   10.352198079017715
does he think we are going to take him in   12.242191496667761
now i have been buried alive or very nearly so   7.571694561719923
but you have the first claim m   16.359445113502762
are you not the beloved of one of my best friends   7.166873078799309
but he heard nothing   13.63588645337762
your eminence is too good to remember such trifles in my favor   2.952890773655506
should that diamond ever fall into my hands again he reflected i would turn it at once into money   12.825106519063041
the bell rang at this moment for the rising of the curtain   18.02751716316018
this time a small troop advanced consisting of from twenty to twenty five men   17.73047741815382
d artagnan pressed nothing but a corpse in his arms   12.234948299697907
but you madame prudent as you are think if you were to be arrested with that handkerchief and that handkerchief were to be seized would you not be compromised   13.6118977679451
very often the bandits are hard pressed by gendarmes or carbineers   9.487015478307713
sometimes in the midst of dinner when everyone under the attraction of wine and in the warmth of conversation believed they had two or three hours longer to enjoy themselves at table aramis looked at his watch arose with a bland smile and took leave of the company to go as he said to consult a casuist with whom he had an appointment   15.932002128422594
answer it   14.229709163883253
said athos we are overheard   10.228973697695926
should we by being arrested be all four together again we should not i am not sure be twenty four hours in prison without getting free   15.551959475608975
one of them alone arrived at the port having either killed or wounded those who wished to stop him   12.679424824478525
i really do not think after all it is anything of consequence   7.738426997206549
bonacieux with some embarrassment the cause of this event   14.771766384340156
but as she saw him advance with even step and composed countenance she endeavored to repress her emotion   11.936801608172667
edmond uttered a cry of agony and quite out of his senses rushed towards the door exclaiming help help   9.38312936323262
my brother had arrived the previous evening at nîmes and at the very door of the house where he was about to demand hospitality he had been assassinated   10.19560127963419
porthos was in bed and was playing a game at lansquenet with mousqueton to keep his hand in   15.044934378827346
ay ay   13.471265308381408
and when i told you i had foreseen the result it is the honor of your visit i alluded to   9.670514164068592
the servant who had travelled at the back of the carriage waited on him   13.22165858352548
he had ordered his three musketeers and their companion to be with him at half past six in the morning   13.113116322790274
you will find in the same way four relays on your route   11.216123779146283
i should not have guessed it   14.579463842500864
and the one received his commission the other his patent of nobility   9.563761950025462
she crushed the paper in her hand and turning with flashing eyes upon kitty she cried what is this letter   9.093906791081626
of fighting man to man without discomfiture against the comte de la fere and the chevalier d herblay and of surrendering only to fifty men   6.453368768036554
cried haydée   13.13050260660533
bonacieux dead and to d artagnan whom porthos and aramis were trying to recall to life   10.567647250846905
after a moment of dumb contemplation during which his face became pale and his hair seemed to stand on end he sprang towards the door crying out doctor doctor   11.396907267453493
they had not looked carefully enough for their lost friends   14.983075378587767
mercédès uttered a cry which made the tears start from monte cristo s eyes   16.838609490495656
carmela was attired like a woman of sonnino   13.109542967914985
alas stammered villefort i do not lose a single word   12.997445076455024
the conduct of the son in seeking to avenge his father was so natural that château renaud did not seek to dissuade him and was content with renewing his assurances of devotion   16.632270487480223
de villefort so as to prevent his listening to what you said   11.895471311500987
connected by marriage you mean said franz laughingly   12.113037275205457
you heard m   12.228535311775893
groslow is on guard there this evening and to pass the time away he has invited us to keep him company   12.257684638539398
porthos went before her and instead of a finger dipped his whole hand in   13.860313663572981
until now it had been undecided whether the supper should take place in the dining room or under a long tent erected on the lawn but the beautiful blue sky studded with stars had settled the question in favor of the lawn   7.659561463249864
it bore no signature but it announced to the general that someone would call for him if he would be ready at nine o clock   18.554457059831062
well now listen   7.330459990263778
what do you think of it all   9.628086068681032
you were walking one day behind the chartreux when it would have been better if you had been elsewhere   12.113848360919674
caderousse raised his clenched hands towards heaven   14.119812953377354
said the gascon proud to display so rich a gift in the eyes of his friends   13.302959549138711
and when they hunt for him there he reappears suddenly at albano tivoli or la riccia   12.621145347219423
cried d artagnan in a loud voice   10.631724453133096
but not being able to stifle her she smiled upon her   13.551924675338775
this is something new replied the king   17.595241847480814
he was a merchant monsieur and had succeeded to the business of my poor father   8.532074554816592
you are a woman of precaution i see my dear madame coquenard said porthos squeezing the hand of the procurator s wife tenderly   10.770947878470821
is he a shepherd or a nobleman   15.972909925246174
your comrade   8.442321972669555
at four o clock in the morning they heard a terrible riot in the stables   15.977889786602244
but it s of no importance continued d artagnan with natural assurance   9.704056905641183
i made inquiries and found that the house in the champs élysées is his own property and certainly it was very decently kept up   11.279037327763414
we can dispose of the business if we please in an hour for i have received a letter from m   15.11619086051762
said athos and he threw two pistoles majestically on the table   9.408443098965517
it was midnight   14.451026286246396
now listen to me maximilian   16.096378321866766
think of my mother   17.17090941990556
i see that plainly enough my most excellent host and you may rely upon me to proclaim so striking a proof of your attention to your guests wherever i go   10.577598570309304
well baron what is there difficult to understand about that   15.828075817110147
the happiest thing that could occur to me would be to die in my father s stead   16.041242131438626
he had hastened to milady s chamber had found it empty the window open and the bars filed had remembered the verbal caution d artagnan had transmitted to him by his messenger had trembled for the duke and running to the stable without taking time to have a horse saddled had jumped upon the first he found had galloped off like the wind had alighted below in the courtyard had ascended the stairs precipitately and on the top step as we have said had encountered felton   8.716923648442057
i have but one man on board and i am as sure of him as i am of myself   8.00744603759952
this time you will lay your plans more accurately   16.6917941536251
go on go on my dear fellow   6.931199265162675
and i wrote and will show you my correspondence if you like   13.785560307766342
my good fellow you ll find the word in saint simon   14.482933971463295
no it had just struck four   8.731147349940981
where are we to go   12.490865673222865
the burglary chapter 83   12.688847225705333
i wish in order to honor our worthy aldermen you should appear in ceremonial costume and above all ornamented with the diamond studs which i gave you on your birthday   7.075277311455094
and i hope that this time he whom he ought to chastise will not escape him as before   11.247083766981406
making no reply grimaud opened the poor man s jacket to feel if the heart beat whilst the host approached in his turn   12.520050958924488
the meetings were always held from that time till midnight   12.508557928017598
god will respect his profession and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a priest   10.782130995857598
kitty had been accused of negligence and severely scolded   11.06911692740146
take this peach then she said   15.143465470602202
i will find him as i told you   12.145929068075977
the french government without protecting them openly as you know gave countenance to volunteer assistance   10.47374236695273
my lord replied la ramee i think if it depended on the cardinal your wishes would be fulfilled   15.028407764788689
then they returned to the rospoli palace   9.370384706043936
it is a long rectangle divided by two upright gratings placed at a distance of three feet from one another to prevent a visitor from shaking hands with or passing anything to the prisoners   13.49034173530567
allow me allow me sir said d artagnan to observe you are in error   14.196593554886462
they wished only to be allowed to fall on their knees before their sovereign and that they might move her to compassion   16.91915039545971
i don t doubt it   8.559402464243128
the lieutenant s entrance produced a burst of laughter in the great drawing room   6.76801209908826
cried athos suddenly where have you brought us   12.273046558701928
four conveyed him away i don t know where to the bastille or fort l evêque   8.565927622050602
with a calm smile and a gentle wave of the hand monte cristo signed to the distracted mother to lay aside her apprehensions   12.512953619150915
said bonacieux slapping a plump round bag which returned of sound a money   16.076446426161095
athos shrunk into his corner pale and motionless as a bas relief   12.634689813011418
was i not nearly your husband   13.921593738010321
very well cardinal very well   10.301001971258579
so that when the illustrious companion of the great henry died the only inheritance he was able to leave his son was his sword and his motto   16.690462820434533
de morcerf on account of loving another   7.293624783283413
he thought himself strong enough for he mistook fever for energy   9.493738618637265
this is the gentleman i am going to fight with said athos pointing to d artagnan with his hand and saluting him with the same gesture   9.974385949988301
grimaud sprang toward an open window which looked into the courtyard   10.436345122661312
as long as he remained in the boat which conveyed him to land he kept his face toward milady who standing on the deck followed him with her eyes   9.677336568161454
but the women will ruin you   12.282595800109789
shall we go forward   13.432372147051392
then you will love me   9.80944877910824
he placed it on the ground passed his hand over his brow and remounted the stairs alleging to himself as an excuse a desire to be assured that no one was watching him but in reality because he felt that he was about to faint   11.83493098703819
franz had by degrees become accustomed to the count s pallor which had so forcibly struck him at their first meeting   12.767616395654976
yes and france is about to pay for her king s refusal with a war   13.740146899894913
i will be a sailor   10.45613220035442
grimaud had now finished his accounts   7.613053867611779
now do you want a horse or will you go afoot   18.761540431456712
now said the count what will you take a glass of sherry port or alicante   13.29522271791457
i shall soon return   17.97642614879374
it ought to do so at least   7.487219299764337
i have hired a cedar wherry as light as a canoe as easy on the wing as any swallow   14.31892177856562
he seized a rope which dantès flung to him and with an activity that would have done credit to a sailor climbed up the side of the ship while the young man going to his task left the conversation to danglars who now came towards the owner   5.72315646309692
propositions have been made to me and i confess to you frankly that the coadjutor has made me speak out   12.871182470922633
why should we not imagine this the apartment of an honest mother   9.954571170102364
it is the rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain the languages you have implanted in my memory and which have taken root there with all their philological ramifications   7.696739006780554
as we were sure of finding him there we left him alone   12.103386817281036
i can well believe it replied d artagnan and that was why i got three crowns for him   15.051280048974913
certainly not if as you said just now you have the means of having dantès arrested   9.38738252939211
he no doubt feared that by this opening she might still by some diabolical means corrupt her guards   14.09254111810377
he said pointing to the bodies of his wife and child see are you well avenged   17.12538341097924
four persons have been assassinated in the rue st   6.842260117826321
madame bonacieux found again   9.453695333074755
and though he s but a boy yet since your soul lives again in him dear athos i shall always fancy that you are near me sustaining and encouraging me   6.543102948026853
cried julie whose eyes sparkled with joy   8.192143647718378
then not a word but set to work   8.87643679691092
said the latter with apparent coolness but with deep emotion have you another invalid   15.59524917047936
d artagnan with a sudden accession of wrath seized the lad by the ear and led him apart with the injunction stay you where you are and don t you stir or i will pull this ear off   12.477376856361458
it is i said athos and what is the name of the person   10.244330903340481
at noon they rode into the avenue of pierrefonds   13.60756200364379
the procureur felt more at ease although he had learned nothing really satisfactory and for the first time since the dinner party at auteuil he slept soundly   15.222966823298304
a murmur of approbation ran through the assembly   10.956448991425153
to brussels if you like   10.484160838587872
but what makes you sigh   11.597585095984547
charles without replying a single word turned his head in another direction and pulled his felt hat over it   13.87004667833567
do you know said franz i have a very great inclination to judge for myself of the truth or exaggeration of your eulogies   12.7788619127983
danglars said monte cristo   11.045583276347688
have you ever seen the tuileries   10.990263493457118
monsieur said m   8.323797500572677
pardon me my friend   12.958137501671468
you have saved my life once save me again   13.96306119645647
oh if such a thought could present itself i would stab myself to punish my heart for having for one instant harbored it   15.602971576579387
d artagnan and planchet took each a post horse and a postillion rode before them   12.165877514357199
for if i mistake not you came to paris with the ambitious idea of making your fortune   13.712193290229472
morrel he has stayed behind sick at palma   16.841823827068144
then no misfortune has happened to you   13.496131433586466
but in the movement made by the man in stooping a portion of his face was uncovered and d artagnan recognized the coadjutor   9.082256845353454
my dear friend said lucien with an air of sovereign contempt do i ever read the papers   11.713842606996337
ah wooi a vager   4.894695588453024
besides here is a piquant fricandeau and a fillet of beef   11.579856787122349
i am in the power of men upon whom i can have no more influence than upon statues of bronze or granite   13.530042018069931
grimaud then took from the pocket of the officer all the keys it contained and first opened the door of the room in which they were then shut it and double locked it and both he and the duke proceeded rapidly down the gallery which led to the little inclosure   17.92609710105809
will your eminence deign to open the door which leads to the count s room and in ten minutes all will be settled   9.66782198172425
continue to seek for this man sir said the king to the minister of police   12.365283245361342
it is nothing and has already passed away   12.74015712755895
explain to me   14.097142008908875
she exclaimed as he entered   11.805277580656812
no returned she but i feel some emotion on seeing for the first time the man without whose intervention we should have been in tears and desolation   12.657103069317085
people might employ themselves in a family affair before all the world   8.552003613639418
you have no doubt some order from the cardinal about you   13.663740299891408
scarron was heated the cold seized on him and when he reached the farther bank he found himself crippled   13.950712148897683
do you not think that they have sent for you both for the same thing   11.1010765796178
bon jour messieurs   15.585526047915703
the past and the future   13.563844665249547
one day we received a letter   19.816394998268258
she is sure of it   8.434747120655834
30269m the chest no longer there   9.335749819180503
of whom i have spoken to you madame   15.047289400131195
but aramis bent his head the instant he saw the duke s finger press the trigger and the ball passed without touching him   7.466365440596778
when arrived there the cause of the hubbub was apparent to all   9.699272944483408
as they approached the piazza del popolo the crowd became more dense and above the heads of the multitude two objects were visible the obelisk surmounted by a cross which marks the centre of the square and in front of the obelisk at the point where the three streets del babuino del corso and di ripetta meet the two uprights of the scaffold between which glittered the curved knife of the mandaïa   9.991426328244598
i have adopted her as my daughter having no one else to love in the world   12.287620043708756
provincial diffidence that slight varnish the ephemeral flower that down of the peach had evaporated to the winds through the little orthodox counsels which the three musketeers gave their friend   10.879137256199103
now four days had elapsed and valentine still lived   16.561014912150405
and yet he had not let fall a single word indicating any previous acquaintance between them   15.895563753886671
go go   13.882592447127188
glasses were elevated in the air à l anglaise and the ladies snatching their bouquets from their fair bosoms strewed the table with their floral treasures   7.545169641277738
the rest concerns another person   13.826633190558688
in the midst of these screams they saw mordaunt upon the poop with a torch in hand   2.8033489186768943
he was no doubt engaged on board some other vessel and thus his bashfulness arose from the fact of his not having if we may so express ourselves worn mourning for the pharaon longer   7.908589942606099
try and make an effort to do so my good man   11.116099180867447
he raised him almost stifling him as he drew him through the aperture at the risk of flaying him in the passage   12.293228367803795
i mean that i shall be travelling on one of the thirty or forty roads leading out of france   13.768056253901703
alas monseigneur   17.096777400043372
and who told you to defend the king   11.691464200250271
indeed sir said he to albert if you are come to quarrel with this gentleman because i have preferred him to you i shall resign the case to the king s attorney   13.480124047653865
and who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap himself up in a blue coat embroidered with green   5.62113510719945
it was that he might form some resolution adopt some plan   16.552505937206234
yes grandpapa said valentine   9.856661417955927
the result then of six more such months as this would be to reduce the third rate house to despair   12.442734810433954
come i feel ill here and the two young men spurred on   13.886743096896282
putting the letter in her bosom she took her son s arm and with a firmer step than she even herself expected she went downstairs   9.38709005882617
happily marie and a follower of hers named kitty could disguise themselves admirably in men s clothes   10.92683404170981
maximilian hung his head and obeyed with childlike reverence   11.999040138014367
what is that again   6.002035356103599
i don t know what devil of an insect stung me and made me ambitious   7.9419678092268295
it is not of my wife i hope   10.681471020368441
but indeed i am not prejudiced beyond the power of conviction   13.54581232204397
he was beginning to ask full explanation of that breaking in on his sleep which was very annoying to him when d artagnan instead of explaining closed his mouth with his hand   13.706566041212694
my lord either with the officers of the guard with the other prisoners or with me   13.261708862236572
i have had no occasion to notice him particularly   14.721143667163302
the groom turned toward him with a look of surprise but made no reply   10.061596550456883
athos glanced at aramis   13.969743249509209
for according to the advice of aramis it was prudent to sow repasts right and left in prosperity in order to reap a few in time of need   17.141360019016517
the jailer came in the evening   12.2733186600543
but now you are happy   8.808485783153431
but by degrees she overcame the outbursts of her mad passion   16.035592481403363
then is it not resumed the duke the superintendent emery who gave his son when he was married three hundred thousand francs and a house compared to which the tuileries are a heap of ruins and the louvre a paltry building   11.816107086064076
cried the boy his eyes sparkling with joy if i can find out where bazin is going   10.62979593998068
the king s service   7.579847501336339
everyone must live   12.494592464040608
faithful friend noble heart   11.130867245797239
daughter of one of your majesty s most faithful servants   7.802187423655237
morrel i beg of you said he not to say a word to dantès on the subject   19.060349845891906
ferdinand street   8.166680185430783
the valet de chambre announced m   9.319012407781722
bonacieux mechanically yes let us be gone   10.084129549990195
grimaud was drinking his wine silently and had just placed his glass on the table to be filled a second time when a terrific scream resounded from the room occupied by the monk and the dying man   10.513649079221135
but hush here comes somebody   10.595798925781335
porthos next made an effort which shook the solid wall and by the aid of his friend s hand gained the summit   16.752114761072303
has not your excellency heard that the french chargé d affaires was robbed six months ago within five hundred paces of velletri   14.941138887419095
she opened the drawer and found a key   15.953390059878137
but it is with men that i struggle and i am but a woman to them   12.447430372058152
well then since she has left paris and you are sure of it d artagnan nothing prevents me and i am ready to follow you   12.403257223722344
then he arose and after finishing off the beer at one draught he advanced majestically to the door of the compartment where the wine was   13.232311879907407
i know not if he heard these words   9.385965308121861
and i renew my promise   9.313063039402184
twere better we should not be seen together   7.25757857434657
upon my honor i will instantly return it to you   13.368805503423266
and as every inconvenience deserves its indemnification here is in addition to the price of the studs an order for a thousand pistoles to make you forget the annoyance i cause you   11.756888555267759
athos on the other hand reflected that this recent gentleness of his friends most certainly arose from some plan formed by d artagnan   13.956837763579957
as he was perfectly acquainted with the details of gastronomy d artagnan and aramis made no objection to abandoning this important care to him   9.085427294000224
that will be the first time i have done so for sixteen days   10.878837090611848
she saw d avrigny curiously examining the glass which she felt certain of having emptied during the night   11.306180555065932
send him away and all will then be well   13.182419998163693
for your father is indeed here and is seeking you   9.109635505941503
there on turning round d artagnan perceived that the two soldiers had disappeared   12.968661015896052
though once i confess i envied him his good fortune   12.526316067557747
was there not a marriage engagement between you and mademoiselle de saint méran   14.149276554687097
have you no information as to his abiding place   12.69994779650767
ah i recognize you i recognize you   17.468877948437264
by the word of a gentleman you shall have no cause to repent of your confidence   12.962346300207443
business like persons pay very little attention to women and madame danglars crossed the hall without exciting any more attention than any other woman calling upon her lawyer   13.877993610411888
and in the interesting trial that young lady is anxious to witness the case would only be still more aggravated   12.908820626163164
also because he is not sure of always retaining his situation and wishes to provide for the future   15.959115079041707
who has told me this fine story monsieur   14.272458534739924
milady under the influence of inexpressible terror sat down without uttering a word   15.141889926100504
almost screamed the countess   5.661704260146182
yes i know that he said but give me the particulars   16.07567323369311
ah gentlemen he cried as the two friends entered you are very happy   15.447909840756289

villefort ran to her and seized her hand which convulsively clasped a crystal bottle with a golden stopper   12.556832838239863

a waiter opened the door   7.792743766407173
give us the clergy and the people of whom you can dispose and i will bring you the citizens and the parliament   5.455863650291566
it was an order the count had just given for immediately ali went noiselessly and returned bearing a black dress and a three cornered hat   11.808619502110023
his hat was a little napless his feather was a little faded his gold lace was a little tarnished his laces were a trifle frayed   8.359543490057177
the count looked up and fixed his eyes on mercédès who arose partly from her seat and extended both her hands towards him   12.881489377273827
de villefort replied by ordering the strictest inquiries to be made respecting these two persons   11.047770431223547
tomorrow morning   10.331588309884946
the young people felt a mutual esteem   13.634128675327872

she was struck no doubt with a superstitious idea   17.080467690635913
now sir you have but to say the word and i will spare you all uneasiness by presenting my letter of credit to one or other of these two firms   5.513649948477312
the count placed his hand on his brow as if to collect his thoughts   13.130112330633882
till tomorrow evening then   11.14223899208478
his hair of a chestnut color was curled slightly   13.363840509133572
can i do anything for you gentlemen   12.65120738437417
why yes replied d artagnan with embarrassment   22.224628355662773
50203m before you quit us count said julie will you permit us to express to you all that the other day madame interrupted the count taking her two hands in his all that you could say in words would never express what i read in your eyes   12.509400423114377
lieutenant felton from lord de winter said patrick   10.454829971337482
and you see he added carelessly he has given me the preference by leaving a balance of 100 000 francs   11.169683950678666
do not despair   14.871240497585035
he will be one as he says cried porthos   10.954933239222484
and i hope to prove to you that you have not served an ingrate   7.70021629742523
no not tomorrow morning if you please but immediately   11.214055063695085
everything seemed more magnificent at a second view than it had done at their first rapid survey   10.126008384302965
chapter 70   11.334525751232214
and i shall always do so replied d avrigny for it has never for one instant ceased to retain possession of my mind   15.50164831441829
the three musketeers   14.728867958841613
you are examining my den said aramis   9.208657846318893

asked louis xviii   17.3728809692166
my lord what have you done with your sister your sister who was my mother   13.80523663320361
pardon me you are right   17.69725091087569
that a spaniard by birth should have fought against the spaniards   11.453265268936768
i have 1 060 000 francs remaining he said   13.245743583969858
it seems you are right planchet   18.411451960447582
how do you ask   14.910101573530818
thus villefort passed through the mass of spectators and officers of the palais and withdrew   10.337134108658926
de chevreuse not only served the queen in her political intrigues but what tormented him still more in her amorous intrigues   11.258863528446692
but the sentinel who knew that mordaunt was one of the most confidential friends of the general thought the order did not extend to the young man   9.624028020188812
there was a study for emmanuel who never studied and a music room for julie who never played   9.31213953343946
he is gone to noisy   10.350262279003775
he was thunderstruck   11.286174543175939
two men lay prone upon the ground one bathed in blood and motionless with his face toward the earth   8.798717535944528
and as i am a gentleman i keep my word   13.118689938821694
in the middle of the stream he stopped the boat and suspending his burden over the water cried in a loud voice let the justice of god be done   11.432435030283287
that will be for another time   8.82150608832894
what did the prince do then   9.817635209844806
milady de boulogne evening of the twenty fifth   9.226067541540374

tis well resumed the king   11.480162079649602
what can they have done with him   10.58510002469291
and monsters of all shapes and kinds requiring to be overcome ere victory is ours   15.359381229188354
franz himself however saw his way more plainly in proportion as he went on towards the light which served in some manner as a guide   12.23218956985862
a mendicant   9.973471072468287
his health hurrah   11.815984773062087
what i was saying villefort was that the bonapartists had not our sincerity enthusiasm or devotion   19.168089947862104
and the latter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious and sanguinary bandit luigi vampa and his band   8.792155709752034
yes saddled and bridled   12.855959261650558
dantès said danglars bowing to the young couple   8.830119669209344
and we are four one for one   16.272491866141625
a mousetrap in the seventeenth century chapter xi   11.646650595480532
you said that porthos had received a sword cut   13.943402191626888
sometimes one and the same thing said morrel with a smile   10.228413225577087
three curates remained those of st   7.949034503463469
she was of a noble family of fiesole count   15.297308936691117
no monsieur and yet i recollect all things as clearly as if they had happened but then   18.001861310343358
is he in bed   14.045906612816754
and did you catch any of his words   14.372087571434323
what could he say   7.279866401680839
valentine said morrel with a trembling voice i had waited since half past eight and did not see you come   13.881218232601533
if there is an army on board it is not here that it is hidden   8.542901595647926
the patrol passed   9.859505321128447
we are much more likely to be killed said athos if we do not go   6.4482509076930254
the court of anne of austria was full of gayety and animation   9.488135014060042
the baroness danglars   13.60212557940337
tis true he said   7.332962818506579
cried the young girl while raoul turned pale at the idea of his being perhaps the cause of her disaster   9.087692715271153
and in my past life they might find something far more grave than the selling of smuggled cigars or barrels of brandy without a permit   14.573880422347742
and when we hesitated to publish the accusatory article he told us it should be inserted in some other paper   6.512034106644772
at this instant the sergeant who had been for his orders returned and pointing to the three gentlemen in cloaks said the passports are in order   7.2157998849725224
he spoke of love like a man who did love and was anxious to be loved in return   11.391692415502648
d artagnan looked out and at the corner of rue montmartre saw the hostess coming along hanging to the arm of an enormous swiss who tiptoed in his walk with a magnificent air which pleasantly reminded him of his old friend porthos   9.788022316316736
then you feel pretty much as you generally do after you have had the dose which i am accustomed to give you every sunday   8.696855063067206
nevertheless he bowed to the very ground in gratitude for mazarin s compliment   11.184867026349197
thanks my dear friend said madame danglars trying to smile   7.936862887346664
i thought as much said d artagnan wasting his strength in useless efforts   9.716147125831782
40306m volume five 50009m 50011m 50019m chapter 96   10.25346473841388
was it not i   13.96894048054479
upon which the stranger asked his name and learning that it was porthos and not d artagnan he assisted him to rise brought him back to the hôtel mounted his horse and disappeared   13.429847890340007
she was ignorant of the change that had taken place in him with respect to the cardinal a change which had since been strengthened by two or three visits from the comte de rochefort who had become the best friend of bonacieux and had persuaded him without much trouble that no culpable sentiments had prompted the abduction of his wife but that it was only a political precaution   15.458490079308964
what upset him completely was that the four friends seemed to have no acquaintance with one another   14.148368303572116
stammered morcerf   8.53847311529766
a great misfortune more important to me than life   10.364794367916616
at a distance albert thought it was a complete suit for he counted from the ace to the ten   10.87989591033459
andrea examined it carefully to ascertain if the letter had been opened or if any indiscreet eyes had seen its contents   13.585154830421809
my cloak said grimaud from the bottom of the hold   15.104222808965604
and if their faces were unknown to him or displeased him he replied that the abbé was not in paris an answer which satisfied most persons because the abbé was known to be a great traveller   14.737573030810331
she sighed again and leaned her charming head gracefully reclined on her hand still beautiful in form and color   16.245421569364247
it is right said athos   12.953405461495814
his son madame must be since the husband of the son s mother is   12.681792523731637
terror recalled me to myself   11.52026891239431
i believe the fellow is here on his own account for i have heard that these gentlemen born beyond the tweed are very vindictive   13.108118499070265
well if you do not go this very instant i will have you arrested by the queen s orders and i will have you placed in the bastille which you dread so much   13.675928277477313
what do you expect to get   11.313220079065252
on the contrary he felt a certain degree of lightness a faculty for absorbing the pure air and enjoying the bright sunshine more vividly than ever   9.811128320315927
but take care the same thing does not happen to you in selling the diamond you feared with the gold   19.45965434019815
the priest who had gone to bed cried out to them to come in   14.15872659757278
is she then preparing for a stroke   12.881767518212866
the host gave franz time to recover from his surprise and moreover returned look for look not even taking his eyes off him   10.385508723202294
the child stuck out his lips and turned away his head in a disdainful manner saying he s too ugly   13.1733970063864
yet perhaps if i had found you humble and penitent i might have prevented benedetto from killing you   8.903587290178532
when suddenly from captivity solitude misery i was restored to light and liberty and became the possessor of a fortune so brilliant so unbounded so unheard of that i must have been blind not to be conscious that god had endowed me with it to work out his own great designs   8.814417551834792
but they did not do so with m   11.14921024559238
i allowed it to become quite dark   9.63380226979973
they understood then from the few words which escaped from d artagnan what affair was in hand and as they thought that overtaking his man or losing sight of him d artagnan would return to his rooms they kept on their way   16.56727936427935
but in what carriage do we start   14.44236947657463
and now i think of it by heavens he may have sent the letter itself   15.022126292117958
each person s attention was occupied   14.52446264641611
in his projects of intrigue for the future and determined as he was to make his three friends the instruments of his fortune d artagnan was not sorry at getting into his grasp beforehand the invisible strings by which he reckoned upon moving them   13.67690135748099
but said athos who is the wretch that has dared to raise his hand against his king   18.649145089094375
that man had the power to crush him and yet he had not done so   14.160926601183236
where are you going marechal   14.737160480218012
well then i want you to take me up in your fine carriage and carry me back   13.979253378291407
again interposed some of the audience   16.213448102217367
which is not quite the same thing   9.57760777673997
d artagnan not less forward than they did likewise and all ran out in order to repair to their posts   13.874520324363127
said d artagnan the expression is strong   13.894545838449876
gervais and we will remain there an hour by the watch whatever the enemy may do to dislodge us   16.0595892157462
chevalier said the king when the door was closed i believe you are right and that this man only came here with evil intentions   15.835629843436283
the fleur de lis is small rosy in color and looks as if efforts had been made to efface it by the application of poultices   13.157419310439607
in june the profit amounted to 900 000   14.231319451589467
it was therefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the principal cities in italy without having excited the most trifling observation   12.437095127433093
here is a beautiful lawn   14.928888264831684
d artagnan of the king s guards company dessessart is expected at the palais cardinal this evening at eight o clock   18.330775958816854
you will have sufficient time before five o clock   15.321782745656334
we are not such devils as we appear to be   10.145520364348407
well albert this money which was formerly designed to promote the comfort and tranquillity of the woman i adored may now through strange and painful circumstances be devoted to the same purpose   9.949062729428436
i was there at a fearful moment   16.2395477717252
finally ten months and a half had gone by and no favorable change had taken place and dantès began to fancy the inspector s visit but a dream an illusion of the brain   10.951443097168553
and the giant took up these two articles and without any apparent effort produced in them the metamorphoses suggested by his companion   6.707757706966611
that was the sloop   12.615709241796866
oh i don t doubt that   12.14989369089308
the baron adored count andrea cavalcanti   10.121182359663983
in that case in the name of heaven continued he throwing him a pistole tell me what you have seen and i will pledge you the word of a gentleman that not one of your words shall escape from my heart   12.773379548190105
no doubt you come to join the princes   7.80126704423917
then turning towards the paralytic he said you possess then 900 000 francs of capital which according to the manner in which you have invested it ought to bring in an income of about 40 000 livres   16.60412467601595
yes were it only out of curiosity   9.745616309530057
and yet said athos with his habitual calmness if it be monsieur d artagnan who is concerned in this matter i do not perceive how i can take his place   15.028995180889936
a secret voice seems to whisper to me that there must be something more than chance in this unexpected reciprocity of friendship   11.957397177357636
as for himself he dismounted and remained under a beautiful group of chestnuts in flower amidst which were murmuring a multitude of happy bees and bade olivain send the host to him with writing paper and ink to be placed on a table which he found there conveniently ready   11.717191485154894
there is someone then concealed here whose throat this amiable lady is desirous of cutting said de winter in an ironical contemptuous tone   10.498844128972
and yet it is very hard added she that a man upon whose affection i thought i might depend treats me thus unkindly and will not comply with any of my fancies   8.252749272504982
i thought said franz to the count that you told me there would be but one execution   9.142207459695854
that s another matter   11.591053319284287
against my murderer   11.249027989219679
it is indeed said danglars   13.987388160957146
as for myself as soon as i recovered my senses i went to monsieur the governor to whom i related all that had passed and asked what i should do with my prisoner   8.592946362016631
serves for me the fate of cardinals caprara and bentivoglio who were poisoned   10.63893816240742
but when i do obtain it well   15.859844269830425
dear valentine   9.610520576605165
monsieur de retz wished to become archbishop in his uncle s place and cardinal like mazarin   9.53481795136468
he will arrange everything for me   16.58637624839345
milady seized the occasion   6.715956664195426
what have i then done to you said felton much agitated that you should load me with such a responsibility before god and before men   14.053855362521332
nothing replied bonacieux nothing   12.050805922363514
that would be too terrible   12.665398937974686
a pistole is not enough said d artagnan tis worth a louis   10.745528333202673
the two notaries were holding a consultation as to the best means of proceeding with the affair   8.399040024586341
said milady with a smile which might have disarmed the angel of the last judgment   13.470513902909694
at length after a journey of nearly an hour the carriage stopped before an iron gate which closed an avenue leading to a castle severe in form massive and isolated   18.258889710881807
these horsemen were our friends or rather an avant garde composed of d artagnan and athos   11.941504486761078
father   13.4737868754558
with two companions yes replied the duke   8.57310972286923
as i expected my officer was there   12.698185089589764
for yesterday if my memory does not deceive me you were at my house   10.842568418212903
yes continued his eminence   12.101973240505863
how much did the jew say he would give for the sapphire if he purchased it   14.57169628513692
the four friends resumed their own clothes girded on their swords ordered mousqueton and blaisois to pay the bill and to arrange everything for immediate departure and wrapped in their large cloaks left in search of their game   13.036550335437946
the regiment of the guards was recruited among the first gentlemen of the kingdom   11.505775493305139
but we shall indubitably attract a ball   11.700510526686614
in truth i was fated said she   11.587401060822973
you have done for me as you promised all that you could do   8.087732781627109
desrues was however i must confess more skilful   11.658735534174651
being a man who knew that the former of these symptoms was one of the inherent penalties of womanhood he did not then press his inquiries but waited for a more appropriate opportunity when he should again interrogate her or receive an avowal proprio motu   15.751156137456228
and the four friends quit the room leaving to planchet and fourreau the duty of paying mortuary honors to brisemont   12.570907051105861
so you see that i am not likely to do any of these things   10.871605873666383
cried anne of austria this is more than i can bear   7.471412060302867
as a result she raised her head opened her eyes and sighed deeply   8.457281521988149
therefore leaving directions at every place for grimaud they took a crossroad which conducted the little troop by the bank of a small stream flowing into the lys   9.55423376659064
good the execution of plots is my forte   13.27652696148255
i shall follow the count s directions   7.36282076045489
but he does wrong to use his privilege   18.521040150905463
athos was meditating   6.944318009206716
i thought the abbé busoni had told your excellency   11.935310248300892
i give you 45 000 francs that is 2 500 livres of income a fortune such as i wish i had myself and you are not satisfied   11.83009205917554
in consequence he brought them the key of his own at least such was the apparent motive of his visit   10.847956823890389
assuming a dignified air she turned round to debray without answering her husband   14.473773374151177
this rough appeal marked by the eloquence which characterized mazarin when he spoke in italian or spanish and which he lost entirely in speaking french was uttered with such impenetrable expression that gondy clever physiognomist as he was had no suspicion of its being more than a simple warning to be more subdued   15.233107849335678
and sitting down he wrote a letter to his broker ordering him to sell out at the market price   12.283758814913664
said dantès and without relinquishing mercédès hand clasped in one of his own he extended the other to the catalan with a cordial air   13.543893639289784
joy to hearts which have suffered long is like the dew on the ground after a long drought   9.138433831684052
the brigadier sent for some sticks and straw and having filled the chimney with them set a light to it   14.091133799858623
if monsieur chevalier would follow me   13.296371389738974
you will learn horsemanship swordsmanship in all its branches and dancing   12.051689414004542
on the entrance of the new comers their eyes glanced from father to son and then naturally enough rested on the latter whom they began criticising   15.961022795380288
lord de winter the corrupted catholic knows very well that i am not of his religion and this is a snare he wishes to lay for me   16.157742349852143
demanded the king   9.200549533948811
then take pistols with thee and a hunting knife   12.176765934096005
but i am eager to see our young vicomte   11.045226405806979
he could not cease gazing at and kissing the sweet girl   10.132078229833743
there is one man for whom i can answer if he will speak out   12.405021495948882
and the spanish woman   9.494937113452746
who told you   12.56224746041184
nor was this all   14.724643170473763
had just surrendered to the parliamentary troops whilst oxford and newark still held out for him in the hopes of coming to some arrangement   13.217139293853954
oh believe me that when three great passions such as sorrow love and gratitude fill the heart ennui can find no place   8.710180317534615
hurry   9.962186984139882
all were eager to speak to him as is always the case with those whose words are few and weighty   10.909401827401473
baptistin give me the refusal of him   11.980084773346647
will this crime persuade you of the justice of her punishment for of all this i have the proofs   10.543230917757453
i was at the house of monte cristo an hour since said morrel   13.002584224488078
i reside in my father s house but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the courtyard entirely separated from the main building   11.559674072658915
nothing would be more easy said the captain of a vessel ready to set sail but this morning came an order to let no one leave without express permission from the cardinal   12.702188811994324
my father s melancholy state prevents our speaking to him on any subjects which the weakness of his mind would incapacitate him from understanding and i am perfectly convinced that at the present time although he knows that his granddaughter is going to be married m   12.223466232170948
in spite of this recommendation which owing to the noise could scarcely have been heard two or three musket shots resounded succeeded by a terrible discharge   11.283372701345597
but replied felton i wish to know   13.12799759187319
but first tell me all the particulars of this shameful plot   12.234783632003492
we know that the dream of his life had been to become a musketeer   12.008259641737988
good thought milady   14.552460246721948
at this moment they were startled by a noise as if a tumult were approaching   10.203661600917979
d artagnan approached him with the most amiable air he could assume   5.826949094177383
but he will not make any difficulty at entering mine   10.72835275850896
you are about my height pierre said he   12.903782131919824
i will send for m   13.191882191821344
to the huguenots as places of safety there only remained la rochelle   14.28148497769212
some parting words to his friends   18.898849189638653
that poor little diamond was worth seven thousand livres   11.496927196900886
his respiration was broken and short   12.90660263823182
in short it was you who have but now in this chamber seated in this chair i now fill made an engagement with cardinal richelieu to cause the duke of buckingham to be assassinated in exchange for the promise he has made you to allow you to assassinate d artagnan   17.858087847145285
monte cristo thus attuned to the interview he proposed to hold with morrel and his family departed murmuring as he went these lines of pindar youth is a flower of which love is the fruit   12.735276401318114
another remained motionless behind some red curtains which were in madame de villefort s bedroom   9.50799384431663
d artagnan took his hand   10.52554046402485
monte cristo took no notice of this ill natured remark   12.44164298362033
and what did he do the rest of his time   10.80973444464413
well and i shall get it   9.925028593905319
for unpaid wages   8.103499190141985
the next day in fact at daybreak the court made preparations to quit saint germain   12.103805821319144
a bright yellow streak crossed the sky and seemed to divide in half the poplars which stood out in black relief on the horizon   13.276626240236055
yes my lord it is i   9.554340209237683
in which the equipment of aramis and porthos is treated of chapter xxxv   7.925190674151336
chapter 31   14.573411004855297
la jeune amélie had a very active crew very obedient to their captain who lost as little time as possible   13.157861702757714
the young man now knew her secret her terrible secret the secret she concealed even from her maid with such care the secret of which all the world was ignorant except himself   9.100105601786893
sire said lord leven with hesitation sire your majesty has been deceived by false reports   10.38779799957536
20323m alas i have still to recount the most distressing period of my life   13.46130333999371
at the same instant the eyes of the little group were fixed on the same line which at daybreak they had mistaken for fog and which the morning sun now plainly showed was an army in order of battle   10.164681155926306
dantès told him that the jug had fallen from his hands while he was drinking and the jailer went grumblingly to fetch another without giving himself the trouble to remove the fragments of the broken one   13.062829133242984
you disapprove of this second project as you did of the first   9.783464010215006
the doctor left him in this paroxysm knowing that he could do nothing to alleviate it and going up to noirtier said abruptly how do you find yourself   11.421129460019202
you will ruin both yourself and me by your folly   11.105993807944081
he had despaired of finding bazin but now he thought since he held one end of the thread he would be pretty sure to reach the other end   11.89599939064838
these are doubtless your family arms   9.474763051860059
god forbid   9.583120616721963
monsieur jests but monsieur will see   10.032545528599782
while a spit loaded with partridges was turning before the fire and on each side of a large chimneypiece over two chafing dishes were boiling two stewpans from which exhaled a double odor of rabbit and fish stews rejoicing to the smell   6.855412500224758
alack   10.193434109444635
but what brings you here   7.160371825780739
the soul of milady was bathed in an infernal joy   6.335905199456624
he asked with his flattering manner   12.061022279653033
but now i have forgiven the world for the love of you   15.312377004948992
now athos   15.96627798207004
asked mazarin after a moment s silence   16.13606549191342
on what i could get   9.256463350238294
after a short time the cardinal arranged his shoulder belt then looked with great complacency at his hands which were most elegant and of which he took the greatest care   9.986645336531652
poor fellow poor fellow   8.10461686262476
you agree do you not that obtaining a carriage is out of the question   16.296268727626604
he exclaimed i begin to be more at my ease however whilst you settle yourselves i shall make the round of the boat   9.490076262171065
d artagnan lowered his   11.70618307122175
she perceived athos and became thoughtful   11.302831446207456
i will then wait until the last moment and when my misery is certain irremediable hopeless i will write a confidential letter to my brother in law another to the prefect of police to acquaint them with my intention and at the corner of some wood on the brink of some abyss on the bank of some river i will put an end to my existence as certainly as i am the son of the most honest man who ever lived in france   9.392034062933245
alas no i know not   10.409156578126819
and if he doesn t go straight i will crush him that s all   10.02118914300715
the sergeant made a sign of comprehension   10.28827422928829
one of his peculiarities was never to speak a word of french which he however wrote with great facility   9.875063191312359
age has warmed not chilled your blood   13.33738342026913
if it be but to carry away with me the recollection of such sweet moments i could even thank you for chiding me for it leaves me a gleam of hope that if you did not expect me and that indeed would be worse than vanity to suppose at least i was in your thoughts   11.663468473121002
and have not all these fernands united made lieutenant general the count of morcerf peer of france   11.661509076655378
very well wait a minute   10.974124628908804
but monte cristo looked at him with so melancholy and sweet a smile that maximilian felt the tears filling his eyes   12.618194102287365
this letter was from my brother   15.406059609818513
and the ladies will allow that after having risen to a certain eminence of position the ideal alone can be more exalted   12.975464543463929
well tomorrow i will leave them when i go to auteuil   12.60493882144979
he weighed the two angers in his brain that of the cardinal and that of the queen   8.30232536289891
still further the sea very rough at this period of the year all along the sea coast destroyed every day some little vessel   10.374305964383478
well when dantès was arrested monsieur morrel hastened to obtain the particulars and they were very sad   8.766639752517762
in fact the minister who in the plenitude of his power had been unable to unearth napoleon s secret might in despair at his own downfall interrogate dantès and so lay bare the motives of villefort s plot   13.770072009274685
with a slight inclination of the head danglars signed to the count to be seated pointing significantly to a gilded armchair covered with white satin embroidered with gold   12.014559636456802
and you receive silver from that man   12.19624311028679
because the secret does not belong to him   10.625427978533198
the eye open and intelligent   16.777234486538013
oh enough of this enough of this he cried   9.212027539873361
laporte place the king in bed   9.962516635422604
ah to have dreamed for ten years of being your husband mercédès and to lose that hope which was the only stay of my existence   7.241967632325182
this frondist duchess trusted so confidently to the power of her fine eyes that she could not doubt their influence even over monsieur de condé   11.343801189809199
sire i went straight to the duc de blacas   9.747914500201707
i do not drink bazin pushed away with dignity the officer s hand tis good only for the laity   9.052989233799412
go then and monsieur and i will strive our best to forget your absence replied the countess with the same tone of deep feeling   4.916920938955084
on reaching the pont neuf the coadjutor found it strictly guarded and a man approached him   11.693551207817473
aramis shuddered   5.699904156014571
so much the better cried porthos   12.55674415619212
you are very humble today remarked the governor   14.655990175404915
oh monsieur if i could believe i might trust in your discretion   13.934303619886958
oh valentine were i in your place and did i feel conscious as you do of being worshipped adored with such a love as mine a hundred times at least should i have passed my hand between these iron bars and said take this hand dearest maximilian and believe that living or dead i am yours yours only and forever   10.990305635444718
i answer for bazin said aramis   11.106963776042672
oh he was decidedly   11.216537436101044
yes i paid them nothing and yet they are gone   12.494123365642253
hardly however had he taken ten steps before he returned   7.518532919568731
cried the novice in her turn seizing the hands of milady and devouring her with her eyes   15.501077491257476
but i do not think he has much claim to that title   9.02087920692477
when the two musketeers had entered   10.43497354173381
said the count in a tone which showed how gladly he would have been admitted to the secret   10.848385551608306
de tréville being informed of this by his eminence packed his portmanteau   8.902213335932172
all falsehood is a mask   16.033980591706264
come my friend he said thrusting his hand through the opening where are we going   12.406761836015848
no cried felton no   9.022490097673986
but do you think we ought to accept these 3 000 francs   12.656677476846648
the young man wishing to spare his employer the pain of this interview questioned the new comer   6.777504007680989
whatever i may be she added hardly restraining herself from kissing that pure brow let us see what profession you wish to follow   8.405245605926702
have you seen him since i left him   9.644956677775053
those who wish to respect him as a master would not buy him as a slave   13.311177711881763
his mania   15.575846817901226
well there sir is another proof that good people are never rewarded on this earth and that none but the wicked prosper   13.864086574791248
d artagnan followed him and mousqueton having closed the door mounted behind the carriage with many groans   15.344357044958555
he was an annoyance to the cardinal   11.753673289631289
although in justice the people who arrest and imprison you ought at least to feed you   10.723679591696204
nineteen years of light to reflect upon in eternal darkness   10.488493504560743
the duke was not mistaken   11.441598773105282
that will cost you a hundred francs   7.3389906520753705
are you going to leave me   12.673591837139405
you may well say perchance replied the banker   10.758282223884613
withdraw him gently from the queen whom he does not like from mazarin whom he despises   9.736900399070684
certainly said morrel i am at your service count   6.174488592306616
fernand   16.734456857064263
we will not part with it for that sum   9.14971803366182
she passed first   10.025600465683796
where was this window with white hangings   6.6129144016072665
it will require four or five days for the transmission of the money four or five days for her to return   12.410708787085955
the night at the louvre   11.26875664649023
cromwell has time for everything   14.671368448758438
the ticket bore the name of diavolaccio   6.114012715611382
so are all italians   12.40282017846293
in one of the despatches the cardinal declares to the queen that the treasury is empty and that her majesty has no more money   15.227323339677149
the apartment of m   14.191132873457201
then i understood from your countenance there was more to fear than i had thought   10.508137600809015
the morcerfs   14.810254696125378
i will make the journey on purpose to see him if it is worth while   17.632057217127404
meanwhile you will raise my monthly allowance to five hundred francs my little fellow   9.02934384137155
they may give him the honors of the sack   8.741559229488129
can it gentlemen   9.108045378783753
then i am afraid i shall very much inconvenience you   10.286824701944777
la houdiniere captain of the guards the devil   12.295514801054335
pardon my frankness too my lord   15.512801496879295
to him no doubt   8.957984936513938
chapter 79   8.109057368848458
very well my dear sir   11.758939615198363
that is enough to take us to london and back   12.336522464163819
the soldier replied that he was and that he had given orders to be informed if the prisoner wished to speak to him   4.8382512888384746
every hour seemed to strike with leaden weight upon the heart of the poor girl   11.211281169751455
are we to pass the night in the king s room   12.857248215229792
i will not   10.634323479249812
holà bazin come here this minute   11.552923413415947
i mean to say that when i came in although i had the key of your apartment in my pocket and that key had never quit me i found a letter on the green table cover in your bedroom   8.405467825834517
but to that i answer that it is impossible   10.464819162465927
you render me still more unhappy hate you blame you you edmond   6.887770041270043
well then hearken to me   10.124747738454609
so if i do not send you more it is because i fear you would not accept a larger sum   10.226988716967742
finally the rest of the equipment was successively debated in the same manner   10.85354465402691
mazarin sent us with a letter to general cromwell   9.975373434007794
explain yourself my pretty sibyl   11.27362557562951
the reason why i am now dissatisfied is that i have not a clear appreciation of the past   7.55175806702783
so much so replied monte cristo that while you call yourself baron you are not willing to call anybody else count   12.343447622265549
d artagnan descended by the staircase at which he had entered and found athos and the four musketeers waiting his appearance and beginning to grow uneasy   12.052247524731921
the translation of this new question occupied another five minutes   12.248350607086437
stake your diamond then   10.299870431319935
are you willing that i should this evening pass with you the time i generally spend with your mistress   12.989959081361945
having obtained the light he hurried upstairs again and once more i heard his rapid and uneasy footsteps   12.741491661176418
de monte cristo s friend   10.178690613495665
there was no longer a doubt that felton was convinced   7.491162639193767
perfectly madame   13.711919633787613
bonacieux we must have them back again   17.841089021941876
i believe i did   16.31592078103708
and it is thus heaven recompenses virtue sir added caderousse   11.528109218874848
god would not permit such a crime   13.15269043613922
yes replied the invalid   12.153926045104784
yes said monte cristo i perfectly recollect him   9.932289412122245
he was therefore about to return to the palazzo bracciano without loss of time when suddenly a luminous idea crossed his mind   16.270472666395676
d épinay return   7.189108640838037
as she advanced she fancied she heard a voice speaking her name   7.1810719713422895
certainly we are friends he replied   12.88995657776669
then run to the door and open it yourself   10.667999201729463
and who is the judas who has concluded this infamous bargain   13.42301879123575
and they set out at as hard a canter as their horses could maintain   4.260901865838778
gentlemen replied d artagnan i have already received by monsieur de cavois a similar invitation from his eminence   10.428468020446433
the two women who thus knelt in united prayer were the daughter and grand daughter of henry iv   12.256718906304718
nothing and he read you have not answered my first note   12.005855911543124
charles having proceeded with aramis as with athos embraced them both   11.80659889757368
that poor innocent offspring of mine which i never even kissed but for whom i wept many many tears   11.121749913947443
lips of stone turned to flame breasts of ice became like heated lava so that to franz yielding for the first time to the sway of the drug love was a sorrow and voluptuousness a torture as burning mouths were pressed to his thirsty lips and he was held in cool serpent like embraces   13.750040330079628
the similarity in the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances is so great that were i obliged to affirm by oath what i have now stated i should hesitate   11.273930704384235
the count watched albert waving his hand to him   4.3767888989580195
buckingham tried to smile a last time   13.529906187699435
gondy bowed respectfully   14.365150217992273
i shall not be more than half an hour   14.197232742937056
let us consider first the ancient rights   10.637133385700363
at the end of the second he had ceased to mark the lapse of time   16.22512917294973
dantès my friend you are not yet registered number one on board the good ship pharaon   9.60413183147964
near here replied de comminges smiling   17.7830369513335
it appears that milady and i are anxious about the health of the same person   10.58292009165712
alas our own wars quite absorb the time and the mind of a poor incapable infirm old minister like me   10.051225456648293
she fanned herself smelled at her vinaigrette and walked up and down   11.044323194236561
well will you take me or shall i take edward   9.442855288714334
i was walking about in order to pass away the time till ten o clock when i caught sight of your carriage and horses   9.153073048366995
what is he doing up there   7.316991622148705
that s true said he quietly for my part i have never loved   14.012851797639703
for the singular clause of the only will that had been found had caused it to be regarded as a genuine relic preserved in the family with superstitious veneration   12.390075215179127
then you have seen him   14.597637796325627
then he took the glass emptied three parts of the contents in the fireplace that it might be supposed valentine had taken it and replaced it on the table   7.3998196599068065
and yet said porthos   10.530758752308856
there is the little door opening into the garden   13.917308974298258
the young man stood before her sorrowful and resolute   8.856719949881189
no unfortunately   9.808782481358344
a corridor   10.424410598922977
how i worked how i hoped how i struck every piece of turf thinking to find some resistance to my spade   12.485901798798059
draw nearer penelon said the young man and tell us all about it   2.6501313357808325
well how has all gone off   8.538584915562957
oh it is impossible   3.662300903676284
and if he does not return instead of accusing him of the inconstancy which you insinuate i will tell you that he died loving me and me only   13.165883800740698
de morcerf is one of the most assiduous peers at the luxembourg a general renowned for theory but a most mediocre amateur of art   20.375374985823363
as a punishment for the crime i had committed answered bertuccio   13.86584481199719
another queen in want of help   15.104859354432488
but of yours it may be said i hope every dream is an illusion   11.448864526588043
he placed himself at the table and wrote a little note which he sealed with a ring and gave the billet to kitty   12.429365962621386
exclaimed mordaunt thank you   12.795876998311067
de tréville possessed at the commencement of his   17.285317176410274
and young as i was i quite understood that some imminent danger was hanging over our heads   10.060198277743552
and having again recommended porthos to the care of mousqueton and paid his bill to the host he resumed his route with planchet already relieved of one of his led horses   15.875739549403475
but like the feudal barons who rebelled against their sovereign he dwelt in an impregnable fortress   17.506417512874993
but have you not come from auteuil here   17.39509287655039
felton blushed   9.716659921686873
i know his character   12.654844621119873
on approaching the house he perceived m   13.53128196528839
a woman will often from mere wilfulness prefer that which is dangerous to that which is safe   7.8296652234983535
yes sir i will give my attention to the subject   10.459922535407054
he is one of your friends then monsieur le comte   14.39170455752754
i have the payment under my hand   9.804248812762191
we and his majesty will lead the second   13.240691878926517
the queen looked with surprise at this strange man whose brilliant courage made him the equal of the bravest and who was by his fine and quick intelligence the equal of the most astute   10.113230339507806
is it possible said he that where your liberty is at stake you can allow any such scruple to deter you from obtaining it   19.68098204831633
although in reality a liberal he negotiated a loan of six millions for charles x   8.60794817080755
caderousse said monte cristo   11.008385710000685
noirtier s grandchild as valentine and yet if she had not been going to marry m   12.127580169560485
his boots were of black leather and at his girdle hung that sword with a magnificent hilt that porthos had so often admired in the rue feron   8.426435836020243
albert reflected   8.085179442481742
the carriage had started madame de chevreuse had made a parting gesture to the young man and raoul had returned in a state of stupefaction   12.342962033145545
de troisville as his family was still called in gascony or m   7.174038956657384
the king asked to remain up having he said no wish to sleep   12.178776843663213
a horse   12.092486242258534
so that the news of the approaching exit ran like a train of lighted gunpowder along the streets   9.899516025344727
if a man had by unheard of and excruciating tortures destroyed your father your mother your betrothed a being who when torn from you left a desolation a wound that never closes in your breast do you think the reparation that society gives you is sufficient when it interposes the knife of the guillotine between the base of the occiput and the trapezal muscles of the murderer and allows him who has caused us years of moral sufferings to escape with a few moments of physical pain   15.041451626535773
you say so   14.855381706620657
dawn was shedding its pallid placid glimmer on the purple ocean when at the distance of a musket shot from them was seen a dark gray mass above which gleamed a triangular sail   15.008847202236932
he was occupied with the preparations for raoul s departure and was seeking to gain time   5.973247182103307
go on signor pastrini continued franz smiling at his friend s susceptibility   10.367402591551105
my dear friend said aramis remember that he goes in an opposite direction from that in which we are going that he has a fresh horse and ours are fatigued so that we shall disable our own horses without even a chance of overtaking him   9.882470223989634
madame danglars returned in another cab to the passage on the other side of which she found her carriage and her coachman sleeping peacefully on his box while waiting for her   16.674463391417515
but to crown all these advantages albert de morcerf commanded an income of 50 000 livres a more than sufficient sum to render him a personage of considerable importance in paris   15.63406401746118
the world calls me beautiful   15.11922584254016
keep my signatures   14.92482894666122
at ten o clock anne of austria had entered the king s room   18.107926591176437
and if he has fostered his amours by promises of eternal constancy he must likewise have sown the seeds of hatred by his eternal infidelities   18.548053506394062
master broussel is being strangled   12.425732141209206
de saint méran villefort s father in law   14.364735709103511
asked the mercer piqued to the quick   13.698738403926324
now said d artagnan to himself noticing that silent play of countenance i am sure of it   7.7568122996863025
oh i have often heard whispers of things that seem to me most strange the father a bonapartist the son a royalist   12.952110616959757
de tréville who was waiting for them already informed of this fresh disturbance   15.10061059558769
milady tried to open the door in order to throw herself out   10.270395324485282
a man appeared on the threshold   14.400507895236531
what will you do with the letter then   10.54132356174196
that evening d artagnan went to present his respects to m   13.599313229413724
i tell you that you are about to destroy yourself continued the count and here is proof of what i say   14.180824654433112
after a short time the count saw bertuccio who until then had been occupied on the other side of the house glide into an adjoining room   11.700458587177812
d artagnan as we have said had become more tranquil as always happens after a past danger particularly when the danger seems to have vanished   11.99292439532746
in this kind of game not to kill is to let one s self be killed   6.354316982402606
but if you yourselves should be struck   10.29819168674756
but suppose one pass as is permissible in philology from the word itself to its softened synonym then instead of committing an ignoble assassination you make an elimination   11.5268714953448
at the dawn of day he replaced the stone pushed his bed against the wall and lay down   11.867450758069351
resumed mazarin   12.062296828986742
and when he was alone in the world i tried by absolute devotion to his will to make up to him all he had done for me during ten years of unremitting kindness   7.291730060815229
let them take my fortune i am already too rich   10.669794723462703
instead of striking between the sixth and seventh left ribs as your countrymen do you must have struck higher or lower and life is very tenacious in these lawyers or rather there is no truth in anything you have told me it was a fright of the imagination a dream of your fancy   11.238766117125733
it seems to me i did my duty   11.74459081579732
20281m my dear monsieur bertuccio said monte cristo laughing control yourself   13.13857761729205
which you are taking back to him   15.202076887603685
cried he in an accent of greater astonishment than before your second witness is monsieur aramis   11.506738230317017
the abbé told us it was worth 50 000 without the setting   6.828450021973261
he and she   14.155629457969013
well done guitant cried the cardinal to the equestrian   10.954085754811825
they had only halberds before now they have muskets   12.129662282253634
morrel you are going to destroy yourself   15.770705480278652
in some parts of france yes excellency   14.021838150709527
i will beg him to turn his eyes now and then towards me and if he keep his word and interest himself for me in six months i shall be an officer or dead   8.974592957575517
d artagnan the younger notwithstanding the efforts he made to remain firm as a future musketeer ought nature prevailed and he shed many tears of which he succeeded with great difficulty in concealing the half   12.338406754138276
when he had heard and comprehended all to the fullest extent he replied that he was a royalist   12.341108296441655
he had an only daughter who married m   16.356967701255954
i tried to speak   11.891234313620801
i am a priest said the young man   11.187539831217963
noirtier cast on barrois showed that there was something wanting which he knew where to find   11.45693483343434
the same noise of a door opening and shutting was repeated the instant afterward   13.426447026983976
bazin bowed low sighed and left the room   12.922989009829308
to what end   17.837722477585977
i came to tell you   6.2158806533405215
but so far from that sire i know the duke to be a royal gentleman and i refer the matter to him but upon one condition sire   9.883510025707256
why it is a veritable pilgrimage my dear friend that you are making to the temple of friendship as the poets would say   6.021407892383591
gaetano who had proposed the expedition had taken all the responsibility on himself   12.42529343484916
so much the better muttered athos   8.519902865533862
true replied danglars   8.209530235139965
bertuccio according to the command which had been given him had two hours before left for auteuil when a cab stopped at the door and after depositing its occupant at the gate immediately hurried away as if ashamed of its employment   14.702181939046923
you have acted kindly count in bringing me back to the place where i have enjoyed so much bliss   10.106107129446801
this might be a kind remembrance of monsieur the cardinal   12.615563633851764
nevertheless whether the passengers were really touched by the urbanity of planchet or whether this time nobody was posted on the young man s road our two travelers arrived at chantilly without any accident and alighted at the tavern of great st   8.94162856974555
we will see about that presently said d artagnan with a slight smile   11.818957218468716
you are disputing which shall fight me first but you do not consult me who am most concerned in the matter   13.38725043583073
so my lord deign to receive my most respectful homage   10.329265033469724
i should tell you that we lived in the little village of rogliano at the extremity of cap corse   13.88376841647161
they had formed a circle round the invalid   4.703294859466393
de monte cristo is whence he comes where he goes and why he speaks in our presence of children that have been disinterred in a garden   10.852567156837836
often killing others but then certain of not rotting in prison m   13.782435668777667
about this time a band of brigands that had established itself in the lepini mountains began to be much spoken of   11.103062939898415
and so you see lest he might do you an injury well   11.043014530099104
at five o clock the next morning she again proceeded and in three hours after entered béthune   14.605806216175933
but i have a partner and you know the italian proverb chi ha compagno ha padrone he who has a partner has a master   15.013410750646806
monseigneur said d artagnan quite confused i went hunting at windsor or elsewhere that concerns nobody   8.592676297590408
was it to tell me that madame coldly replied gondy that your majesty admitted me to the honor of entering your presence   14.588377298920701
did the sun shine in my eyes   19.827485836566417
i beg your pardon madame but you were about to relate some story were you not   12.755750041022834
oh heaven   10.144023346680266
could you engage to bring him to me to morrow morning at ten o clock on the pont du louvre   11.352142844051643
before i leave you mercédès have you no request to make   13.671585630085705
said she and why do you place your hand on me   10.360845204438345
30069m well replied monte cristo suppose then that this poison was brucine and you were to take a milligramme the first day two milligrammes the second day and so on   9.095203667950171
do you wish to know why he bought it   16.057489513570225
not like monsieur de richelieu who went on just as he pleased   12.920733561160457
go on monsieur   10.795757022227725
he knew his time well the hour when valentine was giving noirtier his breakfast and was sure not to be disturbed in the performance of this pious duty   12.31518952205747
the countenance of milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under any other circumstances mme   12.744879683537476
now to the point   14.872536745642496
i am the spectre of a wretch you buried in the dungeons of the château d if   12.01505363725386
how do you know the motives that person may have for trying to extract all he can from you   12.128225638194351
on reaching the door he bowed   7.908491470298898
at auteuil   14.009515465564517
captivity the fourth day the next day when felton entered milady s apartment he found her standing mounted upon a chair holding in her hands a cord made by means of torn cambric handkerchiefs twisted into a kind of rope one with another and tied at the ends   10.507115410845866
ah try it   10.099649970601865
have you known what it is to have your father starve to death in your absence   11.465478129268314
he esteems me highly   10.83810856910426
his gravity made him look older than he was   11.068806733901521
he the man who would be popular can not forgive the count of morcerf for being created a peer   8.485246860644398
my senses fail me amid such a chaos of iniquities   13.57638205239057
the walls hung with brocaded silk of the most magnificent designs and texture   15.590786621033313
but he is said to be a furious mazarinist   11.592806704372823
chapter xxiii   10.078736705579221
and if i have any counsel to give it is always lose   15.227052891604526
certainly women alone know how to dissimulate said monte cristo to himself glancing at madame danglars who was smiling on the procureur and embracing his wife   9.5707210101668
take in two reefs in the top sails cried the captain   11.199599879909167
with dilated eyes growling as he paced along by the bars of a window looking upon the yard of servant s offices   8.543579903681849
it is very evident that the mind still retains its full force and vigor   8.467779653398086
said monte cristo you do not appear to be in the possession of your senses   12.810002726184996
you may convert to and distribute this work in any binary compressed marked up nonproprietary or proprietary form including any word processing or hypertext form   8.542148618830922
he left the box and dice where they fell threw the purse to the wounded man and eagerly opened the pocketbook   11.788966321132143
then who reigns in france at this moment napoleon ii   11.530016491946581
i shall not trust to that said the lieutenant and i shall make for the dunes as soon as possible   11.505161428646396
oh he never was a friend of mine i did not know him and i had nothing to ask of him   12.324191875044042
i wished to make an effort   10.518789041814447
it would have been more simple   14.815095775286832
but no one thought of monte cristo   13.110872014394023
the prince was therefore contrary to his custom gloomy and anxious when an officer entered and announced to marshal de grammont that some one wished to see him   17.36193129533467
halloo planchet   3.981789724525795
and danglars wrote the address as he spoke   16.24693519706382
but supposing our enemy should not allow us to do so   9.499149247529488
make free now you have begun   9.434844103505444
give me another cutlet   6.021347264535308
said d artagnan coming back to recommend courage to his lackey   15.270221334165589
can it be bad news   11.608541490501988
they passed in silence through the little village of festubert where the wounded servant was and then skirted the wood of richebourg   8.038382804444712
d artagnan perceived that he was enforcing prudence with respect to himself   16.13882760389276
as you said we have acquired glory and were enabled to carry on a conversation of the highest importance   9.375416831933462
with the first light dantès resumed his search   13.386974508731768
the cardinal saw that it was now high time to come to the assistance of anne   8.321892721031613
at length villefort the most composed of all spoke sir said he to maximilian you say you loved valentine that you were betrothed to her   12.921304208288865
you will make some desirable acquaintances   9.793341095320642
the prisoner reproached himself with not having thus employed the hours he had passed in vain hopes prayer and despondency   13.481984781159062
he was an eccentric being and did not believe in the existence of gratitude   15.63165007655076
the soldiers then saw him stretch his limbs little by little and under the pretense of much heat throw off the scotch plaid which covered him   10.694559966691767
albert was on the point of pronouncing his father s name when monte cristo gently held up his finger in token of reproach   13.76103338855405
and think you that we should find him at this hour at his post   10.731700295742467
the queen had confidence in the courage of d artagnan which she knew and the cardinal in the strength of porthos which he had experienced   10.140652783811536
if while he was being carried out the grave diggers should discover that they were bearing a live instead of a dead body dantès did not intend to give them time to recognize him but with a sudden cut of the knife he meant to open the sack from top to bottom and profiting by their alarm escape   5.605307808475293
his wife on the contrary whose maiden name had been madeleine radelle was pale meagre and sickly looking   12.543629069461527
in a quarter of an hour he returned accompanied by a tall man masked and wrapped in a large red cloak   10.869460053864465
and athos sprang into the boat which was immediately pushed off and which soon sped seawards under the efforts of four stalwart rowers   6.964898473070444
there still remains that of bernajoux but you must not be too confident   15.047657720938943
i am lost murmured she   11.514445653769497
amid all this d artagnan remarked also that not one countenance responded to the gallantries of porthos   17.01829309990686
but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their eyes and with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each other s arms   11.507793257882515
i regret i did not inform you sooner of this circumstance   10.994533313817005
well but put on this dressing gown first said the musketeer to his friend   13.08642312597863
continued gondy turning to the curate of st   9.889204911470273
at the same time he felt a sharp pain in his knee   15.682439364368374
yes continued caderousse so it is   12.60748813966872
after a pause which appeared an age to rochefort mazarin took from a bundle of papers a letter and showing it to the count he said i find here a letter in which you sue for liberty monsieur de rochefort   14.013948813866296
my military weapons   10.898801529245487
be happy and tomorrow we shall have more   12.96837003604533
brought up in paris where raoul had been but once   11.420244054227231
yes yes i   8.038804364120026
i have concentrated here at naseby camp all the resources heaven has left me and i write to you in haste from thence   15.443584053475732
you see he has a truly royal escort   11.73122383461328
cardinal   12.443667527763875
30093m i am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth 32 000 francs wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at 5 000 francs each   13.940899075001273
this unexpected band of auxiliaries arrived in paris on the tenth of january and the prince of conti was named but not until after a stormy discussion generalissimo of the army of the king out of paris   11.532035758623309
you may   7.7809875071078975
ten minutes afterwards the sails were furled and they cast anchor about a hundred fathoms from the little harbor   7.521198158154439
de monte cristo either in the lobby or on the stairs   10.115296180205522
but you speak of him not of his party his resources   11.47283045047372
twelve hours sir   15.405682334381362
the solitary light burning at the catalans   6.679099943433465
well as after my death the command devolves on you as mate assume the command and bear up for the island of elba disembark at porto ferrajo ask for the grand marshal give him this letter perhaps they will give you another letter and charge you with a commission   10.398037749018833
stop there are a fine body of citizens passing   12.732309944172437
when we are alarmed we see double   10.802775857661548
i have reflected and i can not must not be guilty of such a sin   11.650339101652975
i shall die of hunger as old dantès did while fernand and danglars are rolling in wealth   10.725047262001699
an attendant arose at a sign from a confidential clerk at the first desk   10.75503072829716
once out of auteuil andrea looked around in order to assure himself that he could neither be seen nor heard and then stopping the horse and crossing his arms before the man he asked now tell me why you come to disturb my tranquillity   13.926009679471669
it is feared that it may be the smallpox sir replied porthos desirous of taking his turn in the conversation   12.775983129720226
de château renaud m   7.825080737874783
just remember what they said   8.118733800796253
was he awake or was it but a dream   12.923981076823312
two men jealous of him sir   19.34609321338276
and for what crime are you imprisoned in the bastile   14.18792009275112
are you quite sure of that   12.388918144329235
said athos how much time we have lost   13.836016720097762
no for two hundred thousand francs   9.073292182871384
but resumed la ramee that is only a way of corresponding   11.668650839352344
satisfy my impatience   12.078169282196308
what say you to that crime of which i have the proof   9.472502361921968
well monsieur said he you appear to be more stupid than i am for you forget there is a little quarrel to arrange between us two   12.067106545814328
she never goes to bed before midnight   9.072405680581351
so much the better said porthos   13.666073265745524
and why on earth does she want to speak to me at all   4.573918182766487
release broussel   16.603424181804336
what can be more wretched than the man who has lost all he loved and desired in the world   15.344405979652233
at midnight they withdrew to their chamber the door of which was left open on the pretext of kindly consideration   14.521172887854192
had morrel been a more quick sighted man or better versed in these matters he would have been surprised at the king s procureur answering him on such a subject instead of referring him to the governors of the prison or the prefect of the department   10.034507160587324
oh if you know him tell me   16.76989439800927
suddenly she heard a step she knew turned anxiously around the door opened and fernand dressed in the uniform of a sub lieutenant stood before her   11.856416538463352
the cardinal s enemy   11.433352050429153
my dear count replied albert i was announcing your visit to some of my friends whom i had invited in consequence of the promise you did me the honor to make and whom i now present to you   16.62530124137598
while we wait time will be progressing events will succeed each other   15.917464226832681
before or after whichever you please   10.435068281049737
but this chase loving diana continually surrounded by her nymphs gives me a sort of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of actæon   12.50654815565302
ask them to sing one more song   9.99139024428669
but at that period we were not at war   13.947598709590254
willingly said maximilian   14.14767771577825
added caderousse with his hoarse laugh   12.232426712493679
he s the second to day   11.06403889440748
he has just written to me   12.678627731175858
de tréville s where he had dined   14.123190996204958
two drops more would kill you replied the abbé   11.795701855561122
then you were aware of dantès being engaged in a conspiracy   16.883448167550092
i no longer belonged to myself for i had my sister in law to protect and provide for   14.414696886988022
the young man was either charmed by his nurse stolen by gypsies or lost by his tutor i scarcely know which   13.897458777875505
i spent perhaps an hour in coming from the yard to this place   12.765717273766967
neither had his eyes bandaged   9.52835573828951
he arrived safely at the top of the staircase and while he was feeling his way a sob indicated the direction he was to take   19.53160835450634
they were standing motionless while single men passed from one group to another   12.015251527108699
the repast had been ordered by athos and the lackey furnished by porthos   13.567463294227807
athos repeated to him the same question he had asked the first person he met   8.002580179960603
next day next day sir you must have seen plain enough what they had been doing yet you said nothing though you were present when dantès was arrested   7.27147985018326
bertuccio made but one bound to the antechamber and cried in a hoarse voice his excellency s horses   15.718292723864305
he then seemed more easy   13.832865501770147
my dear mother said he do you know if m   13.184986263892005
valentine was so pale so cold so inanimate that without listening to what was said to them they were seized with the fear which pervaded that house and they flew into the passage crying for help   11.493811244380517
his dress half artist half dandy did not excite any suspicion and consequently no disquietude   12.074974857730169
his eminence was uneasy and sent me to find you   15.704267519940252
it was an oriental feast that he offered to them but of such a kind as the arabian fairies might be supposed to prepare   17.73720154371889
really impossible   14.505327333291147
then count if you will not wait we must look upon these projects as if they had never been entertained   11.8113701493976
one who will be your best friend dantès for he is my friend my cousin my brother   12.890474583020984
this man who was hastening towards the wood was already three quarters of the way on the road from the grotto to the forest   21.09990668379332
then i understand it all   11.366081651307368
it must be nearly four o clock   8.157123256624052
oh it was a touching superstition monsieur and although i did not myself believe it i would not for the world have destroyed my father s faith   10.784714222153077
bills upon spain   14.256484827731628
exclaimed the gascon   14.334612829965158
la chesnaye   14.848694216652449
has morrel whom we know been killed   13.086919342631496
madame danglars moved rapidly as though she would spring from her chair but villefort stopped and clasped his hands as if to implore her attention   9.360389560533834
how absurd as if one crown were not as good as another   15.528895110787516
you are laughing at me   13.663689147257239
it was at the corner of two streets and had in the rear bordering on the side street stables and a sort of garden   9.432739953940839
oh do not fear   15.118313850527347
does his mother then keep poisons in her laboratory   6.414464517212606
but blaisois ventured to say i have heard you relate monsieur mousqueton that once on a time at chantilly you fed your master and yourself by taking partridges in a snare carp with a line and bottles with a slipnoose   10.233052859396887
he took the child in his arms embraced him shook him called him but the child made no response   7.1364655140385205
he was alone   20.792810559086114
yes madame in your oratory   11.370228372460604
it cost me more but i have nothing to fear   8.162854132703572
your father major bartolomeo cavalcanti   13.242252276320514
this is no act of selfishness but of delicacy   14.941920097544127
patrick remain here or rather join the king wherever he may be and tell his majesty that i humbly beg him to excuse me but an affair of the greatest importance recalls me to london   6.803645186126085
so my dear the coffer of the defunct holding out its arms to me i shall marry the widow   8.945734296025671
well commenced   11.528379692360446
cried the astonished woman   16.229442883048243
and i too added aramis   5.9272312023881435
well asked he of the count what has then happened   13.934013121364446
he mounted the skirting stone that his eyes might look over the curtain   10.637739020703345
you live on your estate happy in golden mediocrity   9.513818103574229
yes with frenchmen and frenchmen like you   12.404483780643274
7 the knife which is shaped like a crescent that cuts with the convex side falls from a less height and that is all the difference   11.661475078341242
prince cavalcanti appears to be a young man of rare qualities   16.630791125500004
said monte cristo extending his hand   15.449338283204137
ah monsieur he was no longer a man he was a devil   10.124569926248073
come have you committed some crime pursued by human justice from which i can protect you   7.581878086828262
say not so quickly returned monte cristo say not so my friends   6.022300758502698
cried aramis throwing his skullcap in his face   12.583285548827519
d artagnan fancied himself very cunning when advising milady to renounce by pardoning de wardes the furious projects she had formed   9.331836931605118
the little soft light shone on in the calmness of the night   18.49043101544279
how do you know   15.91146547836073
and bertuccio feeling in his pocket signed to a keeper whom he saw through the window of the wicket   9.164067398447969
of course we do replied albert   16.527585552135506
de villefort for three months he took not a step out of doors without my following him   13.377369524224289
but your eminence   11.201293830536372
the young man bit his lips and whispered to his sergeant you will follow these men and not lose sight of them   16.023304547605306
between the past and the present was an ineffable abyss   10.906878720245553
athos pinched aramis s hand   15.3113367130306
the woman screamed and cried for help   13.878235632367533
no but perhaps you will permit me to call to mind stay   6.74743663585693
repeated the sailors   15.138252476802526
he then thought with a touch of vexation that perhaps the young woman had fallen asleep while waiting for him   12.306794234944341
said caderousse very uneasily   14.720413955535179
it is difficult to form an idea of the perfect change that had taken place   20.003341058013795
does your honor want a horse   10.497716917793134
that of a lieutenant of musketeers   5.979951201776698
and when shall we have the honor of seeing you again your excellency   13.119654810207656
that is all i promise you   11.422655634941094
have i arrived at the moment when you were drawing up an indictment for a capital crime   10.877115532486549
planchet whom he had sent home two hours before from the hôtel de ville telling him to sit up for him opened the door for him   12.14702201958156
yes looked the old man   10.863247362499774
villefort remained silent for a moment and dented his pale cheeks with his nails   14.567186226962795
be satisfied beautiful constance   8.957278193931543
having made this well turned speech villefort looked carefully around to mark the effect of his oratory much as he would have done had he been addressing the bench in open court   6.606825409604673
it is a demand that porthos takes very ill when he is not in funds   4.136988070418502
the abbé sprinkled a little dust over it to conceal the traces of its having been removed rubbed his foot well on it to make it assume the same appearance as the other and then going towards his bed he removed it from the spot it stood in   10.6310666328746
the two piastres that luigi received every month from the count of san felice s steward and the price of all the little carvings in wood he sold at rome were expended in ear rings necklaces and gold hairpins   13.991032541009059
i will tell it cried milady with a feigned exultation on the day when i shall have suffered sufficiently for my faith   15.039144580473092
it was necessary to compel him to open it as the sergeant had been compelled to speak and this took another ten minutes   15.954667150837032
the enemy   11.783619221045143
their number was formidable now that he had begun to fear and yet these names powerful though they were had often caused him to smile with the same kind of satisfaction experienced by a traveller who from the summit of a mountain beholds at his feet the craggy eminences the almost impassable paths and the fearful chasms through which he has so perilously climbed   14.05639640847803
how far distant   8.317377787064505
we say the gravel he trod under his feet for d artagnan made these reflections while walking solitarily along a pretty little road which led from the camp to the village of angoutin   16.95370408733766
this milady this woman this creature this demon has a brother in law as i think you told me d artagnan   14.136372471138182
cavalcanti will certainly fight   19.222506671916427
but the eyes of his three companions were fixed upon him their ears were wide open and there were no means of retreat   15.710483215983114
you are naked   12.50119174152136
tell us news of yourself as often as you can   11.744790616093665
said the cardinal and for what purpose   11.684783223908022
yes count and a splendid duel too   11.94416025617149
said kitty you know how to represent things in such a way that you are always in the right   11.90832038873681
meanwhile the young man had darted in to his chamber and opened the letter   6.58317625317772
i hope madame that the cardinal will not enter into negotiations with such men   14.502006452657024
i will give you the baton of the marechal de la meilleraie who does not seem to be much in favor just now   10.455720464184648
no was there one   13.195137074637309
athos drew d artagnan aside   12.313846664229892
the austere puritan lies   12.960124810021949
he was masked likewise   12.920224695112916
you are in the wrong to tell me that my lord   16.094086815839436
but in the present instance the confidential nature of the conversation he had overheard made him with propriety judge that his appearance at such a time would be anything but agreeable   7.130429910443755
that s true replied jacopo   8.338821145295665
captivity the fifth day chapter lvii   11.456181844859275
you must not stop an instant on the way   13.88820313960995
said d artagnan that is to say the queen wishes to leave paris   16.922832371708104
and as the king began to lose what he had won he was not sorry to find an excuse for playing charlemagne if we may use a gaming phrase of whose origin we confess our ignorance   11.437202126580365
have pity on me count   17.775356751052083
king of france who was formidable still in spite of his recent reverses   9.219143670709935
oil is a sovereign balm for wounds   9.8155846961963
thus sure that the rider would not release his hold raoul now only directed his attention to the horse which he guided to the opposite bank helping it to cut through the water and encouraging it with words   11.133541672777168
besides here s the end of the cable   5.892975469773313
her eyes were cast down and she was crying   15.07466940934021
he occupied that post for twenty years   16.465779590841894
not at all i assure you   12.834631371263226
shall you have the courage   9.193677104304044
now although la ramee appreciated as of a certain value the honor of being shut up with a prisoner of so great importance still the pleasure of living in intimacy with the grandson of henry iv   6.926337648146154
he formed therefore the resolution of believing for the present all that was said of their past hoping for more certain and extended revelations in the future   11.817381895229726
you know the affairs of the deceased are in perfect order and her will bequeaths to valentine the entire property of the saint méran family   8.177016564467081
i must be able to present these proofs for his appreciation   13.160024103479932
why have you hated him   8.234748919222461
but sit down said monte cristo   12.049923719892595
upon grimaud   13.083856747288031
he started   16.63933585828524
do not fear i have little to prepare   11.984032142503459
come four   9.276070700742316
well do you comprehend now   12.782298133643508
ah sir the poor fellow told you the truth   16.438746003197508
morrel looked at her with astonishment   14.24795279016455
you have hastened to me can i have the happiness of being useful to you   13.076956081645703
yes monseigneur replied the faithful cloak bearer of anne of austria but too late perhaps   7.400715417840406
what took place at portsmouth august 23 1628 felton took leave of milady as a brother about to go for a mere walk takes leave of his sister kissing her hand   9.903088335450281
d artagnan left athos s chamber and went to that of porthos   15.626160291889011
oh you can not believe what you say   15.895165199207401
very well my lord   7.572365056766085
at last they reached the tennis court   10.551548206965808
said the young captain shaking his head   14.801298409366845
said she hurriedly you know poor grandmamma died an hour since and now i have no friend in the world but you   12.540660579200399
it shall be the last can you prove the authenticity of what you have now stated   11.977455741888084
that a nobleman whom he did not know had wished to take charge of it had answered for its future and had taken it away   10.03837385123665
and you still bid me hope   11.168387323646684
de winter stupefied looked on while the soldiers bound felton and could not tell what to think of such insensibility   14.701348339359885
then he resumed in his turn discipline monseigneur has i hope in no way been forgotten by us   8.658990336388525
rest assured gentlemen that within three days in a less time than justice would demand the revenge i shall have taken for the murder of my child will be such as to make the boldest heart tremble   10.765541424856405
do you propose entering any horses at either of these races count   11.429514696323633
and it was time for you were sinking   9.258695491007906
you are right cried the gentleman   12.146836260688637
you have given me all you can give me and from to day your debt is paid   8.203784810743066
no replied athos fortunately monsieur d artagnan has only fainted   14.579661961673242
let us say no more about it   6.110444687214137
the young man took the helm felt to see if the vessel answered the rudder promptly and seeing that without being a first rate sailor she yet was tolerably obedient   12.206463172950809
cocles pay two hundred francs to each of these good fellows said morrel   15.116387357447145
no you shall live honored and pure   15.692653725297045
that gentleman i say what has become of him   12.994749820236215
i comprehend   17.737839638844385
athos took a pistol from his belt looked to see if it was properly primed cocked it and placed the muzzle close to grimaud s ear   16.913053231059884
i will wait to pay you my next visit till you are in a better humor   16.126884580126138
exclaimed signor pastrini utterly impossible   12.487036982834283
he drew his sword entirely from the scabbard and followed him crying turn turn master joker lest i strike you behind   13.856441281086406
cried aramis turning around   20.115103490226403
nearly at the same instant the door was opened and the count of monte cristo appeared on the threshold   11.884337814536975
for my part i shall go unarmed   12.011013594899918
too ardently perhaps   9.113829953956031
that was most probable   8.797905325268594
the question is this monsieur the principal thinks that my thesis ought to be dogmatic and didactic   10.222539099972096
well said villefort what then   7.1374979841903485
we expect him every moment   12.081844981604576
at this sigh felton turned round   14.526154865736649
this house was gloomy because it was remorseful it was remorseful because it concealed a crime   19.046294612819697
bonacieux kissed the hands of the queen concealed the paper in the bosom of her dress and disappeared with the lightness of a bird   15.391898390041712
this brought them by the end of the repast to swallowing a drink which from the color of the ruby had passed to that of a pale topaz   12.622092486733107
but it was plain that all assistance was useless all the features of the dying man were distorted with agony   10.060043352610101
i will keep it returned morcerf   11.9117324658822
and you complain of that   8.086219288999992
he then turned to the left down a corridor which had escaped the attention of the two friends but as he opened the door he paused as if in thought   11.19038923600917
what do you ask of me   11.612132754702234
and when all was arranged he went out quietly with the soldiers   15.689991838462596
he was in the country as i was told by the person who recommended him to me   12.215434017921952
the king called the cardinal   8.635637695286531
albert that and he may know what to answer you   15.937176041513075
the fortunes of that monarch now are at low water   13.689633892168398
my dear viscount said monte cristo gravely you must have seen before today that at all times and in all places i have been at your disposal but the service which you have just demanded of me is one which it is out of my power to render you   13.496298466136519
he is a priest learned in cases of conscience and we will tell him ours   13.461583016481686
mistrust yourself john said he   11.687689956556351
what ails you baron   9.879655851382388
do you not think so   11.186518591119508
de la trémouille s testimony and himself   13.16818813008542
i am all attention said the abbé   12.287074996600587
mine are numerous   8.409562755969604
that there should be a famine   9.709550212374895
there is but one service i can render you and for that i place myself entirely at your orders that is to present or make my friends present you everywhere   4.917683890717132
the queen turned her back and the laughing recommenced   10.088174415532826
at half past seven the retreat was sounded   11.559330787695153
she revives   7.628552384685408
and the good abbé seeing in a dream these glittering walls has indulged in fallacious hopes   10.028081816169145
and the duke swooned   13.10028110076251
you see then d artagnan though princes often are ungrateful god never is   10.553326814452161
another salver passed loaded like the preceding ones   10.7792093896772
at length the light disappeared   20.314923320170593
the expression was imprudent   8.093850993861588
oppressed mortified and persecuted day by day hour by hour minute by minute no person has cared for even observed my sufferings nor have i ever breathed one word on the subject save to yourself   10.855666571165662
very sorry monsieur   15.276613114434802
presently presently cried the latter when you haven t your cloak on   7.659484404631529
d artagnan bowed with respect   11.193115220354208
only i concealed a glass of water which remained after my breakfast thirst having been the chief of my sufferings when i remained forty eight hours without eating or drinking   10.837545674688123
my dear friend said caderousse eat of my bread and take my advice   15.529475170582174
30107m ah said the count in a somewhat forced tone that may be easily explained   15.055179773051503
certainly sir it is not such lords as you are who are allowed to wait in the ante chamber only just now he has a secret conference with monsieur de bruy   8.74943444071087
villefort cast a gloomy look around him   8.582313897337485
that i may have the pleasure of seeing you my little fellow   14.031563810376891
i do not say replied andrea that you never make a good one   15.613134579293298
cried she with tones of thrilling tenderness you are everywhere   11.446710220228523
ah monsieur porthos cried the procurator s wife when she was assured that no one who was a stranger to the population of the locality could either see or hear her ah monsieur porthos you are a great conqueror as it appears   11.716976281801426
you alarm me   12.728796099863354
mademoiselle said franz turning towards valentine unite your efforts with mine to find out the name of the man who made me an orphan at two years of age   7.718627190776174
the young man burst into a laugh   16.38267955408277
a loan nothing more   11.84186164060062
said louise   9.984554903595
sincerely madame   5.429552007440052
her head hung back and her long hair swept the ground   14.703279342385331
is not his name monte cristo   13.105131058484767
hush the curtain is rising   12.822573469294502
by the way what   12.008491806513229
let me look for this letter   11.92314246315052
oh pardon me sir   7.130703219999025
the first feeling that pervaded paris on hearing of the flight to saint germain was that sort of affright which seizes children when they awake in the night and find themselves alone   13.417345746422079
edmond had not heard anyone speak save his jailer for four or five years   14.239899385789773
if replied the duchess with a meaning look you do not say too much against her   11.064263518758803
caderousse was equally restless and uneasy but instead of seeking like m   12.632323276689469
no i grieve not on my own account i shall always find a resource   7.983863936818954
because i have been in such shocking spirits all the evening my friend said the baroness   7.1033566574922125
the porter at the palace was about to close the gates but seeing such a handsome equipage he fancied that it was some visit of importance and the carriage was allowed to pass and to stop beneath the porch   9.930127915811427
have you no friends in paris then monsieur porthos   9.737526492334442
the honorable functionary had scarcely expressed himself thus in that intonation which is peculiar to brigadiers of the gendarmerie when a loud scream accompanied by the violent ringing of a bell resounded through the court of the hotel   6.619971931489656
the man of meung the crowd was caused not by the expectation of a man to be hanged but by the contemplation of a man who was hanged   11.752824706247308
unfortunates who ought to begin with god do not have any hope in him till they have exhausted all other means of deliverance   12.879865619757231
and to marry mademoiselle danglars would be awful   12.377726179577717
and he made a sign to grimaud to bring another bottle   8.535731106071694
the prisoner expected that he would be at no expense that day for like an economical man he had concealed half of his fowl and a piece of the bread in the corner of his cell   11.178051552027764
buckingham saw this apparition in the glass   10.890423415566445
though his coming was announced in a very low tone madame de saint méran arose from her pillow   9.308178377766488
now go   13.026003341277622
is he tall or short   8.763800657634814
go to bed mademoiselle said milady   11.115889306121433
at least it was not i who ever encouraged you in that hope fernand replied mercédès   14.214537607963962
you think so porthos   9.648729978164324
it will be a work of time but those who have begun by crying out down with mazarin   8.434993263447904
de villefort her devotion to the elder dantès   16.10014599086376
but his illness becoming more serious he was forced to stop at villeroy   11.722941320438707
friquet counterfeited surprise and twisting his new cap around in his fingers said it is not astonishing for you to know it monsieur broussel who knows everything   13.635394156386067
awakened in the night by the light of the flames she sprang out of bed wrapped herself in a dressing gown and attempted to escape by the door but the corridor by which she hoped to fly was already a prey to the flames   13.620793393104343
come take them and monte cristo forced the bank notes into his hand   8.604302682612172
ah really said monte cristo in a half stifled voice   13.56663211667147
so the two swords were crossed close to the hilts and as d artagnan stood firm it was his adversary who made the retreating step   12.933532591968635
but both of them had spoken so low that everybody out of respect withdrew several steps so that nobody had heard anything   11.511826823743599
but as planchet awoke in an instant and cried who goes there   14.960921654642014
the pickaxe struck for a moment with a dull sound that drew out of dantès forehead large drops of perspiration   13.023109206551327
and writes me thence   9.854199766618084
she therefore took leave of the abbess and went to bed softly rocked by the ideas of vengeance which the name of kitty had naturally brought to her thoughts   8.978551170747583
the mercer fancied himself already on the high road to honors and fortune   14.15180854958827
have you an exact idea of the amount of your fortune   6.912671871789777
i like that best replied lord de winter laughing   11.331642276466084
oh ungrateful girl that i am cried valentine sobbing i will give up all even my dear old grandfather whom i had nearly forgotten   16.47343093581419
no truly you comfort me   12.750914791198277
no madame i did not say as much as that replied the count with a smile   8.47591898774527
did you hope to escape it because you were four times guilty   12.637226025047017
i did go to monsieur d artagnan s   13.147472743147345
d avrigny returned about eight o clock in the morning   14.23416915404097
said aramis how did you manage it   9.490380817682611
the evening arrived   11.544340734374401
noirtier interposed maximilian is celebrated throughout europe   10.193081314394597
in a moment   12.557683353642151
then everyone could understand the cause of the unearthly pallor in the young girl and the bandit   13.647070723445355
i would not give up this paper if covered with as many gold pieces   10.440265947834018
but in face of the proof i was obliged to acknowledge the truth of the recital   11.219607679963165
she undertook his seduction and succeeded   13.776132629296821
without him i should probably at this moment be a dead fish in the nets at saint cloud for it was a question of nothing less than throwing me into the river   12.249929232853376
facial angle strongly developed magnificent forehead livid complexion black beard sharp and white teeth politeness unexceptionable   14.341715587531766
a week before his return lord de winter died leaving me his sole heir   11.959172607164877
no doubt of it   10.760566512592227
oh as for that i have made inquiries respecting the diligences and steamboats and my calculations are made   10.864537450505923
pray how many men have you on board captain   9.254665125402017
women say those things but never do them   18.44861322763908
the rock yielded rolled over bounded from point to point and finally disappeared in the ocean   15.09583421885192
i will have him come in if you really wish it   13.39863240217963
la ramee followed all these objects with his eyes his alarm every moment increasing   14.837419111566797
the substitution was made so carefully that my spies if i had any could have no suspicion of it   7.973649544571487
a burst of flame rose toward the skies with an explosion like that of a hundred cannon   6.068042304968618
and when added to that he who does the honors is the grandson of henry iv   13.551793987689269
i must know so that i may assist you if there is any chance   13.174478868514752
the young girl turned pale and continued to descend while the stranger and cocles continued to mount the staircase   9.56379788555211
thus we have exchanged ideas and no one has seen us do it   15.049453407959458
d artagnan told me that he had recommended him to your care in parting   15.589521321392095
signor pastrini remained silent a short time   14.294135892564189
i will give you three replied the stranger   11.120020243125404
there it is cried the jesuit   14.813433825721821
his honor s equipage is waiting said mousqueton   12.59300768246617
an instant after dantès entered   14.771503872503597
his eyes were fixed upon those of the mendicant which were lighted up by a lantern   11.222760063096658
but do not be too confident   10.613752416470481
everyone therefore ran to the court   17.30251531177952
and if we appear inclined to defend you they will arrest us with you   9.350413988092026
be at ease felton said lord de winter   8.585591441230985
the only way of doing that was to cause the disappearance of the london executioner   10.273611555008646
you say you desire my mother s good opinion   12.65869258575935
i had at the moment of being ordained a little difficulty with but that would not interest you and i am taking up your valuable time   9.787110449803322
what happened then   7.37569824765713
but and i say it with some pride mercédès god needed me and i lived   17.292327025010525
but listen and you will understand   9.830792140372916
morrel smiled   10.104894166237234
you may go and offer your adieux and mine to madame de saint remy   13.0942562132752
you were looking the other way   9.67023028565539
ah cried monte cristo remembering the abbé s two hiding places   8.236129770659982
that i alone   15.563800227259136
lord who can say monsieur   6.815263729854695
i believe while the countess g takes you for lord ruthven my mother imagines you to be cagliostro or the count saint germain   13.73849923522357
it might alienate my protector   12.711628766949115
for me i well know my sweet girl said d artagnan   11.343706525542913
as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns firing let off happily without other end or aim except to show to the guards the swiss troops and the military who surrounded the palais royal that the people were possessed of arms   12.906820875259587
but the stranger declared that he had nothing to say to m   10.653061818147444
it is incredible how these biscuit soak up wine   14.526117671368391
what do you say maximilian   13.773386038853745
a few drops of the rum restored suspended animation while the friction of his limbs restored their elasticity   13.529896887607205
i have doubtless i am dreaming   16.275230013930233
one does the work while the other stands guard   10.465143954536412
yes who was hanged   11.521451732469531
he said you had engaged to pay seventy pounds if i landed you safe and sound at boulogne or any other port you choose in france   12.360870190687093
be reasonable   16.001219730938672
well i will give it up then said the young woman sighing   10.021112244624579
remember that he will most likely be disguised as a horseman   11.096265953610338
and he thus gained the name of the stoic   10.258122831775458
but tell me well what do you wish to know   11.177160086573833
do you dance count   13.69261825379684
and as the romance of don quixote was then the fashion they said that he was sancho who after having lost one master had found two   9.034454732818908
and where are these four men   14.364221342174606
it is a color very well known in botany but till the present time very rare among horses   15.363004047761475
a candle of coarse tallow on a black table lighted up the handsome and resigned face of the king and that of his faithful retainer far less calm   9.651360411117578
we shall start the evening of the signing of the contract instead of the evening of the wedding that is all   12.885483943766644
we will   13.411952226631923
and one by one the lights in the salon of the rue des tournelles were extinguished   10.731721493361995
there is your money half in bank notes the other half in checks payable to bearer   13.817676925348824
in reality observed albert he seemed to me somewhat eccentric   18.461370040190296
you are a delightful cicerone   15.934271828249974
do you think anything else was to be expected of them   12.841250213832303
perhaps my heart was weaker than the hearts of most men and i suffered more than they would have done in my place   15.901204655097853
in the first place i was four years making the tools i possess and have been two years scraping and digging out earth hard as granite itself   10.15200875405238
my turn said athos himself trembling as the lion trembles at the sight of the serpent my turn   16.592766593116234
but he was soon aroused from these reflections by lubin who uttered loud cries and screamed for help with all his might   13.035541250922234
i should have thought the continual failures you have met with in all your own love affairs might have taught you better by this time   16.8888758696893
asked aramis in the same language   15.94414115150767
we must go and find lord winter   10.066084433002334
porthos my friend you know i am descended on the father s side from the prophets and on the mother s from the sybils and that i only speak in parables and riddles   11.061337660083217
d artagnan who had unceasingly maneuvered to gain this point was not at more than three paces from it   14.473295291883861
cried milady in her turn   12.297585395807397
andrea got into the cab which passed rapidly through the faubourg saint denis along the faubourg saint martin crossed the barrier and threaded its way through the interminable villette   13.50400558114919
if mousqueton were here   7.188443949194678
this is fine   10.040592472738142
go out by the door turn to the right jump into your saddles all will be right   14.290273447027309
to describe the impatience and anxiety of these two friends would be impossible   12.922458045791313
madame said villefort i ask where is m   9.634240268138377
but pass the pen over to monsieur abbé   10.601742157539503
and danglars rose as if he meant to depart   11.934081579328364
athos as the name of raoul was pronounced looked inquisitively at d artagnan in order to see if any curiosity was painted on his face   14.615760568857226
the notary showed me the documents yesterday which will enable us to draw up the contract immediately   9.421277310911192
they went through the alley mounted a flight of stairs and entered the assembly room   13.264288960151399
so   8.973295140781754
very well my dear sir you are the prisoner of a fellow countryman   8.521883312346707
a red mist covered his sight and through this mist he saw a hundred threatening arms stretched over him ready to seize upon him when he fell   12.194694552034399
no less said athos as pale as a corpse   9.46469222147423
if i had been wearing a handkerchief like yours on my head rags on my back and worn out shoes on my feet you would not have known me   16.99833142785102
and now what are we to do and where do you wish me to conduct you   9.726176459024948
there is no one but myself can so execute them that one can not tell the new from the old   11.423608984412695
yes replied he while he did the honors of the supper with much ease and grace yes he is a poor devil who is much devoted to me and does all he can to prove it   7.536214412488711
what a beautiful creature   10.648499218804922
d épinay unlike you bears his misfortune patiently   14.780799232803412
at the worst he would have a companion and captivity that is shared is but half captivity   13.650244053737747
but i heard the noise of breaking furniture   11.74946607015915
i am of monsieur de bassompierre s party   11.568466965168014
are people to be run against without warning   13.587133315915782
you never come to me without conferring pleasure   12.855992828016213
a count and a rich one too eh   18.495187582925883
suppose we wait a while and see what comes of it said he casting a bewildered look on his companion   12.460672935494545
morrel said dantès observing the owner s impatience here is your supercargo m   12.453251984539103
the conditions required that at every hit the man touched should quit the game yielding his turn for the benefit of the adversary who had hit him   12.250899043418377
then the duke put to pistache this difficult question who was the greatest thief in the world   12.99516862539349
tréville s company   11.298563401055311
the bandits looked on with astonishment at this singular conduct until they heard footsteps   22.251871453699856
you were not certain my child was dead and you buried it   7.239273482730647
i have placed reliance upon you my friend   13.752487168839913

50223m ah yes   18.02953352883047
you met him at a dinner party at my house and you introduced yourself at his house   15.309083449011045
yes but you have not this little staircase said monte cristo opening a door concealed by the drapery   17.322981321898148
this sir is all i can tell you and you see how uninteresting it is   5.57437590347967
that by an infamous treaty you have sold me for two hundred thousand pounds to parliament   12.429424871588353
at the fifth stroke the door opened and lord wilmore appeared   16.701370081059217
buckingham reflected that the young man coming from lord de winter undoubtedly spoke in his name and softened   9.95360079749116
it was quite evident by her manner that her uneasiness was not feigned   8.02205095444766
a burning fire a red hot iron the iron of the executioner was imprinted on my shoulder   15.10296900405535
no it has been stolen from you   14.714432843344358
grimaud had every quality that could attract a man on duty who wishes to have a deputy   11.698623082272462
and you did not awaken me   14.686188958329389
chapter 24   13.114206180948454
will you return to the salon   12.851027670452874
edmond shuddered when he heard the painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along   8.990722267704866
now what are we to do with you   15.362744569824436
in short said d artagnan this has been the will of god   11.565686543817234
i had three two of whom have left paris to go i know not where   12.413249760353288
tell him also what you have just told me that mazarin has placed me in the pavilion of the orangery in order to make me a visit and assure him that i shall take advantage of this honor he proposes to accord to me to obtain from him some amelioration of our captivity   14.710829589412048
look well at his right hand on which he has a large wound   10.6182232332713
the duchess smiled half tenderly half ironically   5.978586569693119
they are not like that unbelieving porthos who must see and touch before he will believe   16.69393827403684
if all the prisoners took it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues and their guardians consented to accompany them they would have a capital chance of escaping   12.219327742570641
he made morrel wait in the antechamber although he had no one with him for the simple reason that the king s procureur always makes everyone wait and after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers he ordered m   10.800922500223164
scattering money round about him as heaven sprinkles rain   12.47634526924311
was he not a fine looking man   6.929959948745528
that of aramis uneasiness   8.904818338306427
unhappily those times are past   11.995726107271032
30275m i sleep soundly like a child   7.633877228959387
they belong to the regiment that was at lens which the prince assigned to the cardinal   10.289674539332967

draw up this note for us aramis   10.838031203469074
now speaking without any exaggeration is your mother really so very much averse to this marriage   10.533624498888829
on leaving the chamber danglars who had shown violent marks of agitation during the sitting and been more bitter than ever against the ministry re entered his carriage and told the coachman to drive to the avenue des champs élysées no   14.093792432970385
now he is turning   9.39443497350904
exclaimed the king to fight   13.00771698947332
with more of mildness than severity   6.484700525962783
my father himself does not know who this president was and if he knows he can not tell you   12.376047347070628
his lips were straight and so thin that as they closed they were drawn in over the teeth   12.119716770549946
what number was it that rang   8.236455606802046
and when she finally returned did she bring that casket with her   12.102326203341299
milady perceived a bed   10.748326032233926
the executioner took her up in his arms and was carrying her toward the boat   13.942228050821157
as for me i have almost forgotten the little latin i have ever known   9.601967952730764
monsieur is not that the barrel of a musket which glitters yonder   10.207732167987041
at least a year   11.794958992311503
willingly answered the duke give me the pie   12.242422633952344
it is the face of the count of monte cristo   9.98694709263649
i know no one in paris morrel on whom i could confer that honor besides you and your brother emmanuel   14.679757984112605
the shadow of a cloud passed over aramis s face as quickly as that which in august passes over the field of grain   16.46611653931776
he owed me for the councillor the pettifogger   8.712699046937072
it may be remembered that it was the hat and cloak belonging to monsieur de gondy s coachman   14.752488695287134
a large round rock placed solidly on its base was the only spot to which they seemed to lead   7.948511883466209
but at each effort he fell back moaning and turning pale   8.225079919985184
murmured athos thinking of d artagnan and porthos   10.048444371472918
you may become equal to monsieur de voiture and monsieur de benserade   5.139499823188996
i shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public and a sweet kiss in private   16.447080024127295
at last d avrigny slowly uttered these words she is still alive   8.010438126617041
ours egad   17.29036083722053
ck from the small   14.091950758082847
you have recalled one of the most agreeable recollections of my youth   14.222712983003111
this was simply because he lived in the hôtel   8.260452210345075
never sell it   13.371691312410961
this hurt is just the fellow of the one i had on the road to amiens   5.253292845162668
what could they desire beyond their liberty   10.52814783888305
alas alas murmured he if the procureur himself had been at marseilles i should have been ruined   13.802012938351533
i re enter it   12.005135862369881
and d artagnan set the example   10.095663528972782
cried the friends tis then useless our seeing monsieur the coadjutor this evening said aramis so we give it up   12.119166126773639
in the country   16.378568710084217
to day this morning   9.110542820897916
well listen my dear aramis said d artagnan   13.916021267384359
is not his name andrea   18.546831243463444
he sought to tread water in order to rest himself   12.878234738871384
exclaimed the young man hastily   5.9521125955991625
in a fortnight the fellow will be marshal of france   13.660494621297207
and franz abandoned himself to that mute reverie into which we always sink when smoking excellent tobacco which seems to remove with its fume all the troubles of the mind and to give the smoker in exchange all the visions of the soul   15.790162040419622
he was we repeat handsome young and bold   16.632855575575956
planchet obtained from rochefort the rank of sergeant in the piedmont regiment   10.620205113543697
if he lays his hand on the boat s edge i will cut it off regicide that he is   11.956254684902111
de tréville being paid the pensive d artagnan took the longest way homeward   12.777662040438216
said the countess without replying to the question   11.52882086735136
morrel took her in his arms as if to defend her from some unknown danger   11.80863157902719
but you ll die of hunger said the patron   8.09322024006213
picture to yourself a pretty coach house at the right hand side where the ladders are kept   11.8225215511086
i will not make you a slave to your filial piety   10.065436968993549
begone if you do not desire to see me dash my head against that wall before your eyes   15.578190960746115
he hastened to cleave his way through them to see if he had not lost his strength   12.791756248216982
probabilities will not suffice only facts will justify a deadly combat with a friend   14.13934435464759
just as they were sitting down to table m   5.174426886663699
it is too late   13.7359263892961
what you say is absurd and i can not see why m   10.646770194058801
major cavalcanti a worthy patrician of lucca a descendant of the cavalcanti of florence continued monte cristo reading aloud possessing an income of half a million   10.366388341695997
never mind replied villefort   13.893610837431279
uneasiness took possession of the tender constant heart of athos and fearful forecasts were the torment of the impulsive aramis   13.450977362712628
he will come and visit the comte de la fere   8.086583538952006
but how comes the diamond in your possession sir   9.379826564127724
i tell you that with that wretched sum continued andrea i could obtain a coat and a room in which to receive the illustrious visitor i am daily expecting   11.60742090629786
he commanded a retreat which began step by step foot by foot   16.957117025193128
albert bowed to madame danglars and advanced towards madame de villefort whose lips opened as he approached   6.6221839395663995
on the seventh of january between seven and eight hundred tradesmen had assembled in paris to discuss a new tax which was to be levied on house property   13.430811321925924
it will be well employed i hope   6.70207928196429
barcelona has risen in his favor   15.332071831177458
let us take some heed of the welfare of her dear buckingham   6.561680047282364
what aramis says is very sensible replied athos   12.907904791704361
follow me monsieur said mazarin   14.665902696678849
monte cristo uttered the last words with so much meaning that morrel starting up cried out you know of whom i speak count do you not   10.897196036090786
demanded d artagnan in his turn   13.622453290850096
but be easy no blood will flow   18.596873039893588
the meeting after mercédès had left monte cristo he fell into profound gloom   10.74132330675322
it signifies little said mazarin when he was alone   9.739925017020688
so much the better said d artagnan   10.556823986035633
ten minutes sufficed for their defeat and d artagnan remained master of the field of battle   10.206686483948022
de villefort only replied by offering his arm to his daughter   11.121867646627823
ah i recollect you asked for a place at my window   12.467883151007186
then they knelt on each side of the grave and said the prayers of the dead   14.351434781415488
the major seated himself therefore by the side of danglars who was more and more charmed with the ideas of order and economy which ruled this man and yet who being able to allow his son 60 000 francs a year might be supposed to possess a fortune of 500 000 or 600 000 livres   12.478871727412718
we were then convinced my friend and i that there was some error of which we were the victims and that an explanation was called for between his eminence and ourselves   10.885266501071994
d artagnan passed to the head of the column and leaving his friends under the guard of porthos went straight to harrison who recognized him as having met him at cromwell s and received him as politely as a man of his breeding and disposition could   17.317260310784402
he saw two shadows approach his bed a third remaining at the door with a torch in its hand   16.97278408961882
there is one in particular which he prefers in his journeys large enough to hold all the world   11.823381664204462
ah my child my poor child   8.66438249350633
he examined him and found him sound and without blemish   12.446048802473854
in the meantime the fugitives had returned to the first room where they took counsel together   10.18686926116386
morrel said he again turning his quid as for that as for what   10.6292099541246
and the next moment luigi vampa appeared before danglars   15.205707465325247
interrupted buckingham   16.301830896604557
yes she is come back and is going to commit some fresh folly or another   15.712578950620557
but it was not the gloomy horizon of vague alarms and which he had seen before he slept but a blue transparent unbounded horizon with all the blue of the ocean all the spangles of the sun all the perfumes of the summer breeze   15.69408274946957
morrel looked around uneasily   11.078518536626229
command me sir what am i to do   11.517506133095424
knew all and that the cardinal had persuaded him to employ this long dissimulation of seven or eight days which likewise was characteristic   15.741834867540314
and they called château renaud s attention to him   11.704732250325629
d artagnan freely applying his spurs was in advance of porthos two feet at the most   10.998764387652692
but a glance from the worthy broussel who in the midst of it all did not lose his presence of mind checked this foolhardy action of despair   9.426796866010225
let us proceed   6.832338042561111
you are not making any mistake are you   9.005431548764879
if i am to remain here permanently as monsieur mazarin has kindly given me to understand i must provide myself with a diversion for my old age i must turn gourmand   13.172888987877027
bring the prisoner in again said the cardinal   13.843666019677508
and what did the letter contain   18.296180639694093
these 3 000 francs are enormous and i intend building upon this foundation a miraculous certainty for the future   13.385229860202683
i beg of your majesty then said athos calmly and not replying to mazarin to quash these arrests of messieurs d artagnan and du vallon   7.15220703475996
are the half of the sum mother   13.502241071413252
they unsheathe and that s all that is said   14.36893628046391
i might as well say count benedetto   13.080751034769866
if you were a duchess a marchioness or a countess it would be quite a different thing   16.206683535687148
and a large sum   10.371014119566457
asked the king eagerly   11.127259874189697
i have done this and am monsieur with great respect your very humble and obedient servant godeau purveyor of the musketeers that s all well   14.421915121082641
dantès himself only knew that which personally concerned him for he never beheld again the five persons i have named to you or heard mention of anyone of them   9.354796376961286
i am the only man in the world having the right to say to you morrel your father s son shall not die today   12.060545684207126
bonacieux what is that noise   11.151874541870905
hasten reverend sir hasten   10.325463923998885
a hundred thousand francs for a fowl   16.50845458187529
my dear d artagnan said he if you please we will join our friends   11.834606641730849
someone will come   11.6196154123108
i come to congratulate you   11.175085890671383
but said andrea why do you not act on the advice you gave me   12.700764028630775
name it sir i beg   11.425023174970343
still the presence of monte cristo at such an hour his mysterious fanciful and extraordinary entrance into her room through the wall might well seem impossibilities to her shattered reason   13.453590478369758
you have spared me yet of all those who have fallen under your vengeance i was the most guilty   7.866536777883717
you have your servant s clothes on you therefore keep a servant   11.566779751605692
three of them were overwhelmed and disabled by numerous assailants   17.692209326733263
he rang so violently that the porter was alarmed   13.976097866460305
besides in addition to the pioneers there are four soldiers and a brigadier armed with muskets   12.385174858533615
still it must have been many years in use for it was thickly covered with a coating of soot   10.840441824004206
it is well madame said mazarin   4.6956546895446625
ah a thousand thanks count for not having forgotten your promise   9.480564659963765
the accuracy of the aim had first given him the idea that a special weapon had been employed   13.545874258512903
d artagnan fought three times with rochefort and wounded him three times   12.849764511184498
he grew deadly pale placed his hand upon his heart which was breaking and at once perceived all the treachery   13.539286287180856
it is men whom i should hold responsible and i will hold them responsible   18.280989014176384
well said he friend what matters the regiment of guards to us and art thou not mad to make such a disturbance   12.550032585900428
the young man knelt down   3.9687067787941253
said athos exchanging a smile with d artagnan and aramis it is very clear you acted nobly with regard to the poor lad   13.074958259416617
no my dear fellow   11.385670468090261
he received yesterday a message from the prince de condé   18.347329320218876
de villefort s is that there is an assassin in the house   10.351964502798786
in one hour after the ordinance was published in london that no vessel bound for france should leave port not even the packet boat with letters   13.635144549528178
and milady after having lost the first trick was not willing to lose the second   9.214961232270726
i salute you marie michon to this letter was added an order conceived in these terms at the louvre august 10 1628 the superior of the convent of béthune will place in the hands of the person who shall present this note to her the novice who entered the convent upon my recommendation and under my patronage   12.161302383183969
his first remark on entering was you know sir i do not speak french   13.097971057294236
the vessel was very old to risk that said the englishman   12.12659916100754
monsieur said the count to albert i do not ask you to accompany me to my house as i can only show you a habitation fitted up in a hurry and i have as you know a reputation to keep up as regards not being taken by surprise   12.871558947457926
ah said the count negligently looking attentively at morcerf is there not something like an execution upon the piazza del popolo   17.113305168783988
and if they do cut me in quarters be assured that not a morsel of me will speak   9.760302775811656
porthos and aramis resumed their places by the stovepipe   14.772339805467322
the siege of la rochelle chapter xlii   12.753479270795946
said he read   12.689903636938281
but the knee of mme   12.279393492027875
then all seemed to fade away and become confused before his eyes like the last shadows of the magic lantern before it is extinguished and he was again in the chamber of statues lighted only by one of those pale and antique lamps which watch in the dead of the night over the sleep of pleasure   14.08189890216209
the soldier returned and felton gave him back his weapon   18.422523668074405
place yourself close to the coach door on the right   11.652125387239249
sir said villefort in the squeaky tone assumed by magistrates in their oratorical periods and of which they can not or will not divest themselves in society sir the signal service which you yesterday rendered to my wife and son has made it a duty for me to offer you my thanks   10.64156269927981
good day said he   11.957523414957944
for himself he had no doubt she was a victim of the cardinal s vengeance   15.109730952802401
my god yes gave that is the word said porthos   13.81146598925511
he will be one sooner or later   13.184656493684397
then he had run to the train impetuous as a man who is excited by revenge and full of confidence as are those whom god blinds he had set fire to the wick of nitre   14.978709528303906
yes i have replied franz   15.368993211418692
well said morcerf i may as well be magnanimous and tear myself away to forward your wishes   14.52893312839037
when the wind of adversity began to blow upon the housekeeping of the rue des fossoyeurs that is to say when the forty pistoles of king louis xiii   14.361948060744393
i shall be most grateful monsieur if you will at some future time renew your offer but i have been flattered with the hope of being introduced to the countess and i will therefore wait   17.40690875861344
dantès held down his head that the other might not see how joy at the thought of having a companion outweighed the sympathy he felt for the failure of the abbé s plans   9.53956438876575
something more terrible more fatal more alarming for us the child was perhaps alive and the assassin may have saved it   10.166353959498743
speak if you please said mazarin   9.486121165509093
your honor in the library of the chateau of bracieux there are a lot of books of travels   7.883925671933417
the houses today so smiling and animated were on that night dark mute and closed   12.079593267858417
said the young man i meet you then at last   13.47858734850406
i have this one safe   9.774137276799562
then a hundred steps from the village he took a narrow road hidden at the bottom of the valley   13.490659093703679
good natured confiding and forgiving as i had been i became revengeful cunning and wicked or rather immovable as fate   14.884980802301016
viscount your countenance your goodness and your courage incline me toward you   16.57845259079821
robert duly challenged the prince of granada   16.913675014454014
why the devil   11.272376867066122
all three set off on their walk mazarin taking the middle alley and the friends the side ones   13.854688672008159
she repeated   10.977315578864566
when i say one spoonful i began by one now i take four   13.97483298468012
when he was only eleven he chose his companions from among the young men of eighteen or twenty the worst characters in bastia or indeed in corsica and they had already for some mischievous pranks been several times threatened with a prosecution   17.25209364867763
if on the contrary he refuses to do so it will then be quite time enough to admit two strangers into your secret   7.5945970749685525
morrel had returned to his bedchamber which he was only this moment quitting   10.912548935113524
when i am rich i will order a statue of chance from klagmann or marochetti   16.307867429607974
milady remained silent   12.658271697760819
they wish for secrecy since we are to converse in a private room   16.207175778714856
take some then and come back immediately   8.293140716884963
stop cried athos extending his hand to one of the grated windows by which the room was lighted   9.596041709307588
but felton that s another thing   10.77862080316542
gentlemen you see said the duke to those present who dared not even smile that it is the illustrious coxcomb who is the greatest thief in the world   9.320830944751103
he approached the doctor and seizing his arm valentine said he it is valentine s turn   10.753086993902896
this was the first time morrel had ever so spoken but he said it in a tone of paternal kindness and julie did not dare to disobey   13.5290790525487
oh no he exclaimed not die now after having lived and suffered so long and so much   9.112223004195995
artless as she was the young girl knew that this was an opportunity to leave and besides madame de villefort came to her assistance   14.021080940770581
murmured raoul   10.820823116082094
all the world is wicked   9.118225275196576
who among the persons here assembled answers to the name of edmond dantès   15.563455747461912
in which we hear tidings of aramis   12.621119163070208
they had not long to wait for an answer   6.580838161205718
antoine at paris where his owner sold him for three crowns which was a very good price considering that d artagnan had ridden him hard during the last stage   11.868762758427946
name to me such of your workmen as you need and point out the tools they must bring   11.289171526697219
mousqueton smiled disdainfully   13.250933163565152
danglars did not lose one pang that fernand endured   9.648267976030375
are you not the soldier fernand who deserted on the eve of the battle of waterloo   11.396238065995915
mazarin made a grimace which was quite indescribable and then turned to d artagnan   14.246880370385021
another flash illuminated all around them   10.998779442963944
but pardon said d artagnan with the most charming smile and putting his hand on the young man s shoulder if the illustrious general oliver cromwell has disposed of our prisoners in your favour he has of course made that act of donation in writing   17.44621260502084
she made it her business therefore to amuse the good abbess with the worldly practices of the court of france mixed with the eccentric pursuits of the king   11.092034574812205
the white flag morbleu   9.285501536614968
albert bathed took his supper and went to bed   11.850018247365462
the stranger advanced slowly and as he advanced after entering into the circle of light projected by the lamp milady involuntarily drew back   19.716749021391777
i must learn where we are going   10.707240213102082
but first listen to the history of this paper   16.158723853679632
from this point everything was a blank to dantès he knew nothing more not even the length of time he had been imprisoned   8.525410785181421
asked danglars carelessly   13.092840406081928
what is her brother in law s name   12.4479706629905
if we should meet a little troop of enemies equal or even superior in number to our own shall we charge them raoul   6.923895746565442
i must not be cast down by the discovery that i have been deceived   12.735379877645547
albert looked at her with curiosity for she had not yet related what he most desired to know how she had become the slave of the count   13.61162561748818
replied anne with queen like dignity extending toward the open coffer an arm despite the lapse of years still beautiful   12.059963224953608
your daughter will be married tomorrow if not today in a week if not tomorrow   16.146622205485183
said milady with the utmost ingenuousness   12.126393504070919
albert soon left her ordered his horses and having arranged his toilet drove to the champs élysées to the house of monte cristo   5.4933609116384305
the man in the mask   14.282961580393254
but the queen was firm   8.847635386100475
it is done   13.418934626034856
speak gentlemen said the prince saluting them   14.481430792461873
but the king is asleep   13.565110035645292
the prince is with them ah   13.843398030710961
meanwhile emmanuel in a broken voice said to the count oh count how could you hearing us so often speak of our unknown benefactor seeing us pay such homage of gratitude and adoration to his memory how could you continue so long without discovering yourself to us   10.869002271376347
0165m mercédès was left alone face to face with the vast plain that had never seemed so barren and the sea that had never seemed so vast   13.006148565392209
franz and debray exchanged some words in a whisper and morrel rejoiced at this unexpected incident went to fetch the count who was walking in a retired path with emmanuel   14.477361105758284
oh i need only one of them for the time being   11.247724614208021
well this waistcoat was discovered today covered with blood and with a hole over the heart   9.636947038547873
don t disturb yourself julie said he   13.606587246980075
you left it somewhere then in the meantime   14.983852806353536
yes said aramis   9.981694995305213
danglars watched these preparations and his mouth watered   11.70910097811945
i have four harriers which are considered the swiftest in the county and a pack of hounds which are unequalled for twenty leagues around   12.008669604151564
then monsieur is satisfied   11.845600661004545
it is a very pretty name and the adventures of the gentleman of that name amused me very much in my youth i must confess   14.628811701830134
if so let dinner be served in her apartments   10.259885312352917
well sir really if like you i had nothing else to do i should seek a more amusing occupation   15.338434368635593
in the meantime there is bread water and fresh straw   10.831450237876814
what is death for me   10.680909055262847
to be a baron   13.31196139095616
there is a poison which destroys life almost without leaving any perceptible traces   14.98402966767981
having arrived before the pont du gard the horse stopped but whether for his own pleasure or that of his rider would have been difficult to say   10.927022155171837
athos followed them then porthos then aramis   15.222070834658988
true interrupted the young man i had not looked upon it in that light   8.093793097148279
yes true as gospel said d artagnan   12.153866313884993
there i am ahead of you   9.50625250135758
and throwing on one side the large kid gloves tried on at first as belonging to the uniform he put on others of silk only   10.585775721048714
these twenty millions are concealed in my grotto at monte cristo of which bertuccio knows the secret   17.132896765666356
maximilian s avowal at the same moment m   6.56390847383519
about seven in the morning andrea was awakened by a ray of sunlight which played warm and brilliant upon his face   12.644004894218659
i again reminded her that you were a friend and that she need not conceal anything from you   9.878235023457263
i only fear one thing   13.429722370500055
it is desirable i should know the real cause   12.669271244661752
the foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country other than the united states   12.322807148734556
and wherefore should they do so   8.738866637491018
he then divided the walls of his room into compartments and dedicated each of these compartments to some incident in mazarin s life   11.485951811083279
said nanette   10.971929081778853
look said d artagnan day is declining   12.422325006014061
mazarin turned the lock of a double door on the threshold of which they found athos ready to receive his illustrious guests according to the notice comminges had given him   11.998700078285973
i am no longer surprised at my detention murmured dantès since my only protector is removed   11.655788063091165
these horsemen whoever they might be had halted there   10.07268443295844
then said aramis this falls out very well   15.332044989585548
beauchamp and château renaud exchanged looks of astonishment   11.326891795290058
cavalcanti senior then the baroness afterwards the future couple as they are styled in the abominable phraseology of legal documents   14.129288151661788
nevertheless knowing the weakness of her husband and more particularly his cupidity she did not despair of bringing him round to her purpose   9.799184264675967
as for me i must look after the anchoring and dress the ship in mourning   8.262554239238973
andrea cavalcanti the count of monte cristo entered the adjoining room which baptistin had designated as the drawing room and found there a young man of graceful demeanor and elegant appearance who had arrived in a cab about half an hour previously   14.810778279261193
the two men in black who guessed d artagnan s meaning darted at him a glance which might have been thought threatening   13.260555532396035
cried out several voices deceived by the blue ribbon and chestnut horse of winter   15.439252882425563
if anything happens to us we shall blame you for it   16.860188917487612
he then returned to the captain said a few words to him and as if from that moment the vessel was under his command he ordered a maneuver which the crew executed immediately   8.908581910600528
can you tell us where we can obtain a sight of the piazza del popolo   13.590260028987192
no object affects me   13.753406336307368
immediately the aldermen clothed in their cloth robes and preceded by six sergeants each holding a flambeau in his hand went to attend upon the king whom they met on the steps where the provost of the merchants made him the speech of welcome a compliment to which his majesty replied with an apology for coming so late laying the blame upon the cardinal who had detained him till eleven o clock talking of affairs of state   12.592281807307815
d artagnan went instantly to the hay dealer and bargained with him for a hundred and fifty trusses of straw which he obtained at the rate of three pistoles each   10.031855676270641
that is my failing a capital failing i admit   9.651402179264462
reverend sir since you know everything you know it was not i it was la carconte   14.899766980520194
rochefort called him his friend his dear bonacieux and never ceased telling him that the cardinal had a great respect for him   15.379051769372051
and who wishes to speak with me   7.192296683633167
adieu raoul said the count   17.42928319972896
the heart breaks when after having been elated by flattering hopes it sees all its illusions destroyed   5.412870075133558
well then how am i free   12.746378119043765
de villefort held a high position in the magistracy and maintained his eminence like a harlay or a molé   12.061687621811348
in your case it would be a crime   15.158372645257336
aramis started back and drew his   8.240112597512422
but i perfectly remember that falling into the error which others had entertained respecting me you consulted me as to the health of mademoiselle de villefort   7.914467986752209
at the sight of this slaughter and devastation i became terrified not for myself for i a simple corsican fisherman had nothing to fear   8.90488202618278
then after half an hour you can go away in your turn   11.822465879617019
monsieur d artagnan has cruelly insulted me said milady in a hollow tone   12.03821591248765
if i am a prisoner what crime have i committed   9.690907310040389
i am manifestly protected in a most wonderful but most terrible manner said he   15.89713174700054
in the evening they separated the count of san felice s flock from those of baron cervetri and the children returned to their respective farms promising to meet the next morning   14.7316630270547
now this is the first part of this precious manuscript which we offer to our readers restoring it to the title which belongs to it and entering into an engagement that if of which we have no doubt this first part should obtain the success it merits we will publish the second immediately   9.305847186148089
you disturb me   8.600381352804906
i beg your pardon madame   9.509155026275433
although he professes to be my enemy i have sympathy for him and if he is reasonable perhaps we shall arrange matters   4.964196932518165
i have not forgotten all i owe thee   15.073208455789919
it seemed to him that thus he better guarded the unfinished opening   4.811605693440633
italy sinbad the sailor chapter 32   15.106932619503642
there were three candles alight each of which burnt before a window one looking upon the city the other upon the palais royal and a third upon the rue saint denis   18.820189335376632
mousqueton duly instructed was put at the head of this sudden and new business   12.18560119145563
asked morrel with his open laugh   14.998277095609037
valentine looked at m   11.644644716495321
in the most simple and natural manner possible   12.466418671733845
grimaud had a stout short picard cob which cost three hundred livres   13.841514858495504
milady let her head sink as if crushed by this sentence   10.575789494400157
the count felt his heart beat more rapidly   8.582288643772095
where for   9.46270117606364
at daybreak d artagnan entered the chamber and demanded what was to be done   12.6556501910405
are not you the person who brought me a letter inquired franz from the viscount of morcerf   10.790498426711299
but supposing he doesn t mount   14.840112617333904
and this time the tone and manner in which the command was given betokened such growing hostility that the two young men perceived for the first time that the mandate was addressed to them   14.211720105663755
but what are we to do   10.086591679500481
speak said athos   9.426890190663903
exclaimed anne following the train of her own thoughts on such occasions one regrets paris   14.651052961517088
i will prove it to you beyond a doubt   8.498363823720888
call an officer of justice he said   10.619774254428949
re echoed athos   11.172583486569165
there was no great cunning necessary   8.96242015595953
her hands and arms were of surpassing beauty all the poets of the time singing them as incomparable   9.518666783232346
well sir and what then   13.000997755967644
then quitting the grotto he replaced the stone heaping on it broken masses of rocks and rough fragments of crumbling granite filling the interstices with earth into which he deftly inserted rapidly growing plants such as the wild myrtle and flowering thorn then carefully watering these new plantations he scrupulously effaced every trace of footsteps leaving the approach to the cavern as savage looking and untrodden as he had found it   17.215475422671165
what was all that to scarron   7.0076437656430235
the contract was read during a profound silence   14.482695745965735
his heart was in a fair way of petrifying in his bosom   7.8653777616692
i shall be happy to do so   12.377669261988514
this answer was too clear to permit of any mistake as to his sentiments   13.467085872159732
the sentinel at the gate refused even to let them pass and called his sergeant   9.576279820777813
at this name the count who had hitherto saluted everyone with courtesy but at the same time with coldness and formality stepped a pace forward and a slight tinge of red colored his pale cheeks   8.850654520245413
do you not remember   8.130249617421205
for you have become pale in your turn   7.337013110928007
the child was born was given to me motionless breathless voiceless   17.250086943551565
and the monk   6.616670195417976
ah said morcerf i see you are a stickler for forms my dear sir and you would remind me that the ceremonial rites should not be omitted   5.701985148021088
in the first case i shall leave directly and in the second i shall wait till i am of age which will be in about ten months   11.323304688773844
meanwhile sir watch always watch carefully for perhaps the evil may not stop here   13.781037135904928
without remorse said he   13.091059778671072
as however he did not fall as he did not declare himself conquered but only broke away toward the hôtel of m   14.836489657424275
oh that is different cried the abbé   9.46744885946728
this gun had an excellent barrel made at brescia and carrying a ball with the precision of an english rifle   12.886381237966871
my child exclaimed the old lady sharply let us hear none of the conventional objections that deter weak minds from preparing for the future   16.4107399561555
the owner of the pharaon and patron of dantès   13.618715489355585
he sees me in despair and pretends he can not understand me   10.251280218627267
the scotch he exclaimed the scotch i called my faithful to whom i trusted myself when i could have fled to oxford   13.149248829891548
asked the young lieutenant   13.508865965936966
noirtier tenderly loves his granddaughter mademoiselle de villefort   10.67076854102958
you are warned vicomte   10.522840626967103
danglars retreated a few steps   16.711218690698054
planchet is brave and shrewd   12.845970225196572
athos now descended the ladder in his turn without losing sight of the young man   15.110434356874826
pronounced the famous i have been almost obliged to wait   11.843062946601664
his confidential valet appeared   12.956408696914172
aim at this command the mountain of populace thinned so suddenly that d artagnan could not repress a burst of homeric laughter   8.266616961755503
it was the first time the hand of franz had come in contact with that of the mysterious individual before him and unconsciously he shuddered at its touch for it felt cold and icy as that of a corpse   5.82656582843501
the servant understood them   10.65249827734175
and should they wish it you will warn me   9.750905609857023
the hesitation created some suspicion in the three friends and athos advancing a few paces in front of the others cried in a firm voice who goes there   14.48862371152185
you will wait for me then   12.404331688612345
ah said morcerf there goes a happy man   11.536489678971181
sir replied the young man honest men are not to be paid with such coin   12.565402294613289
when i say i want i mean the queen wants them   16.439028053981808
listen said she   9.603227137034954
no in truth   14.487418268367804
milady with a rapid gesture opened her robe tore the cambric that covered her bosom and red with feigned anger and simulated shame showed the young man the ineffaceable impression which dishonored that beautiful shoulder   10.680810196373326
repeated bertuccio   11.88824623599194
d avrigny about the death of m   12.532360673059634
we must joke with the guards we must gain the good will of the soldiers since we can t corrupt them   13.370699106257165
shall i give you a line for the vicar of st   17.146475250741776
the count pretends i have not him to thank   5.150028225446482
i wished it to do so   10.435975823528306
he ran without stopping from the rue férou to the rue de vaugirard   12.088258284763482
and philip urged by his own curiosity entered the gallery   11.984295834177349
it is useless for you to say so count   8.124832146524241
his manners are admirable said the countess at least as far as i could judge in the few minutes he remained here   5.1676666878942985
no she is a bordeaux vessel la gironde   10.606321580768427
you will go to buckingham in my behalf and you will tell him i am acquainted with all the preparations he has made   10.343613178211436
but should it be too tight never mind you can wear the breastplate and the hat with the red feathers   11.42684417344034
during the five years of this seclusion which would have improved and matured the intellect of any other man m   14.388137157146804
no certainly replied planchet rather astonished at the unexpected honor conferred upon him   8.32395143773577
i mean that my friends officers in the guards and mousquetaires came to keep me company and we passed the night in feasting drinking dicing   6.869287549361125
then when the latter appeared dangerous to me i entered as i have now done and substituted in the place of the poison a healthful draught   10.713545975730346
and as she is not in bad odor at court she may perhaps on some future day speak a word that will not prove useless to you   10.802414067998129
here monseigneur said aramis is the treaty proposed by the deputation of frondeurs   12.426148704186694
they are veritable sponges   11.616308502573764
château renaud and albert looked at each other with amazement   13.422866151399491
he is a charming young man said monte cristo and i felt a lively interest in him the very first evening of my introduction when i met him in search of a supper and prevailed upon him to accept a portion of mine   11.826319127959424
such was the fashion of the day   15.220636036512175
you understand baron my grandfather wishes you to read this paper said valentine   5.048269862633146
dantès in his cell heard the noise of preparation sounds that at the depth where he lay would have been inaudible to any but the ear of a prisoner who could hear the splash of the drop of water that every hour fell from the roof of his dungeon   7.648162026114531
he made a sign for grimaud to bring a glass for d artagnan and grimaud obeyed as usual   9.99176191643869
and this gentleman being disengaged takes to the service willingly   13.376444108338791
once upon a time well go on   14.45418249187932
of the french academy   13.188034993622724
i comprehend now   7.070544353689875
cried d artagnan a horrible suspicion crosses my mind   13.599558451475305
ejaculated porthos   11.675972929261961
noirtier said d avrigny   12.43898380456807
but it behooved us to find it   8.411158465987414
so there is said d artagnan and he read we conceal the place where we are dear friends knowing your brotherly affection and that you would come and die with us were we to reveal it   13.219186330757802
let her then exhaust her vengeance on me alone   11.960367470908428
at least so my cashier tells me   12.840488709918251
penelon turned to his companions and exchanged a few words with them   17.904880347715636
i speak as i can   10.51931375833666
will the queen deign to follow my advice   13.065553136596037
but no i found nothing though i had made a hole twice as large as the first   12.7367000106325
a woman about six months after came to claim it with the other half of the napkin   13.429312762901892
i must divert my attention   15.179835450863898
he found it firm solid and compact enough to bear any weight   18.209506481834097
i am half an hour in advance of them an hour perhaps   11.520580701162267
i know that you were one of them my uncle and that you cried louder than the others she must die   15.084658499570367
this was to go himself to m   11.602187692883493
the pope the life of a man   9.783785376864763
he is my steward replied porthos   6.381933318851527
have patience   11.390936047629992
that is true but we then only risked our pistoles   15.727361789805634
he threw his arms around her neck   10.380461430143388
yes there is something i wish to see   13.342141197151015
well this man was making signs to another at my left and turning around i recognized the honest grimaud   12.017040858587428
the game began   10.567265494178656
how is it possible for anyone to do that   12.145945943137825
remember that i write to you now to repeat how much affection for you i still cherish   14.414175092288366
the servant went out but returned almost immediately   14.582032920048183
and that you should fail me   12.278328410515911
she had revived but could scarcely move or speak so shaken was her frame by the attack   8.608280589640922
you know that i am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced captain in the service   9.603522332827012
but no   15.094300524903952
but that has nothing to do with it   9.367705052240991
if they did not speak of me i am sure they thought about me and i am in despair   9.839295286709737
is it my fault that your father has dishonored himself   8.260962813389387
has he not all the tricks of a demon at his command   9.564843616707218
but i know neither the street nor the number   13.260627201849942
cried one of the ladies   8.644876084133585
for mercy s sake then what would you call robespierre   8.682062650305673
going straight towards him he propounded a variety of questions on different subjects carefully watching the man s countenance as he did so   10.04254541670365
and if there is a bottle of wine in the town let mousqueton buy it   11.874577261718304
the general remark is oh it can not be expected that one of so stern a character as m   15.873298159125923
his threat completed the intimidation of the host   9.26791637688072
they waited ten minutes and then his lordship began to fear aramis was not coming to join them   9.344156201658485
be easy monsieur said planchet   13.41584881352882
the two doors before mentioned were in the middle of this wall and enclosed the villefort and saint méran coffins   9.41099638386859
he found a young shepherd watching his flock   12.106162096694252
de villefort had taken   12.25574434850296
she resists   12.332332946486359
you are adorable madame   16.995012085930682
but by way of rewarding your honesty i give you another double napoleon that you may drink to my health and be able to ask your messmates to join you   11.5669306679115
it was evident that his legs refused to support him   12.023553967318726
i will not forget you   14.614215903621085
i think madame danglars again requires your bottle he said   14.825641137521467
all our servants are busy discussing the grand affair   14.924025770708184
well said monte cristo in an indifferent tone you will do as you please count for you are the master of your own actions and are the person most concerned in the matter but if i were you i would not divulge a word of these adventures   8.767971351354856
i don t very well know   12.283972976479431
why is he not here that i may tell him so   11.113569610839379
when you see one prisoner you see all always the same thing ill fed and innocent   6.0370947812962195
well it is impossible but that master aramis that keen scented bloodhound and athos that wise and prudent nobleman will discover our retreat   16.87390643410956
gentlemen said he m   12.180289084309825
nevertheless he pressed d artagnan s hand and said to him you are an honest youth   12.774188231132923
athos on his part had a valet whom he had trained in his service in a thoroughly peculiar fashion and who was named grimaud   10.948494308552048
but soon the same clock he had already heard strike two or three times rectified the error by striking half past nine   15.200129282033496
i have a fancy and mean to get a housekeeper   12.837686802451582
this new attack made no impression on mordaunt   13.62642216075676
maximilian cast a look of disdain almost of anger on the count   11.030237449894873
lord de winter d artagnan athos porthos and aramis went out close behind her   12.695161676386745
in the meantime the cortege returned to the palais royal   8.389817505469349
the battle of lens gained   9.605506559413252
i shall see you through the window as you mount your horse   12.428264914210063
it may be easily imagined how great was our joy when in turning over this manuscript our last hope we found at the twentieth page the name of athos at the twenty seventh the name of porthos and at the thirty first the name of aramis   9.64798557032974
chevalier   13.680801145304429
indeed sire i wholly comprehend your disappointment   13.800513409112575
i will not promise said milady for no one has more respect for a promise or an oath than i have   7.878571068339013
but you know none are so formal as bankers in transacting business   12.559544498475688
the result was that the innkeeper with whom we were connected seeing that we would no longer come to him was forced to come to us and had established a branch to his inn on the road from bellegarde to beaucaire at the sign of the pont du gard   12.48978113163748
the guards of monsieur the cardinal are forever seeking quarrels with them and for the honor of the corps even the poor young men are obliged to defend themselves   8.386153403334838
it is the pede claudo of the ancients   7.509400213325841
your conversation with the cardinal overheard by the four musketeers   15.470171786073934
see how deadly pale he is   12.598986478826358
beauchamp wished to go in alone but albert observed that as this was an unusual circumstance he might be allowed to deviate from the usual etiquette of duels   15.37989620497045
as we said before by ten o clock almost all the guests had dispersed   11.28261566189637
a carriage below is waiting for your majesty   11.222657897164956
three of them appeared to be looking for the fugitive while the fourth dragged a brigand prisoner by the neck   16.76396967287283
this was now all changed   12.339211670532073
horrible horrible exclaimed athos   8.193498609104328
consequently he had appeared to believe all that the vainglorious musketeer had told him convinced that no friendship will hold out against a surprised secret   9.391560294991649
he came to renew the thanks of madame danglars which had been already conveyed to the count through the medium of a letter signed baronne danglars née hermine de servieux   11.109314815905982
faria started have you indeed   11.289390233769778
cried porthos do you think so   10.11224720001613
they were heard running down the stairs and through the long passages then there was a rush in the court afterwards all was still   8.842752043322433
you must take a carriage and an escort and guard the prisoner with the greatest care   16.052915437362643
he means that the articles contained in this purse are the relics of the angel i spoke of just now   10.660443722205867
on then   11.669102954660943
serves for me the fate of cardinals caprara   16.788760335879935
it was then agreed that they were to go first to monsieur de bouillon as his house came first   12.735583564922843
ah cried valentine suddenly i understand   13.941292238288884
the smile was melancholy   12.065297330504626
and the count s agreeable voice his gentle and persuasive eloquence recurred to his mind at the various towns through which they journeyed and about which he had no longer any one to give him those interesting details which he would have drawn from athos the most amusing and the best informed of guides   11.513896387139813
yet stammered dantès wiping the perspiration from his brow yet i gave you two hundred francs when i left three months ago   9.54064197794867
meanwhile who is in the russian ambassador s box   18.41197854588893
i have chosen a trade   16.927450773451653
but a man were he even a mercer when he had talked for ten minutes with cardinal richelieu is no longer the same man   11.908008516225411
yes i know that he meant to afford you that agreeable surprise   8.356206275171624
but the chief without taking the money made a sign to him to follow   10.735767549473424
muttered d artagnan   7.185334983219462
but allow me to tell you monsieur continued the citizen that i am convinced that there is less love than politics in all this   14.20905240056464
do i lose by that   12.642918760066099
on the morrow at break of day they were still three or four leagues from the coast of england   12.160460745864365
porthos clapped his hands and the other two came running around   13.798486405852135
0317m when he withdrew from the scene of his painful recollections they both accompanied him downstairs reiterating their hope that he would come again whenever he pleased and assuring him that their poor dwelling would ever be open to him   10.82863893892181
you must accomplish loyally the commission with which i deign to charge you and on that condition i pardon everything i forget everything   14.558962748761573
tis your fault answered porthos   16.252078735913088
and this morning he sent for me to ask me if i had obtained any information   13.303692467540609
you resist do you   4.455992040698223
and they set out for boulogne where toward evening they arrived their horses flecked with foam and dark with perspiration   5.458252489827958
i would not have our gratitude become indiscreet or importunate   10.985674285593044
then we must fight   14.447499544281818
i approached him and said in a low voice well since you know the corsicans so well you know that they always keep their word   12.939195093954098
doubtless doubtless said morrel   12.360555711324714
with an excellent master at arms that we have here   8.217995535752504
now the four friends began to speak loud scarcely waiting till one had finished before another began and each assumed his favorite attitude on or at the table   10.171404679038861
the baron took the pen and signed then the representative   9.962168466010375
doubtless these strange grave diggers had heard his cry   10.47720741651217
athos then made him a sign to take up his basket and to walk on first   14.934236096130443
god s death don t fire   15.435071261382202
the queen ran to a little table on which were ink paper and pens   14.572070720634438
but your excellency has not read all   9.3329573510637
mordaunt put his foot on the first step of the door and with his hat in hand prepared to pass by the two friends motioning to the four men to follow him   11.593577484890224
chapter 61   19.08390986403834
and madame de villefort to my country house at auteuil   8.118941466076535
a fourth the illustrious coxcomb mazarin refusing to give laporte the young king s valet clean sheets and saving that it was quite enough for the king of france to have clean sheets every three months   14.97732302235398
i too would give up that good monsieur broussel dead or alive and all would be at an end   12.7100753092163
sire replied villefort bowing in an hour i shall have quitted paris   17.013631593554358
she had been engaged in arranging the dresses and linen in a closet when the king entered   17.248769141749886
and the cargo   12.959399359319697
now said he i may require to go in one night from paris to tréport   13.041212370626424
you have probably guessed right   13.232803052082984
because madame de saint méran is just arrived in paris bringing the news of m   15.02619652366796
the two nobles saluted each other politely for if no friendship existed between them there was at least esteem   13.48266710400846
chevalier he continued addressing aramis who leaning proudly on his sword seemed to agree with his companion chevalier porthos and i run no risk   9.664294723485648
enough sir muttered the cardinal you have said enough   8.588574911650948
still you have thought of it   9.660069947883756
you do not know that name   15.758440657981932
my friend said d artagnan turning to the servant tell his eminence that in half an hour i shall be at his command   12.617194918346788
i expected him this morning   11.647213123569372
she will escape us and it will be your fault athos   12.992871286506997
i should like to know upon what occasion   5.115762126775046
de tréville moved to the bottom of his heart by this proof of courage sprang toward him   12.277106555274539
for he has educated me in everything and it is not his fault that his pupil profited so little from his instructions   10.27032107642573
planchet go and find aramis   15.19254356986791
you know gentlemen that i served the piedmont regiment and had the honor of being a sergeant   12.933127708867474
this woman exercised over him an unaccountable power   8.893766725457716
said porthos there s phoebus ruined   12.93379329691524
and the marriage may easily be thwarted methinks and yet dantès need not die   8.44078270917361
my dear count allow me to show you the way   12.424799628726355
only to alleviate the tediousness of the duty athos allowed him to take a loaf two cutlets and a bottle of wine   7.8622692173779445
the cardinal rose and advanced in haste to receive the queen of england   12.184195736284257
on them depended my father s life replied she   10.637922451470647
yes i want your chaise   13.261860631274413
he s not a guest like the other one here just now observed mine host to olivain who had rejoined his master to see if he wanted anything and your young master has no appetite   11.097075430651646
you would like very well to be at liberty on that beach   12.59122640280689
you are perhaps ignorant that they are fighting in england added she with a melancholy smile and that in a short time they will fight in a much more decided fashion than they have done hitherto   12.31404851207908
milady heard these few words and caught at a shadow of hope   11.971195882483128
these conditions being agreed to porthos took leave of mme   16.612418190464073
interrupted the count smiling   7.156366362709669
eagerly inquired the two youths   8.73382046941239
and are the first of men   13.837884544108782
he may have traveled so fast against the wind as to have brought on a violent catarrh   17.332012115415324
the three cornered hat over this effectually transformed the count into an abbé   9.81549576712231
said he after this embarrassing silence   9.75553803754935
sign the treaty then monseigneur said aramis   13.792738110915149
you must make some reformation in that quarter   13.779204375452261
as i have already told you sir he was a very dangerous man   16.534093770771996
de tréville glancing round to see if they were surely alone and then fixing his questioning look upon d artagnan   13.319554773691433
that evening i had translated an episode of judith and had just communicated my verses to the lady who gave me all sorts of compliments and leaning on my shoulder was reading them a second time with me   14.858744458344571
you should not speak so to an old friend like me caderousse as you said just now   12.757472234242378
athos replied always by gestures that that was well and indicated to grimaud by pointing to a turret that resembled a pepper caster that he was to stand as sentinel   11.405156692511115
he remembered the adventures that albert de morcerf had related when it was intended that he should marry mademoiselle eugénie   15.882933943364822
he was one of those merchants who come to sell jewellery at the beaucaire fair and who during the month the fair lasts and during which there is so great an influx of merchants and customers from all parts of europe often have dealings to the amount of 100 000 to 150 000 francs   11.275381074379785
at any other time valentine would have seized the silken bell pull and summoned assistance but nothing astonished her in her present situation   15.887494550304707
suppose i happen to strangle him   16.1743682741722
haydée had three french maids and one who was a greek   13.694521040121682
buckingham was their messiah   16.716893477651148
inquired danglars turning pale   12.561197438986135
by day they did nothing but ascend and descend the steps which led to the chapel   9.405992738698659
haven t you some one who will relieve me of my horse   14.869062887389564
you were wrong to reply to him as you did continued aramis following with his eyes the young man now vanishing behind the cliffs   14.362096553134409
exclaimed a commanding voice   13.640489796651508
the history which he related to me of his lost son touched me to the quick   11.467148284950886
and he is made a member of the academy of sciences for this   11.004193507658501
said the procurator s wife   11.293216751757756
the fact was that none of his servants none of the travelers present could have gained anything by being possessed of this paper   10.483557480338305
grimaud obeyed without replying   13.513014995781718
the major looked anxiously around him   10.653666382953245
nor did he neglect to launch a few arrows of wit at the excellent monsieur mouston   11.57894388060944
another older and less strong than he had attempted what he had not had sufficient resolution to undertake and had failed only because of an error in calculation   17.384096187669755
hush child   18.54831119182574
you are right said the latter   13.060333813361172
gentlemen said the queen a few years ago i had around me ushers treasures armies   16.15393110910776
it signifies nothing whether you eat much or little whether you have ten dishes or one it is always the same price   13.567812459403504
re enter paris if you will let us my good planchet   13.681910685760307
he lighted it and retired   8.590519775110762
bathed in tears she wandered about the catalan village   9.232070492760558
now s the time   10.890766571776094
a title and promotion attach you to the government we wish to overturn   17.527675645299027
what with the baroness   4.9560069077167785
they will believe he is arrested and that will give him time   12.656516355274505
my drunkenness is always sad and when i am thoroughly drunk my mania is to relate all the lugubrious stories which my foolish nurse inculcated into my brain   20.15035074123403
and you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses do you   9.2471471761374
as we have said he was lying on the deck   11.582277952064631
let us wait for a dénouement for the day when the prince thanks to you shall have turned against the court   9.008894483594776
but what has the french academy to do with all this   14.220727156033881
but i give you warning that if in polishing your chapel utensils you forget how to brighten up my sword i will make a great fire of your blessed images and will see that you are roasted on it   12.938275354104405
oh no no cried dantès   12.985236189357076
the two guards led in athos   13.705161561701555
i am as poor as job and were you to search my pockets and my boxes i don t believe you would find a hundred pistoles   12.855685111892548
the veins of his temples swelled and boiled as though they would burst their narrow boundary and deluge his brain with living fire   17.529413494204015
asked the young man looking fixedly in his turn at the count   10.273242439623283
i will not miss you   15.616857414154643
who then am i   9.57750908398594
then you are not consoled   14.475378161034948
follow us at a distance of twenty paces as far as the louvre and if anyone watches us slay him   11.563125929000499
repassed the bidassoa   13.436751339266408
exclaimed edmond that will not be   13.438011051678199
and when   14.969829862024152
dantès was occupied in arranging this piece of wood when he heard faria who had remained in edmond s cell for the purpose of cutting a peg to secure their rope ladder call to him in a tone indicative of great suffering   11.035736818984292
he has revenged himself and has done well   15.130630481677185
the catacombs of saint sebastian in his whole life perhaps franz had never before experienced so sudden an impression so rapid a transition from gayety to sadness as in this moment   11.854830734108937
and pastrini s account of vampa s having found refuge on board the vessels of smugglers and fishermen reminded franz of the two corsican bandits he had found supping so amicably with the crew of the little yacht which had even deviated from its course and touched at porto vecchio for the sole purpose of landing them   13.758684325338724
but there are no more said she   11.236424243471394
porthos succeeded him   15.469391227067051
yes but i have my breviary to repeat answered aramis   5.762806368063693
listen to monsieur de tréville said the king   9.700481578391962
i recollect you were saying said d artagnan that after having demanded my head of the cardinal milady had quit the shores of france   11.304948263090683
the rigors which had attacked barrois gradually increased the features of the face became quite altered and the convulsive movement of the muscles appeared to indicate the approach of a most serious nervous disorder   10.830152059405327
it is for that reason you see me so early   10.546618794996595
and if it please god we will make a good use of your presents   14.544468329732796
whereupon grimaud observing the duke s disappointment drew from his pocket a purse filled with gold and handed it to him   6.924001022121464
does anybody know   16.396836587020708
i became uneasy leaped the wall found my way through the garden when voices conversing about the fatal event what voices   12.576944025266675
yes yes repeated villefort as he approached his home yes that woman must live   11.028735906341856
but we have not as yet declared war   15.08099406530933
yes replied d artagnan let us still be musketeers and let us retain as our battle standard that famous napkin of the bastion st   15.74734543109189
you begged me not to leave   9.99748117344039
he hated and adored her at the same time   4.568526571925963
asked milady warmly   12.964663793537655
i find that i have not been mistaken and i thank you that there is still one man in france of whom may be said without disappointment what i have said of you   12.853822256304804
yes and no   6.887673320597069
no no said m   10.528768259808617
whilst the two friends were with the cardinal the queen sent for him   9.64911168094447
50165m the young woman hid her face in her hands   10.592139017681239
athos seemed to grow calm as the critical moment approached   13.397675598657255
oh your pardon   12.877172762199937
what does he mean   10.100973221278538
you were saying madame i came to ask you my friend said the baroness what will be done with this impostor   11.60142159457855
there will be eleven crowns gained   14.280482927699207
in fact the road was trodden by horses feet visible even in the approaching gloom of evening   11.654078687025038
he wanted to kill me   10.529638313236276
but i have not told you that i know him   14.159828425205426
pardon me for quitting you my dear madame bonacieux said he   13.864887540033482
yes the very one who is lighting us   9.493822217072271
i understand now why they murdered him   12.522203360119327
but they both assured me that it was a jest they were carrying on and perfectly harmless   11.00096682289932
the pretty madeleine who had approached during this colloquy stepped back and turned pale as death on hearing porthos s words for she thought the scene with the swiss was about to be repeated   10.035280392338949
in my wife s chamber on the first flight where they are dressing his wounds   12.223730760067488
and were you even to require a million i beg your pardon interposed monte cristo   13.279145869214169
they had learned to distinguish the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their dungeons and happily never failed of being prepared for his coming   10.340614217924482
he would not sell his horse   13.520497796304475
milady s son replied athos   11.688995754350241
the taking of la rochelle was the preface to the revocation of the edict of nantes   17.30917510569216
on this conviction i allow her to speculate she having her bank and her stockbroker   11.039410389629557
madame danglars therefore went to bed without a shadow of suspicion and began to muse over the recent events   9.735973001421701
do not be lost with me   19.106568631189184
noirtier cast an intelligent glance at morrel as if to say perhaps i may   12.084781768620829
now sir said d artagnan wishing to change the conversation here are fifty pistoles that the count has sent you by the same courier   10.240461763900637
for the cause which today takes us to england   9.686858772958933
he is accused said the commissary with his inflexible voice of having assassinated the man named caderousse his former companion in prison at the moment he was making his escape from the house of the count of monte cristo   10.312100794087346
he likes good wine   12.759488568482684
well said albert with a sigh it seems you are determined to marry me   10.20191560902031
we here present the letter verbatim to his eminence monseigneur le cardinal mazarini i have wished monseigneur to learn your intentions relating to the existing state of affairs in england   9.833588791112634
now listen albert   11.691045022726966
but on reflection he hated him more and more being convinced he had some evil motive for his conduct   13.70885074740806
mademoiselle de villefort prepared all the cooling draughts which madame de saint méran took and madame de saint méran is dead   14.363113930495658
said blaisois pointing to the barley bread and pot of beer upon the table   13.85095788365286
that is because love has come suddenly upon me and for the first time   14.930160545064908
ah said andrea when may we hope for that pleasure   8.081717410616536
and that it was owing to you that he was very nearly being damned eternally for remaining a musketeer whilst all the time his true vocation was the church   10.457536171790604
i can answer for it they do not   11.51677299528825
the mendicant shook his head   13.642648812951549
george villiers duke of buckingham chapter xiii   7.205361813910884
and whatever people may say continued caderousse in his native language which was not altogether devoid of rude poetry i can not help being more frightened at the idea of the malediction of the dead than the hatred of the living   10.270264098206567
i will bless you i i am dying   14.36953293069368
tell us about it said athos palpitating   5.593216064196509
aramis has a hieroglyphic countenance always illegible   16.135450822874937
a terrible cry was heard and the wife and daughters of broussel held up their hands in supplication to the people   7.56740293659949
great god she is losing her senses   9.286469993262214
where have you read in the scriptures i ask you that the english are your neighbors   9.206288219455594
the space was cleared the two lamps placed on cromwell s desk in order that the combatants might have as much light as possible   13.908770601031392
and she took two or three steps forward   12.870218898756903
unhappy he who on the brink of misfortune broods over ideas like these   8.75990479945093
my lord i shall send this evening to your eminence in order to reinforce the troop of monsieur de comminges the ten men you demand   9.834402313286079
i assure you we are or rather we shall be very happy   11.633062054268686
he scarcely knew mademoiselle de villefort   13.816817792859514
and now i am a frondeur not of broussel s party nor of blancmesnil s nor am i with viole   11.750021731908765
i am ready to obey your eminence   12.16114005178612
dessessart who esteemed d artagnan made him offers of help as this change would entail expenses for equipment   15.01004002584434
who can tell whether mazarin may not take advantage of this rendezvous to seize us   14.618706668134333
constancy and discretion   11.972247804912973
i say that love is a lottery in which he who wins wins death   8.131319582015852
yes sir replied the count   4.8378538338131705
he confessed that he had undertaken with his comrade the same who was killed to carry off a young woman who was to leave paris by the barrière de la villette   16.66427246681821
but i have no permission to shoot over this island   15.771661856761162
had i been alone i should scarcely have gone to rueil without great caution   14.002667754512817
his friend   14.602402740613549
i can assure you that this hobgoblin of yours is a deuced fine looking fellow admirably dressed   15.38673706586808
well i tell you that i come to you from the cardinal   9.194600705610636
what s your pleasure gentlemen   7.426540935389413
the mission with which i am charged sir replied the visitor speaking with hesitation is a confidential one on the part of him who fulfils it and him by whom he is employed   16.545440855132405
there was a mistake   10.415658293089836
blaisois went with him   12.797628141738647
let us bury this terrible secret in the deepest recesses of our hearts   12.121114332342499
aramis in a black gown his head enveloped in a sort of round flat cap not much unlike a calotte was seated before an oblong table covered with rolls of paper and enormous volumes in folio   10.52466525438997
thanks d artagnan thanks   11.824733047333023
two in the arm and one in the breast   11.753400347463899
i faint   11.069058729349685
d artagnan and porthos pointed to their dusty and torn dresses but the cardinal shook his head   13.309940425327484
the abbé then showed dantès the sketch he had made for their escape   6.989787103147938
i think he was your colleague   7.493279733347918
yes yes let them come up immediately   10.721566663997262
they are going to fight   11.270335831056375
then you have received full information concerning my arrival   10.357987216021426
these words gave great joy to d artagnan   12.563528398482678
from my earliest recollections i have been beloved by no one so much the worse   10.576809936632227
but i do as he has made me a baron and a field marshal and i shall never forget that for these two titles i am indebted to his happy return to france   15.38393539320828
the queen herself does not dare to oppose the terrible minister   12.117585981249126
conditions   8.260991150254764
nor have i lost sight of him for a single instant since   17.913897448727244
i am from gascony it is true   16.897748944949345
i had acted hastily towards him   9.927714985093434
what ones   11.541234119210174
justify yourself if you can   12.270622482450483
come louise said mademoiselle danglars to her friend   12.252619880032043
we mount them and before daylight are twenty leagues distant   15.10677753141308
would you like better to be hanged in your true name milady   9.643548408885065
you have then been induced to alter your opinion   7.8568482821085
do not go away   13.115982789015344
noirtier rue coq héron no   8.50370053038994
at the sound of that carriage i shuddered   13.214650657664361
three months since it was m   12.677101553875168
this was the inspector s first visit   6.159507366568874
a cabriolet was in waiting at the gate in which i intended to carry off valentine to my sister s house to marry her and to wait respectfully m   14.289177470458782
but since you tell me to whom it is addressed tis useless to wait till then   11.987690763775008
her face was so passionless that he as every one else present was incapable of reading her thoughts   7.355083721656323
franz however did not obey the summons till he had satisfied himself that the two men whose conversation he had overheard were at a sufficient distance to prevent his encountering them in his descent   7.9136718233992
but asked the visitor do you know why he came to france   13.756308256037727
i obeyed my love   16.08047472945647
order a larded hare a fat capon mutton leg dressed with garlic and four bottles of old burgundy   12.485460154135083
this last obstacle having been overcome the troop pursued their course with their accustomed ardor   13.868518700580218
andrea cavalcanti or rather m   10.154486326913304
in crete he was supposed to be slain in winter with the decay of vegetation and to revive in the spring   10.400317030810992
and why is it impossible   17.688459701420875
there are twenty five bottles of it left   13.614662876184607
my expedition has given me an appetite   10.345601314549333
four days would quite suffice to complete the seduction of felton   16.125227914952536
athos appeared   9.540430942409953
i still assist at executions but no longer strike the blow myself no indeed   7.290170193322938
demanded the host after a few minutes of useless investigation   8.066138187432335
he came up with her before she had traversed a third of the street   9.382164755472548
an illustrious person sends you   8.824806479118498
mundane presumption   5.995471967702952
de villefort is preparing against my amiable assassin some brigand escaped from the gallows apparently   13.120890740492676
killed him or poniarded him sir as is most agreeable to you   15.078125609809625
still further his shirt had stuck to the wound and he had lost only a few drops of blood   14.805110619231847
when it arrived there four guards and a police officer who accompanied it mounted into the heavy machine and closed the shutters   13.805847173109374
they are the only men who know how to live   15.621359851732326
well beautiful lady very well said he   12.503678838471414
if the marquise will deign to repeat the words i but imperfectly caught i shall be delighted to answer said m   12.092586605547998
i can see nobody said d artagnan   11.123750152711475
mouston will do   8.583157263193335
if he had not courage he had what is very like it namely pride   12.087396180499054
not if the choice had remained with me for i had frequently observed inaccuracies in his accounts   12.449129138605985
is this secret your own   13.247812497722546
my honor will not survive it   5.8300827996212
but lord de winter might suspect him   8.53889122427356
take what rest you require and remember that if you are not able to serve me here in paris you may be of the greatest service to me at marseilles   11.73480990741518
did i know anything about it when it was all done when i was down there   12.507496037943119
a piece of bread and another glass of the capital rum i tasted for i have not eaten or drunk for a long time   11.039486043217886
crown pieces only silver pieces   11.907780927453908
edmond rose again but this time his legs did not tremble and his sight was clear   15.782053953478632
adieu your excellency   9.908572216815529
the cardinal s hair stood on end   12.139533648098695
by means of the two windows looking into the street albert could see all that passed   10.754025672377999
remarked a third   11.055952966950995
i should affirm the culpability   11.439683819720017
said d artagnan i had forgotten that he was only a musketeer for a time   13.90232257368944
prodigiously replied athos in the name of himself and his comrades   12.23571884525532
he traversed a corridor crossed a grand saloon entered a library and found himself in the presence of a man seated at a desk and writing   16.59655444925294
protect her for the count s voice was thick with emotion henceforth she will be alone in the world   11.851570884146101
and you want my blessing   6.899118357705732
then said albert you became the property of this man   8.227787745917503
my dear sir said monte cristo i understand your emotion   10.774701564108
well as you please i even gain something by it for i no longer see that wicked smile of yours   11.344906650413309
caderousse drew a deep breath   19.149126801894226
monsieur du vallon has a cold and did not cry either   11.554160660548247
why did you not mention his name at once   14.901897975504106
i say only that fortune has turned against me i had thought to gain heaven and now i have lost it   12.050802604083856
he returned to france with the epaulet of sub lieutenant and as the protection of the general who is in the highest favor was accorded to him he was a captain in 1823 during the spanish war that is to say at the time when danglars made his early speculations   9.802176808313057
he s not more cunning than de richelieu was   17.425577592492626
but as i was older than fernand and had just married my poor wife i was only sent to the coast   10.960281883961505
the baron drew out his watch   12.408313837626789
there was no longer any deceit or bravado in the manner of the accused   9.901273150505542
in fact a moment later m   13.506659163396415
he was a berrichon thirty five or forty years old mild peaceable sleek employing the leisure his master left him in the perusal of pious works providing rigorously for two a dinner of few dishes but excellent   16.355953970719682
you are the subject on which i wish to speak   10.060746149986858
and when asked dantès may i see all this   13.193527525348316
for a hundred pistoles i have discovered a secret for which richelieu would have paid twenty thousand crowns   15.794421359314025
i thought sir that it was kings alone who abdicated   15.1780326599558
i was sure of it said morcerf   15.430965498621854
with albert   17.795089784520535
but all these reasons were combated destroyed overthrown by that feeling of intimate pain which on certain occasions takes possession of our being and cries to us so as to be understood unmistakably that some great misfortune is hanging over us   10.2830169985612
very good very good said the voice   12.625473192457465
exclaimed de winter   10.795839491627238
but how handsome thou art how fat   10.036244613193679
and on what floor does he live   14.018943794102015
they said she had left   13.949299292710359
do you permit us to open this casket   15.230778027644135
my wife and child shall escape from this gulf carrying treasures with them   14.208078019416156
added gondy turning to la meilleraie   12.473700617699679
however i have managed to live thirty years without this protection you will say   12.511668241277908
maximilian villefort rose half ashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm of grief   10.571048942313373
gentlemen resumed aramis any one but the comte de la fere and myself would have had you arrested for we have friends in paris but we are contented with another course   8.401105581275793
pardon me at least such i have heard is your custom   12.188684887519125
but your highness has never seriously thought of it   6.18926291444486
what is allowed then   11.911623686803917
now besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the hôtel de ville which is next door to the bell and bottle it had been stated by others that a number of travellers had arrived during the night   8.721332210956918
that is convenient   9.806943268761362
further this woman as if not certain of the house she was seeking lifted up her eyes to look around her stopped went backward and then returned again   7.299301344615842
i will not die alone   11.050557371856119
his excellency the count of monte cristo had he said given positive orders that the carriage was to remain at their lordships orders all day and they could therefore dispose of it without fear of indiscretion   8.71166386806072
but it is very hard for me my poor caderousse you take advantage bah said caderousse when you have access to countless stores   12.383006411111204
he went then to the queen and according to custom accosted her with fresh menaces against those who surrounded her   12.969463341723953
andrea assumed his gayest manner   14.963192067006162
but he can easily become one if he is not already   13.073157942869729
what do you mean grimaud   9.194418536429263
i tremble to give my permission   13.696966555861815
who is there   15.9563893304115
asked the queen motioning to raoul to rise   16.07455542153806
de schomberg   7.968673916966022
alas monseigneur we were not in the plot as you will soon see   12.486077835892589
who says this aramis is not a wit   9.344703809748971
she will be the sooner with her mother   13.666459765864921
to eat do you hear   6.594677444722521
well said aramis beaten by fate   9.650397337178104
well really nothing is certain in this world   8.23349026849068
and i ask god and you how i can save her   11.30322537082368
and when you are full of money again you can redeem it and take it back cleansed from its ancient stains as it will have passed through the hands of usurers   11.054416909623805
ah you fancy so   11.122503243926165
on guard then monsieur on guard   10.43577714580663
the carriage had been twenty minutes behind the time appointed   13.9912851810422
are you ill   13.03922246722031
but said the agitated mercer do me the pleasure monsieur to tell me how my own proper affair can become worse by anything my wife does while i am in prison   10.829540000674161
the duchess loudly lamented the announcement of peace   10.460704627498119
among friends my dear athos no you are right   14.996869932014636
the other room near the library was a bedroom   16.445541684435135
any noise in the ears   14.421823060143197
i explained nothing and it is he who apologized to me   11.221557882865431
i reached the age of twenty nine without loving for none of the feelings i before then experienced merit the appellation of love   8.919009791739608
de tréville touched more than ever by his paternal solicitude for his musketeers   10.572178421885376
the two friends then placed themselves as they had agreed porthos being completely hidden in an angle of the window   12.787086286515667
you promised me something else   12.957387130558324
then without taking his eyes from the object which had first attracted his attention he asked for his telescope   14.449178899222286
he recounted with circumstantial exactitude all the particulars of the supper the hashish the statues the dream and how at his awakening there remained no proof or trace of all these events save the small yacht seen in the distant horizon driving under full sail toward porto vecchio   12.118001496872322
cried porthos with a laugh that shook the windows   12.66687347472958
jean in front of the silver buffet of the city which was guarded by four archers   10.401543050372265
said d artagnan who began to feel all his patience exhausted   16.886058068300088
he hurt my shoulder   15.511478131436
some unknown enemy an invisible foe has done this   15.745854699675775
magloire   10.19491528515067
his shoulder knots were of burnished silver his mantle had no gold nor embroidery on it   13.2126927049021
they will come for her tomorrow or the day after with an order from the queen   15.123981244567414
you are setting up an establishment of course   9.863996324801779
my dear count you have no idea what pleasure it gives me to hear you speak thus said morcerf   10.85518023777831
will you assure me it shall not be signed   7.752506087326513
it is a wretched bed but that is not my fault and it is you who have chosen it   11.164842833455554
is it to the judge or to the husband   12.200958322270674
those who like us have never had a thought for which we need blush before the world such may read each other s hearts   15.864286914392697
to tell you the truth i consider it lost   18.955200790889442
rumor will probably be busy respecting me my occupations my manner of living that will signify but little that concerns god you and myself   9.749697716018678
it is a chain of recollections an idea which carries you back to other times to other places which very likely have no connection with the present time and place   11.305345549872198
the musketeers advanced bowing d artagnan following closely behind them   11.938839363939703
see said he my dear friend how god punishes the most thoughtless and unfeeling men for their indifference by presenting dreadful scenes to their view   11.460590350697121
and yonder are five hundred persons as you may see through the loopholes taking us for heroes or madmen two classes of imbeciles greatly resembling each other   12.435496877538371
you consent then   15.224022475429727
come he said tis a warning from heaven   15.315173458149175
the count s anxiety was manifested by a bright color which seldom appeared on the face of that imperturbable man   14.84975819020005
then what did you mean stay he left a letter for me   10.261196114106315
then the landing began   16.387202202208098
the latter rose from the front of the window upon the sill of which he had leaned with his elbow and knitted his brow like a man disquieted   14.054321915238082
the musketeers lackeys included were seven   12.27483553949603
three or four times he has said to me and certainly without the slightest premeditation at such a period i was five years old at another ten years old at another twelve and i induced by curiosity which kept me alive to these details have compared the dates and never found him inaccurate   11.449303857656648
then when he thought i had said all he advanced toward me   8.713754110909996
nearly thirteen millions of our money   11.924406271327143
he had even given orders to arrest her and would have cut off her head had she not escaped with her waiting maid poor kitty   11.36141346537213
this quantity which is perfectly safe to administer to the paralyzed frame of m   9.240378267986566
oh that is quite another thing then   13.632981718296309
oh i know this country marvelously   10.632398825115141
within this mansion you are absolute mistress of your actions and may go abroad or remain in your apartments as may seem most agreeable to you   9.947084109335474
because i was shown up the private stairs   10.628607380431825
do you understand father   12.804506235898016
asked richelieu in the tone with which he would have put a question of no importance   8.590745652260619
then all was dark again   11.055531247644156
whereabouts downstairs   13.743260330614874
but at the first words he uttered the comte roused himself from the kind of lethargy in which he had sunk   10.768357942689285
after which the curtain again fell and the spectators poured forth from the theatre into the lobbies and salon   11.165570652354766
i should be turned off and lose my pension   14.928668936309446
de villefort locked the garden door and returned upstairs   8.078981252202412
and since he has been here i have watched him   6.197872839974927
asked madame danglars with an anxiety easy to be understood   15.455345208645545
but you sir   13.654343184987335
and you should call it devotion added aramis   14.279232564988572
how should i know what horse furniture is   7.785903318844943
or if you have them why don t you keep them to yourself   13.198184055729374
said aramis our late adventures have disgusted me with military life   15.191903414082876
well they fastened a thirty six pound ball to his feet and threw him into the sea   15.800234110768343
oh my lord   9.268139892530414
on their road they perceived lord winter marching at the head of his regiment   13.730243045266825
d artagnan taking with him three trusses of straw returned to the chateau where everybody freezing with cold and more than half asleep envied the king the queen and the duke of orleans on their camp beds   12.319232191551402
let out your prisoner   13.683668761138293
answer sir exclaimed he   11.28546494398047
tell him your name and show him this letter   8.727545248621329
immediately the window was opened and a ladder of rope was let down from it   9.99367992122136
in that case said bazin he must be pretty sick   5.870363743523489
or of my sister since she was dead   11.525321173426349
well now then the count   12.492251606589717
so far well said aramis   14.08165027719923
porthos had been trying a new horse   9.283995097385636
de villefort heard of him at marseilles and m   8.996945902578027
everyone spoke harangued and vociferated swearing cursing and consigning the cardinal and his guards to all the devils   8.971139333052099
is not death in my house   10.84389586758446
as he struck the wall pieces of stucco similar to that used in the ground work of arabesques broke off and fell to the ground in flakes exposing a large white stone   10.333051635729433
faithless court   13.68032557355072
porthos consoled himself by filling the antechamber of m   14.864794094229287
that s my masterpiece   12.754297009303643
tell me a little about it my dear monsieur de rochefort   15.72457344850975
we have quitted business   10.325910681781568
chapter lxxvi   17.008896512845652
that is to say as often as you can with safety   8.228578142798035
there was no fear of her falling asleep   12.363108985798876
the handsome madeleine announced to d artagnan that planchet had returned bringing mousqueton with him who had heroically borne the extraction of the ball and was as well as his state would permit   18.361338565022038
the king half dressed the queen and laporte remained each in the same state and almost in the same place where they were listening and waiting   6.497359342964179
and so sir said the queen you are seriously afraid of a public tumult   13.360744852776948
well cried milady in a sharp voice   8.360105044156612
madame the passage is quite clear and your majesty can continue your road   8.070473153117192
the clerks surveyed him with great curiosity and he not knowing well what to say to this ascending and descending scale remained tongue tied   13.661032963626214
she exclaimed in so plaintive an accent that it seemed to stifle a sob   8.57002660878641
an announcement has been made which implicates the honor of a member of my family   13.149416683099192
comte de la fere   16.730392793627338
d artagnan raised his head and uttered a cry of joy   13.65819397979979
he brought it to bear skillfully executed it with the rapidity of lightning and struck the blow with a force which he fancied would prove irresistible   10.667439203586396
and she resumed her narrative   15.096221202252574
happily he did not meet anyone   11.927734063401287
but instead of that you come to paris   13.850443190769047
he left there three men   16.397078704258192
he stooped and with the most gracious air he could assume drew the handkerchief from under the foot of the musketeer in spite of the efforts the latter made to detain it and holding it out to him said i believe monsieur that this is a handkerchief you would be sorry to lose   8.12635580744995
well i will take it then said d artagnan   12.79103283419221
he said in a low voice   8.33046010041433
he would never forgive me for not having preceded you   7.194819545225861
you are in error sir answered the queen   14.875131614665687
but all four together and without a scratch   13.032303568734537
besides were not those riches chimerical   8.929338384619165
after these preparations he placed his finger on his lips and lowering himself noiselessly into the sea swam towards the shore with such precaution that it was impossible to hear the slightest sound   10.615854957919439
athos stepped back and passed his hand across his brow   17.097510157617698
athos indeed saw a second smile on the lips of d artagnan   17.969788483371655
i took the precaution to half empty the carafe in order that my suspicions might not be noticed   16.055013131487925
do no such thing i beg of you   12.32999250302856
yes replied albert raising his voice   11.483811212636304
you will perceive that it resembles that of thunder   12.290873446557248
this idea completely restored clemency to his heart   11.977973020925049
and traversing at will the path of history i cease to remember that i am myself a prisoner   10.761969565689817
well then said edmond if you do not i shall die of hunger that is all   10.230245620499408
the guide carried away the torch   10.462718592403958
the abbé s chamber after having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean passage which however did not admit of their holding themselves erect the two friends reached the further end of the corridor into which the abbé s cell opened   13.710531607496641
he was one of us   11.904086417271381
madame more hopeless than he thinks   9.464822948142483
he thought perhaps they were going to leave him on some distant point   10.199399989870685
but it was apparently not heard by the jeweller caderousse or la carconte absorbed as they were all three with the demon of gain   12.530691832910057
but they could not refrain from remarking the difference between the count of monte cristo s table and that of signor pastrini   13.629259877212132
and which of them made this passage   5.671042692179391
i became weary of ranging fields and scaling walls and seriously alarmed at the idea suggested by you that if caught hovering about here your father would very likely have me sent to prison as a thief   15.328704770319206
ah my dear count you are far too indulgent   8.820469477507501

said athos shrugging his shoulders   17.203381319376156
there happened to be a sermon which made the church very full of people   11.321455318920453
simply this said the coadjutor   18.687152367842582
after closing the door carefully behind him mordaunt glided into the subterranean passage sheathing on the way his now useless sword and thus reached the neighboring house where he paused to examine himself and to take breath   9.439048325112246
bertuccio who was also gazing with sad astonishment upon the iron bars the bolted doors and the shadow which moved behind the other grating   12.004054365462343
and shrugging his shoulders with unaffected contempt he passed on   11.686630909468365
and who knows which of you is the most fortunate   11.656272005427514
exclaimed a voice on the stairs   13.142634521185883
oh dear no your excellency unless you intend to commit suicide   16.75141469960374
they dragged us away by force   12.098644404957792
chapter lxxiv   11.1719674381103
go sir then said the queen   11.475520135543658
weep said athos weep heart full of love youth and life   9.865404285300746
said albert to the count   12.28087561917218
in truth whether we die here or elsewhere matters little since we must die   13.66151430840101
this is not to the purpose said eugénie   8.395417381023371
say my highness is furious   12.272840005398631
he arose and stood near mousqueton   12.982143398696037
i will let you know that directly i have seen m   14.069980503763567
the poison will be changed and the quantity increased   15.296590390690607
i perceive that my story has caused a general emotion and i beg to apologize to you baroness and to mademoiselle danglars   10.14404598292112
the host had the appearance of as honest a man as any on earth   19.015547685074093
hardly had he read the letter when his wife entered   13.70160089339096
on this side i think the cardinal will be well guarded   3.6750768655480694
30185m madame replied villefort i can truly say that i have always entertained a high respect for my father because to the natural feeling of relationship was added the consciousness of his moral superiority   15.396909950924627
cried aramis and porthos at the same time   17.21840988514333
the letters were long the four pages were covered with closely written words   11.316730144690439
i shall follow you with my eyes as long as you are in sight   11.901877902181454
it is all a matter of imagination   12.070326508367831
but the instant your majesty considers me a prejudiced judge i withdraw   11.19842736247573
you will not touch the garden either   12.260102423877544
30119m what precaution   13.603423669714026
i understand how he would act   11.237279087780225
he found the troop in the glade supping off the provisions exacted as contributions from the peasants   16.22018428940479
captivity the third day felton had fallen   14.383605971222906
but here are your bonds   14.41710318044344
i say that he has hastily accused your majesty s musketeers toward whom he is unjust and that he has not obtained his information from good sources   9.316326605876842
why have we not a grimaud near every prince   7.224607380679528
that s what i mean said andrea endeavoring to smile quite overcome by the strange tranquillity of bertuccio   13.040197483565812
yez yez said the swiss   13.948866774567087
chapter 14   9.559196611067886
can it be otherwise   8.857431220482507
he seized it and attacked the wall   10.234561099229868
athos was the first to leave him in order that he might retire to a little property he had inherited near blois   13.989982508541463
and besides he said going out of this chamber isn t all   16.748185086854285
each of them when the other was not looking hazarded a sly glance   7.47568354113667
one day benedetto who had been gone from the house since morning to our great anxiety did not return until late in the evening dragging a monkey after him which he said he had found chained to the foot of a tree   14.498684734884117
because he left no commentaries replied la ramee with his coarse laugh   13.946024579762561
bernouin took up a candlestick and led the way   12.843718487069252
the third then fell from the clouds i suppose   10.451453413707908
woman woman why do you have such ideas   12.486457150428514
but on his way he met athos who during his relief which d artagnan had procured him had recovered his breath and who for fear that d artagnan would kill his enemy wished to resume the fight   10.592874512748539
if as we hope our readers have not wholly forgotten the first part of this work they must have preserved a clear idea of that estimable individual who is wholly unchanged except that he is twenty years older an advance in life that has made him only more silent   11.373220382040062
asked albert lighting his cigar   9.388944029047206
the two friends walked out on the fortress   10.793444354734616
the men of my crew who are devoted to me for life and death mount guard around this apartment and watch all the passages that lead to the courtyard   11.792635927510414
de morcerf as you saw   18.33667135277309
it is unnecessary we know each other so well   13.017582249497408
i will perpetuate the crime and punishment by making a frightful example   9.775104440502147
the fronde is a comedy of which the first act only is played   13.547444808031235
and now sir resumed mousqueton when he had rid himself of planchet who had in vain tried to clasp his hands behind his friend s fat back now sir allow me to leave you for i could not permit my master to hear of your arrival from any but myself   12.961720362478474
no no read exclaimed the queen indignantly   11.953133753390773
grimaud looked after him and when the door was closed he drew out of his pocket a pencil and a sheet of paper   7.169060768144107
i have often read and read again the history of mithridates said madame de villefort in a tone of reflection and had always considered it a fable   14.346764281772387
oh beauchamp beauchamp how shall i now approach mine   6.55109753744982
mouston replied porthos much affected should we ever see my castle of pierrefonds again you shall have as your own and for your descendants the vineyard that surrounds the farm   7.411152978521206
at the door he found the two men and the spare horse which they held   9.899737576827452
and you selected it yourself   8.554628656371843
his situation was too precarious to allow him even time to reflect on any thought but one   7.904114321143064
then taking porthos aside my dear du vallon he said here you are in full dress most fortunately for i am going to take you to the cardinal s   13.203535734612416
yes continued athos four times only   9.942606811593809
amongst the catalans mercédès wished for a thousand things but still she never really wanted any   9.354777095986702
well suppose it is a bull fight you are going to see   12.842544158073375
in an instant dantès plan was formed   10.708515014874624
today then at eleven o clock your father has nearly three hundred thousand francs to pay   14.896624925400618
of that great that sublime sovereign all which does not prevent you refusing hospitality to his son in law sir   9.741797293590011
and even then the precaution seemed superfluous the wall was so high   12.33303472029999
i am at your command sir   10.579134093929502
nothing good replied d artagnan shaking his head   14.516982025675691
danglars burst out laughing   11.313077236281847
tire to him as my sole heir   5.8471522164588405
he told me it was you who sacrificed to the demon of speculation   14.596596360612585
a few seconds afterward d artagnan also went out enveloped in a large cloak which ill concealed the sheath of a long sword   13.301538518588908
a roman scarf tied round his neck   13.406600762454175
there was a profound silence in the room when the duke again addressed them do you not remember that the duc de guise taught all the dogs in paris to jump for mademoiselle de pons whom he styled the fairest of the fair   5.463270196924846
shall i ring for baptistin   7.9156057617954
he went out after the coadjutor settled his account locked up his gold and had confidential workmen to contrive hiding places in his walls   12.040818391572794
i mean to say young man that he who sleeps over a mine the match of which is already lighted may consider himself in safety in comparison with you   11.29616461871396
my lord added henrietta with a melancholy smile it is sad and almost shameful to be obliged to say that we have passed the winter in the louvre without money without linen almost without bread and often not rising from bed because we wanted fire   7.887209809453571
you called me didn t you   11.542152386631148
he has already been invited by my father   20.162144011182313
muttered porthos with a kind of pretense of answering   10.304906628811514
bertuccio appeared   8.14806333201851
he had allowed himself to be dressed in great astonishment overwhelming laporte with questions who replied only in these words sire it is by the queen s commands   18.937032921756927
she was now connected by bonds of a political nature with the prince de marsillac the eldest son of the old duc de rochefoucauld whom she was trying to inspire with an enmity toward the duc de condé her brother in law whom she now hated mortally   14.358633808480468
a folded paper fell from edward s breast   11.70952231570934
you have a longboat   10.823923000940297
the overture to the second act began   15.78583300451114
anne of austria bent down and whispered in the young king s ear say something gracious to monsieur d artagnan my son   10.828727031627182
at the door stood two horses fresh strong and fully equipped   17.553694754596734
you are deceived monsieur   12.850091657101025
in truth murmured d artagnan to whom m   16.163767039929862
cried kitty   10.420479343121794
everything fell out as mme   10.104521465347341
but what say you to raoul s fancy   10.017632952356951
arriving unexpectedly in sight of the isle of ré with ninety vessels and nearly twenty thousand men he had surprised the comte de toiras who commanded for the king in the isle and he had after a bloody conflict effected his landing   11.764462168277166
he he incur danger of death   11.868378677252181
it is they who on the contrary overcome fate   12.2109568705082
the officer entered   10.018673187491032
it is a frightful trick of the husband of our duchess   16.502849326845485
where forbidden   10.086437810681387
monte cristo on the contrary took the right hand   11.922978373182094
and could you count on fifty resolute men good unemployed but active souls brawlers capable of bringing down the walls of the palais royal by crying down with mazarin as fell those at jericho   14.01290813055963
this is the reason why monsieur the principal has proposed to me the following subject which has not yet been treated upon and in which i perceive there is matter for magnificent elaboration utraque manus in benedicendo clericis inferioribus necessaria est   16.34569671800745
have you enemies then   11.061451453493293
instead of returning then by the saint honore gate d artagnan who had time before him walked around and re entered by the porte richelieu   11.326484065716425
come laporte said the queen   9.91320598390455
so that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy prisoner at the same time   13.251512998875189
morcerf had expected he should be the guide   0.8989499843199091
madame de saint méran heard her   16.89063368406328
shall i bring him alone   8.834603026959817
the sensation experienced by franz was evidently not peculiar to himself   10.096407188776467
then going to albert he touched him on the shoulder saying will your excellency please to awaken   16.35659825643463
but silence   13.12088678435883
she had already decided upon seeing him and urging his immediate departure when on the very evening of coming to this decision mme   12.719260138020982
he must have written to him   9.060174756981766
and madame de morcerf of the arrival of the count of monte cristo   11.94630794138655
that is why valentine passed through her room which was on a level with valentine s and only separated from it by edward s   11.506563795813156
it was on the thirteenth of july that ventrebleu   11.40218463475002
but here is m   11.797934514856099
the executioner made a sign and his two assistants leaped from the scaffold and seized him   13.142693877020623
then recollecting the honor you had done me in admitting me to your friendship i hastened to you   7.029293650592767
at what hour does the examination take place   5.767980766528364
for when you meet me again you will perhaps be alone and there will be daylight   10.38132607445724
as the carriage started off the cries were redoubled and more than ten thousand people thronged the quai and overflowed the pont neuf and adjacent streets   13.954536539602852
those wretches wanted to take away my sword   12.070478118629921
only impenetrable that s all   6.890312270811147
should dantès not return mercédès might one day be his   12.141971916507313
there was a brief pause during which louis xviii   10.248736143594211
very good said gondy shaking rochefort by the hand who descended in his turn and closed the trap after him   13.801859859970696
and what hast thou to say boy to monsieur broussel   9.343430900580266
to yanina   11.145436599187494
i have seen him also said d artagnan   10.780868379044392
d artagnan led away the swiss in spite of lamentations on the part of the hostess who in reality found her heart inclining toward her former lover though she would not have been sorry to give a lesson to that haughty musketeer who had affronted her by the refusal of her hand   14.8748303705447
a terrible idea however rushed into her mind   10.893217037166371
you are a great politician my queen said mazarin   12.931286799276334
the count and ali ate in haste a crust of bread and drank a glass of spanish wine   11.743945330572297
how can it be otherwise my dear bonacieux   12.717252161796008
oh count what a service you might render me   10.035425575261884
yes but we will talk of it   10.97084838078148
i have more reasons than you can imagine for desiring to know who he is from whence he came and whither he is going   7.158611191274521
i have studied chemistry because having determined to live in eastern climates i have been desirous of following the example of king mithridates   14.343741053815116
as the stranger asked the question he dragged the table beneath the window   9.563176409158228
at length he interrogates me   11.651942402959662
but under the present circumstances i am justified in doubting the wisdom of an old man who because he hated the father vents his anger on the son   11.268911919554261
and as the ideas presented themselves to her mind she repeated them aloud then finding that all her efforts elicited nothing but a constant no she said come since this plan does not answer i will have recourse to another   10.023348769708438
i shall have to watch the men who pick up balls   11.497653951794083
things go wonderfully   11.011282417380338
he was a picard whom the glorious musketeer had picked up on the bridge tournelle making rings and plashing in the water   12.227353823767388
40176m albert opened the paper it was an attestation of four notable inhabitants of yanina proving that colonel fernand mondego in the service of ali tepelini had surrendered the castle for two million crowns   7.619229946773016
is it not countess   8.07020823763089
i will leave the paternal home i will give up all   15.76178434932688
when he came within hearing he exclaimed i am pursued   11.677569173500228
let us not misunderstand each other replied monte cristo   11.829488933905115
said monte cristo compassionately it is a hard blow for a third rate fortune   12.269052138013237
yes and to hang me   8.621892530226367
help comrades help   12.686242896141625
danglars served together in spain my father in the army and m   14.14739773345641
i have ten left said the man for here are eleven and i had twenty one five more than last year   15.044710926527808
no hermine replied debray   15.076542546089115
then opening his coat and unbuttoning his waistcoat displayed his side pierced with a third wound   13.583259055454516
the host who was not endowed with great perspicacity did not observe the expression which his words had given to the physiognomy of the stranger   15.868289544405606
and what did you say to her   13.464617812879073
gone murmured valentine   7.692987883472444
but by what means   13.63077803520723
as we have said he perfectly understood the old man s vocabulary and if he did not use it more often it was only indifference and ennui which prevented him from so doing   17.4115941469212
you are quite upset   13.740029220346832
and we shall not be made chevaliers of the order this time   10.662640960100433
have you wanted money father   11.253228044193168
and therefore said d artagnan to clip the hope which athos s tacit adhesion had imparted to mazarin we shall not proceed to that violence save in the last extremity   9.829806855832476
what inconvenience can it be   8.465984780055297
mazarin wrote a few words which he gave to this man   14.765197446929168
although your majesty can bear witness that i have always taken her part warmly even against you   6.067585801463273
mousqueton who knew nothing of what was going on in the chateau wondered that the idea had not occurred to him sooner   12.018426423766615
now let us talk the matter over quietly said the count   8.524816566247132
we parted from him four days ago and we have reason to believe that he has reached paris before us   16.02380125162513
faintly murmured fernand but the word seemed to die away on his pale agitated lips and a convulsive spasm passed over his countenance   8.747746216710159
and you were right cried aramis and porthos with one voice   11.259893692986264
but asked dantès how long shall i have to wait   12.558739286519307
i understand cried athos with a gentle blush   12.111685818733603
the very name assumed by his host of monte cristo and again repeated by the landlord of the hôtel de londres abundantly proved to him that his island friend was playing his philanthropic part on the shores of piombino civita vecchia ostia and gaëta as on those of corsica tuscany and spain   11.578103600426507
oh you are an angel   10.435422797710249
what new calamity   10.554654621176258
have you confidence in me   14.011826044540364
i will go myself and fetch the lemonade   10.337738804277805
i say he is a myth replied albert and never had an existence   13.523031105168512
they attracted his admiration   11.247828547954441
i know very well that during the last four or five years misfortune has seemed to pursue m   12.681365997920315
really my lord you are his nightmare   14.193812538496582
hereafter being able to ask for me at all hours and consequently to take advantage of all opportunities you will probably obtain that which you desire   14.28907689695976
de villefort promise to call on him and i hope the visit will be returned   10.640691825883838
your breakfast shall be waiting   11.799954841723656
said morrel when he was alone with the count   11.097066385560577
well then listen   11.336238001400666
the circumstances are more serious than you perhaps believe   9.61518356485206
this strange unexpected terrible accusation has disordered your reason   15.168030081514711
as to his title and fortune as to that madame i have made over to him the estate of bragelonne my inheritance which will give him ten thousand francs a year and the title of vicomte   15.982330588517359
we came straight off a journey and are insurgents too   17.18290877844901
you should have traced her   17.36364089137186
milady smiled at this thought for felton was now her only hope her only means of safety   12.98928682235319
but you know he is now our friend   17.802171992719796
a greek   15.296063036308855
and in my opinion death may be a torture but it is not an expiation   11.103449930577236
and you my lord   12.43255724863716
but what the devil are you about aramis   7.237632512445037
noirtier you killed my father   21.486596337994406
and your bitter recollections have time to change themselves into sweet remembrances   22.32169742495737
that will be the most sincere line of conduct said mazarin   15.984744616883415
he is entirely devoted to the cardinal   8.594374959230239
in fact at the end of the rue vaugirard the gigantic porthos appeared   14.97197392826774
my master has commanded me to be discreet   6.234282845337341
what is the use of time rewards of merit medals crosses monthyon prizes if they do not lead society towards more complete perfection   13.699118075128263
it is only shown to me to terrify me that s all   9.986680027630754
cried the cavalier whom milady had designated as her brother stooping down to the height of the coach window   9.882600330720603
and i can set out immediately   10.761817978299028
again   15.474835948895125
let us see if she shuts the door after him he muttered   7.402380220223662
of the evil you have done said the voice   11.96170424789576
besides i was so seriously indisposed that i could not in any case have replied to them   6.365294679462723
he expressed to him the fears he entertained with respect to her majesty   13.465198411374885
the day after or two days after his visit to morrel he had disappeared   6.737539528985539
milady was wrong in fearing that mme   9.029872538310041
in a quarter of an hour at most   14.171417550586533
the price agreed upon between the englishman and the genoese builder was forty thousand francs   8.375812371157046
the valet led felton through a large hall in which waited the deputies from la rochelle headed by the prince de soubise and introduced him into a closet where buckingham just out of the bath was finishing his toilet upon which as at all times he bestowed extraordinary attention   14.74679836426084
her complexion might therefore deceive a person who saw her for the first time   8.096938594992292
and you know added d artagnan that whenever i catch him i will kill him this mordaunt   8.327677225200297
but this is infamous   13.301682480974238
well i had promised madame de villefort the loan of my carriage to drive tomorrow to the bois   6.34309244203088
she is a remarkable woman and i only regret that there does not exist another like her about twenty years younger   13.193871002301513
do you then love me   11.600651457513022
i should hate and despise myself as a coward did i desert the brave fellow in his present extremity   13.755027499550042
oh ours is a theological quarrel replied aramis making a sign to d artagnan to keep secret the cause of their duel   13.157538326364598
but still there are some signals only addressed to you   7.22517076919343
this time the gentleman closed his eyes and fainted   12.127319277900337
i will do everything your majesty commands replied d artagnan   10.596570711960013
the count then placed his foot on his head saying i know not what restrains me from crushing thy skull rascal   17.820056495853446
she caused the unfortunate duke of buckingham to be stabbed by a man who was ere that honest good and pure   9.578603799913841
then the police have vainly tried to lay hands on him   10.225869956066639
hey yes thank god i am pretty well said mousqueton   12.66286201887107
pardieu that s true   12.135988351315495
let us drink while the wine is fresh   15.959101126505523
milady smiled to herself at the idea which had occurred to her that this might be her old chambermaid   9.556059462519313
was it a corps sent out to make a diversion   10.080457890314003
athos at the same moment moved by a similar impulse looked back also   11.975775626073089
this petition to napoleon kept back by villefort had become under the second restoration a terrible weapon against him in the hands of the king s attorney   14.267255246599802
let me be on my guard   9.996125314149953
something bright   10.816085112375474
laporte broke the seal and placed the paper before the eyes of the duke   14.281902896072946
yours if you like   14.133272306412778
he could only be traced by the phosphorescent line in his wake   16.27525355288495
the count alone seemed unmoved nay more a slight color seemed striving to rise in his pale cheeks   14.574268511902353
and now my dear child adieu for the present   7.932665430371205
there is no doubt they went thither to fight themselves   4.588815021204267
now it never occurred to me to wish for a nearer inspection of these large insects with their long black claws for i always feared to find under their stone wings some little human genius fagged to death with cabals factions and government intrigues   14.6744125026263
you would be right porthos but for one thing which may change the current of your ideas   11.992932364771665
the curate related the incident to the count of san felice who sent for the little shepherd made him read and write before him ordered his attendant to let him eat with the domestics and to give him two piastres a month   8.242485892239896
but never mind that my boy go and announce your arrival and let her know all your hopes and prospects   9.873845523484224
i should think so   11.492614023709116
and you ought to thank her raoul   14.215051102513161
its odor charms one of my senses that is all i can say when i am asked why i praise it   10.281517701147862
louis xiii   8.086169909659839
benedetto you are fallen into terrible hands   10.3073673866602
i inquired of you if poisons acted equally and with the same effect on men of the north as on men of the south   13.393533083440621
planchet began to weep   11.380321469601915
is he a deputy   16.087421017523013
gave me some days before he died   16.038529641881162
he was called benedetto but he is ignorant of his real name having never known his parents   8.792711065204628
the names have been purposely concealed   8.605992642745647
the old man made a sign in the affirmative   13.764697763182967
but tell me valentine how has it all been effected   19.67136899165243
what then to do   8.824931349655913
no voice replied to hers   10.944402283070621
without speaking to anyone but yourself   5.828528843421832
do not be intimidated   11.81318363230858
take the post chaise which you will find waiting at the porte de gênes as you enter nice   12.38753632106555
would it not be safer and more certain if i should ask him his name and tell him yours   17.34041245805568
we have no time to lose in regaining our camp   10.557432689694853
it was now the coadjutor s turn to fix his piercing eyes on louvieres   13.291634623494726
but to whom then   17.96235440787524
it looked so gloomy i should never have bought it if my steward had not taken the matter into his own hands   14.850142017859511
morrel again fell on his knees and struck the ground with his forehead   13.215169417846079
besides how is it possible to avoid a little condescension toward a husband whose pretty wife has appointed a meeting with you that same evening at st   13.187159266249962
well now let us talk a little seriously said milady in her turn drawing her armchair nearer to d artagnan s chair   15.822770263772842
danglars motioned that he had nothing more to say   13.12820036960131
d artagnan gave him playful buffet on the shoulder and as they had reached the station where they were to breakfast the conversation ended there   11.96221433382837
exactly as i have the honor to tell your excellency   12.82795565076054
the walls are thick the doors strong and the bars solid   10.458851250151548
we heard i think the sound of her guzla but she remained perfectly invisible   14.972058025866698
that is why m   8.262132372555588
d artagnan rose took his hat as if it had been his intention to obey then opening quickly the door of a large closet instead of that leading to the staircase he buried himself amid the robes and dressing gowns of milady   10.173686073968701
he knew all objection would be useless and instantly determined how to act   14.146810609702724
but they were uttered in the romaic dialect   12.796884826175077
back   6.13355649949863
the rendezvous the first words that albert uttered to his friend on the following morning contained a request that franz would accompany him on a visit to the count   7.521293283863902
it is exquisite said athos cutting a slice which he placed on the young man s plate   14.246032581708288
the spectators saw the muskets leveled at them and divided between fear and curiosity remained noisy and excited   12.975675033640893
i know not whether he is still my friend but since that time i have remained his   3.999979835889105
do you find yourself badly lodged sister   17.28298513122497
as soon as they had disappeared behind a green curtain sufficiently thick to conceal them from the sight of any one who might be in pursuit they drew up to hold a council together   10.334575711282813
he entered without knocking or giving any other intimation of his presence as if he had been a friend or the master of the place   15.63691763740952
what have we all done then dear grandpapa   8.377632902788976
well then he is a bandit compared to whom the decesaris and the gasparones were mere children   15.89999219349737
really my dear count said morcerf what i admire in you is not so much your riches for perhaps there are people even wealthier than yourself nor is it only your wit for beaumarchais might have possessed as much but it is your manner of being served without any questions in a moment in a second   4.870449857088177
he would fain have gazed upon his gold and yet he had not strength enough   16.6102510602177
i don t need the quarter of such a sum i who am still only in the guards and by selling my saddles i shall procure it   8.273679092213333
but father take care   13.094115020192703
30277m indeed   12.244916892295965
grimaud signified his assent   9.207665234926726
i know nearly one thousand words which is all that is absolutely necessary although i believe there are nearly one hundred thousand in the dictionaries   9.790852158011834
come grimaud order dinner for yourself and when you have rested a little we can talk   11.091189316795852
light the candles in my apartment if you please   15.479430090048572
having said that they went out of the stable   11.09258030257429
the count had felt the influence of this happiness from the moment he entered the house and he remained silent and pensive forgetting that he was expected to renew the conversation which had ceased after the first salutations had been exchanged   9.312081094585473
for wherever you see madame herbault you have only to look within a circle of four yards and you will find m   11.044749925608741
i know something of him   11.067994144460407
his reserve his roughness and his silence made almost an old man of him   11.911022249546024
strike me   9.641646355610582
but buckingham did not even turn his head to see what became of those he had knocked down   17.18713744842402
make inquiry   16.187388420320904
there were benches here and there   12.956084466478977
and he lighted his cigar at vampa s torch   14.916973289145105
i have a son too and i should be very wroth with those who detained him from me after a three months voyage   15.875633863536798
how can she be so   9.378595185814351
continued the giant in his quiet manner   11.897313011874958
i think that with a hundred francs a month well   10.754929820621514
at the house of m   10.835756023694845
may i ask how much he allows the young man   18.00714202505231
asked comminges   6.778524912152257
you may count upon me my lord provided you want to make a complete upheaval of the city   11.277915268369826
have you not had enough time for reflection during the eight years which have elapsed since this marriage was first discussed between us   10.212963304922262
you understand dantès relations if he had any might have some interest in knowing if he were dead or alive   9.644521197615774
d artagnan smiled he was just the man to understand the astute italian   10.639111635205358
your excellency s carriage is at the door said he   4.61426801602985
the banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand   15.33950052390698
d artagnan took every smile for an insult and every look as a provocation whence it resulted that from tarbes to meung his fist was constantly doubled or his hand on the hilt of his sword   6.766044717031465
the four friends were reunited   17.48832979227709
but now he said that you are a widower your wife s connection can not injure you   11.120607962687254
when once more in her own apartment anne fell into a chair and wept   18.632466591902045
30047m he did not credit it at the period which i knew him said monte cristo touched to the heart by the accents of julie s voice   13.668326213107004
so much the better for me sir if you speak to me as you say with frankness for then you will do me the honor to esteem the resemblance of our opinions   14.702777154150683
ah she cried what a frightful dream   15.383744109358851
my first care was to run to the door   12.963797605533372
the witnesses endeavored to insist but the president bade them be silent   11.621518046244281
she stretched out her arms to him but they seized hold of her and one of the three none other than the accursed benedetto exclaimed put her to torture and she ll soon tell us where her money is   11.563430504859722
i know it and i expected this result   9.635924250854632
more pale and menacing than athos d artagnan stood on the threshold   9.421442450935773
then he made an exact inventory of everything and placed it in the most conspicuous part of the table after putting aside the books and papers which had collected there   15.115497294850062
we shall go out all the same   7.4994590008087165
at first i certainly did feel somewhat uneasy as to what fernand might be tempted to do   13.3305946856961
it was then only the coachman perceived the grooms were not behind the vehicle   10.624769907856962
said another guard who might have been thought asleep on a bench but who had lost not a syllable of the conversation do you suppose that men can escape their destiny   13.430389299040252
athos nodded affirmatively then turning and monsieur de bragelonne a young man fifteen years of age attached to the prince de condé has he the honor of being known to you   15.203453522324217
concerning a court intrigue in the meantime the forty pistoles of king louis xiii   11.631986140262086
don t you say dear d artagnan that it is the queen who has made choice of the convent for her   13.84373158922022
in going up to the target morcerf picked up two or three swallows that had been rash enough to come within the range of the count s pistol   9.347568789476675
have you a letter of audience   10.528848111972692
nevertheless isolated as he was we must say that the duke of buckingham did not experience an instant of fear   11.376360796532081
was a villain   11.774863217467226
follow wherever he leads you   9.114762482883407
she has never been so kind before   12.057298471931682
in what am i benefited by accompanying my son so far since i now abandon him and allow him to depart alone to the baneful climate of africa   14.447397219289043
at each moment in the midst of the crowd the buzzing and the laughter the door keeper s voice was heard announcing some name well known in the financial department respected in the army or illustrious in the literary world and which was acknowledged by a slight movement in the different groups   16.02971067228256
he received the travelers with his candlestick in one hand and his cotton nightcap in the other   10.990567992176496
i would willingly have said two words to mordaunt in this little desert   14.222227405172791
do not look i implore you my king   8.233556269662582
who would have suspected it   13.050799180596044
d artagnan tell us what sort of a night you have had and we will describe ours afterward   9.64566360942036
as long as i have known her always   15.441258299082003
have you anything as good to offer me as the two gentlemen who have left us   11.789420302964395
it asks if i am ready   15.302929738955854
but the easy chair of the old man was heard rolling along the floor and he soon made his appearance in the room   16.454861581451418
chapter 116   12.121583370163833
what business had you then to go into the chamber of monsieur d artagnan your neighbor with whom you had a long conference during the day   8.743848229947771
well my dear friend win it it is at the point of your sword   15.480739995558631
do you think it is time for us to enter the service   13.071750939628583
the count had three windows at the rospoli palace   13.678772565199079
nortier gives notice to these gentlemen replied barrois that he will give orders to be carried to the drawing room   6.02277890578698
then they came and boasted of their fine exploit in the cabaret of the next village where my brother and i were drinking   10.667019577652034
the plan is his own   9.907935193630852
faith he said in italian as he was reascending the steps and looking at a bag of reals faith there s enough to pay five councillors of parliament and two generals in paris   11.464558572636298
he s going to play us a trick   15.310245248701955
she was forced to return to tours   10.387079606356984
in a few minutes a night watch passed   14.758077547260957
there ll be firing   10.345579452240074
however he like cæsar borgia knew the value of time   10.167949495415861
said morrel sadly   14.266767145170995
murmured athos in a broken voice   6.409234959751361
well you see how a man may compromise himself when he does not know what he says replied athos shrugging his shoulders as if he thought himself an object of pity   16.735545329278523
athos smiled and d artagnan struck his hands together in anger and muttered the most convincing reasons that he could discover   12.316348523089482
but as i have told you it was too late   11.968445001488979
i will pay you two hundred for them said mazarin   15.009386971623954
what would you have two men without arms do against eight armed men   10.190934384114108
i swear to you i like no better than yourself to meet that viper in my path   15.927767421870609
then he turned to the various articles he had left behind him put the black cravat and blue frock coat at the bottom of the portmanteau threw the hat into a dark closet broke the cane into small bits and flung it in the fire put on his travelling cap and calling his valet checked with a look the thousand questions he was ready to ask paid his bill sprang into his carriage which was ready learned at lyons that bonaparte had entered grenoble and in the midst of the tumult which prevailed along the road at length reached marseilles a prey to all the hopes and fears which enter into the heart of man with ambition and its first successes   6.089212851210069
in his most simple actions as well as in his most secret thoughts i find a relation to my own   15.08953298794454
but he thought of his oath and he would not break it   7.029816234349161
after having touched felt examined these treasures edmond rushed through the caverns like a man seized with frenzy   14.964453954551818
but i was going to tell you that i met m   9.20152012763548
but as claudius said to hamlet it is a law of nature   12.094811114905427
we discovered yesterday the truth   16.641991407899642
i landed here regulated the affairs of the vessel and hastened to visit my affianced bride whom i found more lovely than ever   6.231582662832534
well said mme   8.669425865982062
oh she would like it but but what   10.676006926025595
here is what each of the parties concerned gained by that treaty monsieur de conti received damvilliers and having made his proofs as general he succeeded in remaining a soldier instead of being made cardinal   8.993411362309672
it was however necessary to affect weakness and pain not a very difficult task for so finished an actress as milady   16.406961961557116
monte cristo concealed himself behind a large tomb and awaited the arrival of morrel who by degrees approached the tomb now abandoned by spectators and workmen   10.786719851518209
he was a nobleman a man equal to buckingham in every respect   13.015355167911684
morrel at his death left 500 000 francs which were divided between my sister and myself for we were his only children   13.384439934949574
but still her voice involuntarily murmured softly edmond edmond edmond   5.489112305593798
well be assured added he with the familiarity of a gascon you shall not wait long   9.476557819661886
they were one in the rue de vaugirard no   10.424837755696252
and if he gets out of prison he will come and see me the first thing and what would he think if i did not wait here for him   9.163488891417773
gradually the reception room filled and some of our old friends made their appearance we mean debray château renaud and beauchamp accompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar in literature or the army for m   11.208912262883745
somebody he perceived was in the courtyard moving stealthily   11.852201699967589
the countess paused a moment   10.431816913485921
we thought so too monsieur   8.588597281374692
a great favor   12.018717723893934
privately   8.390338610945216
so i am of these men   12.271113317474281
god bless his majesty   11.578632263937942
cried the cardinal a venetian glass   11.546334820532337
and yet frightful though this spot may be it is looked upon as a kind of paradise by the men whose days are numbered   11.161768792244137
i regret that i ever crossed swords with you porthos   14.274276354975706

he was certainly eating and noisily too like an ill bred man   14.94512133563659
he had observed between the house that madame de longueville inhabited and the convent of the jesuits an open space surrounded by a hedge   15.042854753767962
oh you don t see straight said danglars   8.175084184401848

and pray what do you call such an action   19.513081247151263
i approached and recognized that little kitty whom our friend aramis had placed with her   9.214774629158867
was my mother   10.890093957003907
his devotion and the compassion he showed for her misfortunes produced the effect they always produce on noble minds mercédès had always had a sincere regard for fernand and this was now strengthened by gratitude   14.232883803854715
in your service excellency where everything is learned   11.593709172129763
i grasped the railings   11.292706238449943
but as the banker had accompanied andrea madame danglars appeared to take no notice of it   14.649415545872774
yes duke yes i know you are very indulgent toward the queen too indulgent perhaps   8.796709347984066
i reasoned thus money time and fatigue are nothing compared with the reputation and interests of a whole family   15.945930677976
steps were heard approaching nearer and nearer   13.775594997016908
it is i myself   9.2213684496003
pray ask me whatever questions you please   14.389000926615108
we are to meet our friends at the hotel at eleven   13.129938091538646

his best known work is the three graces now in the louvre   7.154177834356511
if anyone had said to your father at the moment he raised the pistol to his head if anyone had told me when in my prison i pushed back the food i had not tasted for three days if anyone had said to either of us then live the day will come when you will be happy and will bless life   13.766990445256315
my profession condemns me to celibacy   10.028293203868092
it really was i whom your excellency expected at seven o clock this evening   9.373432810429346
impossible madame impossible   10.253678115392276
there was nothing remarkable in the circumstance of a fragment of granite giving way and falling heavily below   13.201380918098472
said milady to herself   2.7605469183926754
still further the jew told them that if they would sell it to him as it would make a magnificent pendant for earrings he would give five hundred pistoles for it   15.266288645268357
then he knelt down made the sign of the cross and lowering his face to the planks as if he would have kissed them said in a low tone in french comte de la fere are you there   12.547505600875306
the cardinal approached the table and without sitting down wrote a few lines upon a parchment of which two thirds were already filled and affixed his seal   8.627543799807269
then are your names gentlemen   8.426028848248219
and now whenever he wishes well whenever he wishes   12.927237124606096
beppo got in inviting the frenchman to follow him and he did not wait to be asked twice   9.103709252427254
i myself felt a strange kind of fascination at the sight of all this gold and all these bank notes   8.263700630126364
bonacieux when her husband had shut the street door and she found herself alone   10.49751547464698
you have 200 000 livres a year and you prevent her son from enjoying these 200 000 livres   9.241429890694095

remember chimed in la carconte those two could crush you at a single blow   7.1154662728147935
her two paddle wheels were like two wings with which she skimmed the water like a bird   10.55509891717173
then tis i who am mistaken for you have always been a good chronologist   8.048635935051536
milady looked at the officer with one of those terrible expressions peculiar to her countenance and which so rarely failed of their effect   16.49680618990151
mazarin started turned toward the comte de la fere and looking for an instant at that grand and honest countenance took the pen   6.4280030295631585
those who were in the chariot opened the doors and presented arms   7.7393288437163665
and on her affirmative answer being given he conducted her by a private passage to m   15.184355913345762
planchet only touched the tips of the count s fingers   5.605895574874372
in the name of the king i arrest you   13.53700396187574
it is not only a right but a duty   16.947070463958823
were you present during the last struggle   10.849815546862214
groslow jumped up ashamed at being surprised in the midst of wine cards and dice   15.65724696731671
see him there cold as marble and proud like his father   19.666186694282516
at the first words of the song the men seated round the fire arose and approached the landing place their eyes fixed on the boat evidently seeking to know who the new comers were and what were their intentions   16.906352397531712
i see no one and yet the ladder didn t come down of itself   11.891355925028897
well then cried d artagnan pray let grimaud search them and throw them over the walls   14.73878752703759
mademoiselle de villefort my step daughter said madame de villefort to monte cristo leaning back on her sofa and motioning towards valentine with her hand   11.732680985096161
but why is my grandfather allowed to live   11.361018831032517
he arrives from the army and has he says a letter to remit to you on the part of the marechal de grammont i think   12.251463268315177
tell me truly maximilian whether in former days when our fathers dwelt at marseilles there was ever any misunderstanding between them   9.631608301128509
madame de villefort uttered a wild cry and a hideous and uncontrollable terror spread over her distorted features   12.85508176340981
when will you do that   10.29513627099173
d artagnan had often meditated against the perfidious host one of those hearty vengeances which offer consolation while they are hoped for   8.44876477201843
said d artagnan that s settled already   9.511077432631707
lord winter answers for his regiment or at least very nearly so we will not split straws about words let him place himself at the head of his men we will place ourselves at the side of your majesty and we will mow a swath through cromwell s army and reach scotland   10.149808754655764
listen my dear friend   10.172488243231394
why he remarked to gaetano you told me that signor sinbad was going to malaga while it seems he is in the direction of porto vecchio   3.414160078016037
he is the curate of bethune sir and was carrying the holy vessels belonging to his church and the treasure of the chapter to a safe place the prince having abandoned our town yesterday   9.669201193881351
without it i should be tried in a court of justice because i did not raise the alarm   4.691973542296465
it is evident sir that your position has kept you out of relation to men and affairs   21.657628031132766
i will give a faithful account of the sum to your lordship said planchet putting the bag under his arm   11.824617294645641
he was as this remark shows a man full of philanthropy and in every way fit for his office   11.809983772762678
fortunately i was so well concealed that he could not find me   6.080423432916798
come come you won t tell me you don t know aramis   12.691071424765923
exclaimed monte cristo shuddering   15.810303646384394
since there are two of them already there let us add a third   10.866309878971947
however for my part i would rather die unshriven than have anything to say to such a confessor   12.528162749872774
this evening with you to morrow at stuart s the next day with me   13.007535009323144
my orders were to carry him off alive or dead   6.354134755871538
for notwithstanding all my sorrows and my tortures i show you today a face which the happiness of revenge makes young again a face you must often have seen in your dreams since your marriage with mercédès my betrothed   17.09887598493086
large rooms completely stripped of furniture bare walls upon which here and there shone the old gold moldings which had resisted time and neglect windows with broken panes impossible to close no carpets neither guards nor servants this is what first met the eyes of athos to which he touching his companion s elbow directed his attention by his glances   8.618800686652586
and if i may without impertinence ask where are you going   15.49208705250705
hope my friend repeated the count   17.041479083448255
the reader hushed herself instantly   7.061169969356291
it was not poverty which had broken her spirit   11.10962697645618
and the same love for you eh my dear child   8.183410255550298
said franz continuing his investigation   10.483636763826983
still baron said monte cristo family griefs or indeed any other affliction which would crush a man whose child was his only treasure are endurable to a millionaire   13.239992290449367
there is no occasion to tell you my lord that the minister knew for a fact that these ornaments had sailed away with the ambassador who was far away beyond seas   12.335706194270944
if we are not we shall have all the time to talk and nobody will hear us for i guarantee the walls of the bastion have no ears   5.2008471505694365
for you   12.47882594553363
his interlocutor whose head appeared through the carriage window was a woman of from twenty to two and twenty years   12.660622672257515
request her also to oblige me by saying whether it is her pleasure to dine with me   11.981143783480578
and they both went into a low room where there were foils gloves masks breastplates and all the accessories for a fencing match   3.9273813543734857
i certainly never will get drunk again d artagnan   13.181817316225025
athos went close to it and distinguished some words that appeared to merit so great an interest that he made a sign to his friends to be silent remaining himself bent with his ear directed to the opening of the lower orifice   11.535939403702008
every one hoped so so that the minister felt that all around him beneath the homage of the courtiers lay a fund of hatred ill disguised by fear and interest   11.709485733099047
monsieur laporte go to them and again recommend silence   6.734820152744586
i saw amid the shadows the table sink through the floor   11.865120181315145
as soon as the enemy are within musket shot we must fire upon them   14.450063049774037
in fact as this last reflection indicated this instinctive return to hope sentiments of weakness or fear did not dwell long in her ardent spirit   12.23477358767236
you will see replied monte cristo that they will be as different as possible in the hands of ali   17.145938506577917
is it as good now   12.555763862960362
then certain that there could be no mistake in the execution of her orders she started her horse and disappeared   10.057660886446143
he sleeps indeed   10.98729462152965
that is whether you really love me   16.272771509838726
they rode on in this way for ten minutes   8.165849302369553
i was still stupid from our yesterday s debauch   17.63070138085301
i guessed all   10.5634611527133
de monte cristo would eat nothing in our house   14.052567378132387
so then they have paid my ransom   15.184179973385604
is there anything else i can assist you in discovering besides the villany of your friends   14.020485163185082
ah that is a good joke   13.00964613452921
very good said the major i do not demand more you understand your visit here today is not of your own suggestion is it   9.970221328503559
the diamond is real   12.048265731478802
at last their hilarity calmed down and faith   12.878919085528318
oh no never said planchet i will never leave monsieur d artagnan   6.791831459002205
yes yes i know how good a son you are so now hasten away to see your father   7.5934720712624095
there is no situation however terrible it may be which can authorize a creature of god to inflict death upon himself   14.817804082920926
you are right said d artagnan   7.00906933373923
the guards under the command of m   11.604412946503633
he must know it this moment and perhaps it is already too late   13.936054536067928
unfortunately for d artagnan among the spectators was one of his eminence s guardsmen who still irritated by the defeat of his companions which had happened only the day before had promised himself to seize the first opportunity of avenging it   17.315762677738807
there now whispered the governor it is just as i told you   9.71730358131129
they don t burn sorcerers nowadays   17.559486720688604
if at this moment the sweet voice of renée had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy or the fair mercédès had entered and said in the name of god i conjure you to restore me my affianced husband his cold and trembling hands would have signed his release   9.237867919969702
i should have liked to have made you the offer of these horses   14.834453231857289
the dog performed three evolutions around the circle and laid himself with the deepest respect at the feet of monsieur de chavigny who at first seemed inclined to like the joke and laughed long and loud but a frown succeeded and he bit his lips with vexation   13.516913874998947
but instead of either of these he saw nothing but a strange face sunburnt and encircled by a beard with eyes brilliant as carbuncles and a smile upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white teeth pointed and sharp as the wolf s or jackal s   10.744463383244783
yes i insist on it said albert whose mind was beginning to get bewildered with the excitement of his feelings   11.225039082730106
then she had pushed him away and directed the coachman to stop at the hotel de luynes   14.854735822164223
the devil he is   9.281679971058844
you do not speak affectionately to me benedetto my old friend that is not right take care or i may become troublesome   9.64842116491382
he smiles at them   9.682642043905345
do you know monsieur de tréville their captain   10.638742659445233
why it is after one o clock   9.896263601864488
then grimaud lifting the dagger from the pool of blood which was gliding along the room to the horror of all present made a sign to the host to follow him paid him with a generosity worthy of his master and again mounted his horse   14.914486029570089
edward the infant phenomenon who is quite an adept in the art of killing   5.61762793746996
and he is in the fort l evêque   17.00380296157566
he descended or rather seemed to descend several steps inhaling the fresh and balmy air like that which may be supposed to reign around the grotto of circe formed from such perfumes as set the mind a dreaming and such fires as burn the very senses   18.580621295971554
he was nineteen when he entered the château d if   12.926200744473856
and you are happy   16.15389238064737

valentine will you not go and see if your grandpapa will have his dinner   16.812234776872558
between these large dishes were smaller ones containing various dainties   17.2134680601494
it is five years since he was here last and he did well to sell the house for it did not bring him in anything at all   4.587916788240092
as to the government of normandy replied the queen i think i can promise   13.24113937874123
why if today before eleven o clock your father has not found someone who will come to his aid he will be compelled at twelve o clock to declare himself a bankrupt   12.74688597431065
he resumed his listening but unfortunately the toilet was finished   9.3295022240183
why should an exception be made in her favor   14.422316905753824
they will kill him you may be sure of it   10.101422928910965
he freed his weapon made a lunge and touched his adversary on the shoulder   9.473979374954169
but how inquired i am i to maintain myself and my poor sister   15.007133345117897
then the noise of two bolts by which milady fastened herself in   13.531967440276235
the man whom athos had come so far to seek and whom he had found with so much trouble introduced him into his laboratory where he was engaged in fastening together with iron wire the dry bones of a skeleton   6.549980604144849
as the gascon had foreseen they easily obtained three hundred pistoles on the ring   13.016634928168006
besides the physician might declare the ailment feigned   11.17067314398548
i hope the carnival will not pass without some amends in one shape or the other   9.091082221702248
the doctors are embalming the corpse and when it is ready it will be placed in a lighted chapel   11.759515674240369
andrea sketched two windows in the room which formed an angle on the plan and appeared as a small square added to the rectangle of the bedroom   17.915484903677104
his coat looks nearly new and his boots are brilliant   14.219634176824485
when someone came and brought her a handkerchief from her laundress   14.25210715327858
and i desist from my pretensions said aramis   13.241445447519682
morrel raised his head and reading the eyes of the old man which gleamed with unnatural lustre stay he said m   11.749789073545612
how many are there   8.492762409756944
the abbé shook his head in token of disapproval and refused to make any further response   10.895814048818135
duc d harcourt fontrailles and the others escaped   14.647380470143595
i gave orders for my coupé to follow me   11.133462571668959
never mind that maximilian said monte cristo smiling   14.143923817686279
to what country   12.133224189245913

i finish your phrase   8.987197941108885
in the first instance to marseilles madame   12.384744940106511
when he believed that the right moment had arrived he took the knife pried open the teeth which offered less resistance than before counted one after the other twelve drops and watched   15.036495873252258
and you really mean to say   9.61213435019863
and she rushed out of the room   13.506919002044452
a mere child   10.056430971548064
i am patient but go on   16.896979283672835
the two friends were crouching down meantime behind a tub in the side alley   10.90532399435039
de boville your widows and orphans must oblige me by waiting twenty four hours since m   17.803636412837996
yes the marechal de grammont is right   14.142310891071144
you will promise not to betray me   11.42253257222329
but what must be done   11.780723777203338

he now called himself du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds and resided on his new estate   13.09292817127173
oh yes sir you are right it is fatality   10.006806940410987

de monte cristo is our enemy   6.930778669962066
d artagnan went straight to the stables   13.53264776885325
the inspector kept his word with dantès   8.406846843867493
beside his taste for the fine arts which luigi had carried as far as he could in his solitude he was given to alternating fits of sadness and enthusiasm was often angry and capricious and always sarcastic   15.975929554834696
dantès remained a prisoner and heard not the noise of the fall of louis xviii   12.204076441348118
but i shall have a priest of vulgar mind whose career and fortune i have ruined by my misfortune   14.659755551010166
you think he has   11.9639337330573
danglars who really began to experience sundry gnawings at the stomach arose softly again applied his eye to the crack of the door and recognized the intelligent countenance of his guide   16.73034147981227
this same person with almost incredible patience and perseverance had contrived to provide himself with tools requisite for so unparalleled an attempt   12.529396525597603
said athos who are going to be killed in order that monsieur de bouillon may have his estate at sedan restored to him that the reversion of the admiralty may be given to the duc de beaufort and that the coadjutor may be made a cardinal   15.9010620563736
and yet that villain benedetto will escape   15.179532802214712
and my counsel to you nay my prayer is to retain his friendship   12.693823258934668
when he had finished he went to a table upon which was a salver with spanish wine and glasses   10.7863768006788
i mean that the wife of the first magistrate in the capital shall not by her infamy soil an unblemished name   14.811799710107003

albert seized it and as franz had no reason to suppose it was meant for him he suffered albert to retain it   9.556647417098487
then throwing himself back in his carriage danglars called out to his coachman in a voice that might be heard across the road to the chamber of deputies   10.552982028090096
never had a first attempt been crowned with more perfect success   14.430690813275836
a shade of melancholy gravity overspread his countenance which was not natural to him   16.44615387813151

beauchamp proceeded to relate to the young man who was overwhelmed with shame and grief the following facts   14.551214561336346
the englishman quite triumphant did not even give himself the trouble to shake the dice   8.46587481676538

morcerf took his hat and left the room   2.7244048639092906

in her room with the notary   13.062667668063472
it seemed as if his feet were rooted to the ground and his eyes on the count of morcerf   11.865546857953028
he took care not to do so monsieur   10.009782208849678

there d artagnan was asleep upon a bench   14.777217547158584
her womanly pride and her queenly dignity had both been so cruelly offended that she could not come round at the first advance   14.619872890322355
but pardieu if you don t calm yourself i will design a second fleur de lis upon one of those pretty cheeks   9.335515842832724
said andrea carelessly apparently forgetting him whom he but too well recollected   9.462675008386402
then the count added aloud was his name ever known   10.508578941124433

a ground floor ornamented with arabesques bathing its terraces in the water and another floor looking on the lake was all which was visible to the eye   11.095570019825143
caderousse terrified looked at the count   14.670382164750908

look at this ray of light which enters by my window said the abbé and then observe the lines traced on the wall   10.694975439568884
i suppose the count has the tastes of the day   6.863929408778549
and d artagnan passed to the other side of the room with porthos and aramis   15.901323011310733
it resulted from these antecedents that everyone entered heartily into the purpose for which they met   13.437277058398989
the chevalier who no doubt was near the door entered immediately   10.619157679306642
no monsieur replied the young man   15.054718274273524
tell me i entreat you my dear doctor that you may be deceived   10.425660530322208
said caderousse shaking his head   12.191048628777015
that is a strange question said aramis   14.235766524320507
but i must write   9.347441976727847
and one fine morning in better health than ever before he set out for france   5.0120637831318895
i am in the vein   9.792340049743574

it is the sort of malady which we call monomania said the doctor   11.245934601685242
let me save the last   13.253595687194986
you perceive then that he is not happy   12.324274045608794
does that alarm you   14.548437382431946
and in the middle of a deathlike silence charles calm lofty and with his head still covered sat down again in his arm chair   17.375620538374157
that night then was somewhat riotous as may be imagined   16.39817276006258
politics has made you laugh at everything and political men have made you disbelieve everything   17.972462542976576
count said he i thank you for your hospitality which i would gladly have enjoyed longer   11.834524548252295
for was it not your fatal and sanguinary intention to destroy that son of whom m   13.205543064509802
30041m i am sorry to see observed monte cristo to morrel that i cause no small disturbance in your house   13.854101565698956
he then closed the door of the landing   17.977213781096456
ah continued my father still frowning their idolized emperor treated these madmen as they deserved   19.82035088986828
during the whole five years in which the duc de beaufort had been in prison not a day had passed in which the cardinal had not felt a secret dread of his escape   9.86012397080145
the judge we remember that the abbé busoni remained alone with noirtier in the chamber of death and that the old man and the priest were the sole guardians of the young girl s body   11.713186373796503
you rely on the usurper s return   10.664259213890137
so that i have no society   13.893735089956545
d artagnan felt the truth of this reproach   14.153650305950935
in this frame of mind grateful for the accidental meeting with planchet pleased with himself d artagnan reached notre dame   8.644501260036993
by her step she must be young   16.067318215454627
and as a proof of what i say permit me to declare i am rejoiced to see you safe and sound   10.232186079307763
well on my word of honor i answered no   17.93154803641739
come in here said d avrigny and he took him into the chamber where the sick man lay   13.819509624364695
they saw no one and the bastion seemed abandoned   10.30833948675476
steps were distinctly heard in the corridor and on the stairs   14.682954400430777
you can turn their suspicions and save my life   11.627698568162817
said grimaud he is coming out   12.324468136991685
the sellers of moccoletti entered on the scene   13.669594700156104
while the count smiled at hearing this song which made him lose sight of andrea in the recollection of benedetto madame danglars was boasting to monte cristo of her husband s strength of mind who that very morning had lost three or four hundred thousand francs by a failure at milan   18.58275091108491
would you dare to lift your hand to your queen   10.365496040720345
and i who have sworn to take him dead or alive i am dishonored and by you   13.856933090442944
my lord my lord you invoke in your defense things which accuse you more strongly   13.671480495730723
among my friends of other times   12.52144060586272

but we must have some supper instantly and a carriage for tomorrow and the following days   10.342584198243737
he s patronized by bazin   14.981856600886633
they conducted me to the chatelet where i slept soundly being very sure that on the next day i should go forth free   9.241094347327163
which was the real delinquent   13.393424977812517
his bright eyes kindled and his mouth so finely formed assumed a wicked smile   10.80722354646974
gentlemen said andrea commanding silence by his voice and manner   13.00349374828993
a bruise   14.016025332803576
they sat down to dinner   12.960363117338911
and in two months and a half if you do not hear of us take possession of them   14.16108745743986
chapter 76   14.023622114782476
are they not as like as two drops of water to d artagnan and porthos   16.20401256799486
and i am very happy in having found you again my dear son   11.401333525734092
hope alone makes me almost mad what will not reality do   9.441763240799569
my friend continued morrel you named the fifth of october as the end of the period of waiting today is the fifth of october he took out his watch it is now nine o clock i have yet three hours to live   13.666199162647308
do you recollect how you used to lick your fingers   11.68535005148547
that he had come at about ten o clock in the evening to pay a visit to his friend m   9.491182242645806
steps were heard in the passage   13.153913908410619
the secretary bowed and retired   12.702571104181278
and now raoul said he you are launched   16.273850318998306
at midnight i will be at your house   8.313810491820085
only i warn you that when i reside in a country i conform to all its code and i have no wish to put myself within the compass of the french laws for your sake   12.407261319512408
her poetic and excited mind pictured it as the soul of her grandmother   13.632671377278673
yes said albert blushing   8.57773804303297
faria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt   17.031351030669946
bonacieux had declared to him by all the gods that she did not know aramis   12.505286164492004
for i madame i may say i was your victim when wounded dying i was abandoned by the surgeons   14.110210960646441
i only wait till you give them   5.746175574679291
the procureur entered with the same grave and measured step he would have employed in entering a court of justice   10.594401453936907
i should not like to be groslow if he meets him   12.121630979824584
and you ate in your carriage   13.610186734030165
30075m really madame this is a scruple which naturally must occur to a pure mind like yours but which would easily yield before sound reasoning   7.4420774463496375
so they made this song about her laboissiere dis moi   16.387136257984718
our game is beaten up   7.461318370419661
i was forced to read the address to know to whom to give it   15.174173328550793
de blacas i must change your armorial bearings   13.20636209078094
these glances frequently exasperated the pride of danglars but this evening he took no notice of them   9.430122343837134
he was desirous of an explosion because in that case the mine throws forth fire and fire enlightens   11.638094863509883
cried porthos who was not completely taken in by d artagnan s gasconades   7.253481727942445
that then he would have 50 000 remaining which would be sufficient to save him from starvation   13.669307977580633
they placed themselves on guard   14.680103972686934
come morrel it is not like a soldier to be so bad a judge of courage   12.358025687770583
when at last the blade had been entirely withdrawn a red froth issued from the mouth of the wounded man and a stream of blood spouted afresh from the wound when he at length drew breath   9.823825140331714
oh sir said she clasping her hands   11.410925853691532
by the lord my good host   11.466755893343796
pale motionless overwhelmed by this frightful revelation dazzled by the superhuman beauty of this woman who unveiled herself before him with an immodesty which appeared to him sublime he ended by falling on his knees before her as the early christians did before those pure and holy martyrs whom the persecution of the emperors gave up in the circus to the sanguinary sensuality of the populace   3.016875826504114
my mother is wishing to go to the sea side what day is fixed for your dinner   15.055012703923392
and in his turn the duke bowed low to monsieur de chavigny   13.27783370272606
why what is the matter   10.122428161457073
i said the origin of his fortune remained obscure   7.523713936993305
there wasn t any trouble over treaties when it was a question of shooting the poor duc d enghien   9.474743949411717
i am sorry for that said d artagnan   12.263463116528413
beauchamp replied florentin   15.447954184723665
for what reason is all this fume and fury   12.875692007889775
but while d artagnan was discussing the price with the dealer athos was counting out the money on the table   5.662649261120828
asked kitty   17.36031832885625
i am going to her   17.3270749511766
adieu adieu dearest edmond   12.412299817718248

athos look at mordaunt s smile   14.420856905861992
he strove to collect a band of followers and followed the footsteps of decesaris and gasparone whom he hoped to surpass   11.88143560527624
what is your name in your turn if you please   12.563392204748107
my misgivings had been but too true   14.522574092655407
beauchamp who had watched with sincere pity the young man s paroxysm of grief approached him   16.55234376952783

the queen uttered a cry of surprise and entered the carriage and the king and monsieur took their places at her side   13.133745373632399
comminges saw that he was undecided   12.001427688218742
milady recognized his step   8.946669478088193
this was delirium   15.574233324311283
asked the captain who was attentively reading plutarch s life of alexander   6.661482335123119
but the inflexibility of the procureur should stop there   11.715879918717741
parry was not wrong   13.425071104550238
at this moment the young man returned   14.916668900403625

you are right to recall me to myself maximilian he said   17.882286898637297
at the sight of that respectable gentleman sitting opposite to us in the same box with the lovely greek girl   11.434733895761532
yes sir he said in a softened tone   9.770197272219258
his forehead broad and majestic   11.664395141914664

villefort s impatience during this scene made the perspiration roll from his forehead and franz was stupefied   14.761832690660881
with madame   13.081440781952882
the return to la rochelle therefore was profoundly dull   10.524611718347227
my husband had been at liberty these two or three days   11.777607134644448

her son   10.92881378982417
for an instant he feared lest instead of keeping in shore she should stand out to sea   10.517264718233966

the brigadier followed by the commissary disappeared by the inside staircase accompanied by the noise which his assertions respecting andrea had excited in the crowd   11.725101716234937
cried the sentinel who was less abstracted and who saw by the lamp light a shadow approaching his chief   13.79930624848059
he then tried to draw him from his moist abode but to his surprise he perceived that athos staggered   11.753673052772434

my lord has perhaps no faith in those words   16.058099752733458
murmured madame danglars   4.580876038554466
occasionally the marks were hidden under tufts of myrtle which spread into large bushes laden with blossoms or beneath parasitical lichen   12.485269937144967
noirtier turned pale and made a sign that he wished to speak   12.055071198350626
but my own opinion is she is a genoese   13.84721930857698
it was cold and motionless   10.027458205797792
then you will not leave me albert   8.781151082924257
that was five years ago   13.424146599891714

franz sprang back but the count seized his arm and held him before the window   11.440396991991737
they walked arm in arm occupying the whole width of the street and taking in every musketeer they met so that in the end it became a triumphal march   15.658671666899277
excessively   8.24351770895443
she looked so pale this morning i scarcely knew her   7.459496856928115
a slight shock the dull noise of three balls which penetrated the flesh a last cry a convulsion of agony proved to d artagnan that the would be assassin had saved his life   10.52166614234627
this postscript decreased greatly the young girl s happiness   11.147494674186056
we will arrange the matter rather better   10.07497113847322
be satisfied   18.783169034864553
on the spot it had occupied was a circular space exposing an iron ring let into a square flag stone   12.092773126298546
the ravisher stopped suddenly his knees bent under him and he fell with teresa in his arms   8.900731915369587
it was evident the good fellow had not gone to such an expense on his own account   13.495750111047169
paul the spot where such as were condemned at the bastille were executed he was near fainting and crossed himself twice   15.16554785923186
the count laughed   11.330735966252302
presently a good solid wooden ladder was placed against the window   12.940866527601829
mordaunt was livid but he uttered no cry nor called for assistance   14.083389173246573
no my dear fellow returned the young man seating himself on the divan   11.553777580970594
porthos had his fits   12.920173271040607
the host was in a lower and back room to which athos was requested to go   8.287475437448194
i can not now repeat to you sir all the eloquent words and imploring language he made use of   8.746799693246167
sit down said the old man   8.288871096960174
at first they saw nothing around them   9.256577555370175
i think that matters look very gloomy madame   11.959171428680756
but as you are the strongest after all continued d artagnan don t be furious with old men and women and keep your wrath for more appropriate occasions   14.049395423175316
i shall be about again in a few days   11.884112197183915
morrel smiled mournfully   7.89349504009866
are you out of your senses or do you come peaceably to take breakfast with me   11.984677130622613
the following morning they arrived at châlons where the count s steamboat waited for them   10.423090993549586
said the stranger   7.292943205118553
franz heard the words of the count but imperfectly and he perhaps did not fully appreciate this new attention to their wishes   13.566022637894102
well my dear dantès are you now free   9.998617916130843

he had gone down about three quarters of the length of the wall when the cord broke   7.356409461384137
then from time to time there came to him an albanian who said something to which i paid no attention but which he always answered in the same tone of voice either kill or pardon   17.006099830921762
nevertheless do not believe that it is madame de longueville with whom i am in love   13.793520581608444
the jeweller meanwhile was humming a song as he stood warming his back at the fire la carconte had kindled to dry the wet garments of her guest   17.238988796589577
she will help me   14.029160831841999
advancing to the opening he stooped and raised the stone easily in spite of its weight   8.914602519010703
andrea cavalcanti found his tilbury waiting at the door   8.781263236692187
monsieur de beaufort sent his cavalry toward etampes and monsieur de chanleu who defended the place was ready to resist an assault or if the enemy were repulsed to attempt a sortie   12.626748599074038

but silence silence   9.005163607109397
no no cried the abbé   10.861170259447167
his eyes met those of the young girl and he could not bear their brilliancy   8.443171625957781
as for you raoul i am sure it is your fault some giddiness or folly   10.149006212673115
anne had enforced the utmost secrecy and had disclosed the event to no one except the prince de condé who had sent five or six hundred horsemen into the environs of saint germain with orders to bring in any suspicious person who was going away from rueil in whatsoever direction it might be   13.984317432963547

d artagnan turned to look at his friends   17.33739225187154
in fact he slowly and respectfully approached the prelate and spoke to him privately a few words to which the latter responded by an affirmative sign   11.557597794071368
kitty was but too well aware of that   15.819578138415473
i was retreating on foot for my horse was dead   11.797942731854292
in the first place i must be satisfied that you are the person i am in search of   17.29322107304207

from this time the prisoner resolved to suffer no longer but to have everything he wanted   11.802204638644712
i m your man   9.001372517814563
it was about nine o clock in the morning   11.90272573131565
doubtless he is capricious but that is all   8.768552033746149
exclaimed dantès what is the matter   16.039850735297314
you heard it for the first time at marseilles twenty three years ago the day of your marriage with mademoiselle de saint méran   11.773890760807072
the eyes of all shone fiercely as they made their demand and the red light of the fire made them look like demons   14.341743793628424
oh you are beautiful always beautiful   8.865460922768051
it is true the cardinal had been particularly ill tempered   10.426336048695585

oh count you overwhelm me with that coolness   15.575075186597385

and no one thinks of us in this country for each must think about his own affairs   10.420333329498852
the faint glimpses of the pale moon hidden momentarily by masses of dark clouds that were sweeping across the sky whitened the gravel walks that led to the house but were unable to pierce the obscurity of the thick shrubberies in which a man could conceal himself without any fear of discovery   7.642496448674602
no said villefort rising hastily   7.8340587188073645
and me said athos she is my wife   6.651372889700328
the host on seeing a young man followed by a lackey with two extra horses advanced respectfully to the door   14.41420613917216
i do not know if he does not even go so far as to say that it rains   8.637690092345466
let these three gentlemen pass   7.491795066736995
he said but can t we have post horses   8.818122023389263

19 in the old greek legend the atreidae or children of atreus were doomed to punishment because of the abominable crime of their father   9.962491416953643

the first time he broke my arm   10.53712148542568
excellently athos but what are you looking for   10.33319880321891
when albert returned to his mother he found her in the boudoir reclining in a large velvet armchair the whole room so obscure that only the shining spangle fastened here and there to the drapery and the angles of the gilded frames of the pictures showed with some degree of brightness in the gloom   9.042516879280113
at madame de villefort s proposition he instantly winked his eyes   11.378399150683924
laporte said the queen suppose you put one of your sons in the king s place   8.707822481296223
but you have constituted yourself my enemy therefore i say what does that signify to me sir   9.416446930128412
the king opened it and found in it two diamond studs   6.184063391806142
but do not speak and do not listen   9.98121788147424
a cloud passed over danglars brow   9.165450628285093
he found his carriage at the door and doing his utmost to restrain his anger he went at once to find beauchamp who was in his office   15.027889425560272
but during these five minutes the duke had had time to read again the note from madame de montbazon which proved to the prisoner that his friends were concerting plans for his deliverance but in what way he knew not   13.612749460553477
a week ago continued madame de saint méran we went out together in the carriage after dinner   15.402012963657105
from the queen replied the servant   12.677637632432686
i am highly flattered returned beauchamp   14.784427212778908
let me conduct your business and my own   16.251356346925693
but since you believe i act for my own account adieu my dear friend get out of the affair as best you may   9.773479965562673
he questioned jacopo   14.604669031370523
let me see this diamond again replied the jeweller   12.815902916913334
but still if albert be not so rich as mademoiselle danglars said the count you must allow that he has a fine name   7.777338591150987
d artagnan who had fixed on his color beforehand had only to select the shade and looked in his chestnut suit exactly like a retired sugar dealer   10.95134889855022
a comfortable habitation although abandoned for a long time without reckoning the furniture which although old is yet valuable now that old things are so much sought after   9.568692270286732
monte cristo looked at her with an emotion that must have been remarked by morrel had not his eyes been fixed on the vessel   11.136594648628606
the latter continued in thought   8.189291618331273
you are a man of the world are you not   9.683332602847765
poor count   15.351531466907815

an englishman you say   10.795927588467336
that is exactly what i was going to say if your eminence had let me finish my sentence   13.322572245298595
they breakfasted with a good appetite looking now and then at poor raoul who with moist eyes and a full heart scarcely ate at all   10.982082585165873
the counsels of so prudent a man as yourself ought certainly to be available   12.674902802812456
villefort ran upstairs without saying a word   13.075962732813377
and looking attentively around him to see if he had left any of his keys in his closets mazarin went out   9.329398257192201
dentro la testa   15.813529248430388
the woman followed him and lord de winter did not appear   12.849255920723992
the other by buying off my judges with gold   16.104336585192165
albert and beauchamp looked at each other   16.285089873937626
two hours thus glided away   8.918846510704512
he stopped a moment in the anteroom as if hesitating whether to turn to his own apartment or into madame de saint méran s   9.771037847685056
no said danglars no decidedly no   15.322691345629266
i will take him for judge in his own cause monsieur and will believe what he will say   14.234668753343838
inquired caderousse frowningly of danglars who had assumed an air of utter surprise   16.642102809815576
because you are a coward planchet   8.793284355647218
i swear that i would give the last drop of my blood and the last fragment of my limbs to preserve the friendship of such a friend as you athos of such a man as you aramis   11.47387442202492
de villefort would stifle the affair   10.068677972652898
and porthos enchanted at having relieved his mind rejoined mousqueton and they disappeared around an angle of the street   14.3790652393817
an enemy   6.62045712206164
or dreamed he was and awoke mad   13.918904160293065
are you sure albert   8.64814202077904
oh i think you swore eugénie   8.291228337874367
the request was needless   13.996492024713712
it was very evident that something desperate was passing in the old man s mind for a cry of anger and grief rose in his throat and not being able to find vent in utterance appeared almost to choke him for his face and lips turned quite purple with the struggle   13.493685601716024
well it surpasses that   12.030262053960787
what shall i do with albert   11.099946904298688
then they shall go for him directly dear grandpapa   11.890827474676685
but he is mistaken   10.371490921252228
said danglars i ll take your bet   15.813209891510889
danglars is my banker   13.425266552039831
because monseigneur mazarin is a prouder man than his highness though not of such high birth he forgot to ask me to breakfast   14.000754391372338
bonacieux remained standing mute motionless and pale as a statue   6.790709137376445
then she ventured to open her eyelids and glance over her extended arm   9.971956445063062
saying at the same time you see i thus destroy the only proof existing against you   7.912205481591499
you will give them to your son who will of course take great care of them   7.194525819994986
someone must be sent to the duke   9.74758696266064
and milady saw with the joy of a demon that his strength would fail him perhaps before the end of her recital   13.816894420677515
you come to demand money of me of a musketeer   11.388914198752815
unfortunately he was in a bad vein   15.04842271831387
my sporting dogs consist of two pointers two harriers and two setters   14.313417770694068
you live alone then   8.388179243950503
no your eminence   13.009363586444264
two persons passed near me allow me to conceal their names for the present   6.716402731480821
the total amount was found to be as m   16.10940591240412
that is a different thing   10.891521726278178
certes if the knife had been left in her power she would now have thought not of killing herself but of killing the baron   16.808789010588267
athos and d artagnan watched their approach from the window   13.697305284702306
my sister is five and twenty my brother in law is thirty they are gay young and happy   9.693772537337052
is that possible my god   12.284426759137322
we ought not therefore i think to act toward a queen so illustrious as your majesty as we should act toward a woman of our lowlier condition   11.43263835993073
he found kitty at the gate and as on the preceding evening went up to her chamber   13.668118812632846
these three yeses had been pronounced by athos each with a sadder intonation   12.838686424084434
then the same steps she had heard approach slowly withdrew as if with regret   9.513896234966337
no no friend replied the doctor you will soon cease to suffer   13.760387984728624
good again   17.33049271917042
he then repaired to d artagnan who thanks to his four trusses of straw was in the act of making up and tasting by anticipation the luxury of a bed so soft so well stuffed at the head so well covered at the foot that it would have excited the envy of the king himself if his majesty had not been fast asleep in his own   16.234219629330212
do you still fence well   10.926324104684873
you make me tremble   12.00392609856807
i say that it was you who desired me to drink it   14.716501152501577
explain yourself pray   10.623574722629431
the duke was at windsor hunting with the king   13.7436596617522
i have but one word to add and that is to propose an example to you not mine for i myself have never appeared at court and have only taken part in religious wars as a volunteer   11.440260051729576
it is an algebraic axiom which makes us proceed from a known to an unknown quantity and not from an unknown to a known   11.392071322179369
you are right baron answered m   12.658696892588368
you can not for a moment imagine d artagnan that i would commit such an offense toward the unknown giver interrupted d artagnan   10.742562454823778
before she went to bed she had pondered analyzed turned on all sides examined on all points the words the steps the gestures the signs and even the silence of her interlocutors   15.10964034535355
on the contrary this dantès saw a means of accelerating his escape   15.923461547115226
if you let him go i am a dead man   14.083898710203922
do so then for of all themes which you could choose that will be the most agreeable to her taste   4.2626540735598155
why did you not tell me so before   14.398157929829535
and on these two occasions it was to one fatal genius sent doubtlessly by the lord to combat her that she has succumbed   13.489670829053845
why do you like that best   19.46386872197839
that s well said cried the king who had heard all these compliments through the open door   11.01955593841945
i mean that they have killed an enemy which is a very different thing returned the captain   9.764183813876759
ali cried he striking at the same time on the brazen gong   14.462804723065608
the notary bowed   7.820768834019689
gentlemen interrupted albert i think you did not understand that something very serious had passed between m   12.228179304101381
but she stood in need of a little silence and quiet to give all her ideas as yet confused a distinct form and a regular plan   8.047291295579218
i heard it from the mouth of the messenger himself   11.18845269174688
you are more impetuous than you were returned d artagnan   11.542629446622634
it must be with my title deeds   9.929568966724808
as she uttered that bon mot she arose and asked for her carriage   15.874148211485982
it is impossible said comminges   14.041171770601176
but she is not mine   7.427625388231661
these two women gave him more uneasiness than the war with spain the quarrel with england or the embarrassment of the finances   13.583205466649078
of having conspired to aid the emperor s return   12.32381920626232
that knife was for you my lad   21.967965102833084
you wish to speak to me alone   14.951570102561899
de tréville was asking d artagnan what he could do to serve him and what caused his visit at so late an hour   11.153212833791185
the cardinal as it appears pursues her and persecutes her more than ever   6.043864651847652
yes but in my soul much more than in my body   13.122265484656786
morrel has promised him the thing   5.544888505483137
they ordered the driver to take them to no   11.952054794492852
i fully appreciate his delicacy said andrea cramming the notes hastily into his pocket   10.38346151956145
i do not wish to be left alone   14.696285312781397
i know full well that you don t turn your back to yours   10.731306875034942
if it were so with m   6.6240893942238
how can you doubt it   15.35540855387452
he cursed the instant when m   11.969035167873516
the lackeys followed   12.34127070286394
have you really measured the world by scrutinies or through alembics and crucibles   10.04877767172233
said felton looking at those beautiful hands and shaking his head sorrowfully   12.780951093860534
i will not detain you long   9.432104384949763
and he went out as he came in whistling the self same air   10.210764581685378
and this one had his said d artagnan   11.933296031643604
the sword of the eternal is too heavy for my arm   11.188556596297893
the door opened but before it could be closed the lady exclaimed oh lucien oh my friend   12.084158958078277
but as he was searched for after this emeute he disappeared   14.04191271413077
he retired to his toilet   11.323739697337322
my dear athos i have reflected on your arguments and i am convinced   11.640009827422809
they will therein find portraits penciled by the hand of a master   10.438650441944707
a gale   17.024195579495927
eight days after i was back again madame   8.856546153850235
as they believe that i go in consequence of an order from the cardinal no one will believe you anxious to follow me   7.00053385788069
seventeen months captivity to a sailor accustomed to the boundless ocean is a worse punishment than human crime ever merited   12.450555080006787
but sir once more i beg pardon   14.554035826640003
then put down three hundred livres said the procurator s wife with a sigh   9.99370331207976
he sighed heavily   8.647037035166576
have you still that devouring thirst which can only be appeased in the grave   18.50444502005301
in that case gentlemen said the footman on hearing the names which the queen had so often pronounced with hope in that case it is another thing and i think her majesty will pardon me for not keeping you here a moment   10.853667705014363
to make your will   17.181613459460223
the valet de chambre had received orders to usher him in at once   16.179802667215412
certainly said monte cristo slightly shrugging his shoulders   12.205412605322286
to speak seemed like violating the silence of the tomb   12.45423375306525
and that his eminence was incapable hold your tongue   12.367876631848064
but meanwhile caderousse who had never taken his eyes off his companion passed his hand behind his back and opened a long spanish knife which he always carried with him to be ready in case of need   10.786056141675994
now then go go in the name of heaven   7.285817229945727
so you have seen the arm that was all   13.308896258798235
does he speak to you of this conspiracy   16.37541681775047
in the evening lord de winter accompanied the supper   11.858737189427435
some madman or fool bent upon ruining himself as fast as he can actually sent his steward to me to purchase them at any cost   15.69806180666896
lord wilmore having heard the door close after him returned to his bedroom where with one hand he pulled off his light hair his red whiskers his false jaw and his wound to resume the black hair dark complexion and pearly teeth of the count of monte cristo   13.34548608150498
said porthos to himself   6.366819884689345
come my brother go with me added d artagnan and i will see that you are made a duke   11.49297811530747
but it was risking the failure of our plan to come up here love   9.21305439732039
de chevreuse and consequently the queen   9.761549643408824
it would not be long before i should be training dogs to say that there were greater traitors in france than the cardinal mazarin   10.08017659201333
do you promise me to make what use you can of the report of the fortune m   15.36919044997573
he will want a crown an el dorado and potosí   8.58325987017713
i hate you all but not equally   8.215595377932795
pardon me for interrupting you but it appears to me that that name is familiar to me   14.207204040004244
then d artagnan described the meeting which he had at the church and how he had found that lady who with the seigneur in the black cloak and with the scar near his temple filled his mind constantly   12.689821280893005
but what will people say   12.968998794829323
it appears that since the death of the marquis which affected her very deeply she has not completely recovered her reason   12.661925592903275
but he had not been mistaken the appointment was for ten o clock   14.082956125735654
what can we say to mazarin   13.925100894836094
but i swear to you by the memory of my brother whom i have loved so much that your accomplice is not saved   14.238843988264513
do you go and i will stay and take care of the wounded man   13.380886781352203
but to every interrogation which they put to him he bowed without response   11.437781142758405
you said just now that you had a hundred friends   10.74600610039678
he is a proud soul he is a man by himself   6.062168964024773
asked scarron   15.757932290349144
it was indeed for him that they were there   13.835476968965798
but to this monsieur porthos replied that as he every moment expected his mistress who was one of the greatest ladies in the court i might easily comprehend that the chamber he did me the honor to occupy in my house was itself very mean for the visit of such a personage   13.391468199877732
murmured d artagnan smiling as he pronounced the imprecation   6.298927102745034
all the ties which attach him to life break in the hand of man particularly the golden ties   9.649019998946024
did you ever suffer from a strain athos   10.643387744379487
he was discovered   14.703322616878475
i thank you gentlemen   8.064233508450279
i have told you to hope said the count   11.544375558818688
we were able to prove the contrary and that proof we are ready to give to your majesty calling in support of it the august widow weeping in the louvre where your royal munificence has provided for her a home   7.34726513142144
it is a handsome uniform   13.831444133081307
asked the dragoon who had approached during the reading   10.821952702639589
he is calling you said the count   17.381768112593768
fall voluntarily into my arms hypocritical and dangerous woman said d artagnan likewise to himself after having abused me with such effrontery and afterward i will laugh at you with him whom you wish me to kill   11.074616372242552
interrupted athos   9.928256234564087
athos alone from time to time raised his expansive brow   7.577340674252845
some belonging to the kitchens gliding down the stairs restored but the previous day as if they had always inhabited the house   8.878358964405178
to its address my lord   8.971140982428542
i will have ten   15.167891922295842
i never thought of bringing you bad news   8.012254814043363
at sight of the officer broussel was somewhat moved but seeing him bow politely he rose and bowed also   8.44903667120736
said the marquis   13.918734545176717
de villefort s antechamber but madame danglars had no occasion even to pronounce her name   13.300738258981873
that is a serious matter and we will not discuss it here   11.03750848480583
gaetano had only seen the vessel from a distance he had not then spoken to anyone   6.617668431773007
at this point i have to accuse myself of a fault madame   15.19027781838875
believe me nothing is more fallacious than to form any estimate of the degree of intimacy you may suppose existing among persons by the familiar terms they seem upon   15.819856827543166
time was getting on however and franz deemed it advisable to awaken albert   7.958013045120741
there is a crown for the annoyance we have caused you   10.734770664835757
de villefort towards his own relations i ought to have denounced him to the authorities   13.186370240104079
suppose the queen should refuse to ratify it   9.921122254775039
valentine summoned every effort and breathed with that regular respiration which announces tranquil sleep   9.69282895201126
it is you who sold us my mother and me to the merchant el kobbir   10.415601597953177
peppino said the brigand chief give me the torch   11.766464147262866
close to him dressed in entirely new clothes advanced smilingly count andrea cavalcanti the dutiful son whom we also know   16.492455747336948
they found the outer gate closed and not a servant remaining in the house   11.963052865720798
he said yes and he put his hand on his sword   14.288404855185327
for they well knew what those propositions were to whom they had been made and who had made them   16.59584395784939
i seemed to be going mad   5.646646585288953
it is well said he kissing it   7.777475729287176
as we used to say when we said good bye to each other in the late cardinal s time   14.130188250195932
noirtier and retired   17.97362089411701
and i have none either said the queen   12.445444725269098
the guests in the house in the rue du helder where albert had invited the count of monte cristo everything was being prepared on the morning of the 21st of may to do honor to the occasion   8.78873052347916
the story volume two chapter 28   12.921343922049513
and thus to accuse yourself is to deserve pardon   15.594892691267987
at the noise they made she in overturning the furniture in her efforts to get at him he in screening himself behind the furniture to keep out of her reach kitty opened the door   6.953999291079667
hereafter perhaps i shall have the right of giving myself   12.817788046685532
monseigneur said m   7.5396997331530935
i come from the cardinal said the officer   2.6851461113082706
asked albert astonished   11.048058760354314
the right of pardoning only applies to the guilty said tréville who was determined to have the last word and my musketeer is innocent   11.569138650661484
and i forgot i had a daughter   9.679606783858446
when i say i will not do a thing i mean it   10.32006447471926
my friend said gondy you seem to be a clever and a thoughtful man   17.927582412034234
who told you we were intimate maximilian   8.993690115412784
in fact the evening after this conversation the report was circulated that the prince de condé had arrived   12.722280237810418
that workmanship is divine   9.797205031231783
grimaud followed athos   13.892466035627105
it will break my resolutions   8.897660687223755
pray let me know what it is you have discovered   15.246288628439743
said aramis to athos   15.404412724594952
madame the possibility of my arrest has been foreseen and should i not have returned by to morrow at a certain hour the next day the cardinal will be brought to paris and delivered to the parliament   9.71716202388292
milady was only a queen while among queens   17.899188673429414
how did your father receive him albert   12.659547800739167
i should think so but not without difficulty   10.278238029177462
de chatillon opened his arms and fell back on the crupper of his horse   13.430145012040798
the very prosaic one of our landlord   11.414060843247428
as for mademoiselle eugénie she scarcely vouchsafed to waste the glances of her large black eyes even upon the business of the stage   6.5294174978885975
he is pursued   7.68452412196471
there is porthos s purse too   7.13578757762867
from a distance resounded deadened however by good shutters the songs of the tipplers enjoying themselves in the cabarets scattered along the plain   13.391275728396028
if you yield him dead all will indeed be at an end my lord but quite otherwise than you mean   11.370281646000759
the crowd gave place the barricade was opened and the marshal with the remnant of his company retreated preceded by friquet and his bandits some of them making a presence of beating drums and others imitating the sound of the trumpet   16.49109898187721
there must be a good deal done before it can deserve that title your excellency for the tapestried hangings are very old   15.332350852753493
what s the matter now   16.502213168763
valentine said the count summon up all your courage   16.730352568101416
well i said d artagnan i answer that while there remains a drop of blood in my veins you will be neither hanged nor shot   12.600918757180532
the cardinal reached a second door without perceiving he was being followed   11.160736224465063
louise slid through the half open gate like a snake and bounded lightly forward   8.324018737779786
de bassompiere saw clots of blood upon the chessboard   12.713194105568942
but remember also that if by your fault any evil happens to d artagnan i will find you wherever you may be for the purpose of ripping up your belly   12.640004826047248
it was mercédès leaning on her son s arm and leaving the house   15.446014730353752
come at dinnertime   8.286842048244116
bonacieux darting to the window can it be he   9.067197464487277
now said aramis you will please to understand gentlemen that bazin alone can carry this letter to tours   13.28029083645415
the days when such distinctions were so nicely weighed and considered no longer exist in france and the first families of the monarchy have intermarried with those of the empire   16.188090834180635
was the gascon determined to keep it as a weapon against milady or else let us be frank did he not reserve the sapphire as a last resource for his outfit   13.007145374795616
soon said haydée we halted on our march and found ourselves on the borders of a lake   13.508169107894684
then you must suffer hunger   11.545691366134712
a mischance   11.309780106339046
i shall perhaps have something to say to you   8.645596185120402
therefore your lordship may suppose they are only assumed names said athos   12.787024999295962
i could only utter inarticulate sounds and irresistible faintness came over me   14.067520363365741
monsieur de comminges he said   11.370617897086081
the shudder of the three musketeers showed to d artagnan that his words began to make some impression on them   10.70293545922787
madame bonacieux with whose retreat the cardinal was unacquainted   13.690531767872269
but let us go in and see more clearly what is to be done   16.903446586977775
he was calm   14.525910384102056
we shall see said porthos majestically   7.670221195108345
it would be noble to see mademoiselle noirtier de villefort assuming the title of madame franz d épinay   15.822530517003369
de morcerf count said he you have said that the vizier of yanina confided his wife and daughter to your care   11.323582192994301
i know the world is a drawing room from which we must retire politely and honestly   6.622407834223027
you are right morrel   9.707998688382848
were you afraid raoul   13.081768957239685
he is well educated   18.1971436600413
de villefort for which i am quite at a loss to account   12.774730443882374
athos was calm and grave but aramis was furious   11.685117552432933
permit me then my dear athos without inquiring further about our friend to pay my respects to m   9.90770015439166
still another obstacle murmured mme   9.144242009927817
it is as i have the honor to relate it to your majesty   9.036494919831306
while madame de villefort remained rooted to the spot like a statue of terror and villefort with his head hidden in the bedclothes saw nothing around him d avrigny approached the window that he might the better examine the contents of the glass and dipping the tip of his finger in tasted it   4.323788243724833
and thou planchet   8.08716855692887
but d artagnan seized the moment at which in this movement the sword of bernajoux deviated from the line   11.740883700848315
the executioner of lille the executioner of lille   12.622287580084572
he would have been free and happy with mercédès and his father whereas he was now confined in the château d if that impregnable fortress ignorant of the future destiny of his father and mercédès   14.951824226339355
perfectly well my good friend   12.125795836026228
that is to say beauty meekness and tears and above all the irresistible attraction of mystical voluptuousness the most devouring of all voluptuousness   14.277686302084877
keep the commission   11.930432982361506
it must be seen to be believed   12.61770585557299
the two arms fell with a sudden force   8.189597090381376
and now my good friend said d artagnan to him i must invite you to deprive yourself for my sake of your hat and cloak   14.140963939096135
put the army in battle array and face the enemy   11.60426426666413
but i arrived second and must sail first   14.989167664860963
inquired one of the officers who accompanied the governor   13.43065381655086
the more melancholy because those engaged in it knew not for whom they were fighting   12.41085469403438
i see you are covered with blood   12.574792374723266
and you serve the party of those who maltreat your wife and insult your queen   12.629961117976059
a few moments after the little door was opened and a man entered   10.426185414177175
flee alone   18.314975082878025
who asked for me   18.764280130303938
morcerf usually so stiff and formal accosted the banker in an affable and smiling manner and feeling sure that the overture he was about to make would be well received he did not consider it necessary to adopt any manœuvres in order to gain his end but went at once straight to the point   14.727132384105964
i shall not leave my grandfather that is an understood thing between us   12.719600662818278
mademoiselle said eugénie let the porter get the post chaise from the coach house and fetch some post horses from the hotel   6.6648495446158105
but you have never told me that you did not love me   13.225239193048944
directly i have given my card to the count who has promised to pay us a visit at rue meslay no   16.312083951326308
it is growing dark and there may be some mistake   12.874636268097495
has he not a son a young man a relative a nephew of whom comminges spoke to me as being a brave boy and who with monsieur de chatillon brought the standards from lens   9.378351458632828
he was making rapid progress in italian   13.070675076355158
these verses were not excellent very far from it   10.88940254886925
and he burst into a hoarse laugh   12.312705777838186
i have seen him   10.72420135637936
come in gentlemen   13.691280178444025
in the large room of the hotel a small table was placed for him and a large one for the officers   7.63936803698058
but what would be the use of living eighteen hundred years after lucullus if we can do no better than he could   10.365766801565226
take my advice and set out this evening   16.470059660555513
you save the lives of ladies of high rank and beauty   15.368500236431935
we have hinted that by the side of these views of the leveling and simplifying minister which belong to history the chronicler is forced to recognize the lesser motives of the amorous man and jealous rival   10.038025660622424
and all he gained was the painful conviction that the ladies of italy have this advantage over those of france that they are faithful even in their infidelity   15.121835403626012
the traveller alighted ordered a good dinner and inquired the address of the house of thomson french which was immediately given to him as it was one of the most celebrated in rome   8.372611602175914
but would you believe that i purchase all this delight joy and happiness for which i would cheerfully have surrendered ten years of my life at the small cost of 500 francs per annum paid quarterly   11.950621753730092
i am as certain of it as that we two are christians   10.1063763676615
when you have given the letter to lord de winter and he has read it you will further say to him watch over his grace lord buckingham for they wish to assassinate him   11.634280342255046
ten fifteen or twenty thieves have been arrested in a café on the boulevard du temple or in the thermes de julien and yet these same men deny the existence of the bandits in the maremma the campagna di romana or the pontine marshes   9.065426201936752
this feeling lasted but for a moment   7.03332638861305
you have not guessed rightly   4.188556754197247
on the evening of the day on which valentine had learned of the flight of eugénie and the arrest of benedetto villefort having retired as well as noirtier and d avrigny her thoughts wandered in a confused maze alternately reviewing her own situation and the events she had just heard   11.116822200370162
news in prison is a fruit so rare that i trust monsieur de comminges you will excuse my impatience the more eager since you have given us to understand that the news is good   11.391886108154127
it is only by comparing the pains of actual being with the joys of the assumed existence that you would desire to live no longer but to dream thus forever   10.05256762089506
well let us see said mazarin   14.038120956986216
as franz had sufficient time and his apartments at rome were not yet available he accepted the proposition   15.9145449682458
said the cardinal i know of whom you speak   6.165694197847788
i shall not do so   14.182720322441677
the coachman entered and traversed the half circle without slackening his speed and the gates were closed ere the wheels had ceased to sound on the gravel   14.771844010662866
do you hear him valentine   13.75551042754509
well monseigneur replied the latter three musketeers and a guardsman laid a wager with monsieur de busigny that they would go and breakfast in the bastion st   10.629911617136322
left alone d artagnan read and reread his billet   10.23378876941578
i would not be quite sure that he has not been mixed up with the police for some trifle a stab with a knife for instance   12.203729099753739
all it can do is to avenge the wrong done   10.55765246585649
do not think it will be less dear to us now we are acquainted with our benefactor   13.356001774305405
he goes two or three times a week   18.34892867126683
the carriage was prepared according to orders and stepping lightly into it the count drove off at his usual rapid pace   12.513408635854526
when they reached the side of this felucca mordaunt dexterous in his eagerness for vengeance seized a rope and climbed up the side of the vessel with a coolness and agility very rare among landsmen   8.092767997549277
faria then drew forth from his hiding place three or four rolls of linen laid one over the other like folds of papyrus   9.974240429973097
it is enough said athos bowing low if the lives of three men can purchase yours madame   12.484801285499964
there go two miscreants   11.18992731289231
suddenly he struck against something crouching behind a wheelbarrow filled with leaves   9.848055568301106
you know not the subject of their conversation   14.047667479087027
it was three o clock   16.425583945391832
but too late by a minute unfortunate unfortunate that i am   15.459577025528823
in this passage he proposed to drive a level as they do in mines   10.756930697926112
you mean to say that he deceives me   13.615718239304876
cried the gascon trying in vain too late to retract the thrust   11.48318450828206
and louis xiii   10.24580977963409
madame danglars trembled with fear   10.76598382468282
yes it was pronounced in my hearing once   14.753659435795814
you know albert women are singular creatures   9.634468745094015
asked the italian   14.863697285531611
the inspector visited one after another the cells and dungeons of several of the prisoners whose good behavior or stupidity recommended them to the clemency of the government   10.328072309279387
bernouin   11.968436607427222
and sir continued the wounded man i suffer much and would like if possible to be carried to some house   11.467824286037668
coquenard turning about in his chair a real feast epulœ epulorum   11.402489807147258
you will find that it is as good as another   7.842117764917705
has he not already forgotten she ever existed   10.293058993488488
there were paintings by diaz who makes his flowers more beautiful than flowers his suns more brilliant than the sun   13.193377364786699
inquired the countess when the servant had taken away the last vase of flowers is it a family name or the name of the estate or a simple title   13.86787749310078
there must be plenty left replied d artagnan   16.274103586383504
here take this continued he after rapidly writing the few lines i brought to your excellency and upon receipt of which you deigned to receive me into your service and proudly i ask whether your excellency has ever had cause to repent having done so   14.301810227107246
i have sworn to tell you all and i will tell you all   9.149388380634598
as they reached the shore the count instinctively shrunk to the extreme end of the boat and the owner was obliged to call out in his sweetest tone of voice sir we are at the landing   12.050107036193024
well here are 8 000 francs on account   11.923445352666965
and have you any recollection of your country   15.597710816290464
in whose name do you come   14.625317918050639
let us understand each other my lord replied d artagnan and let us make things clear beforehand in order that there may be no mistake   10.588206414445928
she tried to go toward the window for air but she could only stretch forth her arms   10.783701267458223
or rather who pretend not to understand me sir   13.166879728896413
tis raoul who is come home   15.7281864815295
but my lord said marshal de grammont consider that when we have collected all our forces we shall have hardly thirteen thousand men   12.669143633743271
certes replied aramis in a pleased tone but the thing is subtle   9.661704602247246
the man looked at the bank notes felt them counted them turned pale then red then rushed into his room to drink a glass of water but he had no time to reach the water jug and fainted in the midst of his dried herbs   10.759716204452857
de villefort and then ask me for proofs   9.257756860388517
if he were afterwards to marry mademoiselle danglars you would accuse me of intrigue and would be challenging me besides i may not be there myself   8.363693340658827
danglars was engaged at that moment presiding over a railroad committee   8.702227945442402
furious against the cardinal   7.930981953430832
but this did not arise from a want of affection   6.181561552420494
and that if she has committed any follies i renounce her i abjure her i curse her   13.895645180729481
and what did you reply   8.626153833346569
why do you ask me now   12.492864125607147
for the rest this vengeance was very easy   12.170545192677169
a tigress a panther   13.488456013471609
but i say no more madame   13.959680160380788
then said the two women to emmanuel we are indeed ruined   11.034427819676559
you seemed at dinner to be anxious about something   5.599811702711543
and where are we going may i ask without being too curious   9.248480213710469
but he had no sooner eaten than he felt thirsty   12.039582037422292
the fourth horse had arrived   15.232055210610234
were they alone   15.279713882049414
yes but by my marriage you have forwarded that   11.562232172174623
he turned to a closet where his own orders were locked up and took out two ribbons of the order of the garter   2.804967113493035
here comes a young gentleman said one of them who seems as if he were going to join the army   14.741046517432364
but little by little the general vertigo seized them and they felt themselves obliged to take part in the noise and confusion   17.438975924559053
i could propose one to your majesty but i dare not   13.53420384980293
ah yes true mademoiselle exclaimed monte cristo as if this simple explanation was sufficient to revive the recollection he sought   12.627603551007464
and you are right my dear la ramee said the duke wiping away the sweat that stood on his brow wide awake though he was   13.55075088985215
the same evening some friends of mine visited me m   10.162731444021357
madame i am a clothier in the rue bourdonnais   14.80803876251111
this time it was not a host but a hostess who received him   16.473263142111318
but having stopped to drink at a cabaret they had missed the carriage by ten minutes   10.361214444626924
the sudden extinction of the moccoletti the darkness which had replaced the light and the silence which had succeeded the turmoil had left in franz s mind a certain depression which was not free from uneasiness   7.076097465535941
question then my lord   13.370996420810897
mercédès said the count i do not say it to blame you but you made an unnecessary sacrifice in relinquishing the whole of the fortune amassed by m   15.892117436000134
i will said the count   16.538253415128622
for a moment dantès was speechless   11.605322730931853
he said two words to the chief and i was free   10.240831629543631
it was not i who wished to kill the jew said caderousse   10.90270847077369
i wish to know if in demanding my signature you leave me entirely free in my person   15.007724309036693
are you a man for the substantials and is gold your god   19.527289890609904
the banker soon returned   13.014534746522816
have you then power against death   12.698900949713526
i will die here and you will see if a phantom that accuses is not more terrible than a living being that threatens   13.71291368377568
at the end of ten minutes the bandit made them a sign to stop   13.529026578131571
it was quite dark and no one saw them go out   12.493046825456725
watch watch beauchamp and try to discover the enemy who made this disclosure   13.626859527742445
upon reaching the room below i found five or six custom house officers and two or three gendarmes all heavily armed   10.788086758274508
four and the two bandits make six   10.086360017535124
amongst them the voyages of jean mocquet in the time of henry iv   10.936870710761761
she saw a woman in a white dressing gown pouring a liquor from a phial into her glass   10.508177375859988
and have i any right to go and peep under their cloaks to see what is not there   11.582947383271508
my books my pencils my piano all the things which cost but little and which i shall be able to procure will remain my own   15.948047501029079
i hate the english they are coarse like every nation that swills beer   11.4104803692703
they then perceived two men conversing in the obscurity   15.831812973671363
but then all this extravagance is not for myself added athos laughing   11.690117832129802
i never returned to the country where she lived   10.437021603524679
andrea had then in a fortnight attained a very fair position   9.281770210407323
all this is vague enough   14.661140051483946
the air burned ignited by flaming embers then the frightful lightning disappeared the brands sank one after another into the abyss where they were extinguished and save for a slight vibration in the air after a few minutes had elapsed one would have thought that nothing had happened   19.212197146929213
in one of the rooms he crossed the trousseau of the bride elect was on exhibition   9.945704685195189
all the day all the next night passed away without my seeing him again   13.016229395603954
imposing silence grimaud put out the little night lamp then knelt down and poured into the lieutenant s ear a recital melodramatic enough not to require play of feature to give it pith   8.065341967811055
the first will was torn up and a second made in which he left the whole of his fortune to valentine on condition that she should never be separated from him   11.792325257252356
he reflected   12.152738021918502
i wished to follow you but my horse was too much fatigued to go at the same pace with yours   11.29687964503345
cavalcanti is going to marry mademoiselle danglars   12.098623919684805
i assure you it is already yours to a very unusual extent   15.791922740551893
do you believe there is a spot on the earth which the cardinal can not reach if he takes the trouble to stretch forth his hand   12.761758425330479
trust me madame   17.0666789885557
this time caderousse endeavored to call again but he could only utter a groan and he shuddered as the blood flowed from his three wounds   15.31388042977634
resumed the cardinal with a smile which indicated that he knew the story as well as he who wished to relate it   7.307065918480913
i will go myself   13.450665113590759
we must excuse our worthy neighbor caderousse said dantès he is so easily mistaken   11.34144890822232
then they lift and sink again and both go under at once   9.94881024373825
the monk had disappeared   6.569386336957908
charlotte backson comtesse de la fère milady de winter said he your crimes have wearied men on earth and god in heaven   12.354000545102387
tomorrow at midday tréville   15.032474550577664
chapter 12   14.643163111200675
instead of preaching about the torments of hell i talk of the joys of paradise   9.28713145663619
are you satisfied sir   11.560760181529089
but i added to help you it would be sufficient that dantès did not marry her you love   12.830904868586362
villefort started with joy   14.160908827685677
what i have done then has been for the queen and not at all for your grace   16.50524723231178
her mouth which might have been found fault with as too large displayed teeth of pearly whiteness rendered still more conspicuous by the brilliant carmine of her lips contrasting vividly with her naturally pale complexion   8.973382666594748
the obscurity augmented the acuteness of his hearing   13.706494512115606
julie suitably dressed and her hair arranged she had accomplished this feat in less than ten minutes received the count on his entrance   14.921433470617934
and besides i think what the comte de la fere said just now is very good   8.115751919910107
it was situated in a very private spot   13.806768929779603
cried porthos making strong efforts to disembarrass himself of d artagnan who was wriggling about his back   13.542751991745828
these were the two men who were to conduct milady to fort la pointe and superintend her embarkation   8.512509416239528
it is too long a time   7.078097929895476
the answer was terrible   14.127948265751629
no pity for him who had no pity   12.9725819363134
i say the two because cardinal rospigliosi who had not taken any precaution was completely despoiled   14.697689347141448
on the contrary he came up to me and said it is your master that needs his liberty at this moment and not i since he knows everything and i know nothing   11.788417878493552
cried he listen to me   11.038813529534462
franz went along the corridor and a servant introduced him to the count   12.581300160074912
the count knows everything said the italian bowing   7.918696059984606
the people believing that he had escaped by some back entrance retired and left him at liberty to retreat   13.23998041517722
there is nothing but a wainscot between my chamber and milady s   8.150073870343338
oh thank you a thousand times   14.058014510463952
they are binding her   15.370708203428023
may i know the cause which procures me the pleasure of seeing m   8.199691426284042
as a fugitive she could not take care of it but on her return she wished to have it near her   11.781587921522723
one of my friends   15.6621904077153
often he was driven away oftener still had he a dread of being sent away   11.733847377937575
i should injure the queen instead of serving her   8.276761506628525
you must go then mademoiselle said emmanuel   11.646922911904172
be satisfied we shall have this lion   9.154957763788232
but eugénie instead of stooping drew herself up under the blow   12.880910893117285
my dear count you can not imagine how my mind is harassed   12.371398437123968
were the late cardinal richelieu alive he would tell you a certain story of the bastion saint gervais which we four with our four lackeys and twelve dead men held out against a whole army   10.858242397778017
a thousand livres   11.370396721956789
he listened he groped about but he heard and saw nothing the cries had ceased and the tempest continued to rage   9.33369606834325
it has succeeded since you deign to receive me   11.855761177916452
these animals though wild and agile as chamois were too much like domestic goats and franz could not consider them as game   14.289406302807492
milady had then made a breach by her false virtue in the opinion of a man horribly prejudiced against her and by her beauty in the heart of a man hitherto chaste and pure   11.056071239749372
and should we meet with one of your patrol we must defend ourselves   14.472449149871014
i will give you a paper which you must not part with on any account and which you will deliver into the proper hands   12.832758850635802
this day will be a warm one said planchet in a warlike tone   8.347581281015556
he was forced to confess to himself that this reasoning was not only comprehensive but just   17.13655736362746
de villefort s house   10.616516771228692
there is everything in a jesuit convent   15.026113704768843
no he murmured none of my enemies would have waited so patiently and laboriously for so long a space of time that they might now come and crush me with this secret   11.802975851633954
he ordered two horses to be saddled and himself went as guide to the young guardsman   12.347842067628047
asked raoul yes that is i had it repined the gascon making believe to find it   10.871425984361274
i do not understand stammered lucien   9.510012513296395
he cried falling back a step   13.369597186886647
he has disappeared like a phantom like a shade like a specter   12.812059099173403
i am the viscount de bragelonne and he is called grimaud   10.950435838075784
well my lord said la ramee with his rude laugh you still set yourself against this poor fellow   9.137242083566385
never i swear to you   12.113526411150769
yes everyone in my family is well   13.174851944721773
for i will freely confess that my historical labors have been my greatest solace and relief   11.64677623153288
it seemed to me as if you were yourself preparing for some dangerous undertaking about which i did not dare to question you since you told me nothing   11.868565592066794
i come now to the last of the family whose secretary i was the count of spada   11.759406658439271
then replied mme   9.924481167146988
a family affair was not subject to the investigation of the cardinal   10.792139356857682
come replied the same lofty tone answer   12.425230259549092
quite so replied the lieutenant   10.503417380999213
he rose on the waves making signs of distress   13.272364874599589
then it is possible   14.008831811432165
if he is a puritan we will inform him of the capture of the king and in honor of the news he will kill for us his fatted hens   12.365926599375856
and in justice to villefort it must be understood that m   10.945667998725925
athos had not failed to send early to aramis and had given his letter to blaisois the only serving man whom he had left   12.727128282976723
d artagnan s penetrating gray eyes were opened to the utmost   11.786589288748232
yes most satisfactory my dear danglars   10.01697484130034
without that precaution valentine would have died before assistance could have been procured   12.257525609270363
but the secret   13.718940319360467
come come tell me   10.644926153719345
said the same sharp and imperative voice   15.68666754954826
well then in return for your story continued noirtier i will tell you another   11.059363622714459
i ask you what year is it   11.599826719980065
albert turned away his head with a sigh and went to his own apartments   9.217820635235947
nothing is concealed from the cardinal   11.879382152466356
keep the lieutenancy my dear keep it   10.51637755598711
at length athos went to bed apparently for the noise ceased   11.60505818589951
another horse   12.581637402045724
did you come to tell us you have procured a carriage   9.702395969599346
the king drew his sword and broke it on his knee   12.673822811080168
said the count mysteriously his eyes fixed on the corpse disfigured by so awful a death   18.06589036871391
the excise was in truth the everlasting enemy of the patron of la jeune amélie   15.439919854960273
besides maximilian morrel though hardly two and twenty had great influence over his father   19.44857815989996
you are free my brothers   10.51115311078049
never mind continued the young man smuggler or not you must agree mother dear as you have seen him that the count of monte cristo is a remarkable man who will have the greatest success in the salons of paris   11.089105757531703
above this floor was a large atelier which had been increased in size by pulling down the partitions a pandemonium in which the artist and the dandy strove for pre eminence   12.276569229216754
the roll call finished the president ordered them to read the act of accusation   13.2706800536951
well continued the count in a tone that made franz shudder this young gentleman is one of my friends this young gentleman lodges in the same hotel as myself this young gentleman has been up and down the corso for eight hours in my private carriage and yet i repeat to you you have carried him off and conveyed him hither and added the count taking the letter from his pocket you have set a ransom on him as if he were an utter stranger   16.917272798974615
porthos turned aside in order not to show by his honest round face what was passing in his mind   14.490867699048703
indeed you give me more credit than i deserve   13.032921312224506
but at the third watched besides the guard and the doorkeepers the faithful bernouin a cerberus whom no speech could soften no wand even of gold could charm   13.932061689463563
did i say monsieur de beaufort   10.797006505329811
cut the cable then   13.67843794869736
there are certain affinities between the persons we quit and those we meet afterwards   12.368946311592238
i said i looked upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery perhaps crime   16.146629176632683
i did announce myself in truth as coming on the part of the marechal de grammont   8.775715645120746
inquiry was made and it was ascertained that by a strange coincidence this carriage contained the corpse of the marquis de saint méran and that those who had come thinking to attend one funeral would follow two   14.263825421557485
let us then go to the archiepiscopal palace said aramis   12.341264337401611
lovely women yielding to the influence of the scene bend over their balconies or lean from their windows and shower down confetti which are returned by bouquets   7.959810544934361
what joy for my lord and master du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds   13.502154100444802
and now good night   11.170902613722149
he had noticed that a few rays not of daylight but from a lamp penetrated through the ill joined planks of the door   9.310837396070117
she had allowed herself to be exceeded in generosity   5.904030420451393
approach gentlemen said albert   9.455932923218029
but as this dream can not be realized since mademoiselle danglars must become my lawful wife live perpetually with me sing to me compose verses and music within ten paces of me and that for my whole life it frightens me   11.518500648289013
he has taken part against his queen or rather against her minister   15.008178843984936
but it appears that in prison he made the acquaintance of a rich englishman and as in prison he fell sick and dantès took the same care of him as if he had been his brother the englishman when he was set free gave this stone to dantès who less fortunate died and in his turn left it to us and charged the excellent abbé who was here this morning to deliver it   12.88694063564605
as you please he said   10.40822231794343
he was approached to be examined and when it was discovered by his plumed hat and his laced coat that he was an officer of the musketeers he was surrounded with the intention of making him cry down with mazarin   11.162829807792779
the young woman in the street replied by a single tap and the shutter was opened a little way   11.78844109081205
these are my words exactly   12.075665852217469
these two causes were enough to give it a gloomy aspect   14.020729536166805
please pay to my order from the fund deposited by me the sum of a million and charge the same to my account   8.746717372765364
no kitty you are mistaken   7.814201245931708
this intelligence restored every one save athos to gayety   13.597478684542352
have i not from the first blessed hour of our acquaintance schooled all my words and actions to your sentiments and ideas   11.45452101264783
asked the countess as though awakening from a sleep to the realities of life   14.024348768857491
and to meet the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the present month and the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the next month to m   6.748320415726303
you are the only man of whom i have heard her speak with interest   12.25162728407089
that gascon has saved a queen and made monsieur de richelieu confess that in point of talent address and political skill to him he was only a tyro   12.632102410364034
sir said villefort upon my word you overcome me   11.64871205959385
well since there is another finer and younger why you may take the old one   6.96636360485808
then as the wheels rolled over a fine gravel milady could hear a vast roaring which she at once recognized as the noise of the sea dashing against some steep cliff   8.67292403988866
and this time i come before you to ask a question far more terrible than any other to say to you as god said to the first murderer cain what hast thou done to thy brother abel   10.32431084397354
two men seated on the movable plank on which the victim is laid were eating their breakfasts while waiting for the criminal   13.03278864294378
they had besides to look constantly to their own proper safety   9.210675251834761
a flurry in stocks some days after this meeting albert de morcerf visited the count of monte cristo at his house in the champs élysées which had already assumed that palace like appearance which the count s princely fortune enabled him to give even to his most temporary residences   8.63219861004589
then approaching noirtier pardon what i am going to say added he but no indication should be neglected in this terrible situation   17.28994517554264
yes my pocket has a hole in it   12.310473328079292
oh how i love you   16.86707339825806
so you may have the diamond for 45 000 francs   7.947060840062187
do you know sir that you are asking me very strange questions and that i am very foolish to answer them   14.40759014163175
he was called count he was said to possess 50 000 livres per annum   11.941594323843876
de villefort by whose hand the ground was dug to receive the corpse of his child   11.482545819926955
monte cristo made a sign with his head to show that he could discern in the darkness the door to which bertuccio alluded   10.318326318694437
let us draw lots   10.38223904848669
by introducing to you a new acquaintance   19.78080276815209
at this instant they heard the sound of horses feet   4.886695356376941
asked aramis and how does he go to work to weed the parliament   13.85399382507931
and d artagnan full of splendid pride and manly intrepidity placed in anne s hands in a bundle the papers that he had one by one won from her with so much difficulty   15.197595664726785
we believe like mohammedans and are as mute as tombstones said athos   13.617320834244513
she first extended her arms to prevent me but after a moment s reflection yes go florentin said she and may he come quickly   10.259317953074493
all his sorrows all his sufferings with their train of gloomy spectres fled from his cell when the angel of death seemed about to enter   12.645624115618691
very well sir said monte cristo   3.9414718633272923
you will get yourself decapitated my beautiful queen and that would be a pity   7.585965304038145
he received the enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with evident pleasure as though his chilled affections were rekindled and invigorated by his contact with one so warm and ardent   9.183798473221078
the pretty mme   5.750151847850999
then i must wait   13.160941909600323
asked the young girl in romaic of monte cristo   7.387367686756646
he perceived in the tavern a pert boy between twelve and fifteen years of age whom he fancied he had seen not twenty minutes before under the guise of a chorister   7.635921587198519
ah said rochefort with a smile   16.085045374993737
but am i not your nearest relative   12.004430545141211
oh then my father has really a very large fortune count   13.168933502073827
well we are going to give a ball to mazarin   10.344415464015515
i require an order which would ratify beforehand all that i should think proper to do for the greatest good of france   10.223682420443803
she ground her teeth   15.437204240192957
and the count humming an air from lucia went to sit down on a bench while bertuccio followed him collecting his thoughts   8.890459339792832
if there is any left   10.648421850626903
i know him also but unfortunately he is not in paris   8.651024854587838
then turning to the crew he said bear a hand there to take in sail   11.178089430826216
all that grimaud gained by this momentary pantomime was to pass from the rear guard to the vanguard   11.362829549667882
that is enough to drive away all my pains   15.759946039732116
nevertheless the calm religious dignity of his countenance abashed mordaunt   10.351454297966988
neither was he one of those who think that the necessary silence of the night brings counsel with it   10.2237116831145
as regarded her attainments the only fault to be found with them was the same that a fastidious connoisseur might have found with her beauty that they were somewhat too erudite and masculine for so young a person   12.496211660941642
at châlons i was put upon the saône thence i passed on to the rhône whence i descended merely with the current to arles   13.088081292935412
a complicated affair said porthos   10.367238120703213
how many days would it require to make two studs exactly like them   13.31905689224552
it is you bernouin she said   15.585972368242098
at this instant the door opened   10.521479009842551
now said the gascon that is all well i accept for porthos and myself everything thanks and compliments   10.681793584374343
nevertheless he did return   12.287048078641478
and it is no secret that i owe my fortune such as it is to the liberality of the illustrious albanese chief   14.72605885122361
and olivain and the host took their way together toward the inn olivain according to the custom of serving men well pleased with their place relating to the tavern keeper all that he could say in favor of the young gentleman   8.90967077994527
has he been wounded then   8.031006625395026
to whom would she apply to help her out of this painful situation   11.816954469517302
ah sir said caderousse with a sigh it is easy to perceive i am not a rich man   10.05947606033251
in fact there is so much resemblance between us that i sometimes believe he is aramis and i am the coadjutor   10.24413378419509
their eyes measured the height and they exchanged conjectures   10.388600242046143
the other that of franz and his friends   10.54334431612526
this was murder in every sense of the word   11.378586710674066
never said the englishman   8.67890395032082
the committee decided to hear the letter   11.141926123159942
he will never leave me   12.34621755593272
he is a young ingenuous pure man who seems virtuous   12.305433072957225
but by the accent the young man plainly saw that the beautiful englishwoman was in a great rage   13.823433116747344
but i was obliged to pay a hundred that will do that will do monsieur bertuccio   9.183413675477333
make haste dear lodger said he   13.792145682435768
the chevalier raised his head saw the two young women and without stopping waved his hand in a friendly way to milady   13.553598635360364
of what country   13.369138634918333
he called   11.944909544629624
and the evening came on slowly but finally it came   13.15203071628767
and so mademoiselle danglars she could not endure the insult offered to us by that wretch so she asked permission to travel   12.922799267615519
well replied la carconte do as you like   12.226849334660796
i repeat it is melancholy to pass one s life without having one joy to recall without preserving a single hope   6.1646718897376
didn t he speak of me in any way   9.852512179545021
there is not one who has not treated me as the master of the house the only title i desire with respect to you   7.3774448220805
the bolts were drawn   16.947216696305244
our house added the englishman with a laugh does not do things in that way   13.317969569772941
in four days said morrel   14.189250957463793
you disturb you agitate the people who live in the castle   12.179321773078733
the count listened with satisfaction to this tale of wounded self love and defeated ambition   13.318292244872309
she can give blood in return for blood that is all   13.948075538329503
alas madame   12.183934448935943
villefort continued he knows me and i have pledged my word to him   8.067908882758696
the journey chapter 86   16.175002605086302
now you talk my dear   14.99085951228897
gaetano faltered an excuse and advanced to the opposite side while two sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their way   12.25681292221169
that girl is not his wife he told us himself she was his slave   9.924745014216736
exclaimed d artagnan anxiously   13.077532637924882
he asked me   13.833590146880564
i owe you the proofs and explanations of what i have said   11.732135108042474
all right said porthos   5.728372878338522
on their side the mother and daughter retired into the embrasure of a window to read eagerly the following letter dear wife we have now reached the moment of decision   5.13965100174514
yes just before you came   15.03301276977346
the officer s face expressed complete stupefaction   11.786051783705737
haydée it will be recollected that the new or rather old acquaintances of the count of monte cristo residing in the rue meslay were no other than maximilian julie and emmanuel   7.764422312611069
very sure   6.161874694529939
yes captain returned carlini   9.576819589711203
cried bonacieux in despair   4.578978383230329
valentine started   13.921379219092548

in a month to the day the very hour and the date is a sacred one maximilian   12.921170861972723

julie hesitated and resolved to take counsel   13.055014306260029
the leave of absence monsieur has asked for replied the lackey   13.161950490968252
an admirable subject   19.31494846499666
if they were strangers he would listen to their conversation and might understand something of this hitherto incomprehensible mystery   10.310504981213633

about forty leagues only   13.897756099670785
the gardens were illuminated with colored lanterns according to the italian custom and as is usual in countries where the luxuries of the table the rarest of all luxuries in their complete form are well understood the supper table was loaded with wax lights and flowers   12.625608378646207

to tear such clothes   17.993740738032198
what would you have my dear viscount   7.415721288942225
starting up he clasped his hands around his head as though to prevent his very brain from bursting and exclaimed his father   9.000294129179773
he could not yet see that dreadful cross but he felt somehow as if it were coming to meet him   8.237868657015346
but not enough   14.188181580597924
for my own part i have laid aside even the name of my father and altogether disown his political principles   13.130267731024272
certainly it is empty replied the procurator s wife in real innocence   9.031320382074977
all goes well   8.487652796639589

there is a whole history connected with the names fernand and yanina   12.271725015528183
matrimonial projects the day following this scene at the hour debray usually chose to pay a visit to madame danglars on his way to his office his coupé did not appear   16.26973532907539
aramis burst into a fit of laughter   12.900413179457384
exclaimed porthos mutton again   10.115349048585896
besides which the musketeer after having exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with him broached the matter first   13.894394751013365
and even supposing all these perils past then to have to swim for your life a distance of at least three miles ere you could reach the shore were difficulties so startling and formidable that dantès had never even dreamed of such a scheme resigning himself rather to death   13.507846522657182
that would be contrary to all custom   13.817909371803164
well it is a question of serving the king the gentleman s duty   12.825603391880104
yes but i make hereby a vow in your presence to employ all that remains to me in pious works   13.040911863566022
he drew out his watch and exclaimed morbleu   14.189388700830946
those who are known are not the most dangerous   11.423562349007996
alas your excellency is right replied bertuccio and god made this infant the instrument of our punishment   14.515985988657139
i can not reconcile myself to this idea it would madden me   9.443926922886867
the poor fellow does not know the purpose for which i am here   13.221934439515286
you hear sir   13.046933614635096
next moment the door opened and the man disappeared   13.099020691437888
does not your eminence fear that the punishment inflicted upon ravaillac may deter anyone who might entertain the idea of imitating him   8.468464863912644
d artagnan tried to recall his remembrances   13.882871423740667
cried porthos oh   7.844556480469011
say no more   8.21376494135121
it was the advice of athos to go straight to the minister   13.067936496469104
30301m meanwhile he advanced through the assemblage of guests under a battery of curious glances towards madame de morcerf who standing before a mantle piece ornamented with flowers had seen his entrance in a looking glass placed opposite the door and was prepared to receive him   9.028363977963915
that of the home department or of the observatory   13.487345150935491
i will follow your eminence s instructions to the letter   10.404697491682853
now of two hundred and fifty one members who composed the parliament there were one hundred and ninety one who were in the way and might have upset his political wagon   5.4089092120528655
then said monte cristo here are 200 000 francs gone after hush do not mention these things said danglars   6.373206618105066
and from whose hands the count extricated me in so wonderful a manner   15.596218726490108
cavalcanti i trust you will not leave before i have had the honor of presenting you to some of my friends   19.812517292303355
the abbé shook his head   11.658699846828338
years have elapsed many events have happened alas   5.251763914936036
kitty breathed a second sigh   10.596777315241358
when were you here   8.816080623750377
the treasure when dantès returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in captivity he found faria seated and looking composed   12.853769257999833
his legs trembled and his thoughts flew about madly in his brain like the wheels of a disordered watch   11.780090133578398
wait my dear father said the young man one word more   10.657047554969274
much monsieur mordaunt would care   12.08774031493195
i do not like auteuil sir said the procureur making an evident effort to appear calm   8.82249242363002
haydée became pale and lifting her transparent hands to heaven exclaimed in a voice stifled with tears then you leave me my lord   6.85526250535317
when i tell you a thing sir said mordaunt you insult me by doubting it   14.95275422259671
against calumniators said m   14.624169657079578
but at present i must imitate the discretion of the doctor s niece   12.968019686095206
adieu till then   12.36056677971915
but the jaws were so clenched that the pen could not pass them   14.571389623681977
ah maximilian that is the very thing that makes you so bold and which renders me at once so happy and unhappy that i frequently ask myself whether it is better for me to endure the harshness of my stepmother and her blind preference for her own child or to be as i now am insensible to any pleasure save such as i find in these meetings so fraught with danger to both   9.031850710199024
of these 600 000 francs you took 50 000 crowns   11.18114250784946
an intervening elevation of land hid the light   11.006538046338532
as soon as gaetano had transmitted this answer the sentinel gave an order to one of the men seated round the fire who rose and disappeared among the rocks   7.201040988901365
and pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune   15.946498350434396
tell your client that although i am the insulted party in order to carry out my eccentricity i leave him the choice of arms and will accept without discussion without dispute anything even combat by drawing lots which is always stupid but with me different from other people as i am sure to gain   13.268051490274802
why you have drunk more than a hundred pistoles worth   11.869961202034888
you see that i should be a fool to accept your offer   13.633090909701133
go down athos he mistrusts you less than me and see if he be still at his door   9.51189756757448
you believe me to be a frenchman for i speak french with the same facility and purity as yourself   11.308599437374124
that s it said d artagnan   8.89020947110591
the nose hooked but finely chiseled   10.901216680325494
why upon the frontiers of artois and of flanders   10.797959311398984
d artagnan opened it and as the day was beginning to decline he approached the window to read it   9.611581792936683
they believe me her accomplice and will punish me with her   10.199743692979084
heaven would have given me strength   10.395734526624462
he hoped for some compliments while at the same time he feared to have frowns   12.191016692340005
which d artagnan perceiving ordered two glasses to be brought and commenced the following conversation   13.583418029117878
a shopkeeper in the rue des lombards who has great influence upon the commerce of his quarter   12.675378971097023
but do you think asked albert that we ought to accept such offers from a perfect stranger   12.122689618992132
your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required whether touching the health of his crew or the value of his freight   9.13810226038231
oh cried eugénie you are a bad physiognomist if you imagine i deplore on my own account the catastrophe of which you warn me   12.611601329346334
he ate these listening anxiously for the sound walking round and round his cell shaking the iron bars of the loophole restoring vigor and agility to his limbs by exercise and so preparing himself for his future destiny   13.598054143692936
he served in india discovered a mine in thessaly and comes to paris to establish a mineral water cure at auteuil   6.007488830794358
an unhappy prisoner replied dantès who made no hesitation in answering   14.981891950604684
laporte made no further objection and read my lord by that which since i have known you have suffered by you and for you i conjure you if you have any care for my repose to countermand those great armaments which you are preparing against france to put an end to a war of which it is publicly said religion is the ostensible cause and of which it is generally whispered your love for me is the concealed cause   14.414750209589865
returned debray carelessly   10.753657067906286
can you guess said d artagnan who was the man who headed this infernal expedition   9.351569767210304
here s to our colonel and let him know that we are always at his commands as far as london and farther   10.518738908701321
amusing certainly replied the young man inasmuch as instead of shedding tears as at the fictitious tale of woe produced at a theatre you behold in a law court a case of real and genuine distress a drama of life   8.836561559636941
raise money with it and let your husband set out   6.944106013597108
let us pretend not to notice that he is watching us   10.276949699982115
the latter took in the whole scene at a glance   12.10408004061971
silence for monsieur porthos s idea   16.324315021102194
commend me to the cardinal   14.13087539364249
bonacieux who was ignorant that d artagnan had overheard his conversation with the stranger of meung related to his young tenant the persecutions of that monster m   6.470582078883678
but leaping lightly ashore he signified his desire to be quite alone   9.468432765790089
you know he has estates porthos   13.983109661397407
talking of captain leclere has not dantès given you a letter from him   16.208266888267033
all is charming and everything savors of nobility replied d artagnan   8.756931736789596
do you remember me   9.728703163129332
and on your honor you have no cause of hatred against me   10.733427627149169
i prefer that   11.666657794595208
sometimes mere strangers like the count of monte cristo came to visit her   14.492582537809936
rejoined mazarin impatiently it s about an hour since i asked you for that very thing wooden head that you are   12.270283401208449
it is a great honor for a poor distributor of holy water   6.796558803956855
the foundation s business office is located at 809 north 1500 west salt lake city ut 84116 801 596 1887   11.46189027090591
not a penny of what i possess will pass into your hands   12.593179315535473
and what part did he play in this sad drama   9.696598557534694
there was no doubt upon the subject   9.022212319931956
you will find it has been hollowed out for the purpose of containing a small phial you will see there half filled with a red looking fluid   9.23897164954693
came into france i would offer him my house my own house   8.1498901389007
i shall tell you my name in order that you may know where to find me my lord or my prince as it may suit you best to be called said our gascon who did not choose to seem to yield to a threat   13.489086814315208
who i am madame   10.584151524914956
but pistache as at first turned round on his legs and stood with his back to the cane   6.035742238173203
even if the powerful voice of nature should be silent you can not well mistake him   16.33175723033321
he was as we have already said perfectly well acquainted with the literature of all countries   7.487974803335678
with whom with a child seven years old   17.005577343068403
there was something grave and solemn in the approach of the young girl which struck the old man and immediately his bright eye began to interrogate   12.411967587753791
the eyes of the paralytic expressed a multitude of tumultuous thoughts   12.802050515575923
no one i tell you will escape   15.649005250454405
the evening was employed in discussing the war   13.743245582961054
i have not seen you nor your friends and i don t think you could gather all that dust that i saw planchet brush off your boots yesterday from the pavement of paris   13.72725769048603
diavolaccio advanced amidst the most profound silence and laid rita at the captain s feet   19.089552244533593
true true cried danglars   14.11788458944023
did he take baptistin with him   16.278590364516464
and understanding that was what he wanted again watched his eyes which turned toward an old secretaire which had been neglected for many years and was supposed to contain nothing but useless documents   9.731647143789871
poor concino concini   13.236225170468517
i shall pass by blois   13.150725327593314
when the chill of the night had driven away the guests from the gardens and the gates of the villa were closed on them for the festa in doors he took teresa quite away and as he left her at her home he said teresa what were you thinking of as you danced opposite the young countess of san felice   11.23635434812254
with this light was extinguished the last irresolution in the heart of d artagnan   11.431795335367644
monsieur cardinal you have heard me   16.919357522323907
dantès descended the staircase preceded by the magistrate and followed by the soldiers   11.172495901441167
i have acquired the bad habit of calling persons by their titles from living in a country where barons are still barons by right of birth   12.149627066365776
de villefort cried a beautiful young creature daughter to the comte de salvieux and the cherished friend of mademoiselle de saint méran do try and get up some famous trial while we are at marseilles   15.474447555503158
he whispered to porthos as they proceeded   13.810229454729065
danglars more and more delighted with major cavalcanti had offered him a seat in his carriage   11.21401238910955
the couple then although they had not seen each other for eight days and during that time serious events had taken place in which both were concerned accosted each other with a degree of preoccupation   15.204559623609303
an error i readily forgive but wilful negligence or forgetfulness never   13.5307992464166
what is the next   11.423594425055429
with the greatest care   13.271001643470967
exclaimed the gascon surprised   12.957326425029883
and has he conformed to all that the letter specified   15.786876132067395
and what does it amount to after all   13.096135295662599
i don t suppose there is a more contented man at this moment in all the kingdom than yourself   13.041265927852026
of high treason   9.392738341393454
in the meantime my dear lucien here are cigars contraband of course try them and persuade the minister to sell us such instead of poisoning us with cabbage leaves   9.980166856322926
madame de morcerf did not lose sight of monte cristo   18.959118951464866
but however near it may be replied d artagnan i can not go thither in this guise   12.839375243162502
the antechamber of m   11.890439546588091
as he passed them he said they are extremely handsome certainly and you have done well to purchase them although you were somewhat remiss not to have procured them sooner   12.383450151305912
go my friend reserve your strength for the moment when the crash shall come   9.911312010340211
i shall be back in ten minutes   15.395565598629153
i broke my word it is true   11.853015066823996
either we shall be attacked or not   13.0238997716054
he had been informed at seven o clock in the morning that a rope ladder floated from one of the windows of the castle   14.205810521064782
fortunately by our marriage contract the survivor takes everything   9.702876019882913
by you   12.958677324334468
an excuse for us   15.106627845476524
yes echoed porthos glancing affectionately at his sword still hanging on the wall   8.740784286817735
oh dear yes   7.664403060812508
get in laporte   13.04907268962164
nothing but intrigues   9.822660149622497
as soon as the escort arrived in a city when they had conducted the king to his quarters the four friends either retired to their own or to some secluded cabaret where they neither drank nor played   13.284797748195635
now if they believed us they laughed in order to insult us   12.782180032722955
does your excellency wish for a receipt   8.949286910859177
but there was no look calculated to reassure her   9.40189314346847
i am at home here and i alone have a right to raise my voice above another s   12.353485593773648
but on gaining the riverside he had mechanically put his hand into his pocket and perceived that he had not wherewithal to pay his passage   13.919062857332417
50123m yes i think i saw him pass   11.567603686152887
it proceeded from a wish like a submissive and devoted daughter a slight smile was observable on the purple lips of the young girl to practice obedience   5.376924723570941
how does it happen that you are in paris   12.823723085311645
said mordaunt whose face was lighted by a savage joy as cromwell spoke this skiff might be of use to you for personal projects   9.839771906927917
but i knocked down more than twenty with the hilt of balizarde   16.127906471887464
just to please me albert said mercédès   15.322428949317057
50170m oh pardon me sir   16.984231302122524
i speak of the prop of the state of my only servant of my only friend of the cardinal   15.20624923550956
bonacieux and that he should find her next day at the louvre   7.956222968179233
i have more than once intended witnessing an execution but i have never been able to make up my mind   12.808123698141262
and by what   15.186890547534734
in which it is proved that first impulses are oftentimes the best   9.657975351811917
the first impulse of these three and of those who last entered was to cast an inquiring glance at each other   8.117058784005673
tell him that the third aramis is the lover of madame de chevreuse he may be left alone we know his secret and it may be useful   10.436218839830397
with respect to aramis though having the air of having nothing secret about him he was a young fellow made up of mysteries answering little to questions put to him about others and having learned from him the report which prevailed concerning the success of the musketeer with a princess wished to gain a little insight into the amorous adventures of his interlocutor   16.190262806908798
here i am   9.396104236531555
i scarcely thought you were so curious as that   10.850046511555417
he turned it gently on its hinges   15.579659503345127
then there is no revenge   12.581053775080818
the woman must have once been handsome but traces of sorrow have aged her   12.599497835581676
your true father   9.092305520953659
your father did not hesitate an instant and the sum was sent to the frontier of piedmont with a passport signed for italy   16.79060714715555
i only ate some fruit   13.079077957972844
for heaven s sake don t be obstinate for when others are obstinate i am obstinate likewise and then i become ferocious and headstrong and there s my friend who is even more headstrong and ferocious than myself   15.10743508315226
well yes planchet to be sure said athos what is there so astonishing in that   10.375060399549549
and at this moment albert had nothing more transpired your father s cause had been gained   14.517036333603773
olivain we have come into possession of two horses but i have lost my own   17.21682569595531
he was a shepherd boy attached to the farm of the count of san felice situated between palestrina and the lake of gabri   14.255088271238284
she joined her hands with a suppliant air but without venturing to speak a word   11.85889110250907
after the reward of his devotion that of his love was to come   11.858542803561788
felton had not spoken   13.814527935490503
only let me warn you that i am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements   11.649119704384438
just then a handsome young man with bright eyes black hair and glossy moustache respectfully bowed to madame de villefort   12.823764027928357
de busigny who by the by had given them a magnificent dinner a partner worthy of his company   11.747020414827249
but you will probably learn the reason soon   11.934234089195146
it is one that becomes a man accustomed to look his enemies in the face   13.264189099185025
here is what the letter contained milady be at the first ball at which the duke of buckingham shall be present   12.450264670694486
we had anticipated this kindness on the part of the count said beauchamp and i have brought some weapons which i bought eight or ten days since thinking to want them on a similar occasion   13.91824040455794
so i took him round the waist and threw him into the boat and then i jumped after him   11.661635148197837
more closely watched than ever the queen felt certain without knowing how to tell which that one of her women had betrayed her   14.623709054062813
go and call out your regiment said he   11.113017536263389
thanks thanks dear love adieu   14.007285961286481
i shall hear this morning that m   4.619538777802424
a cry of astonishment was heard from all parts of the room   11.848820222832442
i must wait   13.689635111664593
in each there was an enemy to contend with and contributions to be levied   11.711011584115957
it gives you an idea of your value   12.789228232084259
he is moving   7.505912915644451
meantime between charenton and the royal army was left a space which looked ready to serve as a last resting place for the dead   9.34748100035371
what prevents you from being so   11.497891776462959
not only free but in favor   6.856663546381348
who are those gentlemen   13.957345712246886
the door was scarcely closed when albert bent his steps to his mother s room   12.56849604289858
yes borgia has been here a torch in one hand a sword in the other and within twenty paces at the foot of this rock perhaps two guards kept watch on land and sea while their master descended as i am about to descend dispelling the darkness before his awe inspiring progress   15.122833390958665
the ghost of samuel appeared to saul and it is an article of faith that i should be very sorry to see any doubt thrown upon porthos   8.033240518732626
benedetto for the murder of his comrade in chains   6.691327085125032
it contained monte cristo   8.628684731785409
he has probably been killed   14.84669052171063
it appears that this club is rather a bore to the police   12.528501070730032
my life was in constant danger   13.964396505963903
i wrote to him from boulogne   10.449094584097985
from six in the morning to eight at night come by the door   5.171627047403678
valentine shook the gate with a strength of which she could not have been supposed to be possessed as morrel was going away and passing both her hands through the opening she clasped and wrung them   12.373334082061172
the friends went to bed early but neither of them slept   14.462162096191715
for i know what it is to be in love   13.89600023766699
my friend there is the viscount of bragelonne and i am the count de guiche   9.171201720667206
egad i know where he is said d artagnan   22.921084881151536
are you not mademoiselle julie morrel   16.022146264133188
swear to me replied faria to free me if what i tell you prove true and i will stay here while you go to the spot   11.446324715538275
madame de villefort expressed a desire to return to paris which madame danglars had not dared to do notwithstanding the uneasiness she experienced   13.634018454519524
there is peril of imprisonment risk of life in knowing me   10.079504991669813
don t be uneasy   8.22832575720754
pass the pen to aramis who writes theses in latin   10.01535700110895
steps sounded in the chamber and drew near   13.465266934726912
the trumpets sounded   14.572366295816577
de tréville had good reason to mistrust the cardinal and to think that all was not over for scarcely had the captain of the musketeers closed the door after him than his eminence said to the king now that we are at length by ourselves we will if your majesty pleases converse seriously   12.331121476090736
de villefort has secluded himself   8.57488400685385
dantès continued his search   14.461959094563028
but he stopped at seeing the horrible alteration that had taken place in the countenance of athos who standing before the table his hair rising from his head his eyes fixed in stupor was looking at one of the glasses and appeared a prey to the most horrible doubt   11.721412903753455
let us hear what it is first   8.166309820392105
then monte cristo slipped aside one of the movable panels which enabled him to see into the adjoining room   11.262822101567451
he rose to return the salutation   12.781946977766827
you will i hope be grateful for it   9.79754045958092
you know them likewise   9.294916987722027
well asked franz what think you of the count of monte cristo   8.454356054986059
whatever you say   12.06778268147623
i sounded all the walls in the hopes of discovering a door but everywhere the walls returned a full and flat sound   14.604003024406223
i know that i must have been mad senseless to believe that snow would become animated or marble warm   6.606899453058199
before the sleeping king they will be mute gentle and timid as lambs   13.261182036751634
sir she replied did i not say and did you not hear me say to those people that you should do as you pleased   10.880855409205765
how did you know i was in prison   11.124368608437772
you arrive in good time dear d artagnan said aramis and by taking part in our discussion may assist us with your intelligence   9.513482376526941
just so muttered comminges looking after mazarin   11.732705562701865
and thus he proceeded onwards till he arrived at the end of the rue de noailles from whence a full view of the allées de meilhan was obtained   14.002884539030926
that s more time than we want   10.152998717558049
would anything retain you particularly in paris   10.557891876123461
the gentleman appeared to be enumerating all his qualities to his auditors   12.57307749973184
i am paid   10.965828538201427
besides his majesty takes no pains to conceal how little affection he has for me   9.622686839007413
you said you were but three but it appears to me we are four   15.576320788006566
the officer who commanded the post of the red cross was sent for and by successive inquiries they learned that athos was then lodged in fort l evêque   12.950863422992793
not one   10.743281745440825
during the twenty years i served i often wished to do so but i had not the time   8.11829600950944
exclaimed emmanuel   16.158672722147944
a police agent entered   11.5329120591228
a woman of such inferior condition   12.293898752377244
you have a daughter then madame   13.765157199295855
yes but those five millions and a half are not mine and are only a proof of the great confidence placed in me   14.633899895445737
andrea bit his lips   6.172934131712134
and then that which was inconceivable in athos who was always retiring was that delicate knowledge of the world and of the usages of the most brilliant society those manners of a high degree which appeared as if unconsciously to himself in his least actions   15.570998320492754
thus the genoese subtle as he was was duped by edmond in whose favor his mild demeanor his nautical skill and his admirable dissimulation pleaded   8.65241043651855
ah a window   16.83321446922573
motionless against the dark tapestry with her hair in disorder she appeared like a horrid image of terror   10.936884345597452
i was speaking of your father s past history   8.242255652929785
i am yet living   14.866120910222733
great undertakings come poorly off with paltry means   15.689690183435793
are all your family well   7.3828996231537
they waited upwards of ten minutes   14.880292049331128
only three or four days ago the impertinent jackanapes gave me his bill and i was forced to turn both him and his bill out of the door   11.073946569164034
he was less stiff than formerly   10.498089211286633
five hundred leagues are not to be accomplished without some trouble and especially in france where it seems it is forbidden to beat the postilions   7.435534232461919
aramis alighted and clapped his hands three times   17.641908154480582
but i thought this mark of consideration due to you   10.708228657325416
he longed to be alone and free to ponder over all that had occurred   9.857287022410308
oh how he will thank you   12.298311723902552
if you succeed with him i pronounce you the demon himself   13.324474951592396
a loud laugh followed these words pronounced with that boldness which women draw from their own weakness a weakness which removes them beyond the power of vengeance   11.8322530468143
i only brought you here to ask you returned mazarin smiling if you have taken any particular notice of our lieutenant of musketeers   8.612664640859053
and her looks fixed on the future beheld nothing but the high fortunes reserved for her by the cardinal whom she had so successfully served without his name being in any way mixed up with the sanguinary affair   10.294701504337299
oh my father must your past career always interfere with my successes   10.112431336968049
my valet in examining this mournful relic felt a paper in the pocket and drew it out   12.73023887835977
said busoni disdainfully   10.245736812144422
i swear i will not   15.624873663071913
parry resumed his reading   14.090687244087917
now said morrel do you wish me to retire   15.487363379318335
said the englishman i practice shooting every day and every other day grisier comes to my house   8.848616247837445
morrel started   11.820224377581592
onward   11.256550854426415
do you know who this pretended duchess is   9.750005577270064
farewell till we meet again said aramis as they took leave of planchet   18.95286898376012
your home is a paradise porthos   14.83894502517755
the two friends looked to the right to the left   17.16095293187191
go then my friends said the former sighing   12.373627136620959
come cheer up   8.320438016316189
do you see madame he recognizes you and bows   7.15732958959226
struck in the breast and extending his arms the spaniard fell back on the crupper and the terrified horse turning around carried him off   8.919280515287674
for i have such a delightful note on the pastor quum traheret wait and i will listen to you afterwards   11.552139679077426
five minutes later he was in the rue des fossoyeurs   15.126056603170163
what has happened to you my lord   11.811719460120427
the iron box was there no one had touched it under a beautiful fig tree my father had planted the day i was born which overshadowed the spot   12.727995762687732
noirtier s happiness i   15.827648291657866
i am sorry too monsieur   10.20041808194061
de tréville who had a tincture of literature and monsieur de benserade was quoting it to me the other day   12.453180958779802
he struck his pocket and said we shall see what monsieur de tréville will think of this insult offered to his protégé   9.65959245374355
frankly and loyally repeated milady with an unspeakable expression of duplicity   18.197323143912968
you are late   13.053816090097007
whatever may happen valentine do not be alarmed   10.904326364609254
you may guess finding the luck turned that i again staked the diamond   4.30185431231938
tell him further that i hold montague in my power   11.140775388097817
as you execute you will understand   13.544750426678497
but from whom is that letter   6.696037182173918
then demanded athos   11.173889440226404
i forgot said athos laughing   11.626572500005356
the king feared an outbreak   12.062616672150373
yes here it is   10.863548604188066
what do you want you strumpet   14.543247210521466
five hundred pistoles   15.977916050526876
cried the young man turning pale   17.322906511778985
he shall receive them on returning from the mayor s20   9.36476444997777
if it is monsieur d artagnan and his friends he will bring them to us   11.166029873509963
replied planchet astonished   10.358649319507778
madame said the president you have engaged to furnish the committee with some important particulars respecting the affair at yanina and you have stated that you were an eyewitness of the event   14.712729940922014
their legs began to tremble and the foam they shed whitened the doublets of their masters   10.876013627115764
i wished to explain this plan to you on the day you received my first invitation   13.067023459555411
he then formed a resolution   16.659274794084205
mademoiselle said he you have a sacred duty to fulfil in your deceased grandmother s room will you allow me the honor of a few minutes conversation with m   12.88878129428164
and without listening to villefort he arose and followed valentine who was running downstairs with the joy of a shipwrecked mariner who finds a rock to cling to   9.384336347838678
but he well knew that it was not in a piece of furniture that the queen would place the important letter she had written that day   16.31472168979469
well they have gone to fetch her no doubt from madame de morcerf s   11.206374715746367
turned returned and arranged them so as to enable me to express my thoughts through their medium   15.823103648548162
really sir d artagnan said to him i am pleased to find one with whom to talk in my own poor tongue   9.022474915556113
the notary here descended and valentine was informed that her grandmother was alone   7.248340416425775
i shall have nothing to do but to fold my arms   3.6246899864735997
it is monsieur d artagnan   18.509413558531023
you can indeed when the arrow lights point downward on somebody s head   15.572873008198343
this voice the sound of which reached d artagnan reawakened in his heart a thousand sentiments a thousand recollections that he had forgotten   9.919780996143691
and then moreover what could happen to him   12.115702764951049
and previously where were you   11.359298765544471
and if at the expiration of ten minutes you do not see me come out return to my hôtel for it will be useless for you to wait for me longer   13.11233843493432
the comtesse de morcerf who is aristocracy and refinement itself does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with one of ignoble birth   7.153726062994924
your fine chateau is worthy of affording its princely hospitality to his eminence   7.97239608892558
he leaves me in paris as our separation will conduce to his benefit   13.230243161155645
on the contrary my boy on the contrary i am pleased with your zeal   8.365974767133299
my air is excellent   14.641559436255047
then he added to himself these english revolutionists are all beggars and ill bred   8.721586278601055
nevertheless it is necessary that my will should be respected in my family and that the folly of an old man and the caprice of a child should not be allowed to overturn a project which i have entertained for so many years   9.772479326149107
on hearing the password germain bowed   13.832789576919563
having acquitted themselves of their errand and exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with edmond danglars and caderousse took their places beside fernand and old dantès the latter of whom attracted universal notice   17.73741983423025
the abbé threw off his wig shook his head and his hair no longer confined fell in black masses around his manly face   9.475575610901412
as to the left hand one he conscientiously repeated the same signals which were finally transmitted to the minister of the interior   12.962015613678517
it is you accordingly that i have pitched upon to conduct the king and the queen to saint germain   11.059463582257166
milady that woman so courageous and firm shivered in spite of herself   11.801503836206667
what do i think   14.811505924056318
i will not allow the prefect of police to interfere with my private affairs   9.059343170749175
and not only did he recognize him but the cell in which albert had been confined and which was probably kept for the accommodation of strangers   11.633167843590991
i thought that my entreaties what right have you any more than the rest to ask for an exception   13.323640009404652
that farewell struck madame de villefort like the executioner s knife   11.960347527698168
when valentine pale with emotion had wiped away a tear   8.556823906579236
but continued aramis the details escape me   11.388872437623869
these considerations naturally gave villefort a feeling of such complete felicity that his mind was fairly dazzled in its contemplation   6.4727325434488385
père pamphile had seen dantès pass not ten minutes before   14.71506141113666
you mistake sir said morcerf with a gloomy smile   9.02881202082326
noirtier s breathing came thick and short   15.072911108747547
my dear albert said he let me introduce to you m   6.145569147597543
but i shall remain firm in my determination and the world shall see which party has reason on his side   13.6628114486558
the boat went on but the prisoner thought only of mercédès   8.979340273681672
the four gentlemen stopped near them   17.183571694621296
you are accused of treason of abuse of power and murder   14.807559186186165
let us go on straight forwards   14.863693464668334
a bed of dried grass covered with goat skins was placed in one corner   10.699793635300583
no sire but to buy your majesty   12.300245928933576
that an unfaithful tutor bought over by the enemies of your family by the corsinari   16.42060536670259
he may tell me whether i shall ever be loved sufficiently to make amends for all i have suffered   8.454193853517578
oh no self love beauchamp   11.88155960595809
two hundred louis each of us would be making a pretty thing of it   14.817679359678898
the banker accompanied him to the door   8.301371448050542
chapter 92   17.87363551930261
coquenard had ascended   7.851703087013348
on seeing him d artagnan could hardly suppress an exclamation of surprise   10.1164443064612
these different sciences that you have made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of them and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced them this is my treasure my beloved friend and with this you have made me rich and happy   8.932534323473018
at the end of two hours as porthos did not come not any news of him they resumed their journey   15.5810479299373
therefore while repeating to himself that his death was inevitable he did not make up his mind to die quietly as one less courageous and less restrained might have done in his place   12.331136737567283
no my lord and i will set out at once   9.520642986716526
that is sufficient   7.578421175408162
the prince leaped to his feet extending his hand in the direction whence came the sound there was no mistaking it it was the noise of cannon   12.325072187619481
what an injustice my dear invalid   8.856694429285913
now my fault is repaired   16.61814677731001
she passed like a shadow through the lodge and ran upstairs without a sound escaping under the touch of her light foot   8.183763434909668
gervais followed by grimaud who carried the basket ignorant of where he was going but in the passive obedience which athos had taught him not even thinking of asking   17.00782862982723
if you do not come across one return for me   14.171243739555553
yes you saw only the torrent that threatened to overturn everything and you gave no attention to the still water   15.484763706938486
oh you are so kind and i am so grateful   12.859942112371568
drink this and then take nothing more tonight   2.4544758717973583
the count bowed and contented himself with seeing villefort to the door of his cabinet the procureur being escorted to his carriage by two footmen who on a signal from their master followed him with every mark of attention   11.868126388834092

athos entered without the least mistrust and took out two pistoles to pay the bill   14.388422548413816
a mournful sob burst from villefort s heart   9.554439629031352
the king looked at the three gentlemen   15.166951671063412

the first risk that dantès ran was that the jailer when he brought him his supper at seven o clock might perceive the change that had been made   11.121149235545818
the young man saw the effect produced on his betrothed and a smile of pride passed over his lips   12.060517147288643
i did not say that i feared it   8.935706657731766

as he alighted comminges approached him   10.073331511952201
my dear d herblay   11.600398011367988
milady knew that lord de winter lied and she was the more alarmed   10.76920771961511
for that is i believe the phrase for hopeful ambition   12.888721393980168
and if besides the pleasure of being in garrison here we must hear such things as these no mortal can hold out   5.543394971463007
it has been long enough to inflict on me a great and undeserved misfortune   16.640419774188103

villefort rang   15.627798552690535
yes stammered the old man   12.538190409063706
must this last formality take place in your presence sir   9.41149937762151
replied albert clasping in his convulsed grasp the glove which monte cristo did not lose sight of   12.945355703928335
almost instantly a female head was put out at the window with two fingers placed upon her mouth either to enjoin silence or to send him a kiss   14.577899188487665
listen it is impossible   17.542846535846845

no count i hope i assure you i shall do my best stammered villefort   10.085681584091764
my antagonist took flight replied de guiche and left me at liberty to come to your assistance   11.672020318738426
now said he will you come   16.4250840777597
morrel horrified supported his head with one hand and with the other pressed his heart lest its beatings should be heard   14.647582359744403
yes madame here i have a right to do so for it concerns monsieur d artagnan d artagnan he repeated in such a manner as to bow the regal brow with recollections of the weak and erring woman   15.719998823893421
the persons whose names were thus pronounced looked at the stranger with astonishment   12.591449259314569
let us lose no time   13.300803868133297
now my dear count he said let us on with all the speed we may   7.977603570739906
those lips were magnificent   15.42764476464475
the cardinal had little notes thrown over in which he represented to the rochellais how unjust selfish and barbarous was the conduct of their leaders   14.974129821583208
de boville are you not going to the funeral of poor mademoiselle de villefort which i met on my road here   11.180220900793651
he hesitated a moment he was so very desirous to complete the poor devil s punishment   13.581558056374869
said bonacieux they took good care not to tell me that   13.001100787824688
meanwhile lord de winter the deputies the leaders of the expedition the officers of buckingham s household had all made their way into the chamber   13.031912327272101
said friquet my fortune is made   9.528336036050128
bonacieux made no reply   16.08399442185278
he said at last   10.870976285383305
bertuccio alone turned pale whenever benedetto s name was mentioned in his presence but there was no reason why anyone should notice his doing so   20.28449014352156
well you must allow it is the best thing for the stomach   10.858133579632632
are we not going   11.821345936703706
the evidence will support it   9.501824446093108
you can not condemn me   9.661331909992708
on the other hand he was about to land without any other escort than these men on an island which had indeed a very religious name but which did not seem to franz likely to afford him much hospitality thanks to the smugglers and bandits   10.386268111208663
there will be extenuating circumstances he replied   8.884598558663436
perfectly just cried the other two guardsmen the judgment of king solomon   9.211748540259634
well in the first place here is my chisel   16.263549058241207
but this crowd represented chiefly the second class of nobility while the prince de conti the duc de beaufort and the coadjutor assembled around them the first nobility of france   14.870101907462157
nor hang me   13.235308271616077
but do you mean to say you have not heard of this   12.613674331251621
but can they will they receive an unhappy king who will bring such a sad story into a country already agitated by civil discord   13.5913387390616
my lord he asked where does your eminence wish monsieur comte de la fere to be lodged   9.689193810402974
what was the subject of my thoughts from the time consciousness returned to me   5.880214736328114
general i wished to see the ceremony to the end which delayed me   11.981775746691778
but in the midst of all this carelessness it was evident that they mutually observed each other   11.797712190600485
besides be assured my dear edmond the dungeon i am about to leave will not long remain empty   7.113333587959189
then we are once more reunited   8.399818302652097
why did you not come down to breakfast   11.228854910214025

inquired the unknown   10.104283422869624
besides a signal made half a league out at sea and to which la jeune amélie replied by a similar signal indicated that the moment for business had come   9.62575355934172
pardon madame he said i am not a lawyer i am a mere soldier and probably therefore i do not quite comprehend the value of certain words   12.455542195026972
d artagnan inquired for the confidential valet of the duke who having accompanied him in all his voyages spoke french perfectly well   8.360380785432572
nay i will go still further and say that i had previously made up my mind to ask a great favor at your hands   10.338610315931485
if i tell you one thing you will be so amiable as to set aside all impediments   14.568424004572785
the friends made a little detour and went to the camp and gave the army an exact account of the flight of the king and queen   15.860953732514053
were consumed or nearly so he commenced complaints which athos thought nauseous porthos indecent and aramis ridiculous   6.387712057553658
a few men the least impressed of all by the scene pronounced a discourse some deploring this premature death others expatiating on the grief of the father and one very ingenious person quoting the fact that valentine had solicited pardon of her father for criminals on whom the arm of justice was ready to fall until at length they exhausted their stores of metaphor and mournful speeches elaborate variations on the stanzas of malherbe to du périer   14.903960017430798
if i take you you will be hung   12.64994386124912
bravo porthos   12.672969285936965
the duke was in full strength and beat la ramee completely   9.669486791724534
milady listened with the greatest attention and yet it was easily to be perceived whatever effort she made to conceal her impressions that this recital was not agreeable to her   5.504342603250633
to doubt any longer was impossible   13.920310207884828
on the morrow at three o clock in the afternoon they arrived at surgères   16.62284367028153
i would then take him by the feet and knock the life out of these wretched musketeers who parody the musketeers of france   11.639937483958958
at this moment the light of the torch was reflected on the wall   10.88136613177609
50229m as he repassed the catalans the count turned around and burying his head in his cloak murmured the name of a woman   8.296154774566634
and if you move i will blow your brains out   12.271007255867367
rochefort remained for a moment in thought   13.007404854220708
the king s closet at the tuileries chapter 11   15.21323696295034
as i shall ever receive the defense of a great principle my dear d herblay   12.42220916892263

pâtés made by the successor of father marteau are described   12.319078273493659
where the devil will constancy niche itself next   10.64933736067486
no he merely drew a pocketbook from his pocket and took from it a paper folded in four and after having examined it in a manner almost reverential he said good   9.192459381863962
oh nothing more easy   14.771019652652138
it was a strange thing that no one ever appeared to advance a step in that man s favor   9.999448769893032
but why do you ask   10.02999794128845
this is the second or third time monsieur that you have repeated that name and yet i have told you that i do not know him   15.248120314707931
the old man signified that he recollected him   10.95807482795792
he had scarcely finished when d artagnan made such a furious lunge at him that if he had not sprung nimbly backward it is probable he would have jested for the last time   6.7250004777604
well replied mercédès sighing go albert   14.495825570521234
in the course of the forenoon monsieur de beaufort had a game of tennis with la ramee   12.469506649014315
50205m these words had scarcely escaped him when the carriage was on its way and the feet of the horses struck a shower of sparks from the pavement   10.575241283393702
and up the stairs he dragged monte cristo   10.418416997425329
i have begun a poem in verses of one syllable   9.321759789219193
the duc de beaufort drew his sword   14.45962737884497
monsieur de cavois   12.133745710924426
but where and how shall i see you again   10.134315016960594
i wouldn t give a farthing for his life   10.871549880886608
de villefort cried he i am delighted to see you   16.26847146159155
he had sighed deeply therefore when accepting the gift of the pony from m   10.010593685899071
nevertheless it required all his skill to defend himself against an adversary who active and energetic departed every instant from received rules attacking him on all sides at once and yet parrying like a man who had the greatest respect for his own epidermis   13.418933261710043
then d artagnan as the reader from whom we have not concealed the state of his fortune very well knows d artagnan was not a millionaire   12.555944920549845
my selfishness will blind me replied morrel whose low voice and clenched hands announced his growing desperation   9.79325880114022
but under what circumstances   11.1268219867655
excellency the frenchman s carriage passed several times the one in which was teresa   10.926437294103273
yes returned d artagnan who had overheard him to night gentlemen we rescue the king   6.8075922809997005
and where do you come from   14.05504846317856
they were speaking in an undertone and yet i was so interested in what they said that i did not lose a single word   15.624642484846788
and it is still entirely in the power of my husband to cause the will which is now in prejudice of valentine to be altered in her favor   11.196566998366395
come guitant speak if you please respectfully of these gentlemen said mazarin   11.625836293902669
rise said the count your life is safe   15.409733471849698
and instead of immediately directing her steps towards the gate she seated herself on a bench and carefully casting her eyes around to convince herself that she was not watched she presently arose and proceeded quickly to join maximilian   14.422838441729363
what is there astonishing in that   8.90595126365138
joy takes a strange effect at times it seems to oppress us almost the same as sorrow   13.090262949338602
the one in the dark blue coat   10.417055117848367
on the right and on the left of the road which the dismal procession pursued appeared a few low stunted trees which looked like deformed dwarfs crouching down to watch men traveling at this sinister hour   9.706090623542833
asked the swiss   8.353716475425035
aramis is one of my best friends   13.664801636709429
ah it is you my lord   15.003676914421147
if we wanted to conceal the noble action this purse commemorates we should not expose it thus to view   12.805052672118052
said all at once a voice full of sweetness and pity   12.09529087396497
besides if your excellency pleases we can leave as soon as you like we can sail as well by night as by day and if the wind drops we can use our oars   10.171184560137451
and if you grant it me i will bless you in this world and in the next   11.813692862541123
at the name of lord de winter who was known to be one of his grace s most intimate friends the officer of the post gave orders to let felton pass who besides wore the uniform of a naval officer   7.7508283245799285
i do more than permit i exhort you   10.436008957109882
i am credited on you for six millions   12.504850728308332
oh save me   13.892177281090108
you must know i felt so interested in the splendid roan horse with his elegant little rider so tastefully dressed in a pink satin jacket and cap that i could not help praying for their success with as much earnestness as though the half of my fortune were at stake   8.621455121166317
what s that   10.184625078196401
and that a man a christian should be allowed to perish of hunger in the midst of other men who call themselves christians is too horrible for belief   11.079498702613368
he married a woman who keeps a confectioner s shop in the rue des lombards for he s a lad who was always fond of sweetmeats   8.855159635048395
now through this ventilating hole i throw my lasso and as i now know in which part of the cellar is the best wine that s my point for sport   15.14911070291986
cried d artagnan athos what has become of athos   8.902604251374008
this fawn colored hair or perhaps the sort of ascendancy which she had over other women gave her the name of la lionne   8.4008777270259
when he raised his head he saw disappearing down the passage nothing but a shadow before which the bandits bowed   15.714317439222219
aha said groslow   9.48512232232622
maximilian shuddered   14.280965507294432
we shall continue our conversation to the end of the village   15.802810712506133
only imagine my dear friend   12.603125733328277
me also   9.936553895686869
in the long run a man knows more about politics than a woman particularly such as like you monsieur bonacieux have conversed with the cardinal   8.754314827890434
in receiving and aiding him france will censure the acts of the english nation and thus so essentially harm england and especially the well being of the government that such a proceeding will be equivalent to pronounced hostilities   14.5581529609187
well asked the abbé as he returned to the apartment below what have you made up your mind to do   12.28400121482539
but when he found that he had come to the conviction that the letter was not to be found he flew for the third time into such a rage as was near costing him a fresh consumption of wine oil and rosemary for upon seeing this hot headed youth become exasperated and threaten to destroy everything in the establishment if his letter were not found the host seized a spit his wife a broom handle and the servants the same sticks they had used the day before   10.867131469814497
that s all plain enough   14.889144052218212
see here it is   12.419627574070395
what s your business here you hussy   12.739038862008767
her second glance was at the dying man   15.949527451489583
i am bored amuse me   9.700027259710437
but it wore the same wild barren aspect when seen by the rays of the morning sun which it had done when surveyed by the fading glimmer of eve   16.890783880244165
they then left the hotel athos carrying a saw porthos a vise aramis an axe and d artagnan a hammer and some nails   14.893352388859103
as edmond paused the black and bearded head of caderousse appeared at the door   10.476568521729945
noirtier playing with revolutions m   6.6903052178788665
that there shall be five hundred crowns for you and five hundred crowns for me   10.823738409794071
thinking of all this and from time to time giving a touch of the spur to his horse d artagnan completed his short journey and arrived at st   15.997206621183034
now said valentine motioning to morrel to sit down near her grandfather while she took her seat on his footstool now let us talk about our own affairs   5.128874571164101
he knew vaguely that he was ascending a flight of steps   15.345531576280923
it is miserable do you see   10.641108313689683
a letter from the viscount   9.426311079498408
i will go this instant and consult the queen and we will refer the affair at once to parliament   11.370942549596203
edmond thought he was in a dream he wavered between incredulity and joy   15.458449564320784
replied the baron negligently   14.850222704578744
that confirms what i said just now blood will have blood   16.085084869730814
and when can i see this young lady for whom i already feel so great a sympathy   7.438909343582699
i require my lord that normandy should be given to madame de longueville with five hundred thousand francs and full absolution   10.093886420802503
after quitting anne mazarin took the road to rueil where he usually resided   9.092220246498947
villefort had calculated rightly   13.586528249747404
he watched them pass through the crowd for some time but at length he lost sight of them in the via macello   15.068135235426237
everyone on board remained motionless for half an hour when the same luminous track was again observed and the swimmer was soon on board   11.110865934693587
but monsieur de tréville is a skilled physiognomist who knows men at first sight   12.153180718641687
the law we have seen how quietly mademoiselle danglars and mademoiselle d armilly accomplished their transformation and flight   10.496665644058114
but who told you i was inactive   14.656724929988826
murmured she   9.738082308793697
mazarin s face smiling as it was became clouded   9.894194077468576
then he threw himself dressed as he was upon a sofa less to sleep than to rest his limbs cramped with cold and study   16.303172934731503
when i speak of the pure parliament resumed the host i mean the one which colonel bridge has weeded   11.285079842102615
my first impressions were favorable to the minister   15.264378660208466
the queen was as we have said of great beauty   7.901814895415
they had reached the ladder which led to the boat   8.473536946186124
and the notary   11.75636565449147
the same night such a man of regularity was the patron of la jeune amélie the profits were divided and each man had a hundred tuscan livres or about eighty francs   9.496915430350636
d artagnan thought it was now time for him to join in the conversation   13.17858214988333
he tried to pass his body through the aperture but not being like the frog in the fable who thought he was larger than he really was he found he must take out three or four more before he could get through   11.971011714610565
how long i had been in this unconscious state i know not when i was suddenly aroused by the report of a pistol followed by a fearful cry   9.252412607046736
i am like yourself utterly bewildered at all that is going on and can not in the least make out what it is about   15.51701356948671
for our young man had a steed which was the observed of all observers   10.261770141684096
on shore in the grottos or on board in your cloak   9.848905723803927
that glance was so sharp that it penetrated the heart of mazarin who reading in it a declaration of war seized d artagnan by the arm and said if occasion requires monsieur you will remember that man who has just gone out will you not   10.792203751441729
but take care   8.62466140772252
he again struck it and with greater force   8.781989697028077
the figures were defined like black shadows on the red tinted horizon   10.277574241174783
d épinay and that your father was resolved upon completing the match and that from his will there was no appeal as m   10.299332491151247
yes returned dantès holding out his hand i thank you again   10.293890808853812
these are mournful auspices to accompany a betrothal sighed poor renée   10.908434658820296
but have you no request to make for yourself mercédès   9.512645335905518
then it is because you do not know your friends my dear monsieur louvieres said the coadjutor raising his hat   10.665134690153653
his face was furrowed with wrinkles   17.207160190220222
his carelessness and indifference touch me to the heart said julie   13.410295480487934
it is that the king should deign to stand godfather to the son of madame de longueville   9.521674053771651
all this is very extraordinary said château renaud   8.549974467485871
the englishman calculated fast   11.760083535189716
the french fight well   15.97406793579
he s my friend and this morning offered to share his money with me as i shared mine with him   9.037347924228133
quite   16.25777636937892
now if you will come on board m   9.254098718735335
and our masters   15.833472836812783
excellency said pastrini i am delighted to have your approbation but it was not for that i came   13.475049438558687
a summer and winter palace   10.91010496154744
then said aramis i take upon myself to obtain intelligence of her   7.85431466527846
a gentleman of high birth possessor of an ample fortune you have consented to gain your promotion as an obscure soldier step by step this is uncommon   12.51542994439484
he did not move at the sound of the door and continued his calculations until the flash of the torches lighted up with an unwonted glare the sombre walls of his cell   18.072784855913234
he muttered whence comes this thought   13.48139121969422
nothing very difficult   11.11495647111145
all the details of his coming into and going out of the palace on the night when he introduced himself in the character of an italian fortune teller you will tell him that he may not doubt the correctness of my information   6.164699409592945
have i not explained your wishes grandpapa   15.107528057377035
on receiving the warning letter you wrote to me i had this woman arrested and gave her in charge to a loyal servant   11.89978280532561
asked monte cristo quickly with an imperceptible gleam of hope   12.897807658694447
wait said monte cristo i wish to take one final glance around this room   10.532577136927674
he had not the less decided upon setting out that same evening   13.384778079149708
and what is her name   6.625021199384291
the gratings are every day carefully examined by jailers whose herculean proportions and cold pitiless expression prove them to have been chosen to reign over their subjects for their superior activity and intelligence   15.717785083791133
tell me should you have the misfortune to turn your head while your right hand correspondent was telegraphing i should not see him   11.926522726112356
and a threatening glance darted from her eyes   11.278440461338455
i did not mean to say silence silence   8.056094818066526
and what do you suspect   15.074640347906712
go to work labor young man struggle ardently and courageously   13.936707065052278
well three days after that you talked politics with m   12.617438646896426
valentine rose quickly and was hastening joyfully towards the door when m   15.989214057346071
only remember though the name be blank it is to you i give it   9.821089636100911
as the night before d artagnan did not return home till five o clock in the morning   16.602485253533164
in the meanwhile the hours passed if not rapidly at least tolerably   12.88887980071714
the will   9.46741850985868
or he will forget us added d artagnan   11.346121374062598
noirtier and will meet him if not with pleasure at least with indifference   10.338340556005923
cried aramis almost in a state of delirium   19.35923216878072
henry iv   11.491164471887725
but doubtless the spot they chose did not suit the smuggler who filled the post of sentinel for he cried out not that way if you please   12.319233191459357
and where is this house that i purchase   15.274741171112899
they were listened to with great politeness by the duke who held out hopes of easier measures promised to speak in their behalf to the queen and dismissed them with the ordinary expression of royalty we will see what we can do   13.909099757147759
the certificate of your marriage with oliva corsinari and the register of your child s birth   12.895816514118248
undoubtedly said porthos drawing himself up at athos s compliment   10.313447154359036
this would have been a favorable occasion to secure his dinner   14.179175514356608
villefort whispered some words in his ear to which the officer replied by a motion of his head   13.459950603086707
if i want money i can send for some to any of my chateaux   8.3564685663098
well the french did not avenge themselves on the traitor the spaniards did not shoot the traitor ali in his tomb left the traitor unpunished   11.840874360392908
d artagnan went successively into all the cabarets in which there was a light but could not find planchet in any of them   11.018673867743786
as i was anxious to repair the wrongs i had done the prisoner resumed the innkeeper i took my way straight to the cellar in order to set him at liberty   12.847712239374308
was not that nearly what you said   9.247362823810306
how did they act with regard to the maréchale d ancre   11.55169355227799
at length she heard the grating of the hinges of the opening gates   14.987007431416492
what does you mean by boor michon   11.211622912334722
and he had hastened to saint germain to warn the queen of that disappearance   8.75019150591218
he is a glutton   15.690217574677051
that s well said d artagnan   20.82161299481286
poor devil   14.695032448691668
the ghost of former greatness   10.218217172622877
to quote some latin verses i have forgotten or rather never knew well the thunderbolt never falls on the valleys and i am a valley dear rochefort one of the lowliest of the low   12.477144554036952
it is the work of another age constructed by the genii of earth and water   14.09309658845387
ah my lord if i mistake not the chevalier d artagnan is lieutenant of royal guards   13.201252468790628
bonacieux retired   16.817316950378572
rue de la harpe   12.377001751878549
but does he not approach the walls while playing   11.197120644528598
you do not sanction our project   15.706064658371641
well while taking my walk i will call on him and we will talk   16.568632505322
but as you were not guilty of any crime as you were not guilty of any intrigue as you in short knew nothing that could compromise yourself or anybody else i attached no more importance to that event than it merited   9.574062061120692
continued the notary addressing the old man   12.50566767547341
an exclamation of joy was heard and the staircase creaked beneath a feeble step   15.095390994849154
how long a start have they   10.638792154724568
he reached it before the carriage arrived   11.697409165256776
i have not yet seen him   13.267049074988325
we are supposed not to know each other   16.276210373827816
this woman was now his whole thought his whole soul   13.638092007202994
probably said d artagnan but as he is a thoughtful young man he promised to send four expert workmen in his place to help those already at the scaffold and wrote the moment he was brought home to master tom lowe an assistant carpenter and friend of his to go down to whitehall with three of his friends   15.117917034247743
and the travelers continued their route   11.14317663780003
you have then decided to come to england again said lord de winter in spite of the resolutions you so often expressed in paris never to set your feet on british ground   13.854365929317206
but enough of money matters   8.64816691082347
i spoke to benedetto alone and proposed to him to accompany me endeavoring to tempt him by all the promises most likely to dazzle the imagination of a child of twelve   10.53662878040076
there on a table surrounded at some distance by a large and luxurious divan every species of tobacco known from the yellow tobacco of petersburg to the black of sinai and so on along the scale from maryland and porto rico to latakia was exposed in pots of crackled earthenware of which the dutch are so fond   14.8011191807906
it was indeed planchet and grimaud   9.667632326929951
you run no risks with me   16.643777009621417
that poor planchet   7.095412742002164
all this savors of his eminence a league off   9.799042774445722
but not a word or look implied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the person with whom he was then conversing   18.13521623135535
for a long time i had these words whispered in my ears and i chose the latter   10.588360653192067
is life worth the trouble of so many questions   8.560583126476132
i want faithful servants   9.304959770990692
of course it is of no consequence he added with a withering smile   8.982351707650416
nor i said athos   6.118810317652408
yes let us go to the library please   11.83044155451039
monte cristo heard and saw nothing or rather he only saw morrel whose calmness had a frightful effect on those who knew what was passing in his heart   14.845674397995163
cavalcanti to meet your lost andrea   11.036933800265484
i shall either return for them myself or shall send a courier directing you to bring them to me   7.4842909668478805
i cried bitterly and tried to raise my mother from the earth but she was dead   9.11536074492825
think what a solemn engagement you are making   16.726336507027874
one of them hat in hand said to him would you believe it monsieur   15.215633875334992
i come in the name of our master ali tepelini   13.270092960973054
have you sir asked he a letter accrediting you to me   15.58483082487961
i quote a fact that is all   14.256322446760759
this suits me the better said rochefort as i wish to continue my journey   17.10289048416168
but with regard to yours   8.620235296815075
but you mademoiselle de villefort you who are necessary to m   13.116801582959207
everything else might be guessed but not that   12.552934616318051
monsieur porthos said she i can assure you that you have severely punished me   13.171349916335847
these details will guide her on her part and on your return i shall perhaps have some good news to tell you   14.436176763268392
mazarin listened intently   14.126085816473417
while on the extreme verge of the horizon might be seen the fishermen s boats white and graceful as the sea gull or the merchant vessels bound for corsica or spain   12.855394499035745
and the cardinal was at that period what we now call a man of progress   7.319455803918468
would you not trust the cavalcanti   11.946342037409028
then she retired as silently as she had come merely saying to laporte try my dear laporte to make the king more courteous to monsieur le cardinal to whom both he and i are under such important obligations   13.954991897919438
the rest that had been thus afforded to men and horses enabled them to continue their journey at a good round pace   13.032459386207679
then the letter that villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind and every line gleamed forth in fiery letters on the wall like the mene mene tekel upharsin of belshazzar   15.993384379166303
laurels however were not meat and drink and the people had for some time been in a state of discontent   14.074859898867498
charles had heard and understood it all   13.008244978972051
well my lord i sew up the paper in the ball and you in your game of tennis will send the ball into the ditch   10.219228392064297
where you please my dear child   13.378521303671508
the signature was indeed fixed to take place at nine o clock but perhaps valentine will not wait for that   8.135404201858478
no excellency i do not recollect telling you that   15.365816371936303
and now replied d artagnan behold the sad spectacle that awaits us   15.947279790362504
on the importance of the step you are taking   10.735623682248379
if she was accompanied and he could not speak still he should see her and know that she was safe   12.80150992971474
you must depart instantly monsieur   18.902734241570425
i threw the rest away with horror and waited with the dew of fear upon my brow   11.577017597935397
did you not yourself tell me so as we left paris   11.048971871599054
you saw the child pass through the rue richelieu last year who amused himself with killing his brothers and sisters by sticking pins in their ears while they slept   16.520326298409906
you laugh   12.539031960504653
remain parry   9.92538609183421
a most edifying representative i shall make of all the domestic virtues don t you think so   12.51931015385461
ah monsieur de rochefort   8.61590245134848
the concierge who attended him had only been there since 1830   12.271377024921168
oh these are fine words   9.246692978790454
and i replied the visitor changing his idiom know enough of english to keep up the conversation   13.632941434889343
at the court which raoul had never seen   7.638252788778697
madame de villefort instantly stepped back close to the wall and there shaded by the bed curtains she silently and attentively watched the slightest movement of valentine   13.460761181414872
he therefore drew near to the table and took the second glass   10.219266154307356
the marquis will give you some papers which will certify this fact and authorize you to appear under that name in the parisian world   6.333843641372215
he has already proved himself full of resources   19.656217987842936
there was only a change of bridegrooms   13.998435416174383
we took good care not to do that   17.37251122877052
that grimaud shall wait on us at table   9.356620952785173
the keeper would leave me in the background and take all the glory to himself   14.036142483225563
danglars was out but the count was asked to go and see the baroness and he accepted the invitation   10.444851851664975
the young man cast a glance at the first musket and saw with a certain degree of inquietude that it was leveled in his direction   12.10061781999167
in an instant we were on the alert but it was too late   12.691905274277437
let us entice them away   12.271138917209083
how do you do my dear son   7.587190929966665
indeed answered maximilian   15.632919568655392
mazarin leaned out of the window   6.785703270768071
besides his probity was irreproachable in an age in which soldiers compromised so easily with their religion and their consciences lovers with the rigorous delicacy of our era and the poor with god s seventh commandment   13.585926755730728
well he is a man   11.886795986407224
you know such news much better than we do   16.786037366391287
excellencies said he the coach is ready   7.440879979307556
edmond started   15.305413433291703
the count watched him with a feeling of compassion and when he had completely disappeared read as follows the french officer in the service of ali pasha of yanina alluded to three weeks since in l impartial who not only surrendered the castle of yanina but sold his benefactor to the turks styled himself truly at that time fernand as our esteemed contemporary states   12.55023020158447
i understand now why aramis advised me to strangle that horrible mordaunt   10.655298640877563
then addressing the man who accompanied him executioner said he do your duty   13.11843292850437
was his verdict   10.989542417790501
when i presented myself before you for the first time in london it was to ask you what had become of my fortune   12.766798089243654
asked the young man withholding his arm   17.21388480647668
grimaud waited till he heard the bolt grind in the lock and when he was satisfied that he was alone he slowly rose from his recumbent posture   10.053636863950288
it is necessary to inspire confidence in that poor little madame bonacieux   8.24400364351112
the silence of earth and heaven is alone broken by the noise made by the crackling branches of hedges planted around the monuments   14.149941441703364
he is black and can not speak returned monte cristo   14.529342552613201
i do not think so added château renaud with the air of a man who knows the whole of the european nobility perfectly   9.823577942993998
andrea cavalcanti with curled hair moustaches in perfect order and white gloves which fitted admirably had entered the courtyard of the banker s house in rue de la chaussée d antin   13.634697563669206
oh yes they will   15.16536563883849
oh you knew that well enough before speaking to me said andrea becoming more and more excited   9.760436215242208
two of the men from jacopo s boat came on board the yacht to assist in navigating it and he gave orders that she should be steered direct to marseilles   14.509068166877649
but continued d artagnan you shall judge of him for yourself   14.726558996632908
never mind sir we will not forget you   4.675169452196153
planchet said d artagnan cocking his pistols i will take charge of the one at the top   12.243887418485949
she has just left me and she complained of being indisposed but i did not think seriously of it   14.356124334921326
tell vitray to come to me said he and tell him to get ready for a journey   12.477495412960117
there would be a very simple means very natural tell me what   12.76491853360391
no sir i am alone in the world   8.998208940506608
he found that he was in a grotto went towards the opening and through a kind of fanlight saw a blue sea and an azure sky   11.27444111489604
except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1   12.05153805027625
a gentleman laughed in my face   13.64975215162497
for a hundred paces he maintained the speed at which he started   10.821044399512077
then when the sound was quite extinct he breathed like a man awaking from a dream and rushed out of the apartment   8.015060282990959
an opportunity presented itself to him in which there would be at the same time glory to be acquired and money to be gained   11.545529306654949
i have happily only myself in the world to care for   16.848747899858434
the young girl made a gesture of rage   11.949388606808085
whilst he thus hesitated the host re entered the room followed not only by a surgeon but by many other persons whom curiosity had attracted to the spot   15.242021364359779
you can understand dear friend with what hope i was inspired by that last letter   17.520168423518943
exclaimed the young man quite astounded i hope no false report as for myself i first heard you spoken of by my friend wilmore the philanthropist   8.694609858343217
chapter 81   10.202849329238427
milady plainly perceived that it was now her turn to take part in the scene   12.68973873997111
morrel in person   7.835087861589201
in the meantime the host who entertained no doubt that it was the presence of the young man that drove the stranger from his hostelry re ascended to his wife s chamber and found d artagnan just recovering his senses   9.279493981720137
scarron and raoul laughed   11.227192540430025
have you never heard what oliver cromwell said when he came to paris and was shown the dungeon at vincennes where monsieur de vendome was imprisoned   11.968321402513169
no one knows what has become of it but doubtless it has struck on a rock and foundered   12.965487381081562
then by degrees a cold light crept through the venetian blinds until at length it revealed the objects in the room   13.561321376508454
so he was called the queen s invalid with a pension of fifteen hundred francs   18.81940482279549
but these two friends are not yet come at which i am astonished as it is not at all their custom   5.980987224567141
indeed indeed maximilian i am very miserable and if you love me it must be out of pity   9.15071188126062
i should make the first a nobleman like athos   11.177080993761878
tis d artagnan s sword he said   14.587430920674771
he listened attentively and fancied that he discovered through three or four rather frivolous adventures that the count like himself had a secret to hide in the depths of his heart   8.779855980089065
think again do you not recollect me   9.94943701801361
judge if i should not put myself under its protection   12.503263847811063
you only speak thus because you are overheard coolly replied milady   15.159119619032959
presently   9.818234145632484
now you must permit me to take my leave of you   7.179025350271394
first m   12.776532044030755
dantès was then seized with an indescribable desire to know what was going on in the dungeon of his unfortunate friend   7.369396303339197
then ten years of age went in state under pretext of returning thanks for his recovery from the small pox to notre dame   12.594385824381575
eight men remain constantly in his room   11.464758545949332
because you met him at my house just after his introduction into the world as they told me   8.876339211385798
given at constantinople by authority of his highness in the year 1247 of the hegira   12.522091190991398
she is dead   14.632959572001338
this evening especially aramis was melancholy and thoughtful   15.396477459939478
i never saw a man with a nobler air than his   17.2670423787039
but what can i do with you   11.511507831638287
let me assure you madame said lucien that had i really the sum you mention at my disposal i would employ it more profitably than in troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the count of monte cristo whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being twice as rich as a nabob   13.095917604496695
my intimacy with the pasha and his unlimited confidence had gained me an introduction to them and i had seen them above twenty times   8.10100224807782
de villefort felt no effects   12.558962606372178
he had arranged everything for her escape   12.737790978304766
well then read this paper which i have never shown to anyone   19.48191129773876
that s not fair said the seaman who had saved dantès   5.175787057511306
the cardinal sets a spy upon a gentleman has his letters stolen from him by means of a traitor a brigand a rascal has with the help of this spy and thanks to this correspondence chalais s throat cut under the stupid pretext that he wanted to kill the king and marry monsieur to the queen   11.511694575569992
d artagnan tried with his sweetest smile to touch his lips to milady s but she evaded him   12.764397510822105
but in this world a man does not thrive the better for being honest   11.389921797439921
it was an impossibility   10.54171234761076
in the first place it had been made by a man quite drunk to one who was half drunk   12.163697401643063
exclaimed the baroness without expressing the ideas which the exclamation betrayed   10.807705456190595
barrois muttered a few unintelligible words   15.888084005281957
the wounds that i make are better than that witness the executioner of bethune my uncle and king charles   13.231536310574961
a light yacht chaste and elegant in its form was gliding amidst the first dews of night over the immense lake extending from gibraltar to the dardanelles and from tunis to venice   14.139240119501151
in the king s service   9.171714799061466
count will you allow me to send baptistin to inquire after someone you know   11.966991859560226
and how did this misfortune occur   15.285080361677235
for athos had the solemn voice and the powerful gesture of a judge sent by the lord himself   10.267403563985525
and i said m   11.436545889251182
i can see nothing inconvenient in that said the cardinal   18.205847842542706
the woman whom the count had seen leave the ship with so much regret entered this house   16.363135781849152
who and where is he   14.610450243197121
it was day   7.50316390363641
out of the hundred and sixty three members designated there were only seventy three present for the rest fearful of taking part in such an act had remained away   10.979431960578944
well my dear friend   11.846476472140294
in strafford s company said mordaunt tauntingly   11.090304277363433
replied athos uncovering his breast if your honor requires my death   10.815180800864583
while thus speaking athos regarded with attention the sapphire set with diamonds which had taken on d artagnan s finger the place of the queen s ring carefully kept in a casket   17.577262563084414
the carriage stopped the officer descended approached the guardhouse a dozen soldiers came out and formed themselves in order   8.140655811010868
if he proves himself worthy of it i will do what i can to advance his interests   11.775477197680534
the parents of little la valliere have for a long time perceived and been amused at it   11.634436015731765
villefort stood watching breathless until his father had disappeared at the rue bussy   9.886414327756015
here s to porthos and aramis   14.441765998306252
i obey i obey sir   11.141351838306456
let s be merciful to every sinner   13.083820053554323
and his father s immense riches buried in the quarries of saravezza were a constant theme   14.543749616477966
oh count   13.225494676595686
i have two things to postpone   16.97126029015225
will you not embrace me sir   13.307435858281996
acknowledge that if albert is brave he can not be a coward   12.19450132732345
you bought it back then from monsieur des essarts   13.144004986173439
but how will you pass through the barrier without exciting suspicion   11.275246530197025
the old man s interrogative eye said which   10.711184114158499
by your reckoning i must be forty three at least   12.741827887650047
but as he said you would make an excellent steward i concluded you had stolen that was all   10.63132690549179
inquired villefort   15.047193701173166
then dantès departed for genoa   11.910051740486159
treat her as one of your sisters   9.746105611869119
tis true answered porthos rising on his saddle in order that he might appraise the immense crowd there are a lot of them   13.498170253887944
but this vengeance must be grand and striking and worthy in every way of a man who held in his hand as his weapon for combat the forces of a kingdom   13.95256449168213
meantime monsieur who knew that from one day to the other he might expect to be removed from his command by the duc d angoulême by bassompierre or by schomberg who were all eager for his post did but little lost his days in wavering and did not dare to attempt any great enterprise to drive the english from the isle of ré where they still besieged the citadel st   12.005533301997005
i would speak with your companions who are in the glade at rocca bianca   9.384082874533574
and at the end of three days when you would be cured well sir it would still do me a great honor to be your man   15.094020540242848
give these happy tidings to your sister my dear cousin   7.355697412022235
well i am sure it is quite transformed since last week   8.537922555896838
where he comes from i am ignorant   13.158603890227642
each register had its number each file of papers its place   12.741848645515645
you shall have it   13.906368745737286
you will of course dispose of it in some way or other   15.874311166765505
oh my friend cried dantès on the contrary it seems as if i were reading a most interesting narrative   6.497284110149298
he found athos and aramis philosophizing   12.879442445579748
my friendship for him is as strange and unaccountable as his for me   12.67826759877634
for some temperaments work is a remedy for all afflictions   7.898290038301321
i have devoted myself to industry   6.7331765572751054
gentlemen i know i am in the hands of an avenging god   10.116103470382855
do you know what consoled him   14.527373792851964
fernand s paleness appeared to have communicated itself to danglars   10.264218871709634
when the lord commands said mordaunt his commands are not to be disputed   14.77151802124504
was this woman english   8.479196091968554
but here i ll pay you for us two   11.489391261961005
he murmured and slowly returned with one hand wiping his forehead and with the other supporting himself against the wall   11.939995530561287
there was no response   9.002933338127306
offspring of the brain of the poor abbé faria had they not died with him   5.992812442469367
the black musketeers my lord   10.51192055805013
i sincerely pity you said d artagnan with an air of profound compassion   9.392800512343708
the coachman turning around gave friquet a slash with his whip which made him scream with pain   15.500263121854305
by the way said athos take some pains with your toilet raoul   9.349945514874078
for when the gentleman was about to set out we perceived that his lackey was saddling monsieur porthos s horse as well as his master s   6.0564463308130705
cried d artagnan you will be shot   10.590081282891276
come here fellow   11.673209253897605
louvieres sprang forward to snatch his sword which stood against a chair in a corner of the room   14.856878948993382
let your excellencies only leave the matter to me returned signor pastrini in a tone indicative of unbounded self confidence   11.87234497580358
to the right of the drawing room a library and a study   12.493334383440848
the sacrifice is too great and i feel what it must cost you   16.371695080985607
did you send this wine aramis   4.7065900702167625
what do you want m   7.31496403527146
in the proper time and place i will remember everything   15.324693486939896
asked aramis in which case i do not greatly care to go for it will be to pocket a lecture   12.337451420094334
the count knit his brow   7.375788016622922
enough edmond   6.020016596820765
oh i have done well   11.682425288811238
d artagnan with a sigh donned his uniform which he would have exchanged for that of a musketeer at the expense of ten years of his existence   6.9073778482757495
and this bed with red hangings a bed visited by the goddess lucina   10.357566332652993
wounded   13.675725359901946
believe me the eye of the eagle is closed forever   17.70184857374399
he jumped out of bed and ran to the window   13.411921157372346
very well sir find this man and when you have found him bring him to me   14.56719439814047
well yes and i had good reason to be so replied château renaud   11.421672387862529
at the sixth he began to reflect that the search was rather dubious   11.983932395060284
it has been so ordained that he may have none to weep his fate   12.981845392158379
go sir said the king   14.2876325450693
come then said the minister   12.118962570966703
you wish to tell me you have hunted the lion   13.10575478846745
0041m explain yourself   14.468598042488662
oh then let it be directly   16.139466397045133
but the soil was moist   14.325744592845297
he adored her   14.06884921074137
the time had at length arrived   8.84028427895026
allow me only to compliment m   14.304436015912717
whereas you are not known there and the gate would be closed against you   13.791247549649022
porthos maintained a majestic silence   17.572500710903014
the cardinal could not keep up with them though with every wish to do so   12.394628309121831
30151m does mademoiselle danglars object to this marriage with m   13.755763376347428
captivity the second day milady dreamed that she at length had d artagnan in her power that she was present at his execution   11.242700597103356
france needs you   4.217548113873191
and that he was on account of this estate engaged in a lawsuit with the bishop of noyon   10.423400766511175
i have taken from you one carte blanche to give you another   15.930938265636161
i would reform her   16.825428798613324
d artagnan was worn out with fatigue   11.803743225645842
at length she murmured satisfied with herself come nothing is lost   16.166131312514786
i was not aware of it replied albert but i can readily believe it   14.443062819268057
now said mordaunt are you not afraid that they will recognize you   10.620119884627357
a cloud settled on his brow evincing decided anxiety and uneasiness instead of the expression of offended pride which had lately reigned there   11.092797967344417
because though i am not a baron by birth my real name is at least danglars   14.900643098371875
you are right duchess   10.517109530221774
ali will drive   11.839269096338244
a poor musketeer a beggar an unknown who hates slavery and finds himself ill placed in the world   10.80935031265287
oh that s of no consequence just now said mme   13.29819644977421
my god i am lost   13.666748049137935
i will proclaim the violence you have used toward me   8.576097010125018
i love everyone as god commands us to love our neighbor as christians   11.859903919668476
guémené was reading aloud and everybody was listening to her with attention with the exception of the queen who had on the contrary desired this reading in order that she might be able while feigning to listen to pursue the thread of her own thoughts   7.992109535935864
do you doubt my word   13.735901303281166
but what are you going to fight about athos   12.908694510156693
he must live   11.37994256861174
oh lackadaisy   16.30360229879116
the two men were left alone   9.468170738256301
he has faith in himself   12.104369478503566
albert had fastened the faded bunch of violets to his button hole   11.802969909282663
let us call i love him   12.644289774840539
sir said albert at first with a tremulous voice but which gradually became firmer i reproached you with exposing the conduct of m   9.143229191935955
i stumbled by chance upon the memoirs of m   12.593799853991637
cried mercédès   10.4795672136075
he felt his heart beat and taking his mother s hand within his own he said tenderly yes you will live   9.150639676844357
the prison register the day after that in which the scene we have just described had taken place on the road between bellegarde and beaucaire a man of about thirty or two and thirty dressed in a bright blue frock coat nankeen trousers and a white waistcoat having the appearance and accent of an englishman presented himself before the mayor of marseilles   10.595278721165302
poor aramis   15.445021304795178
finally that the queen wants a brave intelligent devoted man to make a journey to london for her   11.751955880825019
buckingham took the casket and fell a second time on his knees   12.267601758809468
but the friends of aramis were not at all convinced by his denial and one of them addressed the young musketeer with affected seriousness   15.524513978484425
half the camp was at the barrier   17.16567739327203
de monte cristo is relating horrible stories to us doubtless intending to frighten us to death   18.264323194971603
and he wondered how it was that there should be in the world people who succeed in every wish some in ambition others in love whilst others either from chance or from ill luck or from some natural defect or impediment remain half way upon the road toward fulfilment of their hopes and expectations   14.778916223863357
so that now it is no longer hatred but vengeance   8.675950934208908
mercédès read with terror the following lines the king s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion that one edmond dantès second in command on board the pharaon this day arrived from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo is the bearer of a letter from murat to the usurper and of another letter from the usurper to the bonapartist club in paris   12.529114431256199
has got off without any accident   13.637397111300388
thank you my good friend   13.43434091276226
this joke elicited a fresh burst of applause   12.417399863828134
but to return to these registers   11.870358745593233
i call to witness the god who hears us that on the contrary i am a fervent catholic   9.509344829714195
my father as i told you   12.96488968150959
in the first carriage with m   16.870719378891295
your excellency knows that wine is beyond all price near rome   12.72978640403376
and if you will wait only a few minutes for me as soon as i have concluded my business with that friend as it is growing late i will come back and reconduct you to the louvre   13.876485291983782
you have nothing to occupy yourself with but being happy   8.784175338741827
well but can t you speak   10.582657970090793
she goes into england said athos   15.06135570183108
said porthos holding out his plate to aramis who was cutting up a fowl   12.158574835750683
and spurring on he plunged into the labyrinth of streets which led to his hotel situated near the marais for having for so long a time lived near the place royale lord de winter naturally returned to lodge near his ancient dwelling   21.216962241010904
and as it is impossible it can be the minister of police as he has the guardianship of the safety and honor of your majesty it is probable that i am in error   12.011081898512268
have the french attendants been summoned to await her coming   9.101652598610203
her will be done like that of god in all things   7.4812592983388955
well these twelve thousand livres are his civil list and are as essential to him as the twelve millions of a king   10.797637395774558
while the three gentlemen walked along the piazza di spagna and the via frattina which led directly between the fiano and rospoli palaces franz s attention was directed towards the windows of that last palace for he had not forgotten the signal agreed upon between the man in the mantle and the transtevere peasant   14.566357103508599
i feel cramps over my whole body   10.763126710158401
the second he wounded me in the breast   6.345476487718353
there is but one way left you that is safe said she   13.807621995155777
it is the password   8.43245723105987
i do not know whether i love you or love you not   14.372682475624757
said a loud voice   9.257874231789954
keep your innocent stories to tell to the judge at nîmes   7.553875084016968
and if in the time to come you should find yourself in a similar situation you have but to apply to me   16.176458401265457
tell them to stop at rue de la fontaine no   12.316069032999206
what says monsieur the abbé   14.43034614173866
ah then you wish to ask advice of me   13.058598968825471
d avrigny said villefort be so kind i beseech you as to accompany this gentleman   13.015113544064258
the patron turned towards his vessel which was rolling on the swell in the little harbor and with sails partly set would be ready for sea when her toilet should be completed   13.502780024187746
oh no no count cried maximilian seizing the count s hands pray laugh   11.762907654958418
i feel some need of it   11.840576542353771
no you have not   11.049065481181879
what have you done with her then if you have her no longer   12.22490743074558
have you then madame no compassion for your servants who for twenty years have vegetated in obscurity without betraying in a single sigh the solemn and sacred secrets they have had the honor to share with you   10.865546060411654
said the duchess pensively   15.786343109196821
a pretty silence truly   12.42076085507276
give me some water and ether   14.027587872067905
cavalcanti dressed in black like one of goethe s heroes with varnished shoes and white silk open worked stockings passed a white and tolerably nice looking hand through his light hair and so displayed a sparkling diamond that in spite of monte cristo s advice the vain young man had been unable to resist putting on his little finger   9.559839242304628
of what use would it be   12.262187302950657
to the scaffold with the poisoner to the scaffold   13.10984350087843
by my faith it is very fortunate that the letter was not in it   23.96732980534253
and the secret of that very pallor is what we want to find out   14.299385778310711
when he had pointed out to her in exchange for the precarious and contested royalty of paris the viceroyalty of font de l arche in other words of all normandy   13.131142133686732
asked milady sharply   10.178985624240475
the table had disappeared only i had still the knife in my hand   9.61204509432716
i did not venture to ask sir   12.416801538905663
if that s the case said mousqueton with a learned air take some nourishment   11.723559708534356
all that he was allowed to say in case of emergencies was the proverbial der teufel   11.251749090744513
until this day and for how long a time   12.733089612787154
the thunder growled in the air like the passion and anger in her thoughts   11.73484247033999
at this moment they heard the rolling of the carriage which at the approach of the musketeers set off at a gallop   13.592064390656871
porthos and aramis looked at each other   11.567694358780233
asked athos quickly   10.732641910642883
added d artagnan timidly   9.09297635402923
she has ordered relays of horses   10.956182871021827
the surprised groom retired   12.172252511587367
your guest is charming but you leave the best company to go into the worst sometimes   14.37719262442761
allow me to compliment you on your knowledge   7.8224483520715875
i am for those who save the state said bonacieux emphatically   11.072562739550733
so young it is impossible said mercédès replying at the same time to what albert said as well as to her own private reflection   10.579398592706639
but whether he did not understand him or whether he had received no orders respecting the nourishment of danglars the giant without answering went on with his dinner   14.176322773820232
he fell back cursing with rage   15.196765183559009
19 god has condemned them and they must submit to their punishment   16.178805031888
this done instead of leaving the door fastened he drew back the bolts and even placed the door ajar as though he had left the room forgetting to close it and slipping into the chimney like a man accustomed to that kind of gymnastic exercise after replacing the chimney board which represented achilles with deidamia and effacing the very marks of his feet upon the ashes he commenced climbing the hollow tunnel which afforded him the only means of escape left   13.543151462755805
she there found rochefort s lackey and gave him his instructions   13.172760710560112
d artagnan put the gold in his hat and in going back to the chateau settled the reckoning with porthos each of them had cleared two hundred and fifteen louis   14.322979149273216
i declare i feel quite ill after only being five minutes in the courtyard   12.654880203596193
i mean that at this hour the headsman has been got out of the way by force or persuasion   8.862322949673652
we are betrayed said the king in a low voice   15.488308100498518
so i yesterday addressed another epistle to her still more pressing than the first   16.421549826350994
do you hear that delightful cavatina   10.8215662752317
the guardsmen imagining this to be caused by some unexpected attack either of the besieged or the english sprang to their swords   6.945901060894945
anybody may see by our bearing that we are people of condition   14.740844679090658
so we shall get from him one uniform and a sword   15.609132670519513
among these two hundred levees that of tréville was one of the most sought   10.742640931125338
let us adjure him in the name of the god before whom he must perhaps appear to speak the truth   14.340884850486312
mazarin did not even turn around   15.673030606382273
cried olivain in his turn   11.708101079674265
well monsieur said planchet who had observed his master grow red and pale successively did i not guess truly   15.79627516854285
ali bowed in token of strict obedience   9.137640758043327
oh doctor cried barrois the fit is coming on again   13.435062781611398
i have told you my wish or rather my determination   15.44535581725545
you look like four conspirators   15.42681053998296
but we are now about to mix in society to visit and be visited   17.65973779035376
a sort of smile played on his lips   8.969320912555649
and turning towards the young man said well catalan can t you make up your mind   15.075793275900491
like his mates he is ready to obey our orders knowing nothing of our plan   14.85414999254666
yet speaking of reports baron what have you learned with regard to the affair in the rue saint jacques   9.701621902983444
then drawing her veil over her face she bowed majestically to the councillors and left with that dignified step which virgil attributes to his goddesses   16.139956011558578
he was engaged in an adventure so singular that he wished for counsel   17.075918529205723
but i hate hypocrites and among that number i place musketeers who are abbés and abbés who are musketeers   8.443054396012453
how are you to get away from here   10.920009294839902
i remember well that diamond which belonged to the queen   14.490298701028122
asked caderousse fixing his dying eyes on the count   7.1477416768696225
well said aramis what do you say to that   9.340972453111736
now i think of it you can do better said danglars   16.144240214316227
you see that with a little forethought one can lead a merry life anywhere and everywhere said d artagnan   14.369837100257708
for he added with a sigh we two are equal perhaps to eight others   9.223307199565152
and do you not think me handsomer so   11.012402476613609
then i launched out into the path that was opened to me   14.750322774561953
the young couple gazed with astonishment at the sight of their visitor s emotion and wondered to see the large tears silently chasing each other down his otherwise stern and immovable features   9.534575748381314
asked he smiling   15.759995639168121
no i did not know it   9.273281559077976
athos colored a little and answered should i go i shall be delighted to see you there   15.57904404308656
she is my sister in law   11.813605925589732
the explosion which had been so long restrained from a feeling of respect to the court of justice now burst forth like thunder from the breasts of all present   10.953307092464124
ah there you are my good d arminges   12.612770644747185
see if he is still in the same place   16.821632285746162
toward six o clock m   13.676463909688207
in addition to this he perceived that the top of a wardrobe and the marble of a commode were covered with empty bottles   6.580486030406885
those two men were the count de rochefort and the mendicant of saint eustache   12.09745273097655
what are you thinking of d artagnan   13.575613382753575
at this moment the door of the minister s box opened and madame danglars accompanied by her daughter entered escorted by lucien debray who assiduously conducted them to their seats   14.160419551193097
this wound my dear d artagnan has been a warning to me from heaven   11.000390899730153
chapter lxxi   9.698910310293694
said athos in a loud voice and i confess i think it incomparable   9.805099376193184
next to the merit of infallibility which you appear to possess i rank that of candidly acknowledging a fault   15.434795651717465
he has the right to notice nothing   6.104596818261879
the address to monsieur the baron danglars banker rue de la chaussée d antin   18.95440073310971
no no you do yourselves injustice   7.958808088854257
a pleasant manner upon my soul of arriving at your end when that end is vengeance   12.96870665438193
and yet said porthos neither of them had any advantage over us   15.06881725964669
and she began the same religious chant which had so strongly excited felton the evening before   9.329176797892163
it often happens continued she that a first fault destroys the prospects of a whole life   13.757256054031796
almost   8.218661955883729
and you d artagnan   9.985348820268618
but to make good ones increases fame witness monsieur de rotrou   11.396964000154691
you may speak of her country and of her youthful reminiscences or if you like it better you can talk of rome naples or florence   9.51690714505016
ah yes said the factitious abbé who began to understand   10.687863030430888
for they had scarcely sailed half a league when d artagnan saw a flash and heard a detonation   13.91531504945506
did you ever hear he replied of the old man of the mountain who attempted to assassinate philippe auguste   12.295624532480419
d artagnan ran after her   16.472653610675927
i tell you what m   11.622722464981523
you have once before thrown yourself in my path   15.960060919481274
i turned around i looked at the trees i tried to recall the details which had struck me at the time   14.946634050502611
yes your eminence said athos while the two musketeers who had remained behind advanced hat in hand   20.019884391094322
this time i will know the assassin and will pursue him   13.293938267973964
at the moment of his arrival a small yacht was under trial in the bay   8.834718241925744
it was forty eight hours since i had taken any nourishment   10.004834570290113
well in the champs élysées there resides a very rich gentleman   16.513479814476984
oh no said kitty it is not me you love   13.979270175494502
no his name is the count of monte cristo   12.951801197490095
well you shall have your five hundred francs said andrea   14.232601653784748
take these said beauchamp presenting the papers to albert   13.463149423852638
he has even a name taken from the book since he calls himself sinbad the sailor and has a cave filled with gold   18.67054047054823
full of hope edmond swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water and thanks to the vigor of his constitution found himself well nigh recovered   21.30792745357582
of roman crowns in the most distant a   9.704673697225928
madame believe me the king ought to defend himself to the last   12.054075283915314
and fifty empty ones   15.08018371645048
how many magnificent projects of vengeance she conceives by the light of the flashes which her tempestuous passion casts over her mind against mme   13.27285539387214
fortunately however he had not been taken   9.01380418674508
did you not say she was dead   19.64454481742696
your monsieur bonacieux is very tiresome   13.619826341193104
and what misfortune could happen to me   16.07912691507932
does it happen to be jacopo manfredi   10.495897343823703
at the bottom of his heart he had often had a feeling of pity for this unhappy young man who suffered so   13.281400462251067
i shall be fined   11.24679996527546
remember the execution is fixed for the day after tomorrow and that you have but one day to work in   14.223167666882574
but in our situation we must not say all we know particularly as we have been warned that our ears should answer for our tongues   13.344940087663764
we must inform the queen   10.549008409329758
if guilty why it is no use involving ourselves in a conspiracy   7.381662749471123
he had doubtless seen all   13.32015258071572
they are yours   10.874303367227393
yes monsieur in this house   10.999447840570317
on the contrary it is of her   11.22308365694639
but really on referring for the moment to what he said do you truly believe that mithridates used these precautions and that these precautions were efficacious   13.732468120929353
we shall go together shall we not   11.483961018526507
and i said athos taking some small change from his pocket i you   13.104194171485565
replied the englishman   11.937781229276037
d artagnan however stupefied cast down annihilated by all that happened stood with crossed arms before the musketeer and mme   12.334126591081628
sir said the young man do you not come from paris if you please   10.347317438783696
the young men impatient to learn the cause of the firing spurred on toward the servants   4.2515139776623645
explain yourself i beg   5.259092219387284
valentine therefore reached her hand towards the glass but as soon as her trembling arm left the bed the apparition advanced more quickly towards her and approached the young girl so closely that she fancied she heard his breath and felt the pressure of his hand   7.283984144253263
on the contrary said athos smiling he has never been so much a musketeer as since he became an abbé and you will find him a veritable soldier   9.427536179421677
by a lucky chance the pen was tolerably good and raoul began to write   12.509159026458217
so be it said d artagnan   6.359276920574897
hair sandy red more red than sandy   17.404497163945425
and did you mention these suspicions to any person beside myself   16.04040938383438
take care you are going to immure a traveller sinbad the sailor a man who comes to see paris   9.728106608826646
lucien said madame danglars through the door you are always complaining that eugénie will not address a word to you   15.096237473049431
nevertheless even in my present state of perturbation i protest that i feel happy   5.554719111460853
scarcely had he shut her door when mercédès called a confidential servant and ordered him to follow albert wherever he should go that evening and to come and tell her immediately what he observed   16.282639346094314
he had left the key in it taking the simple precaution of turning it twice in the lock   7.216711955161653
take courage said grimaud   9.452485842583386
asked the fruiteress   9.07348379200604
the other night she left   13.62264456218602
the reflections of the mercer were already made   12.537914057538114
because a mistress is one of the cardinal s favorite means   11.935840366597844
i say that when a thing completely surpasses my comprehension i am accustomed not to dwell on that thing but to pass to another   15.901425826707527
courage we have them   13.491718686026239
said the baron suspiciously   16.05512683412207
give it to me later   15.055899945134998
do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him   6.477104338191413
de winter shook him by the hand   15.942223140939962
it is   7.34111106093148
dantès for fear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his memory like a distant light wandering in the night   14.850940200746527
but by an inconceivable error the veterinary surgeon who had been sent for as it appeared to bleed one of the host s horses had bled mousqueton s   17.94922515263763
we say almost for the idea that a young handsome kind and witty woman is at the same time rich takes nothing from the beginning of love but on the contrary strengthens it   10.904672929386992
for a scene half tragedy and half comedy had been performed by him with mousqueton and blaisois who frightened by the noise of the sea by the whistling of the wind by the sight of that dark water yawning like a gulf beneath them shrank back instead of going forward   9.826524826659423
not so for it is religious replied aramis   10.955324651144778
well we won t speak of it any more then   11.90594996629423
no count replied monte cristo taking the hand held out to him by the general   9.83285010658475
on the contrary sire set the example   10.960957187368981
what with d artagnan grimaud and mousqueton we can manage to dispatch eight of them   10.527878154096616
no it is bazin   10.794973400677776
yes that is he   11.438542780919478
condemned by parliament   9.237088391718741
and every time that it touched me i trembled from head to foot   13.227428102618397
danglars left   5.785275546314011
why did she not ask from any one of us a home instead of from mazarin   12.245849110136398
it was for this she summoned you this morning and that she told you to return at five o clock   9.181356754555347
you have told me the truth my gentlemen said he addressing the musketeers and it will not be my fault if our encounter this evening be not advantageous to you   13.219820419026417
chapter lxvi   17.88177791082233
he dreaded the enervating effect of all that he saw   13.41774388025189
who knows whether or not these industrious worthies do not pay to their feudal lord some dues for his protection   14.209807063206737
no doubt said milady coolly such a woman may be found   16.457028358779866
but are you no longer aware continued anne giving that sweet expression to her voice which she could do at will that in former days the queen had once need of a young brave and devoted cavalier that she found this cavalier and that although he might have thought that she had forgotten him she had kept a place for him in the depths of her heart   7.990775709973958
i should like to know what you would say if i were to relate to you a real tale of love   11.323146795601875
it was called the palais cardinal before richelieu gave it to the king   14.165321512593081
yes but they have found a corpse   16.140854954075525
what they should write to the clever person at tours   11.947322888751525
porthos was the first who came to himself   11.751695442916255
a truce to compliments said aramis   14.344343094275388
the queen had passed the night in lonely conference with the prince who had entered the oratory at midnight and did not leave till five o clock in the morning   8.171795322460063
now said valentine you can neither go out by the front door nor by the garden   15.222511177904742
she was an ardent passionate mistress abandoning herself to love which she also seemed to feel   8.789056019590678
on the contrary the lackeys knew milady perfectly   7.4220409646881755
the carriage drove on and d artagnan availing himself of the darkness in the archway under which they were passing threw himself into the arms of the prisoner   10.713412556379241
one may see that you love your family madame coquenard said the procurator with a smile that was almost tragic   13.410996100930653
you can say you were needlessly alarmed   8.066387752621022
a left handed man is very troublesome to people who are not prepared for it   9.062666068523905
that would be a misfortune said de winter and i shall begin to think that we are really doomed   7.186436454151446
it is now three years madame since i saw you for the first time and during those three years i have loved you thus   12.079387253554867
oh she is perfectly lovely what a complexion   7.519387294478892
to paris first   17.658439166937768
it was ali my nubian slave who rendered this service to madame de villefort   6.965654265488306
is it as hopeless as he thinks   15.206829808839672
listen returned d artagnan when our embassy is finished well   9.18084149637333
he was a brave and an honest man   14.916593036788012
but it will be dark in the cellar   12.60483215506834
murmured the queen they shall pay dearly for their boldness and it is i who promise this   8.696550880203048
but what has become of the poor wretches whom these scoundrels were murdering   10.291092592085468
athos went toward the house while the mendicant who had received his reward left as fast as his legs could carry him   8.942147353729052
and without turning aside so clear was the road left for him he passed from the baroness to eugénie whom he complimented in such rapid and measured terms that the proud artist was quite struck   8.37677315759078
he continued his walk but he had scarcely gone a hundred paces when a furious fellow leaning between two soldiers spat in the king s face as once an infamous and accursed jew spit in the face of jesus of nazareth   16.20014315764697
so that you see there is a deadly feud between us   7.810107377558086

the fair indian approached scarron   15.571635076692296
one of its chiefs who understood provençal begged the commune of marseilles to give them this bare and barren promontory where like the sailors of old they had run their boats ashore   15.061321757669326
the queen became thoughtful and smiled like a woman to whom duplicity is no stranger   5.937767677705336
the names of all including carlini were placed in a hat and the youngest of the band drew forth a ticket   12.87588930835485
luigi was not mistaken   6.663453034782673
help help he murmured   9.898344421287536
you are wounded   15.315334389936162

oh not the least in the world madame   11.017322935400882
and though franz had been unable to distinguish his features from his being either wrapped in his mantle or obscured by the shadow the tones of his voice had made too powerful an impression on him the first time he had heard them for him ever again to forget them hear them when or where he might   11.129976246128383
the duke followed him with his eyes with involuntary terror   6.400065456620446
from fifty to sixty musketeers who appeared to replace one another in order always to present an imposing number paraded constantly armed to the teeth and ready for anything   16.373590454684575
so you are here   11.350312099577039
what is your opinion gentlemen and does not m   8.21261523795966
it is so hot at marseilles that really i believe that the respectable inhabitants will in time go without any clothing whatever   12.443087667787713
buckingham threw himself at her feet and before the queen could prevent him kissed the hem of her robe   10.747931728341083
her happiness cost her very dear   12.353217506405974
she has been dead these ten years   11.740650348277264
de tréville scolded his musketeers in public and congratulated them in private   10.943225954249288

you laugh aramis   12.800349519252451

oh all this is a family history as château renaud told you the other day observed maximilian   17.648225916446187
cried kitty springing forward to meet her mistress   14.173097675994104
a recollection of athos came into her mind   8.48227886342349
oh yes replied andrea laughing   17.340699880011663
yes said valentine   14.602472519907858
while on the contrary teresa shuddering in every limb dared not approach the slain ruffian but by degrees and threw a hesitating glance at the dead body over the shoulder of her lover   14.571777315985813
because he had no cash to save   12.3597840988041
ay there s no fear in the daytime   6.966963553564553

de winter dismounted at his hotel and went up into his apartment intending to watch the spy   13.286242752268985
prudence monsieur is a virtue sufficiently useless to musketeers i know but indispensable to churchmen   10.016113846603115
bless me murmured baron danglars this must surely be a prince instead of a count by their styling him excellency and only venturing to address him by the medium of his valet de chambre   7.406114136221108
if it be so we trust your eminence will deign to explain yourself and we should then at least be acquainted with our real position   12.76900032975591
i promise you by all that is most sacred to me in the world namely by my mother   6.775291583914393
five days after your departure he came back and in a very bad condition too   15.469493947514252
as we no longer wear the sword of the gentleman we may as well have the head of the puritan   7.264245191119326
but the count did not answer   9.010587864211777
no on the contrary i am not inclined to laugh said athos suppressing a sigh   8.266372697223009
and you think this cousin pays her attentions   10.670352549972455
i know them because the men of whom i speak were at that time my enemies   13.94748724070156
an island situated on the other side of the equator at least two thousand leagues from here replied the count   10.294628683808904
at the end of an hour the stone was extricated from the wall leaving a cavity a foot and a half in diameter   9.069080734766809
and will you go   9.18318603032881
the door was scarcely closed upon him when the queen sank half fainting into the arms of her women   15.897737933671534
being a few paces in advance she whispered to the lackeys a thousand pistoles to each of you if you will assist my escape   14.359073774173254
not at all not at all said mazarin   10.112091070997957
well we will wait a week a month two months if need be and meanwhile your strength will return   5.715018605445604
she lives   8.700352678516765
what fine things we would do together   12.263851027132747
the baroness took advantage of her husband s absence to push open the door of her daughter s study and m   13.860177693627653
this was the name which he gave him in former days in their moments of tender intimacy   10.940213812207816
living you will not lose your life through me   11.946762626846498
he sprang into his saddle   16.28647312300697
well well cried d artagnan this reconciliation is truly touching   15.61987399844374
you are not afraid of ghosts with me i hope   12.48743803166029
the snow deadened the noise of his fall   12.468403565496207
compose yourself madame said he   15.535295899246611
when the count entered the room the young man was carelessly stretched on a sofa tapping his boot with the gold headed cane which he held in his hand   10.107387679800674
caderousse became thoughtful   6.869876000816368
oh lord   10.196446754643969
when at three paces distant from each other albert and the count stopped   11.887100222906327
prepare yourself maximilian he said with a smile   13.81882908499669
the young girl was very pensive but seeing luigi so cheerful she on her part assumed a smiling air which was natural to her when she was not excited or in a passion   15.499460645121333
40202m the blush of mingled pride and modesty which suddenly suffused the cheeks of the young woman the brilliancy of her eye and her highly important communication produced an indescribable effect on the assembly   15.60004105386805
that is but fair replied monte cristo   10.879967745824263
if you loved me oh if you loved me that would be too great happiness and i should run mad   12.628382003062683
do you know she is going to embrace a religious life   14.22842530822586
he was introduced   14.343192275167834
i ought to have consulted you on the point and have had some dishes prepared expressly   13.902883294769477
not a word was spoken everyone seemed occupied franz with his disembarkment the sailors with their sails the smugglers with their goat   8.385640563994794
they could not long delay bringing her a repast   15.048115602757914
besides we shall be there at the time of the flight   17.897928687740816
now while admiring as others doubtless will admire the details we have to relate our main preoccupation concerned a matter to which no one before ourselves had given a thought   12.034622581747447
then the figure from whom she could not detach her eyes and who appeared more protecting than menacing took the glass and walking towards the night light held it up as if to test its transparency   14.987048088735655
you wear the uniform of the new french conquerors monsieur said he   19.48931085193165
to hold for five minutes the gates they will be torn down twisted into iron wire ground to powder   10.696812260514221
the house with all its crumbling antiquity and apparent misery was yet cheerful and picturesque and was the same that old dantès formerly inhabited the only difference being that the old man occupied merely the garret while the whole house was now placed at the command of mercédès by the count   15.342955093935055
it appears said the baron seating himself in the armchair opposite that occupied by milady and stretching out his legs carelessly upon the hearth it appears we have made a little apostasy   16.462634660940182
then turning to the singular personage who had caused this scene he said your pardon your excellency but i was so far from expecting the honor of a visit that i did not really recognize you   16.185137915432
now then what do you say to that   17.48992503334231
wait said bazin striking a flint and setting afire a twisted wax light with which he started the church candles   10.589334308493392
the curtain at length fell on the performances to the infinite satisfaction of the viscount of morcerf who seized his hat rapidly passed his fingers through his hair arranged his cravat and wristbands and signified to franz that he was waiting for him to lead the way   9.57070254942159
you don t mention those who aided and abetted the deed said caderousse   14.82277450810133
a short time ago while making researches in the royal library for my history of louis xiv   8.785285066970452
but on the contrary sad as death   13.737372215000349
although i might easily have accepted it for it was i who put into his hands the first silver he ever earned   6.314652571197527
ten young descendants of marius and the gracchi barefooted and out at elbows with one hand resting on the hip and the other gracefully curved above the head stared at the traveller the post chaise and the horses   11.489232369585771
at six o clock the curate of st   13.590684705843618
suddenly a squadron of cavalry galloped up to encounter the royal troops who were entering pele mele the intrenchments with the fugitives   9.568607636176395
while he was endeavoring to calm his fears and instead of dwelling upon the political future that had so often been the subject of his ambitious dreams was imagining a future limited to the enjoyments of home in fear of awakening the enemy that had so long slept the noise of a carriage sounded in the yard then he heard the steps of an aged person ascending the stairs followed by tears and lamentations such as servants always give vent to when they wish to appear interested in their master s grief   10.476708659369589
why replied athos carelessly she is probably going to write to the cardinal that a damned musketeer named athos has taken her safe conduct from her by force   9.850410138819004
but she has most likely returned to the louvre   13.764332213895546
at the end of a year dantès was a new man   8.438002212244319
and the ill treated people have drawn up the following which i have the honor to present to your majesty   13.043367253286714
ho there boy   8.156517526911877
i demand the suppression of the thesis   4.983015375938794
and with a king as full of foresight as your majesty scarcity is not a thing to be feared   8.91135433561095
not one of us has failed the others at this rendezvous   12.75648882587402
he called for me at seven o clock and before anyone had arrived asked one of the door keepers to place me in a box   12.120865852414312
write to me at paris to m   11.587319001513848
good caderousse he said how happy you will be   12.058078365543084
the best swordsman in the kingdom my lord said d artagnan   16.961748966689132
morrel now emerged from his hiding place where he had remained quite unperceived so great had been the general confusion   10.157119279708601
a deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of caderousse who turned away and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head   13.231515586640766
shall i complain of him   14.236456302683631
ah for the sake of our child let me live   16.54276819775924
one seized me by the hair that is why i now wear it so short for no one knows what may happen the other swung a yataghan and i already felt the cold steel on my neck when this gentleman whom you see here charged them shot the one who held me by the hair and cleft the skull of the other with his sabre   9.407709478218734
ah sire   13.00110585898022
monte cristo cast a rapid glance around him   9.364673084927745
excuse my talking of family matters but as i shall have the honor of introducing you to the count i tell you this to prevent you making any allusions to this picture   10.1435824817855
the bell here rang for the third time with another shriek of anguish   12.48442373119296
i am hardly nineteen   9.511238430785763
you will allow me to leave first   17.82207769319072
no ceremony will be neglected in my house   10.25682631111842
then with the intention quite patent of not drawing back a foot from the accomplishment of the commission with which he was charged and as the attendant of an executioner might have done in the chamber of torture he approached anne of austria from whose eyes at the same instant sprang tears of rage   10.923033811807032
i do and i will tell you why   19.885216155151696
but having sinned myself it may be more deeply than others i never rest till i have torn the disguises from my fellow creatures and found out their weaknesses   14.396997036786217
you were constantly employed in the task you set yourself and when weary with toil you had your hopes to refresh and encourage you   10.721615252546913
the wind blew strongly the boat made six or seven knots an hour and they were rapidly reaching the end of their voyage   13.47776234928147
i have but ten days and this evening two of them will be gone   14.133287881903282
now i think no more   16.030904307682018
drink a glass of pure water it will restore you   17.60319072396483
you will tell monsieur de tréville that monsieur aramis is very much obliged to him   16.146468298106257
bear with him whispered aramis   15.436983814450368
a table ready set out awaited them   13.945242343784958
i your excellency   12.18892857728261
they are the spoils of victory   11.83842893178976
at that voice that mocking tone and that familiar gesture accenting voice and tone athos made a bound of surprise   11.703385494519365
the idea came over my mind and as mademoiselle entered the sight of her was an additional ray of light thrown on a confused remembrance   12.39198922146266
the damps of the dew bathed the head of villefort and refreshed his memory   17.031404273766782
for everybody must be aware that a cadet from gascony does not find such stones in his mother s jewel case   10.740780043015546
and as they were really gentlemen they pronounced the host in the wrong   12.080282706582665
morrel was there   10.444128186604738
montrose beaten at philiphaugh was obliged to disperse the remains of his army and to fly disguised as a servant   9.192078636884942
the queen as he went on looked at him with increasing astonishment   10.57177343133997
our future our ambition   12.016034214019697
said she thou knowest in what holy cause i suffer   9.116748912247937
oh continued milady do your wounds still make you suffer   9.34589765807539
and will he aid this project   9.978745382649112
send me the keeper of the seals séguier   6.6276116855652205
yes replied monte cristo these blazons prove that   16.43250477792069
i will obey you at all points   13.012018068555637
and in short since the young people of the present day will not fight it remains for us to do so   11.787514372871758
but the wine was good and he was convinced   14.686539649929161
why he would be annoyed if i did not play with him   10.25492431303992
madame replied monte cristo you must not ask of us the manufacturers of fine porcelain such a question   10.41606161729463
no replied the turnkey   14.039295948683584
you speak like the apocalypse and you are as true as the gospel   12.214134243373591
my friend you impose a painful task on me   10.796793043029133
and by making a long detour avoided the wood and reentered the city by another gate   12.456597899791866
there is in london i hope some establishment like that of the magdalens or of the repentant daughters   16.104880337898496
what matter   15.472167281272469
the night lamp threw out countless rays each resolving itself into some strange form to her disordered imagination when suddenly by its flickering light valentine thought she saw the door of her library which was in the recess by the chimney piece open slowly though she in vain listened for the sound of the hinges on which it turned   11.67294465639512
before that is expired some idea will occur to me   12.477702422623517
have you not thought so   16.56420836705118
sir said mazarin to porthos what would you do if the crowd fell upon us   15.428380442611328
no bartolomeo his father   9.637033969380214
but still no prisoner fell down as they expected   9.750735130236354
said he to the baron   7.755587947830884
as for me i can never forget the pale complexion and black eyes of the young soldier and whenever the angel of death summons me to another world i am quite sure i shall recognize selim   7.750455463065876
you and i alone know of its existence   14.370644544582461
he approached the block and laid his axe upon it   14.514732967272385
but observed the honest notary the count is i think mistaken   17.53516837757511
no but look replied the hostess pointing to the wounded man   15.356988567314293
how he had found grace in the eyes of the minister he did not know   17.87642151683443
albert she said in a voice which was altered by emotion i have always put you on your guard against new acquaintances   14.235698311303688
then the noble and severe countenance of athos crossed his mind   17.281627692465
some grand personage a prince i believe they said the count of monte cristo   11.7914079812284
coachman gallop on   8.295028915098523
valentine as her only apology for not having met him pointed to the corpse under the sheet and began to sob again   16.818888412000426
a hypocrite does not shed the tears of a man of good faith   9.942495342060221
the fifth of october it was about six o clock in the evening   15.566833903565477
she is what the english call a yacht   6.88897731832735
he would have pardoned me he would certainly have pardoned me if i had not said anything to him about that cursed baldric in ambiguous words it is true but rather drolly ambiguous   12.58100104197251
the horse   14.293425598797043
porthos followed him by the same road but with more difficulty and less diligence   11.782815831269053
and the name of athos as well concealed the comte de la fère as the name milady clarik concealed anne de breuil   17.24393233834291
he looked at aramis and made a special sign to him with his head   13.050072175717858
i am aware he is a furious royalist   11.982621143294987
but at pont neuf he found louvieres and his bourgeois   10.535107457537704
as to love the only woman he could have loved was mme   7.9071324833277
i have filled those papers and have made out the accusation against the assassin benedetto   12.441887458503052
said a hollow voice   9.259023567001435
only might not these betraying marks have attracted other eyes than those for whom they were made   10.903522903336276
said he is the hotel on fire   10.432508479392393
what did you answer him   12.051229779702876
the prison register chapter 29   11.279530276169067
they looked hesitatingly around them and appeared to doubt the thickness of the partition between them and the office of m   16.079854623364866
there is no room for him he will rejoin your eminence   11.162143950074272
morrel had long thought of danglars but had kept away from some instinctive motive and had delayed as long as possible availing himself of this last resource   12.812340656028049
very fine anne   13.57140527983837
a man wishes to see monsieur at home replied bazin   7.981842918655844
well sir i was educated at rome by a poor devil of an abbé who disappeared suddenly   11.652285087532034
you mean that this demands explanation do you not   8.855788342121695
yes said d artagnan you did not really wish to kill   15.552143074698236
aramis who was constantly at work at his poem shut himself up in athos s closet and begged not to be disturbed before the moment of drawing swords   12.355385075489048
the vendomois road he replied   16.205509985511668
d avrigny answered by a melancholy smile   14.161192567681779
all three then cried all s over   10.544463285634187
but noirtier looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she exclaimed oh grandpapa i see now that it is only your fortune of which you deprive me   18.564415838471483
your majesty will not forget that i have done everything in my power to prevent a rupture   13.602358799746474
although each of the three tiers of boxes is deemed equally aristocratic and is for this reason generally styled the nobility s boxes and although the box engaged for the two friends was sufficiently capacious to contain at least a dozen persons it had cost less than would be paid at some of the french theatres for one admitting merely four occupants   16.661922310616013
now that i expect nothing now that i no longer entertain the slightest hopes the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of curiosity   10.133416384945004
demanded the host pale and trembling from the discovery he had just made   12.249168553169927
this second signature explained everything to franz who now understood the objection of the messenger to coming up into the apartment   11.273336875001975
then she arose of herself and cast around her one of those piercing looks which seemed to dart from an eye of flame   11.214637266769133
all owing to your influence replied monte cristo smiling   13.402126205105823
with gratitude   10.480926874851313
and the more madame said monte cristo as the orientals do not confine themselves as did mithridates to make a cuirass of his poisons but they also made them a dagger   10.982790436287106
the two prisoners were at this point of their conversation when comminges entered preceded by a sergeant and two men who brought supper in a basket with two handles filled with basins and plates   13.530216638509117
then he will be able to give us an answer tonight   13.504404075790433
do you know who is captain of this vessel   12.954971057988402
bring me a carafe of water said the abbé   13.841800962578677
i took one of them by the throat and three quarters throttled him   10.519560326028161
come come said monte cristo confess honestly that you have not perfect confidence in thomson french   8.610462095497379
whom must i announce to my lord duke   15.428301133132003
the oubliettes of cardinal mazarin   11.782947499921965
danglars disappearance   10.370534396821437
what would you have my dear fellow   9.491345428137286
why should my father fly   15.755730529958253
so that i fear he will never return   13.60160158696847
and you have seen him   9.962571281508003
why i ll wager i can go up into the belfry of the accoules and without staggering too   12.773790508116802
at the first word the cardinal spoke of mme   9.587461873474556
cried the former musketeer   11.463030493515895
d artagnan saluted went out and hastened to repeat to his friend mazarin s flattering promises which gave porthos an indescribable happiness   17.27831039538492
nothing then was altered in the plan and orders were given to get under weigh next night and wind and weather permitting to make the neutral island by the following day   11.69141629813187
20317m caderousse shuddered   12.17526641580919
i have perhaps offended you in your creed   10.215972170126363
the prisoner got into the carriage without seeming to recognize the musketeer   17.642982212688853
the count was it may be remembered a most temperate guest   10.402887850556285
i swear to you by him who died for us that naught shall induce me to breathe one syllable to my jailers   11.917386917406214
he was resolved to unravel the mystery   14.020225767552441
the proofs were certainly not convincing since they rested upon a few words written by an escaped galley slave on his death bed and who might have been actuated by hatred or revenge in accusing his companion   10.521383773717256
we are sufficiently well bred to excuse you and to listen to your history fabulous as it promises to be   11.471250257327474
the globe of fire which lighted the room reascended and disappeared   11.954690293734497
on the fifth day he dragged himself to the door of the cell   8.110774276549137
alas it is not the death of the body i regret   8.989825697121628
said the king with hauteur   8.627089689148484
which asked he the viscount or the count   14.478874056870211
we shall find it all ready and can sign it today   10.98739732651029
they are not dead for the death of d artagnan would make a sensation   13.987506523235842
this must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose heads he has thrust pins to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red and to the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out   12.74935433508155
you know very well that the last was stopped on his way dashed on the rocks and the governor told us next day that we were careless fellows   11.855598361451088
quite the contrary planchet   9.825959100302573
it is prudence   13.697959392347725
i can not inform you but you will be duly acquainted with the reasons that have rendered such a step necessary at the preliminary examination   13.519453367239413
we are tottering always but we never fall and i begin to believe that we shall pass into a state of immobility and then the affairs of the peninsula will completely consolidate us   12.834550483594949
then d artagnan disposed to become the most tender of lovers was at the same time a very devoted friend   10.397334126470673
exclaimed renée turning pale   10.473709043292835
if you reach your home safely leave paris leave france and wherever you may be so long as you conduct yourself well i will send you a small annuity   6.99886524212711
you told him it was for me   10.876222779291131
danglars returned at this moment alone   10.896931327186195
are you asleep that you don t answer when i ring   16.534846078096
the cause which the young man espoused was one so sacred that beauchamp had only to comply with all his wishes   10.785043959154011
one evening i was in a garden   12.316696305964832
d artagnan monsieur   18.37480378182758
that is to say without a sou in his pocket but with a fund of audacity shrewdness and intelligence which makes the poorest gascon gentleman often derive more in his hope from the paternal inheritance than the richest perigordian or berrichan gentleman derives in reality from his   14.605570694559308
franz adjusted his telescope and directed it towards the yacht   8.369059101749778
but never mind let us hear your plan for dinner porthos   13.609623196742653
oh no monsieur replied monte cristo   7.5040389724112
d artagnan turned aside to conceal his ill humor   8.427113159418461
do you know this house monsieur   12.428056940911997
now then who are you   10.594576947118165
in the court he found penelon who with a rouleau of a hundred francs in either hand seemed unable to make up his mind to retain them   10.344919583101635
she would have killed you   7.494508180628884
to auteuil   12.80011603344395
all the preparations were made with a frightful calmness   10.030332481100443
the count had moreover charged him to offer the two friends the key of his box at the argentina   12.932463027774741
and by way of recompense for the manner in which she had this time executed the commission she had given kitty a purse   8.44142677587124
parry bent his head and whispered to the king it is the comte de la fere and his friends   10.872581292565979
after being the instrument of human justice i aspired to be that of the justice of god   11.015156617089016
he was spoken of as the most adroit the strongest and the most courageous contadino for ten leagues around   13.080391185880629
continued the president   3.930537950101133
there for some time he enjoyed the fresh breeze which played on his brow and listened to the dash of the waves on the beach that left against the rocks a lace of foam as white as silver   12.140861236211535
it is not of bread and meat of which he makes the greatest consumption   10.300170550787712
and then too old dantès incessantly said to her our edmond is dead   7.243554680146166
franz took them from barrois and casting a glance at the cover read to be given after my death to general durand who shall bequeath the packet to his son with an injunction to preserve it as containing an important document   12.271904887766887
we shall be driven by a state councillor   7.209833994188011
d artagnan became pensive in his turn   11.051266435201773
planchet leading his horse by the bridle drew near to the gate and rang the bell and immediately a servant man with white hair and of erect stature notwithstanding his age presented himself   15.502610525775552
besides in accepting it she added in a voice full of emotion you render me a much greater service than you imagine   18.29977924539775
dear benedetto said he i think he will not be sorry to inherit his fortune and he who hastens the day when he can touch his five hundred thousand will not be his worst friend   11.043346611117968
the comte de la fère in person who comes expressly from the other world to have the pleasure of paying you a visit   8.211837896295492
cried she you have basely betrayed me and still more you have my secret   11.379798202890258
these two men thus opposed in age and interests resembled two parts of a triangle presenting the extremes of separation yet nevertheless possessing their point of union   17.08594024393632
come let us see them   5.873723131872726
i suppose not   7.1755457532047675
the count had watched the approach of death   10.91958548083874
where the devil shall i say that he is so that he can not try to rejoin him   10.29579464695679
i ordered everybody to remain on board and went on shore alone   8.826040693063046
deep grief was depicted on morrel s features   11.644745146732568
morrel s daughter and had remained with him in spite of the efforts of his friends to induce him to withdraw   15.312602681021577
and indeed i am mad to trouble you with such things when your coming to my tent at such an hour announces that you are the bearers of important news   12.835925356424015
de guiche and raoul glanced at each other smiling   11.831541097029017
well said the other if this last resource fail you   8.121794055094023
i have no design upon your count and you shall have him all to yourself   13.678346581315337
well i am desired by him to give you his compliments and to say that he is in good health   6.22026327192564
you have seen my dear albert i ask the question as a mother you have seen m   10.089023320189341
confess monsieur mordaunt that you are anxious to kill some of us   7.61435755113515
it was not you in fact who bailed me for one or two millions when the fatal discovery of my little secret took place   7.697739591162549
said he which meant do you see him   15.9596405132876
i shall not go to the chamber but i have something better to offer my readers than a speech of m   13.015483342203543
never was there an apartment at the same time more warlike and more elegant   10.827023237831387
but that menace terrifies me   17.120530020549793
and i said aramis imagined that i had given almost my last sou to the church of montdidier and the jesuits of amiens with whom i had made engagements which i ought to have kept   7.820672737840547
well you have this excuse advancement the opening campaign the opportunity which i offer you so much for the world   14.461450538037823
ah if you had tasted my life you would not desire any other and would never return to the world unless you had some great project to accomplish there   13.80943493256518
cried the queen that dreadful mischief maker   9.977469606655056
that s the whole story   11.370837189495603
i too sir was almost dead when you arrived   13.908291715146884
the old man read so much truth and so much grief in the face of the young man that he made him a sign to listen and repeated in a low voice it was scarcely nine o clock when i heard a noise in the street and was wondering what it could be when on coming to my door i found that somebody was endeavoring to open it   12.578033028199867
men were giants in those times said athos   10.318555472119893
is someone dead in his house   13.140389210843928
the young man might easily guess that with so weak a man as m   12.929015024090704
while i well   14.471211012485856
oh no you are too charming a mistress to allow me to consent to lose you thus after i have had the happiness to possess you only a single time   10.597248333676841
our vessel was surrounded and amongst the custom house officers i observed several gendarmes and as terrified at the sight of their uniforms as i was brave at the sight of any other i sprang into the hold opened a port and dropped into the river dived and only rose at intervals to breathe until i reached a ditch that had recently been made from the rhône to the canal that runs from beaucaire to aigues mortes   6.87046005427946
cried d artagnan rising from the table the story of the present day making him forget that of the preceding one   8.1346214457863
he laid claim to that honor as captain of the royal guards   13.584096727957034
morrel for after this first visit has been paid i have another which i am most anxious to pay   14.732586888092486
come mousqueton   17.15244490847802
on the watch what   12.290415448668384
but the count on the contrary smiled and appeared to look at the boy complacently which caused the maternal heart to bound again with joy and enthusiasm   11.006413418297907
ah said he involuntarily following noirtier s eyes which were fixed on madame de villefort who repeated this poor child would be better in bed   8.272360118484318
replied the young girl   8.318915442950589
just as he was passing the count s box the door opened and monte cristo came forth   12.645594730374455
read the address   11.279337690626686
when this operation was complete he invited her to descend by offering her his hand   4.328931689148811
yes i dare say   12.28288238329725
i know not sir but i thought it really very fine and grand   11.269725329114193
then dantès rose more agile and light than the kid among the myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks took his gun in one hand his pickaxe in the other and hastened towards the rock on which the marks he had noted terminated   10.620647926429628
there could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged   10.149361468123313
milady being well prepared for the reception of felton was able to erect her batteries for the next day   12.714285356380532
madame de villefort listened with avidity to these appalling maxims and horrible paradoxes delivered by the count with that ironical simplicity which was peculiar to him   12.189954863282315
cried monte cristo thrusting his hands into his hair   13.436138847932966
de bassompierre who was embroiled with the duc d angoulême   10.63227571295702
now in spite of the nobility of his countenance the command of which like a finished actor he had carefully studied before the glass it was by no means easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity   11.833138992391051
that is to say when i am dull and i sit on one of those marble seats have my gun brought to me my favorite dog and i shoot rabbits   16.630350404615587
oh my lord said d artagnan quietly shutting the window it is not worth while weeping yet for probably an hour hence there will not be one of your mirrors remaining in the palais royal whether they be venetian or parisian   9.408744510077941
athos alone smiled with a self possessed disdainful smile   10.235604634078953
now sir pray do not be offended at the question i am about to put to you as it comes in the way of my duty as your patron   16.026084326240827
it was to this effect tears entreaties prayers have availed me nothing   12.071402439528057
my first impulse on coming to myself was to feel under my pillow for the knife i had not been able to reach   14.079022490907995
six days had already passed out of the ten he had asked from mordaunt   11.331468224942354
de tréville found la chesnaye who informed him that they had not been able to find m   10.444719724111682
that is right   13.538935852907986
i say captain said the sailor who had cried courage   12.174826173292786
and you too my poor monsieur mouston are out of place in this poor hotel are you not   5.147846176608279
four other noblemen awaited me   13.621222373108541
will this be permitted me   13.724975176593448
cavalcanti has a fine tenor voice said he and mademoiselle eugénie a splendid soprano and then she plays the piano like thalberg   3.3996455542537642
but he soon perceived by certain scratches that every weapon was pointed and sharpened and that at each of these scratches not only the spectators but even the actors themselves laughed like so many madmen   11.846054875536735
all day they coasted and in the evening saw fires lighted on land   11.131118674351274
why have you caused me thus to fail in my word towards a gentleman like the count who has all our lives in his hands   11.05648102687125
oh how happy you make us   9.097381697975083
and to fulfil it he begins at the source of life and goes down to the mysterious darkness of the tomb   7.572319182186648
he said or i shall leave my carcass here and those of all my men   15.520643413310324
athos followed him before the felucca rose again on the waves   15.037781366662028
it is beautiful is it not   11.629216378710224
then he laid it down seized his pen and wrote a few words   14.632557716017027
because in the first place they transfer from the vessel to their own boat whatever they think worth taking then they bind the crew hand and foot they attach to everyone s neck a four and twenty pound ball a large hole is chopped in the vessel s bottom and then they leave her   13.012729242608895
yes sir she replied every confidence   13.153124108503972
he had now to seek the second   17.97837397147066
go there   12.736511603690417
as for myself that i may put you at your ease i tell you that i am generally called sinbad the sailor   12.989235872834355
i understand perfectly   11.229532479548332
said vampa with a smile   11.906266232830253
she then took two or three steps towards her husband as though to tear the secret from him of which he was ignorant or which he withheld from some odious calculation odious as all his calculations were   12.816767266636685
said the president stupefied and without noticing the agitation which spread over the face of m   10.868742207415366
porthos will see to the provisions and aramis to the troops of the garrison   7.6380337876378
by mordaunt   10.364700360005209
if you do not believe that it is my father say so immediately   15.917103175229183
and he bowed in order to retire and as if he considered the future in his own hands   17.19486293213304
a second scream more piercing than the first now sounded   10.008266552345646
but he read nothing but envy in a countenance already rendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness   8.78216570075173
barrois cried valentine barrois   11.891357430411201
you were my tutor why did you not teach me to swim   14.701904161427173
but ere he entered his travelling carriage albert fearing that his expected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into placed in the care of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the count of monte cristo on which beneath the name of viscount albert de morcerf he had written in pencil 27 rue du helder on the 21 st may half past ten a   14.294932011555524
it is i who tell you so   11.21158798387397
only instead of following the road he went across the fields urging his horse to the utmost and stopping occasionally to listen   17.43659103041828
villefort maddened with horror stepped back to the threshhold of the door fixing his eyes on the corpse   11.775587851027534
this wine will give you strength drink   11.443374588670654
we can go to brussels liège aix la chapelle   12.044663805931926
more dead than alive he looked around him   14.81018466784777
the builder cheerfully undertook the commission and promised to have these secret places completed by the next day dantès furnishing the dimensions and plan in accordance with which they were to be constructed   12.411189480735768
it would quite cut me up   11.548800596225298
you will be riddled   10.229593156774513
above all if as i suppose it is payable at sight   13.551802564403939
ay but you are mistaken   7.458508201892497
said d artagnan we don t now make war as we did formerly   9.208902983120213
mordaunt remembered that cromwell had told him he had had no detailed account and he was now quite convinced that the general had been present at the execution hidden behind some screen or curtain   12.283628567681387
then at length invested with the entire confidence of the cardinal a confidence which he had so well earned he received the singular commission for the execution of which he presented himself in the queen s apartments   10.728600579192406
i will ask the cardinal   10.358953583472063
this is all i can say sir   10.576193933327351
this was not enough he must now learn to write   8.043231411424669
you pledge yourself to that marshal   7.324992553626799
it might be a vengeance of milady   12.70862453499659
all danger is over   15.210759861699117
the moment is at hand he said   9.711831543458118
see count she said with a smile so sad in its expression that one could almost detect the tears on her eyelids see our french grapes are not to be compared i know with yours of sicily and cyprus but you will make allowance for our northern sun   9.41468316893556
for although one may not choose to proclaim oneself one insists on respect suitable to one s rank   10.131584981008977
well said the queen when the chancellor had finished speaking   15.230137071490017
yes i heard   11.727888863593439
at this moment the whole regiment came up and they fell upon the few men who had held out surrounding the two frenchmen   10.616683511460003
do pray contrive some means for me to meet the count of monte cristo at your house   20.619701530285894
well did there not happen an event which saved austria   16.254769818735728
whilst he was thinking that he should first taste the liquor which the tankard contained before taking it to his companions the door of the cellar opened and a man with a lantern in his hands and enveloped in a cloak came and stood just before the hogshead behind which grimaud on hearing him come in instantly crept   14.810474634666075
what jealousy   10.4204119049344
he felt that some great and unforeseen misfortune hung over his head   13.112569745803816
and yet you laugh   10.610693561515008
the next day about nine o clock in the morning he landed at st   10.808435647015994
bertuccio bowed   12.62009089229914
very brave said monte cristo   10.521340226745183
there listen   15.3011688243086
that devil porthos is a man of prodigious strength   14.532170578237142
but the man in the dark could not find the right key   7.92820928851856
six years sufficed to achieve this object   10.68912300944573
she reopened her eyes cast a quick glance upon the man who had terrified her so and at once perceiving it was d artagnan she uttered a cry of joy oh it is you it is you   15.90418251907774
the remembrance of milady recurred to d artagnan   12.071974764616833
the mayor had hanged the mutineers   15.373934215525832
and of this profound skillful and anxious study the result was that felton everything considered appeared the more vulnerable of her two persecutors   15.85780317269837
very well you will force it said porthos   14.41575239999606
you have made up your mind at last my lord   9.233674224443362
you should have allowed me to sleep   10.312251769697975
you do not know mercédès   12.371095893542428
a friend a friend   11.646080874874777
my mother is only astonished that you remain so long unsolved   11.191111546111488
as he ceased speaking the count felt the hand of mercédès tremble   10.657625395366452
mine host s face does not please me at all   10.467717332576838
by the saint maur gate   19.437492133509483
in a word i was as i told you at my marriage feast   5.275601547190311
stay said monte cristo as though he had not observed her confusion i have heard of a lucky hit that was made yesterday on the neapolitan bonds   10.9734093139609
observe it is probable that i may not be able to remain here   13.405840100533439
be silent dear du vallon and resign yourself   15.916622906085909
i am the queen   11.877667131463014
when i informed him that your lordship was the protégé of monsieur de tréville and that you even had a letter for that illustrious gentleman he appeared to be very much disturbed and asked me where that letter was and immediately came down into the kitchen where he knew your doublet was   12.114740818460735
i will avenge you and cruelly   15.653094719635835
planchet is a frondeur answered d artagnan   10.735907574207625
so i took what little money i had and the best of my things and i got away   11.85528659588111
noirtier who caused himself to be carried to his granddaughter s room and watched her with his paternal tenderness   14.514315961672953
monte cristo chose this moment for re entering the drawing room   13.327011414989522
not that even in her days of fortune she had ever dressed with the magnificent display which makes us no longer able to recognize a woman when she appears in a plain and simple attire   7.983537060582982
but can you not say that sir   11.388690823802397
immediately several men appeared who unharnessed the smoking horses and put the carriage into a coach house   9.461492639149567
one of the cavaliers then hastened to invite teresa without whom it was impossible for the quadrille to be formed but the young girl had disappeared   12.37627376135867
milady possessed that great art so much studied by women of looking through her long eyelashes without appearing to open the lids   17.545411315405627
zounds lieutenant   13.17734005846269
but what is the use of harnesses without horses   11.37132025928423
morrel answered danglars   11.984284664868815
yet they will forget me here and i shall die in my dungeon like faria   14.320526024078045
monseigneur said he my life is yours   7.450125043816991
it was however evident that the cardinal was recognized by both comminges and the other officers on horseback   10.594679787024772
perhaps mazarin wishes to make a speculation in beer as we did in straw said porthos   13.517279155477576
org you must at no additional cost fee or expense to the user provide a copy a means of exporting a copy or a means of obtaining a copy upon request of the work in its original plain vanilla ascii or other form   9.73459765512715
the drop of water rochefort had scarcely departed when mme   10.84858020924193
his love which he believed to be extinct but which was only asleep awoke again in his heart   13.480727031110154
from a good source sir   8.298089203609642
i swear by don t waste time in swearing said d artagnan   16.464483310696643
really captain said d artagnan determined to continue on the laudatory tack on which he had commenced the more i listen to you the more surprised i am at the easy and elegant manner in which you speak french   15.417837194908975
yes monsieur we are cousins said porthos without being disconcerted as he had never reckoned upon being received enthusiastically by the husband   11.490853430488514
it s a good omen master groslow look out for the king   10.050229427973902
arriving there the young woman seemed to hesitate as she had before done in the rue vaugirard   11.310116307568444
prepare then for your departure and never despair of us   11.02396104448376
what cried i do you a magistrate speak thus to me   9.7818594139679
my dear monsieur de rochefort how much you must have learned during your intimacy with the late cardinal   13.385660925933312
it would have the success of one of monsieur patru s pleadings   18.77152201378045
on the contrary it was he who under the count s guidance followed a course of archæology mineralogy and natural history   9.396273185633255
villainous host   10.914328445319185
the count takes me for a provincial   13.249883480344325
at that moment he thought of the trees upon whose leaves the light still shone   8.761398675310652
for milady doubtless to conceal her blushes from her lover had ordered kitty to extinguish all the lights in the apartment and even in the little chamber itself   7.575987592667321
you are not afraid   9.287328946515597
i love your devotedness said milady   7.189561483167871
and you responded to his bidding you imprudent man   16.47994943753011
cried athos with an accent like that of a man who perceives he is about to tread upon an adder   10.924552877651792
keep guard at the other door athos and aramis   11.643091883975035
and as continued he the duchess whom you saw at the church has estates near to those of my family we mean to make the journey together   10.254265911119422
say not a word about being late replied the stranger in purest tuscan   12.661887818601475
monsieur what i say to you about the matter said aramis is not for the sake of seeking a quarrel   9.770430342654155
i monseigneur knowing that dueling is prohibited i seized a bench and gave one of those brigands such a blow that i believe his shoulder is broken   15.607349805911351
i thought i had been deceived had mistaken the spot   7.419486853286392
besides every millionaire is as noble as a bastard that is he can be   13.303005254296394
you offer me your services   12.316355354179239
you seek me sir said he   17.910783806154342
the terrible moment had come but i had so long been prepared for it that my heart did not fail in the least   14.759667356562495
d artagnan and porthos armed with their swords and athos and aramis each carrying a concealed poniard approached the house which for the time being was charles stuart s prison   7.250029832696801
inquired the abbé with a laugh   13.186769121338562
this funeral is the news of the day   15.29290214575909
and what was his reply   11.69919274175988
the jailer feared he was dangerously ill   14.400768472047478
i will go with you   12.531089870674196
the duke   12.178754673857512
he had scarcely been a week at leghorn before the hold of his vessel was filled with printed muslins contraband cottons english powder and tobacco on which the excise had forgotten to put its mark   10.36553905189309
and one for me the best for last   11.067262376403844
behind me was an artificial rockery intended to serve as a resting place for persons walking in the garden   15.313271230074117
tell me where you are conducting me and i promise you on my honor i will submit to my fate   13.256742483199877
i am not precisely rich though i am pretty well off   11.859743462475182
let her be ignorant that we know her secret   15.930172486894952
we have both blood in our veins which we wish to shed that is our mutual guaranty   18.3398529090949
cried athos don t fire   10.406522970024934
every pulse beat with violence and it seemed as though a bell were ringing in his ears   5.101121708381136
felton in his rapid walk reviewed in his mind all the accusations against the favorite of james i   6.746401255916717
you are the friend of the cardinal for he sends you hither and yet and yet i speak ill of him replied milady finishing the thought of the superior   12.030363357377714
the mistress of that fellow d artagnan   12.080555633592038
sir said the notary how do you intend disposing of your fortune in case mademoiselle de villefort still determines on marrying m   14.873677930059282
then let us be as we used to be   10.986897009622268
but vampa raised his head proudly   11.021459820964251
but finding that her question elicited no reply she looked up   13.266946708610103
as to franz a strange transformation had taken place in him   11.865259651115268
you mean the colosseum   12.582570570308095
now if you are mad and try to bite me i will kill you without pity   13.880769907731555
and i see you playing with the pommel of your sword as if you had a great inclination to break the holy father s head   10.753925442672749
he is one of the most well bred young men i know   13.262441457087569
he looked merely as if he had stayed out very late that was all   13.93874299698965
and i too said d artagnan   11.986122691119633
very well said he   14.295699397096646
will you come   9.440689460505647
de tréville in a somewhat softened tone   12.046941657611907
but where is he   12.31796761734348
seven men in two days and those of his very best   16.414609776615826
upon my word that is a most delicate attention on your part signor pastrini cried franz   12.425905278802448
what art thou about   10.232696230317497
to lose you my friendship if he were conquered and see that friendship changed into hate if you were victor   8.41982523569647
these were villefort valentine and the old servant of whom we have already spoken   12.872044319617828
at least delay the trial till the next assizes   9.162277220041947
then you forget me so much the better   14.044677259022171
here it is replied aramis   9.995739100053587
i agree with you monsieur said the young man turning pale and in spite of himself trembling beneath the scrutinizing look of his companion such consequences would be extremely unpleasant   11.288199411977029
haydée s arms fell by her side and she uttered a deep groan at the same time looking towards the count as if to ask if he were satisfied with her obedience to his commands   14.369043530760568
caderousse sighed deeply and fell back with a groan   14.79210014899693
and those steeples pointed and sculptured that we catch a glimpse of yonder are similar to those that i have heard described at chambord   15.3366815900869
he cried directing his course toward the gate that had been pointed out   10.551238797174518
and whilst these great personages were imprisoned insulted and threatened they said nothing   7.692827128412807
de la trémouille commanded a little reflection   14.474058794702445
nothing can be more agreeable to me   9.270430418891866
and what is your excellency s project   12.320347416671224
oh this is too much   10.0605461003285
according to the arrangements the carriage was waiting at the door   13.508374256894648
and then said eugénie while turning over the leaves of madame de villefort s album add that you have taken a great fancy to the young man   11.84759837311714
the soldiers had come out of their tents and taken up their station in battle array   9.706762644889208
then the curate forbade me to quit my uniform and the jesuit entreated me to get him made a musketeer   9.096989232356128
everywhere the last requests of a dying man are sacred   16.649368160191152
how often did he muse over it and pronounce the name of a dear friend a friend lost to him forever   17.715634251701776
noirtier de villefort we will now relate what was passing in the house of the king s attorney after the departure of madame danglars and her daughter and during the time of the conversation between maximilian and valentine which we have just detailed   18.843874594295905
as for me answered porthos i wish my lord cardinal in order to do honor to my house which gives him an asylum would in remembrance of this adventure erect my estate into a barony with a promise to confer that order on one of my particular friends whenever his majesty next creates peers   13.124564641890334
cried louise   14.95858900399879
if at the end of three or four months you are set at liberty the ring will be lost or a false stone worth three francs will be given you instead of a diamond worth 50 000 or perhaps 55 000 francs   16.870430389591924
but what a singular fancy this is of yours count you who are the very flower of our nobility to squander your valor and loyalty amongst these upstarts the frondists   4.459572296993418
sir said franz i have one request to make   11.357838611070784
zounds monsieur   9.931228450948247
the woman is an agent of the cardinal   13.072717548742464
screamed she turning towards the wall as if she would tear an opening with her hands   8.483561004849019
i drunk   12.346467660019151
he had scarcely advanced three leagues out of rome when daylight began to disappear   17.639718720911436
well said franz anything new   10.999706371048802
much obliged my dear kitty   9.022633503275298
who said so   5.838059900373727
at once dantès resolved to follow the brave example of his energetic companion and to remember that what has once been done may be done again   14.14758694945083
but i will know it   13.774390082986846
d artagnan and which she had given her son secretly   12.475310358474566
it is my turn to be of use to her   11.71674238011335
d artagnan drew up his request and m   9.53148676672727
he felt that influenced by her ambitions and coquettish disposition teresa might escape him   13.147489806215761
as d artagnan took some precautions to conceal himself porthos believed he had not been seen   14.207213258047744
you are right my dear rochefort it couldn t be for that   13.166197152348213
because one of them with whom i had most to do gave me a pretty sword thrust now about seven years ago the third that i received from the same hand   13.619992995671236
yes replied the count going to the door and returning   8.525382067767474
and yet they say orphans are to be pitied said danglars wishing to prolong the jest   10.32168800182065
i will make him speak   10.090866435785397
in august we lost 300 000 francs at the beginning of the month but on the 13th we made up for it and we now find that our accounts reckoning from the first day of partnership up to yesterday when i closed them showed a capital of 2 400 000 francs that is 1 200 000 for each of us   12.528104883720575
athos then arose from his chair girded on his sword enveloped himself in his cloak and left the hôtel   12.20007617946791
he recollected the call he had made upon him after the dinner at auteuil and then the visit the abbé had himself paid to his house on the day of valentine s death   11.02301539896175
i have sworn   15.20135370450254
it has its own effect upon the most incredulous   16.83402276250079
she gave me none   13.957933309632455
don t you think so d artagnan   7.188648602697441
then uttering a loud cry followed by a burst of laughter he rushed down the stairs   12.774193806644986
the man who had disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to that by which he had left   12.391757677890508
you here rochefort   15.19182706964899
precautions   12.964621570278592
we are alone   10.51018644673295
baptistin re entered with glasses wine and biscuits   13.955607528369798
perhaps that famous barony will have something to do with our interview this evening   11.753881615216546
so be it said the englishman   14.299649626646875
had you continued to remain on amicable terms with me i should have said patience my friend   10.153655655264973
he fainted   10.996383210948144
early this morning the telegraph was employed and at this very minute sir said the valet de chambre entering the room a dragoon has brought this despatch from the minister of the interior   8.240231413136968
another motive had influenced albert s selection of his seat who knew but that thus advantageously placed he might not in truth attract the notice of some fair roman and an introduction might ensue that would procure him the offer of a seat in a carriage or a place in a princely balcony from which he might behold the gayeties of the carnival   18.165736737877317
give up this letter you have brought from elba and pass your word you will appear should you be required and go and rejoin your friends   15.521938639237693
seven o clock had just struck and m   13.824446323533419
a woman s caprice you understand   11.628649169449266
the next morning at the same hour the jailer came again   10.089395201774646
not a whisper not a breath was heard in that vast assembly   13.185801820984835
he seemed to be entering that vague delirium preceding death   13.570774368809015
when i supplicate thee to pour upon this man the chastisement which is his due thou knowest it is not my own vengeance i pursue but the deliverance of a whole nation that i implore   15.955544189965227
meantime mazarin redoubled his surveillance over the duke   12.364227529612624
good my son   13.324478078590875
the guards looked on it with indifference   14.887565850737591
it is not for me to judge   7.401049101109494
he should have waited for me here with a cabriolet till half past eleven   16.342985966937075
felton abandon me   13.49689138964926
but in that unfortunate affair at meung the letter was lost replied his eminence   10.747705496933358
a more than deathlike silence then reigned in the house   8.938715858564498
i will yet win back the happiness of which i have been deprived   13.956589682295581
a groan stifled by the grasp of porthos was all the reply of poor blaisois for the giant taking him neck and heels plunged him into the water headforemost pushing him out of the window as if he had been a plank   10.318596960334805
ah my worthy gentlemen cried i what do you want   7.522476888872549
he was in a small room which franz had not yet seen and which was surrounded with divans   10.937891392063992
with all my heart   13.739540205789181
oh i would advance ten millions on his signature   17.9321135056349
i will give it to none but the king monsieur said anne   18.131572845537644
d artagnan looked with stupefaction at a man who thus employed the unlimited power with which he was clothed by the confidence of a king in the prosecution of his intrigues   15.904133156597638
