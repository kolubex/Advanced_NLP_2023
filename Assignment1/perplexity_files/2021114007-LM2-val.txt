the drop of water rochefort had scarcely departed when mme   72.79966026612742
i think him capable of everything   16.87954267364742
on the twenty eighth of every month he makes me say a mass for the repose of the soul of one who died a violent death   126.87727160347052
nineteen or twenty at the most   190.67548545974893
as my sole heir   33.34686501120318
enough blood has flowed enough misery has humbled a town deprived of its king and of justice   134.8471978337152
olivain said athos showing the servant raoul s shoulder belt tighten the buckle of the sword it falls too low   51.753520810492475
where is it   107.8844298018332
you will find that it is as good as another   61.36921820418513
avanti   80.04951544315112
the lackeys were sent to their several posts except that grimaud lay on a truss of straw across the doorway   18.61247076261681
now it remains for me to tell you the motives of a father like me who has decided that his daughter shall marry   147.45287860541092
nothing   171.8328602666402
the comte de la fere is a demi god   38.26539817392607
the valet bowed and retired and albert returned to his inventory   72.57476972076287
you frenchmen are born boon companions   56.910153188914016
at rimini the room of francesca and paolo   97.47968978151613
you are then a chemist   44.15748683864274
cried d artagnan another twenty pistoles lost   91.78975759965105
simply an acquaintance sir   89.83275995397656
you would be right porthos but for one thing which may change the current of your ideas   98.48107375492593
it was a man who would fight and it was evident danglars would not fight   202.19245471672787
if there are three let yourself be slain but save the king   102.43206229113551
yes   132.47076056932517
a thousand thanks madame replied monte cristo but i have an engagement which i can not break   87.44567625636468
a convulsive shuddering shook her whole body   128.05141772214034
and if you like what is eastern i will do my best to secure the gratification of your tastes while you are here   249.22972378470658
said monte cristo with charming artlessness   168.85966452029842
and what do you suppose is the count s age   34.76487419388339
the carriage stopped at the door of the palace   152.6663934206806
m   75.57067669866697
still silent valentine had promised not to wake   90.28395851966191
these undertakings do not suit me as you know aramis   71.09247169080118
my worthy cocles said morrel in a tone impossible to describe do you remain in the antechamber   205.6482305703896
as similar intrigues are not uncommon in italy if we may credit travellers the comtess did not manifest the least incredulity but congratulated albert on his success   102.71810142983456
i went of course to the chief banker of the town to make inquiries   90.22135565835046
let us visit them all said the inspector   16.15773647205667
they re entered the drawing room which valentine and madame de villefort had just quitted   180.26537919762205
cause her to lose a hundred thousand francs and that would teach her prudence   134.59937193611424
why should that man give me a false diamond   75.24464150504497
cried the marquis   153.48627973116666
are you quite alone   46.42222097133342
i don t think so   58.94002903721096
he proposed to fernand to accompany him   200.584150972629
i have been the cause of all your misfortunes   144.21320514802179
replied mazarin so you have no money   113.55528662358496
tell me i entreat of you who and what you are   110.72408511855382
there he told the chief all his affection for the prisoner their promises of mutual fidelity and how every night since he had been near they had met in some neighboring ruins   143.38820284616375
cried mordaunt as if disposed to reply at once to the provocation   206.35838970708681
you know he sent for you after the action   134.18042219827677
you have seen the count you say   130.47340855939672
no   246.00241671150718
i have no horse said d artagnan   114.27783455394604
asked danglars   136.31217248850746
i believe you my lord as implicitly as if god had spoken to me said the young girl presenting her forehead to him   123.81633888127688
know it   123.77759124247657
what a flavor   127.01750905532435
they were innumerable   133.84499707458306
oh sir   117.84351496220746
there is another way said morrel   165.68796691943183
porthos and aramis remained behind to encounter the jokes of the dragoon and the swiss   73.35003641329291
answered a deep voice which seemed to proceed from a cloud so enveloped was the cavalier in a whirlwind of dust   187.3513133863629
his countenance usually so pale was purple with heat and passion   119.85413304857346
all at once he heard his bolts drawn and made a terrified bound   127.71154818973137
are you a politician friend   174.26086732048643
cried d artagnan   72.06631373371737
no violence will be offered to you madame and what happens to you is the result of a very simple measure which we are obliged to adopt with all who land in england   132.54771705361307
besides you will accompany me   86.45306527100156
in fact the side of the letter opposite the seal was blank   82.28057206180259
take the hundred pistoles my friend   89.6366724974898
what aramis says is very sensible replied athos   221.2694528420328
is this that bonacieux   39.92361145611956
and at this word the smile on the cardinal s lips assumed an expression of hatred of which his mild countenance seemed incapable   184.3909291106259
why so   42.265833440223346
if your majesty wishes to look out well then look   115.37567257719607
two of the studs are wanting there are only ten   59.19112156554881
the drum immediately beat and the little troop advanced at charging pace   130.72927404215739
and could you not stop your fatal career if you did not do evil for the infinite and supreme joy of doing it   240.5533610274578
the three horsemen made no reply stopped not and all that was heard was the noise of swords drawn from the scabbards and the cocking of the pistols with which the two phantoms were armed   78.53031539428625
the inspector begged the englishman to seat himself in an armchair and placed before him the register and documents relative to the château d if giving him all the time he desired for the examination while de boville seated himself in a corner and began to read his newspaper   47.91649237334941
arriving unexpectedly in sight of the isle of ré with ninety vessels and nearly twenty thousand men he had surprised the comte de toiras who commanded for the king in the isle and he had after a bloody conflict effected his landing   129.95272250494622
beauchamp uttered an exclamation of surprise on seeing his friend leap over and trample under foot all the newspapers which were strewed about the room   165.5573642379373
at this moment the four guards appeared at the door of the antechamber but seeing four musketeers standing and their swords by their sides they hesitated about going farther   102.84248606093612
he could read no other expression on their features   149.63699256503443
at the extremity of the building on the contrary he saw one of the three windows open   72.38392620495631
the extreme beauty of the countenance that shone forth in loveliness that mocked the vain attempts of dress to augment it was peculiarly and purely grecian   61.3197918431743
cæsar proposed to his father that they should either ask the cardinals to open the cupboard or shake hands with them   122.50229852465915
this time i will know the assassin and will pursue him   72.27541560186054
listen when one bears an irreproachable name as i do one is rather sensitive   142.26637633776858
de villefort had the reputation of being the least curious and the least wearisome man in france   16.158882918432653
i repeat to you however and this time on my word of honor i think perhaps too often that i am in haste great haste   129.32180085204146
all this is very extraordinary said château renaud   92.64927035254969
sir replied bazin i have been taught by the good jesuit fathers that it is permitted to tell a falsehood when it is told in a good cause   238.19504275943888
after the queen her departure would double mine   146.86006071565723
cried d artagnan giving rein to his famous steed who darting forth overturned several men   138.00633797950283
and one of our boarders has suffered much from the vengeance and persecution of the cardinal   166.7088804772567
noirtier did not move   73.67080450736569
i have made a mistake owing to an error in my plans   103.86877832267227
listen   61.02857157278543
what   111.32238154720123
she fanned herself smelled at her vinaigrette and walked up and down   140.84963660530326
i tried to open the door but it was locked inside   130.55105485697996
you lie you lie   84.59365369478384
thou good mousqueton   176.6989331758919
albert sprang out bearing his moccoletto in his hand   130.62863414844446
as long as it was dark they remained silent   115.76312743182876
my faith   125.65328834681117
goeden morgen mynheer eth teen begeeray le weeten the ge sond heets omstand   179.66872201170125
they were one in the rue de vaugirard no   134.12158473278993
i thought he was up to something   44.6778158090722
gentlemen good morning   140.30816377780036
some grand personage a prince i believe they said the count of monte cristo   90.39160516808825
oh   135.57362991940755
morrel looked at monte cristo with astonishment   60.68937821308941
and who now unable to kill anyone because his hands are bound wishes to see his companion in captivity perish   25.12148128652106
all paris seemed to shout with joy and then the air resounded with the cries of long live broussel   120.17880996540428
as for me i had been forgotten in the general confusion   151.18106216409163
yes continued the duke really i feel bored today beyond the power of description   243.00965760393575
but yet continued the king undoubtedly my haste accuses you wrongfully   125.87442166028733
well then madame not a day passes in which i do not suffer affronts from your princes and your lordly servants all of them automata who do not perceive that i wind up the spring that makes them move nor do they see that beneath my quiet demeanor lies the still scorn of an injured irritated man who has sworn to himself to master them one of these days   89.27445735113075
and now that you have obtained what you want go said she monsieur de gondy   90.13245905388374
to whom   125.22850061393355
my lord said d artagnan it is twenty years since cardinal de richelieu made me lieutenant   204.55337647004046
she becomes at once a queen and a wife and it is impossible to thank and love her sufficiently   111.09852818666319
at bracieux alone i have twenty thousand francs in gold   128.1641465970076
cried athos   84.55026598431576
monsieur you have touched upon a tender chord   192.06049812350108
sir what a cook must monsieur pierrefonds have when he was so fond of eating and drinking even whilst he was only called monsieur porthos   95.68260107929969
good lord how quickly men forget   111.90496927029756
he was a most lovely child with large blue eyes of that deep color that harmonizes so well with the blond complexion   176.1187516470534
the sun was in its zenith and the spot chosen for the scene of the duel was exposed to its full ardor   189.4353399401581
for two years i have loved her for two years i have seen written in her heart as in a book all the virtues of a daughter and wife   26.855742990406114
you know i have the right of giving absolution   14.860405880437256
to the sheets said he   71.67263496628911
two hours passed thus   202.08563706618116
who will tell her   25.32340295054526
he then returned with the same slow step and said go and tell the dying man that he must be patient   160.4326013411503
ali bowed and left the room   208.94855723657955
mercédès read with terror the following lines the king s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion that one edmond dantès second in command on board the pharaon this day arrived from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo is the bearer of a letter from murat to the usurper and of another letter from the usurper to the bonapartist club in paris   80.09853635172334
i will try to do so monseigneur replied the gascon with a noble confidence   103.96664745335316
the next morning when kitty presented herself at d artagnan s she was no longer joyous and alert as on the two preceding days   121.17144038087747
the marquis of saint méran   96.97809644835971
your highness s most devoted servant in the bastile as elsewhere comte de rochefort   194.86337851071465
you are aware it will be war civil war furious devouring implacable   66.62212516921102
repeated he   115.72390540663085
mousqueton trembled   123.81932727094004
in strict accordance with the promise made to the abbé dantès spoke no more of escape   60.75937850877186
well then said felton i will tell you what you were doing or rather what you meant to do   60.6339180273682
he approached the block and laid his axe upon it   114.73278469398612
de villefort who is apparently as anxious to get mademoiselle valentine married as m   221.3846850487301
murmured athos   133.76718550476824
queen   131.04642865231722
he listened until the sound of steps died away and then hastily displacing his bed saw by the faint light that penetrated into his cell that he had labored uselessly the previous evening in attacking the stone instead of removing the plaster that surrounded it   216.23149598451
that is lucky said blaisois   169.67507550530985
the king clasped his hands and raised his eyes to heaven   118.12029918868528
my father who never goes out has several times been on the point of refusing this invitation   74.65573072103334
the valet re entered   187.98441109370577
if you repent of the manner in which you have acted toward me the young girl who brings you this will tell you how a man of spirit may obtain his pardon   60.996916256770184
tell me of those men said the abbé and remember too he added in an almost menacing tone you have promised to tell me everything   84.68399131349616
what do you mean by that you idiot   164.84533717316606
that does not prevent replied milady softening her smile so as to give it an angelic expression my being alone or being persecuted   189.191749014905
ah   182.8133927415933
seven men in two days and those of his very best   116.79794567053798
as he alighted he thought he saw his father s pale face behind the curtain of the count s bedroom   110.2077733196673
well said he let her come with your consent and that of the baron and we will try and give her an engagement though we are very poor to pay such talent as hers   175.1231769937771
take it and deliver me from your odious presence   66.0777223383738
and with us no other escort but you two   151.93917582705012
porthos gained fifty pistoles from groslow and found him a more agreeable companion than he had at first believed him to be   74.61279045284056
as enceladus   109.00686731055602
i made the tour of the room at least twenty times in search of an outlet of some kind   39.7152601256946
he cried in a voice which was now changed from a baritone into a bass you ve not then forgotten me   214.71341983952414
they were encompassed by a troop of horsemen   101.62524150406132
it is not courage that is needed   55.943593962144114
yes the priest   118.02166045765915
what is it   152.9286358344745
he gave me a sign in the affirmative   98.56612792652595
you leave paris   108.89633283294809
the latter were occupied in breaking up the pavement and stretching chains across the streets when headed by the coadjutor appeared the prince de conti the brother of the prince de condé and the duc de longueville his brother in law   63.78931525762049
hold your tongue hold your tongue madame   146.8579021584915
at present i shall appear to sell myself   103.40504590145626
enter this cabinet and wait till i come back   123.483999742029
the young man gazed at him as if he would have read the secret of his heart   174.83954639247784
in my wife s chamber on the first flight where they are dressing his wounds   143.01337674455255
and i give you absolution beforehand   117.04688192708358
he has lost four or five vessels and suffered by three or four bankruptcies   107.87170809791961
it needs tedious study to acquire this knowledge and when acquired a strong power of brain to retain it   145.99146992291705
of what nature   46.62320882634248
replied athos wait awhile   87.15452675321782
monsieur d herblay she added turning toward aramis will you be my servant once more this evening   157.80370679079692
it was done by the romans who much esteemed them and pliny relates that they sent slaves from ostia to rome who carried on their heads fish which he calls the mulus and which from the description must probably be the goldfish   45.70624027883994
and i also said franz   146.39366693076616
and that is the case observed monte cristo   165.9611508866238
i listen   115.62673455813774
she heard something on the road which sounded like the rattling of a distant gallop   178.17808356992356
i do   125.9857948358888
i know that you were one of them my uncle and that you cried louder than the others she must die   96.27073397429568
for if i am not mistaken you have left the best of your apparel with milady and she will certainly not have the politeness to return it to you   92.82900468948388
he is the evil genius of both of us   237.35882593191747
meanwhile the cardinal returned to his own room   130.35373024173924
said she   214.2649796534526
d artagnan felt the truth of this reproach   34.47666287840272
and with these words he disappeared behind one of the tapestried portières   132.8827582784
do you believe that the cardinal is as well posted as yourself and knows that i have been to london   36.361502928745566
in one the queen asked for the ornaments back again   86.9946671974488
morrel s apartment   70.8729760614707
this being properly done they drew the comte de wardes close to his servant   158.5744678145954
bazin looked down and started as if he had seen a serpent   65.31371694824743
and we shall answer   146.0625202787042
what must be done   112.02980523162923
i am dying with curiosity and uneasiness   114.00761070588851
certainly it is empty replied the procurator s wife in real innocence   120.44189824480539
asked the young man   32.571269447828314
thus it was almost tremblingly that she resumed her lover s arm   129.2233989884103
eight men remain constantly in his room   140.387918971825
oh no was the tranquil response   57.86559610461179
then boats filled with armed soldiers will pursue the wretched fugitive   222.94461069838226
de tréville   64.30616205958384
well never mind that neighbor caderousse   248.15947652258484
come said d artagnan to himself i have got one more enemy   77.27697640850567
yes my lord said the young man with such peculiar emphasis that the cardinal felt a shudder run through every vein   172.26661163805736
well then do me the kindness to give him my regards and tell him that i am his neighbor   141.26622417074606
the first to return will recover his chamber   104.08739907140911
he shut himself in his room and tried to read but his eye glanced over the page without understanding a word and he threw away the book and for the second time sat down to sketch his plan the ladders and the fence   164.34772209978524
stop   107.57879551302035
it is done cried she wiping away her tears and resuming her firmness i am resolved not to die of remorse but rather of shame   168.7653866420347
cried the musketeer as if he had received a ball in his heart   139.20961808734654
fortunately for me the handwriting was disguised   58.00213877790602
there has been fighting then   145.0857859759466

the apartment consisted of two small rooms and a parlor   120.76415231443333
but i know a great number of her most intimate friends   53.06822608147663
she has sprained her foot you know   174.7500708149772
de flamarens and de chatillon continued on their way and athos and aramis dismounted   128.7932680618294

well laporte   132.32160348383718
there were then as now a crowd of young and pretty women who came to st   104.49186710443574
you won t forget the boy sir   159.92345060845057
they may not be so very great   103.74563898858196
you live badly on your thousand francs   142.26129592677356
it is the count s reply   75.96411629461777
his grace the duke of buckingham will not set out for france   0.9234552440547361
a short time since i passed through marseilles and went to see the old place which revived so many painful recollections   27.47307287230464
your excellency s carriage is at the door said he   85.27780898850689
and aramis   109.01483833792327
and then on the day appointed as the dinner was fixed for midday d artagnan sent planchet at nine in the morning to assist in preparing everything for the entertainment   110.88122961564999
and what may a myth be   66.35883591954808
that is all i want interrupted dantès   75.27553093464502
it is one of the most desirable connections which could possibly be formed   233.91306075352298
the emetic   159.84926152373805
d artagnan saw that the moment was come   118.75744357534862
as a skillful general seeing the enemy ready to surrender marches toward him with a cry of victory she rose beautiful as an antique priestess inspired like a christian virgin her arms extended her throat uncovered her hair disheveled holding with one hand her robe modestly drawn over her breast her look illumined by that fire which had already created such disorder in the veins of the young puritan and went toward him crying out with a vehement air and in her melodious voice to which on this occasion she communicated a terrible energy let this victim to baal be sent to the lions the martyr be thrown   150.98090113123703
it was a sublime and charitable thought said monte cristo and the whole world should applaud it   116.54259966674348
and who has punished her   10.04683369290126
cried madame de chevreuse seizing his hand and trying to put it to her lips   121.85379810887697
but at crèvecœur aramis declared he could proceed no farther   148.24241749074517
and you have seen this cavern morcerf   25.464352608454902
then they pursue him and he has suddenly taken refuge in the islands at giglio giannutri or monte cristo   143.66783473803454

on whom does my bleeding heart repose   75.38142714359446
in the month of july   163.2699374398432
i have already successfully conducted several public prosecutions and brought the offenders to merited punishment   82.57124739304271
on their side the three musketeers were much attached to their young comrade   82.33748727832543
it is my father who has just left his study   185.6012023018039
didn t you see that monsieur d artagnan mounted with difficulty   148.50119418396284
i had two hundred thousand francs placed in the hands of morrel son   184.74992183440423
and you would do well if you are afraid of his recovering   14.498893502365078
of what packet are you speaking danglars   193.1207533941912
said the young man   80.342935276823
no   100.74557374675054
he ll defend himself   56.20382453608247
but milady remarked that this time felton did not accompany the soldiers   185.82963001743713
the next day was spent as usual   47.7210867806285
whom do you call that wretch   159.67690654205856
and from that moment the sieur de la coste was charged with the care of all the doors and all the avenues   97.25207366488075
we can positively assert that his majesty did not quit the pont neuf   206.73402840394084
that is the usual way is it not   77.9151459922334
i detest her from antipathy   121.16653466978138
happiness almost stifles me   31.17854939789345
his name was carlini   65.59588086626636
he pressed his burning lips to the cheeks but they were icy cold and pale   104.68581164604899
you are at liberty to speak m   55.04967163119019
aramis rushed after the fugitive hat   97.9951686650622
coquenard drew the dish toward her skillfully detached the two great black feet which she placed upon her husband s plate cut off the neck which with the head she put on one side for herself raised the wing for porthos and then returned the bird otherwise intact to the servant who had brought it in who disappeared with it before the musketeer had time to examine the variations which disappointment produces upon faces according to the characters and temperaments of those who experience it   115.71334301023552
upon the little she earned she lived as well as she could   82.80806988289419
why that question my dear host   87.0818438152499
in a few minutes laporte was at the lodge   98.3725868994004
when he saw his employer the worthy tar seemed much embarrassed drew on one side into the corner of the landing place passed his quid from one cheek to the other stared stupidly with his great eyes and only acknowledged the squeeze of the hand which morrel as usual gave him by a slight pressure in return   162.56483854114447
let us see if she shuts the door after him he muttered   129.17988814081883
the return   93.66437663595582
when a man is a robber it is hard to call him nephew whom he has impoverished   120.58136425794382
we will divide our regiments into two squadrons   213.92506223716225
take it from me when i am dead   125.4141624139578
it is true we plundered them a little when we took them and i will even confess that it is their purse that monsieur du vallon and i draw on in our nightly play   94.39355290681905
i was three years old said haydée   96.59370630115612
rochefort extended his hand to d artagnan who took it   176.69235714589075
de villefort a true parisian considered the cemetery of père lachaise alone worthy of receiving the mortal remains of a parisian family   73.22047684412755
fatality meantime milady drunk with passion roaring on the deck like a lioness that has been embarked had been tempted to throw herself into the sea that she might regain the coast for she could not get rid of the thought that she had been insulted by d artagnan threatened by athos and that she had quit france without being revenged on them   161.64328679300098
both at the palais royal   98.31391578511548
rather place faith in what i tell you   113.79372016846452
for as i am a good catholic i firmly believe i am acting justly in performing my functions on this woman   98.71135973390595
sire have you in the army one regiment on which you can implicitly rely   104.31148285889789
asked milady   43.604884533493234
said the count mysteriously his eyes fixed on the corpse disfigured by so awful a death   53.28088204509308
is he still one of the seventeen peers of france   259.17136614350295
that s ingenious said athos   71.23591191507462
where are we going   4.553284267119551
why   130.94648653976932
you see sir he is really dead said the doctor   106.4920220845421
you were saying signora said albert who was paying the most implicit attention to the recital that the garrison of yanina fatigued with long service had treated with the seraskier15 kourchid who had been sent by the sultan to gain possession of the person of my father   125.80429361671509
faria has dreamed this   59.17410054882747
and that you should fail me   187.74804745018218
that is because your fancies go too far replied the triumphant bonacieux and i mistrust them   79.00039940758917
that was true   194.4210203282844
but instead of following the main street he turned behind the château reached a sort of retired lane and found himself soon in front of the pavilion named   106.18117410512816
then you will love me   102.54121138128305
but you are too intelligent not to know that according to a prejudice too firmly rooted to be exterminated a nobility which dates back five centuries is worth more than one that can only reckon twenty years   109.03844685639791
what could be his intentions towards him   20.247281656610284
gentlemen said athos a wager   145.08411008692968
and towards whom do you bear this personal ill feeling then   143.856610214683
who is that swiss   102.45180186931046
she would see him the next day and if she could not make him fail in his duties as a magistrate she would at least obtain all the indulgence he could allow   213.04934429855416
and to me too   135.5358661034785
exclaimed athos raising his right hand to heaven never   87.17047080841101
had he better deny everything or tell everything   165.27892173884246
said monte cristo   78.7853869561099
de boville the inspector of prisons to whom they are due   178.80690091571898
i wish to speak to you   190.3635616762742

the lions den chapter 108   68.97280781562043
no no be easy on that score   231.8151211830691
may i hope sir said madame de villefort that your intentions accord with my request   64.1826316583671
porthos opened his mouth to reply   74.88297474221619
she opened noirtier s door ran to a window in the passage and returned hastily   52.275510265801486
but it will break his heart   83.47061291078481

you are acquainted with the scriptures   149.83841716915572
all the bodily fatigue of the day all the preoccupation of mind which the events of the evening had brought on disappeared as they do at the first approach of sleep when we are still sufficiently conscious to be aware of the coming of slumber   26.582401096794825
i am temporarily commander of the pharaon with the certainty of being permanently so if that fool of a caderousse can be persuaded to hold his tongue   30.038617457520587
well   86.06399128419834
inquired the abbé   64.67166894060863
i would speak with your companions who are in the glade at rocca bianca   163.0219918370997
at a quarter past a merchant presented himself to insure two ships   90.72953509673415

i want capital to build my plans upon   144.31792536227576
and the youth dressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had failed to rob him of during the two months of fashionable life he had led in paris   218.63976801746878
the queen looked at him surprised   58.38790168053858
with regard to myself monsieur de rochefort replied mazarin i am not like monsieur de richelieu all powerful   134.65260201352183
and he returned to his companions   98.29653380498334
before felton replied and before she should be forced to resume this conversation so difficult to be sustained in the same exalted tone she let her hands fall   71.47687733112286
mme   125.85907905470333
i beg a thousand pardons said the count there is nothing the matter but i slipped down and broke one of your panes of glass with my elbow   44.44540737610609
no one answered   101.67709097520797
on seeing him d artagnan could hardly suppress an exclamation of surprise   146.69369926103548
well replied athos have you not heard what d artagnan said   189.2315324282074
by the bye he said i think that we are decidedly wrong to depart thus without leaving a line for porthos and d artagnan   147.15743471711775
goodnight   89.61465119285099
come my friends   79.82034837462635
at last after crossing the courts of the palais royal where there still remained some of the conveyances of late guests they entered the garden and reached the little gate   97.62897467618018
he would then have about 5 050 000 francs left   137.81190246021652
sketch me the plan of that floor as you have done of the ground floor my boy   189.25495273242245
it remains now for us to keep our word   36.15804376326679
it was situated in the via dei banchi near st   111.67222413817717
at these words the man with a pistol and sword raised his head but it was too late   95.51129079273167
you may one day be the captain of a vessel   105.68955349092425
ah indeed said d artagnan   97.35563904882463
f   41.38173448381612
at the first word milady turned looking at the young man with astonishment   99.24838319908362
then that s my thief replied d artagnan   163.2005787753253
if you arrive safely at home what have i to fear except from you   72.519620092745
then your duchess is still at the waters   125.80471550933925
ah yes that is another thing   96.92690047971018
he rose on the entrance of the coadjutor and at that moment ten o clock struck   167.72411465702928
finish the bottle and you will be completely so   126.51225389352933
ah   100.93066692220489
your servants to whom i gave directions the moment they had left the ferryboat ought to be already at the inn   67.80323529938747
but which mere copies as they were seemed to feel their degradation in being brought into juxtaposition with the gaudy colors that covered the ceiling   125.43045453441044
and do you like him   97.35928912693609
yes we will wait   212.75321844818055
which compels us here to give a public contradiction to the slanderers who pretend that we live under a government but moderately indulgent to men of letters   0.7670575888087541
anne gave a quick glance to mazarin who answered by an almost imperceptible shake of his head   194.1611096292396
inquired franz taking the letter from him   222.4602327673838
break his arm wound him but do not kill him   141.82137596990518
you have been here a very long time john said he   159.91217060406862
to porthos and aramis to accompany their friend whom they are not willing to abandon in such a painful condition   204.38741649443256
oh sir exclaimed m   41.72373063341773
then in addition to these concealed or public secret or open wars there were robbers mendicants huguenots wolves and scoundrels who made war upon everybody   224.57210014279136
if you could but persuade him to come out monsieur i should owe you the gratitude of my whole life   202.91375619732665
so throwing himself back in his armchair he said with an arrogant and purse proud air let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your wishes   200.0387634927871
well sire for once he found his master   135.09679361666252

i will   100.16080913113389
yes in your own way   99.49766128946497
every one therefore believed him to be dead especially those to whom his death would give promotion   75.85648113576514
exclaimed albert   102.60548412934968
athos smiled sadly for it was evident that he was thinking of other things as he listened to his friend and moved toward de winter   75.53872232633468
well then a happy and merry life to you   110.25819750841761
all this appears to be a little mysterious   100.45567192166695
well come   130.62210834684475
i have at length then intelligence of you   86.09138144394414

you will soon know what to expect for here he is   16.453207039179176
they advanced silently the count guiding franz as if he had the singular faculty of seeing in the dark   215.06783299902892
that is true said porthos and he spurred his courser on   122.38011806260964
well on the faith of a minister   178.42725265678718
andrea did more than tremble this time he turned pale   96.43803828826593
great people only thank you for doing the impossible   152.49845491161778
i did not even know that you were the person i was sent to fetch   88.76116320601258
he will guess at least   144.8121503369484
ah pardieu tréville   119.8296910613636
the richest turkey carpets covered the floor and the softest and most inviting couches easy chairs and sofas offered their high piled and yielding cushions to such as desired repose or refreshment   245.7604782832063
and every time he passed and repassed he heard a murmur of words which at length fixed his attention   145.82744968147708
milady de boulogne evening of the twenty fifth   177.18998298973224
very well   23.097247123274755

i will prove it to you beyond a doubt   182.64168186691296
but m   87.69346291974168
then you can quit your house leaving your jewels and giving up your jointure and everyone s mouth will be filled with praises of your disinterestedness   174.1003484914942
inquired the count   143.83813243074218
he even has in his pocket a letter from that person who attaches great importance to you as i have heard him say   135.89533136384264
indeed   136.8799186722759
it had a bitter taste   57.35757265433108
besides what is required of a young man in paris   81.53656515999549
said andrea who knew the delicate sense of hearing possessed by the walls   147.72560040381845
and sitting down villefort wrote the certificate at the bottom   169.7198111845171
albert gathered up his papers hastily rang the bell to pay the thirty francs he owed to the landlord and offering his arm to his mother they descended the stairs   213.0704158049677

i come to die in the arms of a friend   37.20750315769054
well my friend i bring you the means of becoming rich powerful and free to do whatever you wish   18.83566992306507
in fact said franz this horrible scene has passed away like a dream   161.5485921006144
said the magistrate without any introduction placing himself between his wife and the door   117.28847756183453
answer it   172.53632526942562
yes replied the young girl whose astonishment increased at every word uttered by luigi but of course your reply was only to please me   158.25157577549703
and what is the pay   52.6428442167729
this man named emery was the object of popular detestation in the first place because he was superintendent of finance and every superintendent of finance deserved to be hated   224.21360980059404
replied danglars   92.21339225959215

if the thing were to do again i would again do it   85.31442231987046
see what is going on monsieur d artagnan said he   64.44085710424616
you were in the south of france i think   110.7112024119947
he muttered whence comes this thought   23.132648253490416
take courage said grimaud   113.82868035576215
said the wounded man collecting all his forces as if to get up let us not lose time in useless words   54.218407355154525
we are not come here sir to exchange hypocritical expressions of politeness or false professions of friendship said albert but to demand an explanation   159.91880156237488
my mother tried to force the door that she might go and die with him but it was fastened on the inside   44.01647944210079
my safety is now a mere question of speed   179.4300543707127

monsieur i replied it is not for myself that i entreat your interference i should grieve for him or avenge him but my poor brother had a wife and were anything to happen to me the poor creature would perish from want for my brother s pay alone kept her   142.7733032077285
ah said the count that is a most conjugal reservation   120.43436030746027
that he had come at about ten o clock in the evening to pay a visit to his friend m   137.11986175907842
true said d artagnan   176.90092002310843
in that case said bazin he must be pretty sick   113.8325178204148
d artagnan had already strode down three or four stairs but at athos s last remark he stopped short   162.73557286291492
sinbad started and looked fixedly at him as he replied what makes you suppose so   149.66944923994362
the two guardsmen courteously accepted d artagnan s excuses and perceiving that the four friends desired to be alone retired   130.9944540603696
so i went to danglars who would not even receive me   31.403447033735674
20261m monte cristo glanced rapidly at albert as if to seek a hidden meaning in his words but it was evident the young man uttered them in the simplicity of his heart   119.03267314334612
the pharaon sir they signal the pharaon   146.49361786317198
asked the abbé   86.96696867289724
well   113.51217055723073
cried a voice whose mournful accents reaching the four friends seemed to proceed from some phantom of the ocean   1.612729254978177
d épinay should be called tomorrow to sign the contract then you have my promise maximilian   69.36169161577516
i sold them to visitors who considered them great curiosities   180.01415934911174
asked the young girl   117.35760309974154
i understand that but i do not understand what it is that galvanizes you in this manner   72.62841685181209
everything is ready is it not   52.06195013454051
because your strength is not in your head porthos said his friend   124.01345227791364
let us come to some conclusion   45.41680969707342
unable to rest he was among the first to quit the table and as though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such deafening sounds he continued in utter silence to pace the farther end of the salon   125.17466963615936
you are in a shocking hurry to be off you forget one of my guests   23.020868702378593
a woman s letter monseigneur   145.0462193762445
as he was accustomed to do in all cases of any consequence d artagnan went straight to the residence of athos   276.3840288072348
that s not bad   46.02562700734602
if i may ask without indiscretion   153.2660855691507
yesterday at saint germain as he came out from the presence of the queen   162.47633968668097
yes   123.28859905606922
sir what gratitude i feel   179.60006334680793
oh those figures how well i remember them   4.358585724462571
on arriving at the extremity of the castle d artagnan found himself overlooking a beautiful valley in which at the foot of a charming little lake stood several scattered houses which humble in their aspect and covered some with tiles others with thatch seemed to acknowledge as their sovereign lord a pretty chateau built about the beginning of the reign of henry iv   31.369320611308552
then athos took from his pocket a small paper on which two lines were written accompanied by a signature and a seal and presented them to him who had made too prematurely these signs of repugnance   104.25866295935225
water   116.95982363469848
the coadjutor is at this moment one of the seven kings of paris and has a court   111.85915170292381
yes on the contrary they met and it was the viscount himself who conducted him to the bed of the dying man   141.5813960753071
de villefort   128.36443129495123
never see you again   127.13283933253787
it was time   139.52623518159857
and did monsieur d artagnan come off the conqueror   128.74955041157438
good   161.27987944643974
if you had been contented with drinking well and good   57.31956149189526
what matters really not only to me but to officers of justice and the king is that an innocent man should languish in prison the victim of an infamous denunciation to die here cursing his executioners   132.31449013199799
that may bring me bad luck   144.04004555920264
it is miraculous   183.16984852543172
that is true said mordaunt and they will be far from thinking of you   84.15751256104264
yet you have unquestionably some ambition   186.89834631057147
happy   150.1809293213867
take one of the carriage lamps bertuccio said the count and show me the apartments   208.45781472614112
you call yourself in paris the count of monte cristo   192.85332323631295
yes have you a plan   69.64296136453366
i know him   72.70351680471265
think you it was the poor servant s life was coveted   90.97575258094177
but now it is different   158.30693390291538
then draw down your hat sire that he may not discover the substitution   180.83359854263617
my faith   224.69223810121804
he jumped out of bed and ran to the window   53.16913051900657
but we want something else replied the gascon   207.3185068744589
attracted by his prepossessing appearance he renewed his offers of an engagement to dantès   192.01644967965262
he rode on convinced that in this direction he would gain intelligence of the fugitive   105.08169819947479
madame he replied monsieur d artagnan s prediction has been accomplished   18.306738931673422
and what will you do in that case   56.63280627398986
and here is the second   118.11775701027526
it is my brother setting off again   87.34017537500857
but you who must know that i am not listen to me and believe me so afterwards if you will   119.52818531689164
devil take these puritans said mazarin aside   120.37657436671026
suddenly a man sprang out of the english ranks fell upon athos twined arms of steel around him and tearing his sword from him said in his ear silence   106.60011868054853
at that moment buckingham was throwing upon a couch a rich toilet robe worked with gold in order to put on a blue velvet doublet embroidered with pearls   88.7934349978497
monsieur said athos placing his hand on d artagnan s shoulder monsieur is the chevalier d artagnan of whom you have often heard me speak raoul   83.38604172726372
the floor of the abbé s cell was paved and it had been by raising one of the stones in the most obscure corner that faria had been able to commence the laborious task of which dantès had witnessed the completion   113.250318068753
he has simply a mahogany secretaire in which the key is always kept   190.90178727533902
perhaps you never before noticed him   110.42355656126713
why did he detain her   100.34891639482996
in case of a check mazarin made a slight movement one must foresee everything   121.72205246461273
meanwhile said felton convey me to the little bay of   80.74595880515432
that he is far from being or rather having been so guilty toward you as he appears   146.99825540088884
the cardinal smiled   123.68114919391627
i feel quite sure of it now   78.30306731408069
there he said is our road   39.673356906618295
see count she said with a smile so sad in its expression that one could almost detect the tears on her eyelids see our french grapes are not to be compared i know with yours of sicily and cyprus but you will make allowance for our northern sun   69.59479572030256
that s all   116.49310949191407
you shall pay me for all this cried the exasperated host   48.710841455225676
holloa   70.18100004577357
oh it was a touching superstition monsieur and although i did not myself believe it i would not for the world have destroyed my father s faith   147.69706733003065
the dark locks of this estimable friend of the defunct cardinal richelieu were now white   137.3580786758463
de villefort said louis xviii   128.77204227967758
for she would have served as the sport of the whole band   112.20517916657468
baptistin   71.39924100337782
danglars brightened up on beholding it fancying that it gave some promise of safety   169.79951746518776
aramis burst into a fit of laughter   115.50172738951318
your majesty is bored   124.13117812838213
send me five hundred pistoles and four or five days after i have received them i shall be in paris   85.01616676496906
said d artagnan   158.54485895479385
the young princess opened the door and raoul appeared on the threshold   147.1063918566423
one of your ancestors had joined the crusades and supposing it to be only that of st   87.4291062085629
said beauchamp   54.17882166722808
m   171.45474058983635
when he believed that the right moment had arrived he took the knife pried open the teeth which offered less resistance than before counted one after the other twelve drops and watched   160.1141783912072
i approached and recognized that little kitty whom our friend aramis had placed with her   57.31359861646891
however he obeyed and leaning out of the window he cried to the coachman rue de la fontaine no   50.621834952440636
the parisians always curious always affected by funereal display looked on with religious silence while the splendid procession accompanied to their last abode two of the number of the old aristocracy the greatest protectors of commerce and sincere devotees to their principles   218.5178753371044
from that moment we had no rest till we could find some trace in contemporary works of these extraordinary names which had so strongly awakened our curiosity   161.91438296017168
five or six millions is it not   89.12903566717384
hold your tongue porthos said athos   32.20958598124557
de tréville the counsels being thrown into the bargain   33.4005308416082
nothing is easier than to begin with fair promises and assurances of nothing to fear   69.3750391918262
such was the man whose carriage had just now stopped before the count of monte cristo s door   122.11677016034047
repeated a third voice   29.65738318874405
but i know neither the street nor the number   100.16603761216128
be calm exclaimed athos for heaven s sake   164.62954699673247
and when madame danglars recovered from her half fainting condition she could almost believe that she had had a disagreeable dream   117.55643764924562
cromwell s house   139.287772129765
this tranquillity proved one thing that d artagnan did not yet know milady   150.9732602124767
franz continued the president then sought to make him speak more explicitly but m   73.8705388761188
she believes in dreams   90.21903231538788
my dear blacas said the king you with your alarms prevent me from working   88.93721769231388
in short it was you who have but now in this chamber seated in this chair i now fill made an engagement with cardinal richelieu to cause the duke of buckingham to be assassinated in exchange for the promise he has made you to allow you to assassinate d artagnan   149.95186986753652
athos now descended the ladder in his turn without losing sight of the young man   143.81761405477008
they carried him through an alley up a flight of stairs and deposited him in an antechamber   167.83233420623333
not to arouse suspicions gentlemen said he go your way and i will go mine and this evening at nine o clock we will assemble again at the gate saint denis   112.51105491687194
and i said porthos   82.87042285410651
chance caused that man to be myself   115.39828450779558
and is it not that he may never do us any harm   134.8483347868472
the memory of richelieu annihilates me   135.0190947267376
asked the coadjutor   129.96967126961047
after a brief silence rendered still more solemn by the time and place the count said in a tone of melancholy wholly unlike his usual manner in order to bring this conversation to a fitting termination the last we shall ever hold upon this subject i will repeat to you some words i have heard from the lips of the abbé busoni   137.04048037997444
i have two friends who in this way never depart from me   201.25535507092525
and he kissed the letter with passion without even vouchsafing a look at the gold which sparkled on the table   234.72878295331464
to be obliging and polite does not necessarily make a man a coward   32.032552207528184
d artagnan smiled   41.171548435797206
oh yes   138.34963291037593
in order to meet the payments then due   213.1052546753691
carmela was attired like a woman of sonnino   176.66114583883555
all i ask is that villefort will be firm and inflexible for the future in his political principles   92.21050834636523
come then my lord said the queen with the painful doubt that is felt by those who have suffered much   156.39819244072092
chapter xix   60.29175926759527
you must excuse us count returned franz but we have still much to do   93.73762103474726
i have known a man much more unfortunate than you morrel   203.0717755440728
in one fashion or another you have a terrible enemy on your hands   167.38617908495772
but of yours it may be said i hope every dream is an illusion   201.7342571855866
the pickaxe descended or rather fell   42.84714794638437
pale and trembling milady repulsed d artagnan s attempted embrace by a violent blow on the chest as she sprang out of bed   152.1062245218692
after the soup the maid brought a boiled fowl a piece of magnificence which caused the eyes of the diners to dilate in such a manner that they seemed ready to burst   143.55598698397674
you unraveled it yesterday to the great satisfaction of all   75.32208462611871
they are like a great child who only wants humoring   78.16569913918626
your comrade   132.37221508406702
his insolent bravery his still more insolent success at a time when blows poured down like hail had borne him to the top of that difficult ladder called court favor which he had climbed four steps at a time   106.3441749720053
he asked what they were for and was told that they were to shade him from the sun on some future day   178.44471474510465
in the long run a man knows more about politics than a woman particularly such as like you monsieur bonacieux have conversed with the cardinal   218.9543964408669
i have imparted it to no one but my god and that in my prayers   146.83129339434242
one of the two who was standing up was of gigantic size and was driving a pick with all his might into the wall whilst the other kneeling beside him was collecting the pieces of stone   119.85433336206945
for pity s sake   125.0114811956653
and the night or two before his death as i have already said he left his purse on the mantelpiece with which they paid the old man s debts and buried him decently   98.36361900888008
this sort of attack is very frightful to witness   78.08022793237986
and yet said porthos   101.20536275320279
i did guess it replied the major with the greatest possible coolness   69.864293447274
a prisoner at vincennes   32.078786982083415
i owe you the proofs and explanations of what i have said   125.07562847810982
i am fond of grass and shade said monte cristo   32.748536179181954
then said milady since you are as generous as you are loving she stopped   229.0378360941304
i do not know my lord   111.44428540443187
now if i entreat if i order you to live morrel it is in the conviction that one day you will thank me for having preserved your life   74.51759905605451
e   38.31243441528896
valentine will you permit me to make a confidant of a friend and reveal to him the love i bear you   83.28686172480509
caderousse said monte cristo   103.60600363719107
proper names are not in the dictionary   111.03302926758246
athos would have died rather than appeal for help   134.70836391676093
this was indeed a horrid event said he in a hoarse voice   225.4292004120802
she goes into england said athos   115.10431354044684
for the fastest sailor in the mediterranean would have been unable to overtake the little tartan that with every stitch of canvas set was flying before the wind to leghorn   227.12571444761042
and mazarin in requesting the archbishop of paris to make his nephew preach had evidently had the intention of administering to monsieur de retz one of those italian kicks he so much enjoyed giving   105.1354647459606
the idea was welcomed by the prince to whom it was of little importance whom he married so long as he married some one   77.12303859388769
well said aramis beaten by fate   161.38233303508144
he drew his sword entirely from the scabbard and followed him crying turn turn master joker lest i strike you behind   5.881627746129553
you sir know how necessary subordination is in any large establishment of servants   42.65611562943336
he was a great man   178.30580134404346
the carriage had started madame de chevreuse had made a parting gesture to the young man and raoul had returned in a state of stupefaction   155.51645776244698
you are in prison then   161.76378509206123
ah you know that already said the private secretary smiling and shaking hands with him   200.60329744571357
do not speak to me of that said monte cristo with the first movement of anger he had betrayed   114.56382744231439
the shutter where eugénie had rapped was that of a little laundress who had been previously warned and was not yet gone to bed   27.32594377623529
down with mazarin   118.61897435157665
your honor   167.81168532346123
there remained in the banker s house only danglars closeted in his study and making his statement to the officer of gendarmes   127.19215518325792
no sir they were carried off instantly and had not even time to tell me why   78.56917907363456
if monseigneur will have the goodness to tell me in the first place what crimes are imputed to me i will then tell him the deeds i have really done   140.63683238538803
de boville and on the 30th the 32 500 francs of bills for which as well as the debt due to the inspector of prisons he had time granted he must be a ruined man   131.10674484743703
when the hour for his jailer s visit arrived dantès straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could and placed it in its accustomed place   100.26875246215778
the blood mounted rapidly to the cheeks of valentine for the name just announced by the count dispelled all the fear with which his presence had inspired her   110.72800894323156
danglars seeing his daughter smiling and proud even to insolence could not entirely repress his brutal feelings but they betrayed themselves only by an exclamation   196.24240720270848
chapter lxiii   172.8262955074947
but felton in his turn embraced her more closely imploring her like a divinity   206.42366819129103
the first act of franz was to summon his landlord who presented himself with his accustomed obsequiousness   61.368635182040606
wait quietly then   127.31982895940547
we here present the letter verbatim to his eminence monseigneur le cardinal mazarini i have wished monseigneur to learn your intentions relating to the existing state of affairs in england   41.12934014774547

de blacas pondered deeply between the confident monarch and the truthful minister   165.63840456340668

thus the greater number of a man s errors come before him disguised under the specious form of necessity   18.617157099502435
and that is situated   225.23735702038846
it is as i have said maximilian there is no one in the world of whom i can ask help but yourself and my grandfather who is little better than a corpse no support to cling to but my mother in heaven   77.88009794723949
and is he still in love with the catalane   202.2942609354413

doctor do you hear them call for help   203.26824472099895
the two cavalcanti opened their enormous eyes but had the good sense not to say anything   172.81904693715063
tis only because monsieur de la fere has spoken of friendship that i question your conduct   49.307201362351634
it was therefore necessary before everything else and at all risks that i should cause all traces of the past to disappear that i should destroy every material vestige   80.42308818769729
the nephew replied no   129.73188720245415
ah   146.55834667438774
this prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests to such a degree that the elder dantès who at the commencement of the repast had commented upon the silence that prevailed now found it difficult amid the general din of voices to obtain a moment s tranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the bride and bridegroom   147.41674288247017
i will make him suffer   177.96349185028805
but on the eve of my departure a vessel which i shall see depart will take you hence and convey you to our colonies in the south   137.46322270687045
at this almost brutal speech morrel turned deathly pale   96.86951176133016
ah perbacco indispensable were they   97.31759213978182
i think i understand his reason said morrel   257.1159586410575
d artagnan smiled   102.68279058737085

and bring your bottle of smelling salts with you   112.03632446402972
but she would not spare him a single pang   180.97495253377332
on the other hand the symptoms may be much more violent and cause me to fall into fearful convulsions foam at the mouth and cry out loudly   220.93728963463917
who could have thought it   73.62243789972248

lord wilmore   105.12132582029031

valentine now requires only the ministrations of the priest   210.9005980376236

noirtier let his head fall upon his chest apparently overwhelmed and thoughtful   80.58722011027103
what company   176.08674524207782
there was only one person among the crew who had any feeling of ill will towards me   155.27717525005323
and an inquest in my house impossible   126.14238986648881
but these two friends are not yet come at which i am astonished as it is not at all their custom   192.65743553948096
said d artagnan   101.90870741170737
and of what woman are you speaking thus   163.1035386657919
yes   132.48655808761097

hush cried valentine suddenly   83.95869822210675
instead of being astonished let me dress myself   61.29784187615997
then according to foreign custom the presentations took place   76.38264026833791
a second afterwards monte cristo appeared on the threshold   40.291601077827124
this is fortunate said the guide   90.30761283777082

bonacieux lamentations to which besides they must have been pretty well accustomed the two guards took the prisoner each by an arm and led him away while the commissary wrote a letter in haste and dispatched it by an officer in waiting   142.97878813100982

you yourself gave me this comb   125.3602165992548
she allowed therefore half an hour to pass away   96.65139594973112
d artagnan himself was frightened by the change in her countenance   161.55125281172084
but d artagnan had now slipped through the window   122.68052307139429
these rochellais are bungling fellows said athos   143.02139239392358

said aramis   58.495702387756175
haydée s only reply was to direct her servant by a sign to withdraw the tapestried curtain that hung before the door of her boudoir the framework of the opening thus made serving as a sort of border to the graceful tableau presented by the young girl s picturesque attitude and appearance   156.33000813055497

yes true as gospel said d artagnan   56.24222813267704
we frequently pass so near to happiness without seeing without regarding it or if we do see and regard it yet without recognizing it   100.37335479712387
ere long a carriage will dash past here drawn by the pair of dappled gray horses you saw me with yesterday   87.19895049413248
his son madame must be since the husband of the son s mother is   70.61554943614644

thou art no longer a choir boy nor a tavern boy   238.75982063174337
then when the sound was quite extinct he breathed like a man awaking from a dream and rushed out of the apartment   93.61665176459915
it is the devil in person   270.391857605347
and as napoleon has scarcely been reinstated a fortnight the letters have not yet been forwarded   84.88118462843443
cavalcanti the company of mademoiselle louise d armilly her singing teacher   95.67601734395336

after dinner the play   172.06254988045285
notwithstanding that assurance morrel still hesitated   34.48206565800571
40298m yes indeed sir continued eugénie still quite calm   85.28383094349819
pray d artagnan said athos after a minute either take off that ring or turn the mounting inside   181.150408793678

then he must be playing in the garden   30.783513558398482
he inhaled the tones of that young voice as harmonious music   108.43704277277683
at this moment raoul awoke without a cloud on his face without weariness or lassitude   99.74373440068953
the young man directed him   162.75890942067602
said the president   120.77532371102558
buckingham at once remembered the circumstance and suspecting that something was going on in france of which it was necessary he should be informed he only took the time to inquire where the messenger was and recognizing from afar the uniform of the guards he put his horse into a gallop and rode straight up to d artagnan   68.0441290378944
really   179.33089286676773
in this case milady would cross the garden and gain the village on foot   244.80189511352665
may the devil annihilate me if i return thy wish   35.81492005723088
at the same instant a market cart which some minutes before had appeared upon the amiens road pulled up at the inn and planchet and grimaud came out of it with the saddles on their heads   42.66632735009604
inquired franz after the countess had a second time directed her lorgnette at the box what do you think of our opposite neighbor   131.0220966473651
but her majesty has no property interposed aramis   135.15502518507898
of what consequence to me is imprisonment or death   32.916578717426674
de tréville s tone of voice that he was very angry about something   126.74618847569761
d artagnan was in a dolorous situation which he had not foreseen   190.60192188536274
that s not needed   123.78077992203477
i ask nothing better   163.48326086915478
it is he   81.17305971362967
albert would not do us the honor to be jealous   199.79733261736357
monseigneur said marshal de grammont with a radiant face will your highness permit my son count de guiche and his traveling companion viscount de bragelonne to come in and give news of the enemy whom they have found while we were looking for him   67.67763491617904
i only beg leave to observe to monsieur that the night will be very cold that chills bring on rheumatism and that a lackey who has the rheumatism makes but a poor servant particularly to a master as active as monsieur   57.31797348959857
supposing the assertion to be really true   106.71298170816732
that s the man   37.20759190089207
all the day all the next night passed away without my seeing him again   30.106100516994147
it is dangerous to go to war with a nation   33.07306632901154
it is worth something you see to have been brought up somewhere   125.83885090171458
there was an instant of profound silence between the two interlocutors   45.88949741044752
how could this ring come into the hands of milady clarik   137.71521503808367
have i deceived myself   71.89764428039393
and as without knowing the cause he knew the great desire and even imperative need which his friends had of returning to paris it goes without saying that he fixed upon them to form part of the escort   147.37051916425156
but nevertheless here are two by hobbema a paul potter a mieris two by gerard douw a raphael a van dyck a zurbaran and two or three by murillo worth looking at   60.01686210023262
the words died away the steps were lost in the distance   195.46547624189276
the four millions i promise you will produce ten or twelve   66.91393404866557
the vanquished must not be dainty in the choice of means   20.554380980747325
ah my faith yes   69.14433567092706
those who like us have never had a thought for which we need blush before the world such may read each other s hearts   213.13478224024476
valentine perceived him without betraying the least surprise   20.03101988053146
ah   83.31464695242784
you might excite a little curiosity but it is not everyone who likes to be made the centre of observation and the subject of unpleasant remark   58.63370408523381
your arrival here without waiting my visit at your house today looks well sir said albert   152.11677305980717
we have no litmus paper but see here they come with the syrup of violets   154.62427199316664
he was dressed in plain clothes and wore at his button hole the ribbons of the different orders to which he belonged   93.49140152046336
cried aramis you set me thinking   189.60699550986692
your wounds are mortal   228.84938791984206
if mousqueton were with us observed athos on reaching the spot where they had had a dispute with the paviers how he would tremble at passing this   73.80970385678454
then you disapprove of duelling   88.15154537648667
he had frequently called for capital punishment on criminals and owing to his irresistible eloquence they had been condemned and yet the slightest shadow of remorse had never clouded villefort s brow because they were guilty   124.88417456928353
said athos   142.38153530636023
his singular host evidently resided at rome   142.6581531241405
i will however inform monsieur d artagnan of your arrival here   177.09188936294865
and pointed out to him that by the help of a sharp instrument he could trace the letters on a slate and thus learn to write   203.43016241302035
because in 1807 i dreamed of the very plan napoleon tried to realize in 1811   187.57283924416816
40286m yes i need your help that is i thought like a madman that you could lend me your assistance in a case where god alone can succor me   132.46628915530948
i am of aramis s opinion said porthos   81.41200337204904
he gave his horse its head struck his spurs into its sides and the animal urged by pain and feeling that he had space open before him bounded over a kind of paling which inclosed the landing place and fell into the river scattering to a distance waves of white froth   150.7833988143828
they then embraced each other like two brothers and each wrapping himself in his cloak they soon passed into that kindly sleep of youth which is the prerogative of birds flowers and infants   121.25018979684532
we took good care not to do that   132.24841558318883
but having stopped to drink at a cabaret they had missed the carriage by ten minutes   156.74640689231677
why do you not seek revenge   114.33201447356144
and as i am not a millionaire like the gentleman in the next apartments said franz i warn you that as i have been four times before at rome i know the prices of all the carriages   201.35264238721572
oh   253.19123745718053
i followed him this evening to the opera and concealed in a parquet box have seen all   132.15730137891927
the one with a white dress and so many diamonds the fair one   151.2531503668409
he is doubtless come to prove the perfect innocence of our colleague   161.06411586984882
inquired aramis   174.35141285384952
go young men   176.1010188027875
and sir continued the wounded man i suffer much and would like if possible to be carried to some house   119.63539273414594
i am not precisely rich though i am pretty well off   76.12956340097776
do you know the writing   49.00976325332567
listen   62.34008913496841
i thought i did replied athos   96.04946880399257
yes   45.95344774252608
planchet my friend interrupted d artagnan you are really a precious fellow   113.86377630400315
you are right   99.79760077989279
this menace smothered the young man s passion   74.01827926797455
to smooth the yellow wrinkled brow of the old procurator   111.2094001610905
but if he does not come   110.03503070723673
the chief took the paper unfolded it and raising his hand heaven be praised and his holiness also said he in a loud voice   117.88056086779937
certainly madame said porthos winking to himself as a gambler does who laughs at the dupe he is about to pluck   68.22362520177347
to you no to you alone   140.72681874983186
olivain advanced retired then made his horse rear turned it and then struck to the core by shame leaped as raoul had done only repeating i am a dead man   62.31249099812236
shall you see him on your return monsieur count   149.5966320586835
and if the fronde knows that monseigneur has disappeared how the fronde must triumph   125.78971605938995
you are right athos said d artagnan   149.24849894947363
what is that   17.56929949070758
but those men you speak of said mazarin smiling inwardly on seeing rochefort approach the point to which he was leading him those men were not devoted to the cardinal for they contended against him   41.67983011379971
you have done well to warn me   215.1181066640653
perhaps i shall stand in need of a back door for retreat   109.81923095979255
besides when that note is delivered in all probability you will have no more to fear   67.08793832273234
it is very evident that it is the letter w which m   58.34127797605359
d artagnan placed in line with his company saluted with an expressive gesture his three friends whose eyes soon discovered him and m   130.32761326444168
but what is your own opinion albert   88.09520394923348
the illustrious planchet   48.204893521658434
the old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same expression   66.1055228816416
the cardinal s   76.95077032855438
oh no no i declare it is not   88.68691981076861
there is the prince de condé the hero of rocroy   142.98678141812098
no   114.69762854860045
die   130.26197849954664
and this king s attorney was named villefort   104.45337971942578
demanded monte cristo and what incomprehensible misfortune incomprehensible is the word   67.62205866099386
and yet it appears in spite of all your diligence you have arrived too late   126.10622734863504
i ve ten guards behind me don t you hear them gallop   115.38365294924476
replied raoul her fall is a very serious one and without any ostensible injury the physician fears she will be lame for life   85.45072086163087
is this secret your own   98.7675489535377
and as he bound her while saying these words milady uttered two or three savage cries which produced a strange and melancholy effect in flying away into the night and losing themselves in the depths of the woods   4.474574032367713
d artagnan did reflect and resolved to thrash planchet provisionally   182.96880989875046
aramis does the same to porthos   198.31199764048074
and villefort felt that his glance was uneasy beneath his gold spectacles when he felt the arm of the baroness press upon his own   79.57672041095225
in case of any attempt to escape the penalty of death is to be applied   140.85545311623298
he sighed heavily   141.98497835600583
that is right said the old man   225.2388730430448
so i have become a gardener and consequently adopted the costume of my calling   169.67292541382486
and the party must be acquainted with english in order to ask the way to london   100.60611965323677
said athos putting a finger on his lips with the sad smile peculiar to him   95.42276290781464
he answered therefore i think monsieur le comte that you had something to communicate to me at your chateau of bragelonne and that gentleman he pointed to aramis had also something to tell me when i was in his convent   180.08390506139642
you are joking   110.39475217632953
you did well to defend the honor of a woman   43.893126689618896
on arriving in paris d artagnan found a letter from m   162.27605207386873
d artagnan quietly pushed him in again and by the light of a lamp on the staircase made him ascend the steps backward one by one keeping his eyes all the time on mordaunt s hands who however knowing that it was useless attempted no resistance   138.36955179628256
the baroness then thought of m   129.2390122880281
for you don t propose i imagine that i shall kill that man of the church   11.570531463449342
let the prisoner be brought in   110.87835825088112
the entire chamber was lined with crimson brocade worked with flowers of gold   39.52370305947146
planchet went out the curate remaining for a moment   165.92886356537028
villefort shuddered and looked at monte cristo as if he wished to read in his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he had just uttered   91.19289435171093
and you forget one thing   187.18475961524976
it is his voice   122.81311445951172
the sentinel at the gate refused even to let them pass and called his sergeant   91.00494297247485
prepare then for your departure and never despair of us   123.52229756644334
do you think it is to replace him on the throne that cromwell has paid for him two hundred thousand pounds sterling   24.60152417861613
bah   200.73745430108323
was he not a fine looking man   108.13638947499862
has he any friends   209.98255696311872

at length she murmured satisfied with herself come nothing is lost   188.13026646710017
to the waters of forges   84.12997379334399
but the circumstances by which we have become possessed of this wealth are so unexpected as to make us scarcely credit our good fortune and it is only by placing the actual proof of our riches before our eyes that we can persuade ourselves that the whole affair is not a dream   55.24031795297889
what a noise about a musketeer   207.76055235612205
as well as you do gentlemen   126.03634321204777
somebody is coming   168.2467106078538
milady remained thoughtful and undecided for a moment   80.04837791681312
her eyes were cast down and she was crying   110.03970146107024
honor to man this masterpiece of nature this king of the creation   142.04123847752174
how can i   122.53880570605916
it matters not   111.10966674762962
mme   95.29699915464408
they descended to the first floor   178.23029449697268
the arguments and his audacity perfectly stupefied me   49.371145853525235
this is the point of departure   101.00847082866157
i do not think that such is his intention said morrel   122.29592462979036
the apartment of m   119.30995761501975
swords then   125.94638543492226
in the first one handy provided it is safe said the commissary with an indifference which penetrated poor bonacieux with horror   120.35419649771545
since when i wonder in the musketeers did they grant men leave of absence without their asking for it   81.2166277855318
cried d artagnan   100.92906007596179
and why   176.21375708848169
your excellency is mistaken   172.11786784995272
he turned to brush away a tear and then summoning up all his firmness drew his daughter toward him recommending her to be pious and resigned   117.63663091998451
this is something new replied the king   214.86040849607735
yes your eminence it is the same   69.99714474091931
after numberless windings dantès saw a door with an iron wicket   89.68255457163998
d artagnan set out with his four companions and followed the trench   0.7583812784723989
sinbad the sailor is your baptismal appellation and yet the first day you set foot in paris you instinctively display the greatest virtue or rather the chief defect of us eccentric parisians that is you assume the vices you have not and conceal the virtues you possess   52.976610367535315
yes   111.17133640634194
if we are so fortunate as to have some particular duty to perform for your eminence we are ready to obey you   93.5745677566043
explain yourself   61.21714824490197
shall i find you here then   82.60261061973321
cavalcanti   177.58342160096785
felton turned his eyes toward the part of the wall of the apartment before which he had found milady standing in the armchair in which she was now seated and over her head he perceived a gilt headed screw fixed in the wall for the purpose of hanging up clothes or weapons   46.616624423228984
d artagnan charged with a party of musketeers up the rue du coq and the portion of the mob he assailed disappeared like smoke dispersing near the place saint germain l auxerrois and taking the direction of the quays   91.95780318133689
but i see much that is very extraordinary in it replied d artagnan   188.2819476084959
so so replied porthos   232.8031750284842
in that boat sat three men unquestionably brave whose courage no man would have dared dispute   141.25712019725037
i will say do you think you are engaged with a pygmy like yourself   186.18924476588225
he has this moment returned   231.4879647085511
and at the first sound of the leader s bow across his violin franz observed the sleeper slowly arise and approach the greek girl who turned around to say a few words to him and then leaning forward again on the railing of her box she became as absorbed as before in what was going on   161.41380665015268
ah ah said the chief i now understand why carlini stayed behind   163.27295876804058
have you never had the curiosity when you have landed and found this island deserted to seek for this enchanted palace   11.120137915676466
while some asserted that they had seen him start for brussels   147.91818744672872
albert looked at franz like a man who hears a reply he does not understand   181.50932350885088
porthos come with me to the left   158.2152087666627
in life our greatest preoccupation is death   156.22113740587565
to the palais   173.37878290476874
no   57.510525949506516
someone will come   152.6019078734903
there s a fellow who will never desert me   34.99116852100805
allow me time just to kill this gentleman and i will return and finish the last couplet   232.56380099044316
richelieu thought d artagnan would have given me five hundred pistoles in advance   127.82578089512363
but milady started up pushing her away   211.53813624244037
and do you command nothing in your own name   109.68829552683816
i arrived an hour since   107.62048565160164
oh yes said château renaud   134.1060311163914
but he one day opened it before porthos and porthos was convinced that this coffer contained nothing but letters and papers love letters and family papers no doubt   129.03497325260747
now see here will that be all   6.4072236627614245
he even tried to make some verses on him but soon gave up the attempt for monsieur de beaufort had not only not received from heaven the gift of versifying he had the greatest difficulty in expressing himself in prose   183.58274824771834
if only for the sake of m   76.25619447382539
yes yes everything for him   154.16289382696792
nothing is impossible replied milady to true love   164.07191656766284
go along this corridor down a little staircase and you are in it   130.76782289140846
2 2 600 000 in 1894   88.9774150830061
in twenty minutes they were on the spot named   131.44771990924258
but he is betrothed to your daughter i believe   56.51333512802287
but you mademoiselle de villefort you who are necessary to m   20.088281543036516
said d artagnan   67.66353506772523
upon my word cried albert you must have been a very entertaining companion alone or all but alone with a beautiful woman in such a place of sentiment as the colosseum and yet to find nothing better to talk about than the dead   155.5851389988979
i saw him today for the first time and he can tell you on what occasion   111.80966123573621
then the young woman confided in him the terrible secret of which chance had already communicated to him a part in front of the samaritaine   78.80605946645984
but as if the multitude had waited only for this demonstration to burst out all the sentiments of hostility that possessed it exploded simultaneously   124.93754131313987
my lord said felton the baron de winter wrote to you the other day to request you to sign an order of embarkation relative to a young woman named charlotte backson   137.34299644114148

continued athos the poor abbé was not a st   167.7545047946231
i mustered all my strength to reply to him with a burst of laughter   126.28675947111466
the deuce   190.90587616321636
i have killed your chief cucumetto whose dress i now wear   53.69176633634341
what for   98.15906097938529
la ramee uttered a cry of horror and rushed toward the gibbet which he broke at once and threw the pieces out of the window   60.593940021688105
by no means   100.46436076324774
mazarin thought for an instant   187.48405767903313
such was the state of society in paris at the period we bring before our readers when monte cristo went one evening to pay m   25.708732009961167
asked monte cristo   122.25615964062168
besides on pressing occasions in extreme difficulties d artagnan would become the preserver of his friends   46.49891864470291
is it as good now   178.1788084391986
morrel descended and came forth to meet it followed by the soldiers and sailors there assembled to whom he had repeated the promise already given that dantès should be the successor to the late captain leclere   178.13209164367922
my father died but i did not die   179.91189346520162
then seeing that the room was as usual empty and only guarded by the dog he called to his wife hello carconte said he the worthy priest has not deceived us   72.85526191758558
i swear captain replied i   108.12579326495889
the hangings were of damask the carpets from alencon and the bed especially had more the look of a fine lady s couch with its trimmings of fine lace and its embroidered counterpane than that of a man who had made a vow that he would endeavor to gain heaven by fasting and mortification   136.58259209072705
the gascon is the devil   172.18442783102012
i love you as my life for you are the best the noblest of created beings   137.32217382023634
franz silently assented   179.41351402730166
in vain were i an ambitious man should i struggle against such remembrances as he has left   71.35704531595707
egad   205.11485698435146
they sat silent and dejected   160.3261135123935
yes   89.7911558133618
got what   178.09965222923694
he heard the door of the staircase creak on its hinges the clock gave its warning to strike eleven the door of his study opened   88.1075791708326
said aramis   115.33883460610139
mazarin uttered a cry and became paler than the man who had brought the news   148.68252591673325
replied the young man where are you   55.71779653150412
get as near to him as you can and cut off two   68.76694994124506
come guitant come along and let s see if they keep watch at the quinze vingts as at the barriere des sergens   87.2525998660511
my lord   151.9102477507493
anne of austria lowered her head allowed the torrent to flow on without replying hoping that it would cease of itself   194.85736771428867
thus spoke and acted the gallant knights of the time of charlemagne in whom every cavalier ought to seek his model   46.594867441455904
as the shadows of night deepened the troops summoned by the prince arrived in successive detachments   131.7503013815687
his secret then was in the past as had often been vaguely said to d artagnan   142.26797042544757
the island of monte cristo loomed large in the horizon   190.59565643408087
the foundation s ein or federal tax identification number is 64 6221541   150.48271341868417
1   70.79881509486064
and then moreover what could happen to him   126.68476912528068
come he said if i pay you the 100 000 francs will you be satisfied and allow me to eat at my ease   54.5288179868859
d artagnan took off his hat and could not be persuaded to make use of his cloak   156.51479412016792
the brand of england   88.47496324156437
and then you know he said an idea a supposition is sufficient   116.29388793103844
it was to run to meet me that she leaped from that pile of wood   64.05592758079197
no on my honor said maximilian   156.872962538519
what is that   186.97709691604555
i am older than your eminence although i possess not your wisdom   223.47082296026838
a thousand thanks for your kindness viscount returned the count of monte cristo but i suppose that m   16.561716746756872
i am glad to see said d artagnan that you have still that honest lad with you   60.230178444931504
indeed   148.42772264790094
they might be said to be of coral   61.71857509174025
he s ours muttered d artagnan   63.997640298147
coquenard did not seem to observe it   136.8090868271905
mordaunt had called on the bishop that very evening to apprise him of the religious desire expressed by the king and also of cromwell s permission   165.97603174960844
edward   204.04442583798988
chapter xli   119.56947648759555
but the bastille   134.54576734051614
informed of what had passed by the presence of the cardinal and the alteration in the king s countenance m   201.95771517380882
jacques de la boucherie   63.47734158778585
let it pass   27.650291393077723
in fact in crossing the city two or three accidents of this kind happened   119.23134377650267
d artagnan shrugged his shoulders and they proceeded   76.9599227557442
grimaud translated the question and groslow who was wiping the perspiration from off his forehead answered some full others empty   125.00634481588055
both   200.55618367671207
sire i thought his name was unknown to your majesty   174.49933753770105
continue and say what we must do now   94.54365969517323
certainly   187.0883360508031
she then added this young madcap is however very nearly right and merely re echoes what he has heard me say with pain a hundred times   67.39749877793872
de comminges went away d artagnan remaining apparently in the same attitude of humble resignation   120.32379286327733
i declare i feel quite ill after only being five minutes in the courtyard   156.5455548326028
why didn t you do it   112.53668800119787
no said athos   74.71099978887885
beyond that hedge that garden and that cottage a dark mist enveloped with its folds that immensity where paris slept a vast void from which glittered a few luminous points the funeral stars of that hell   82.19672905678885
don t try to appear anything but what you are a true country youth   93.03802311067393
to the captain he promised to write when he had made up his mind as to his future plans   164.4127992429026
have you been working all night   59.14221923704821
porthos took advantage of this circumstance to ogle the women   80.53338980460416
de morcerf   113.29890485142602
while mercédès glanced at the clock and made an expressive gesture to edmond   102.05011497302851
she revives   81.21194606831088
no false generosity count   153.97919709538235
to receive the cardinal   85.79645886072484
asked the abbé   36.80099117469021
four other noblemen awaited me   177.47404103059296
still further athos obtained of m   111.15195198397946
well ask your worthy jailer what favor i this instant solicited of him   59.79081268892747
yes my lord and from pure devotion to the cause for monsieur de bracieux is rich   194.94368360713872
if my mother could know of this attention on your part and i will venture to tell her i am sure that she will be most grateful to you   199.5133406374283
yes continued he a charming woman who entertained kind views toward our friend d artagnan who on his part has given her some offense for which she tried to revenge herself a month ago by having him killed by two musket shots a week ago by trying to poison him and yesterday by demanding his head of the cardinal   137.24951679674263
asked valentine   117.32635034191588
madame danglars looked at her husband with an expression which at any other time would have indicated a storm but for the second time she controlled herself   120.95993992933697
he is impatient   113.39853190955378
now listen to me and try to recall every circumstance attending your arrest   145.55416017520616
not one too many   84.85343928183431
it might cause him to fail in some desirable matrimonial alliance   137.53750547171845
nor i said madame danglars   175.42621501799232
that s true said kitty   82.28818984421773
where do you keep the poison you generally use madame   104.85974347697126
the side windows were hung with yellow damask and the centre one with white damask and a red cross   139.28760473668012
besides his intention was formed to make the brave musketeer all suitable apologies but without meanness or weakness fearing that might result from this duel which generally results from an affair of this kind when a young and vigorous man fights with an adversary who is wounded and weakened if conquered he doubles the triumph of his antagonist   134.92797080527183
caderousse remained for a moment aghast under the weight of such an idea   117.50046833849053
what is that   103.98346737803189
we have circumvented cromwell mordaunt and the sea but we shall find a certain difficulty in circumventing mazarin   94.80978652748144
and they set out at as hard a canter as their horses could maintain   62.12363066600496
milady shuddered through her whole system   160.73132687296655
albert at this moment ran in   26.46845988518831
her legs failed her and she sank into an armchair   128.29342989476012
madame de villefort has nothing of her own and hates me for being so richly endowed   128.8788637879161
it was mousqueton who was obeying his master s command   79.31626331637445
athos then took him by the hand and led him into the drawing room where there were several people   122.96986505005393
well said renée i can not help regretting you had not chosen some other profession than your own a physician for instance   69.97334781644948
suppose we ask these englishmen to sell us a bottle said the honest blaisois   124.33013294773387
at this instant they heard the sound of horses feet   119.59159619245703

albert listened trembling now with hope then with anger and then again with shame for from beauchamp s confidence he knew his father was guilty and he asked himself how since he was guilty he could prove his innocence   218.85949969992652
he leaped from his charger placed his back against the shaft of the carriage making a rampart of his horse drew his pistols from their holsters and fastened them to his belt and began to fight with the back sword like a man accustomed to the handling of his weapon   198.46934884548165
oh   134.00750026741213

before him was the vast expanse of waters sombre and terrible whose waves foamed and roared as if before the approach of a storm   139.96871365175355
the old man made him understand with his eyes that he could not answer   88.77267397415987
replied the stranger knitting his brow   197.6976699096283
and as though he feared that the walls of the accursed house would crumble around him he rushed into the street for the first time doubting whether he had the right to do as he had done   192.73674452237145
she grew pale and ran to the window while mme   214.45688790103503

a bell resounded   57.40070949136877
he would fain have continued but his knees trembled and his heart beat so violently and his sight became so dim that he was forced to pause   53.47404481421885
he took his key and candle and went upstairs to his bedroom   92.16611999344155
i will facilitate it by repeating the question will you or will you not retract   136.63439877008074

signor pastrini who had been accustomed to see them dine together inquired into the cause of his absence but franz merely replied that albert had received on the previous evening an invitation which he had accepted   140.56298088158053
the house which was discernible through the trees remained in darkness and gave no indication that so important an event as the signature of a marriage contract was going on   114.35381664558544

sire replied m   66.14692296860153
by dint of constantly dwelling on the idea that tranquillity was death and if punishment were the end in view other tortures than death must be invented he began to reflect on suicide   134.16184656655605

emmanuel adieu   47.85607245280258
to wait replied athos   224.332361085402
porthos went to the window took a bar in his hands clung to it and bent it like a bow   114.64943540377372
then noticing in the dim light the still youthful and veiled figure of madame de morcerf pardon me he added with a smile i leave you albert   108.70444313810647
there were seven minutes left that was all   138.01371328715507
you will then be convinced that the resources of the house of danglars however limited are still equal to meeting the largest demands   178.22902435571405
returned rochefort   52.455976969139655
what still keeping up this silly jest   87.87450403942881
you have no idea my friend how my bones ache since i came here   120.8287389347299
eagerly asked madame de chevreuse   166.09006609493713
only he was very pale and trembled slightly   143.05819333194455
three months passed and still she wept no news of edmond no news of fernand no companionship save that of an old man who was dying with despair   167.3232384444399
dame that s a long job monsieur   4.752023841967713
i have not lost my time   134.57395847821914
just assume the tone and manner of a husband and see how she will remind you that your hour is not yet come   88.09064600830376
d artagnan when he gave way to his own feelings which were in accordance with those of the queen had accomplished more than the most astute diplomacy could have attempted   13.003475054022033
a murder   94.23929490383482
how did you leave the count   79.66665561915207
yes let us search paris and especially inquire of planchet if he has yet heard from his former master   178.0458083786317
at that moment the steward came in to consult his master upon the proceedings of the next day and also with regard to the shooting party which had been proposed   188.95817562592055
oh i inquired after him for the purpose of hanging him likewise   9.932390846447973
and the third that it yet wants ten minutes before the lapse of the hour   30.783738881256156
now let us go   114.78007580512461
i must seem to you by no means curious but i assure you that it is not my fault i have delayed it so long it will happen one day or the other   131.3990889006871
albert felt his heart bursting at these particulars but gratitude mingled with his sorrow he would gladly have embraced those who had given his father this proof of esteem at a moment when his honor was so powerfully attacked   46.78034798457739
in the name of the queen i forbid you to throw yourself into any peril which is foreign to that of your journey   183.52013043531315
athos pinched aramis s hand   112.97971363620603
well i am convinced they are all charming women   93.53359004374968
and if he is so unfortunate as to lose our dear athos from that very day he becomes my son   135.37783827890715
what do you mean blockhead   69.90939753964537
with the first rays of day their tongues were loosened   185.48874590458817
as i noticed the significant manner in which the whole party pointed to my blood stained garments i involuntarily surveyed myself and then i discovered that the thick warm drops that had so bedewed me as i lay beneath the staircase must have been the blood of la carconte   172.4881057964879
m   133.86633813213004
and this d artagnan felt no doubt was the habitation of the worthy beadle   86.1023425267033
if your daughter had committed only one crime and i saw her meditating another i would say warn her punish her let her pass the remainder of her life in a convent weeping and praying   62.073006305172406
but what can they intend to do with the poor creature and how shall i ever meet her again   143.91723089022116
i neither ill use nor ill treat my servants by word or action   115.91817313982173
it was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber for without it he would have been unable perhaps to reach the vessel certainly to return to shore should he be unsuccessful in attracting attention   175.6369977208329
but you may use it replied lord wilmore   26.92469498993971
noirtier looked at the door where the servant had gone out   127.36340182792993
d artagnan and porthos moved so as to plant themselves between the person entering and the cardinal   179.30827520539927
cried anne of austria this is more than i can bear   65.39276735252292
said d artagnan to porthos   270.41464284429946
i had provided myself with a dark lantern   133.78897908630242
planchet   221.17558548241078
in the most german and the least gascon accent possible   157.17102404271026
pardieu   117.45240340019927
morrel had no particular reason for uneasiness   94.22713652639739
moreover d artagnan had delivered her from the hands of the demons who wished to search and ill treat her   103.85423538293381
cried mazarin fearing that should his prisoner ever leave his prison he would be the more exasperated against him if he thus retrenched his amusement   88.74978184981259
provided i understand your perfidy sir and succeed in making you understand that i will be revenged i shall be reasonable enough said albert furiously   110.96674772224961
when in the middle of the room the general was invited to remove his bandage he did so immediately and was surprised to see so many well known faces in a society of whose existence he had till then been ignorant   68.28458524759401
but it wore the same wild barren aspect when seen by the rays of the morning sun which it had done when surveyed by the fading glimmer of eve   73.95305472115908
oh my mother it was you who said you were free you had a beloved father you were destined to be almost a queen   98.58491415215033
on saturday at six o clock   125.38630979815231
this sight reassured him   68.54536142883357
if there is an army on board it is not here that it is hidden   102.64412259318074

on your honor   59.17502634031074
i have nothing to do with these things why hold me responsible   91.6511042890114
the proverb was but too correct as regarded benedetto and even in his infancy he manifested the worst disposition   262.7812169915354
be easy i am a gentleman   135.87082683227126
said mazarin who was anxious to make a friend about cromwell s person   95.65092707034265
there they are   95.48034176754808
said athos   146.15558268733287
why you sell yourself body and soul to the demon the devil for money   60.003435707077195
i have been here since the morning   157.499981648864
after which they withdrew   103.80580854017313
mazarin pretended to laugh   137.95684296856888
depart then depart i implore you   229.74174076911953
there were only chimeras and illusions   176.62287614649802
besides as that is the exact value of the stone i brought just that sum with me   105.43217377527812

but as he felt by her weight she was on the point of fainting he made haste to reassure her by protestations of devotedness   72.82254955937029
but he experienced no curiosity to know who was visiting his father   167.82572181268262
i am only a lieutenant of musketeers very poor and journeys cost money   146.2908917827229

she appeared to me charming though rather melancholy   191.83713634188325
oh i am never cold you know   138.69779177164713
after breakfast two letters arrived for athos who read them with profound attention whilst d artagnan could not restrain himself from jumping up several times on seeing him read these epistles in one of which there being at the time a very strong light he perceived the fine writing of aramis   180.01531928565262
not if it were my own brother   142.8741956792131
this double error became an irresistible reality and by one of the incomprehensible transports of youth he bounded from his hiding place and with two strides at the risk of being seen at the risk of alarming valentine at the risk of being discovered by some exclamation which might escape the young girl he crossed the flower garden which by the light of the moon resembled a large white lake and having passed the rows of orange trees which extended in front of the house he reached the step ran quickly up and pushed the door which opened without offering any resistance   44.742541882594665

asked d artagnan seeing that mme   100.1124152107883
my friend said aramis with a look of imbecility on his face which d artagnan had never observed whilst he was in the musketeers if i did not come from heaven at least i was leaving paradise which is almost the same   105.53793017359388
by heaven and earth   84.88615035064146
parbleu i believe it is not said planchet   149.72940361783367
he desired kitty to tell her mistress that he could not be more grateful for her kindnesses than he was and that he would be obedient to her orders   35.01827994163591
count said de winter for whom do you take me   112.4151888020628
well said the count turning towards franz it seems to me that this is a very likely story   217.3921196948128
well don t be alarmed if i return at one two or three o clock in the morning   0.5515067661503821

my god that s all   63.147516934245516
the cardinal envied that composure which he attributed to the habit of meeting danger   67.21711682323546
asked madame danglars   121.00771289901306
the moccoletto is kindled by approaching it to a light   54.22961023421778
the baron adored count andrea cavalcanti   88.91018408022377
now albert said he you understand me do you not   21.84336586090535
but wherefore are you here   196.69337991109452
why did he kill himself instead of you   162.27774482902237
plague on t my lord have you brought me here to get my horoscope out of me   70.30473512251393
de villefort replied the doctor with a tone which redoubled the terror of the young man i have not led you here to console you   103.23465680649373
de villefort and then ask me for proofs   156.06497784349125
asked villefort   144.02834486160236
and bowing to the lady he sprang into his saddle while her coachman applied his whip vigorously to his horses   119.71994192077452
and if we do overtake him   169.28919437735993
the count is not   47.16296247643561
my dear fellow let them sleep on if they are asleep   183.3344674405864
said he   93.98780285453103
during this time he occupied himself in making figures with his watch by his side   84.43642542516474
your daughter will be married tomorrow if not today in a week if not tomorrow   190.47004780730984
well then it becomes the simplest thing in the world   71.21211921307786
then the lamentations of the host and hostess pierced the vault of the cellar   192.5260800354717
no one has been able to accomplish that   144.24280140294726
humiliating as such a confession is i am   174.81340413640586
how so   106.30575727034959
we are lost   118.07123954497351
she had her portrait painted thus six or eight years ago   73.13066366193107
tomorrow my dear friend said edmond desirous of not yielding to the old man s madness   132.50112369841776
it is useless replied henrietta the queen will not say yes when the cardinal says no   83.84359272612176
how so   83.9212865403003
and for myself monsieur shall i saddle rustaud   50.95330819071768

murmured athos   155.18263371635226
m   114.4728961459665
i succeeded a man of the most sublime genius that ever upheld the sceptre of france   292.58457900845815
so much the worse for them said porthos   76.13944657180753
on no pretense leave the door for you know that last night my lord punished a soldier for having quit his post for an instant although i during his absence watched in his place   79.95590696296047
more than three hundred soldiers of all kinds were assembled at the gate of the camp   170.4996938179642
i restrain myself   38.52906846460263
yes replied porthos coughing   101.64321534415217
because i was shown up the private stairs   40.233430001616114
d artagnan printed as were most of the works of that period in which authors could not tell the truth without the risk of a residence more or less long in the bastille at amsterdam by pierre rouge   27.349009262003804
at the knock the door was immediately opened and the young man who was seated beside the countess in obedience to the italian custom instantly rose and surrendered his place to the strangers who in turn would be expected to retire upon the arrival of other visitors   137.891991681537
if the cardinal does not hold you in high admiration for the affair of london he entertains a great hatred for you   146.3391228439139
really athos you would make a singular general   106.57701433089997
but she as her only reply drew a letter from her pocket and gave it to him   154.67644691222142
one who will be your best friend dantès for he is my friend my cousin my brother   68.35027810560169
excellency the evil has arrived   73.88919444480823
monte cristo stopped after having closed the gate and fastened the string to the nail and cast a look around   119.4104394941966
de saint méran before you bought it   120.35473441746242
morcerf did not reply   119.08946318148837
for a thousand pistoles said the captain   111.652929227719
but others wish that you should go there   101.85878204652727
shall we return to the camp   147.2417667146565
at that period i did not even know what time meant   89.04624295852562
we will see my dear monsieur if you can handle a sword as skillfully as you can a dice box   158.8449176025921
but strange as it appeared he cared not for those who might pass from the avenue of the champs élysées or by the faubourg saint honoré   161.65579516361277
the duchess shook her head   53.48289609272476
never mind continued the young man smuggler or not you must agree mother dear as you have seen him that the count of monte cristo is a remarkable man who will have the greatest success in the salons of paris   116.14682630528348
yes sir i was there and very anxious to speak   136.7865766623193
i tried to make him fall in love with mademoiselle danglars   186.4197016055042

the baron took the young officer by the arm and turned his head over his shoulder so as not to lose sight of milady till he was gone out   209.1397812597831
at the moment you left his house   150.371693569584
and a hundred and fifty persons may be seen exhibiting the same attitude or elevating the same arm or leg with a simultaneous movement that would lead you to suppose that but one mind one act of volition influenced the moving mass   113.6244087567971
oh it is very well as a finish to the toilet   66.7559128685445
demanded the irresistible voice of monte cristo   23.441055807138085
the feather in his hat is worth at least five and twenty pistoles   67.72265867459481
satan bowed his head and groaned   137.1954056326367
now i can promise you that a frenchman might show himself in public either in tunis constantinople bagdad or cairo without being treated in that way   109.82078965564307
edward endured the accident with miraculous courage he did not utter a single cry but fell lifeless into my arms   67.14267655799662
have you a name then   116.66045497063841
and why so   173.80276076242896
the next morning he could not see or hear   13.521788994895374
i shall always love you   70.39660257780079
the authority of the king was to be maintained   243.8147527669076
carmela wished to form a quadrille but there was one lady wanting   202.23003747241444
your life madame will then no longer be under my care and added he with a sigh then you can do what you will with it   115.16382273506541
he is no longer in my hands replied villefort   83.25067212025948
and the effect tended to increase the expression of self dependence that characterized her countenance   127.70726038119733
in ensnaring me you have fallen into the trap yourselves   206.66560017879152
another queen in want of help   180.6425924562141
azure seven merlets or placed bender said he   78.75357905847125
athos became thoughtful   59.42857893085838
believe me continued tréville in enterprises of this kind in order that one may arrive four must set out   202.53183606397167
he left his address as he had done before and set off again at the same pace for pontoise   116.20491485178646
tell me what it is replied monte cristo   196.75049010197765
but morrel remained motionless   205.8435901789372

exclaimed morrel i do not deceive myself that young man who is waving his hat that youth in the uniform of a lieutenant is albert de morcerf   114.56573449297514
death alone can separate them remarked fernand   44.145860551695804
ten minutes sufficed for their defeat and d artagnan remained master of the field of battle   5.889015298190216
and mousqueton rising respectfully yielded his place to him and went to give an eye to the two stewpans of which he appeared to have the particular inspection   164.25444511755182
they were thus engaged when the count of monte cristo entered   161.26953180897425
you would be all the wiser said athos   180.24578759244628
balls parties and fêtes are over   119.14616382862583
no   140.60358194792042
but monsieur it is very natural returned bertuccio since it was in this house that my vengeance was accomplished   60.97674840026254
they ask my age   176.28507628913226
formerly said the count i was athos   106.30544522339267
noirtier was sitting in an armchair which moved upon casters in which he was wheeled into the room in the morning and in the same way drawn out again at night   148.04237756430672
no   87.13648324470972
let us be open with each other and sincere   221.57837733488765
it looks as if you were trying to fleece me   40.36621182348898
it was you who took him count said raoul smiling   71.57823128185483
gentlemen cried aramis listen to this   53.73128243514306
really   82.07290102492905
answered the queen endeavoring to assume something of her former dignity   95.73333325218053
i know and admire the corsican nature too well to fear you   209.4454304005847
no but according to all probability she soon will be replied edmond   24.84196353408153
i reply my lord tis but little as certainly i shall not go alone   111.25248130496556
they had just prepared their beds and barricaded their door within when someone knocked at the yard shutter   148.78396282362294
my mother was at his feet and i childlike amused myself by playing with his long white beard which descended to his girdle or with the diamond hilt of the scimitar attached to his girdle   55.3482686669351
why it is poor lubin the lackey of the comte de wardes he whom you took such good care of a month ago at calais on the road to the governor s country house   190.19727864227724
it is natural enough   68.35281538272564
and now my dear athos said he do me the kindness to tell me where we are going   136.3768208148623
and i am very glad you recognize me dear m   151.94490336438216
the queen was still standing when he entered   196.6292557625316
among friends my dear athos no you are right   53.05194501642283
athos made a sign for his lackey to approach   136.13382858039714
besides you know i had the idea that you could introduce me into some of the paris salons when i came to france   75.33251143011708
de tréville s note in the other   164.98655631613073
a retired baker my poor benedetto is rich he has an annuity   34.99533959460821
exclaimed the abbé springing from his seat   17.665160122090384
there can be no doubt about it thought he   84.33691099083762
you are young and rich leave paris all is soon forgotten in this great babylon of excitement and changing tastes   134.75026349081332
you have scarcely seen my mother   106.56080535373326
we mount them and before daylight are twenty leagues distant   28.518098499419224
that promise is pledged to you that heart is also yours   188.40081725530115
this is a very unhoped for conclusion of a very disagreeable affair   147.66722450553718
not a thought was given to a life which you once mercédès had the power to render blissful   115.72056709131677
he took to his heels and was soon at m   99.7515557788371
well we will reflect and perhaps we will beg him   131.95323712034653
where is the hay dealer s   40.51974625355193
said the cardinal three men placed hors de combat in a cabaret squabble   64.74853869615542
no no cried bertuccio setting down the lantern at the angle of the interior wall   100.43195125483591
the second that we still have some very important things to say   123.26977805741913
he is a priest said bragelonne he has worn the tonsure   205.62379934201073
hush   107.96512231405548
athos   157.00890911274792
and without losing a minute thinking he saw an opening he thrust his right in and forced mordaunt to parry a counter en quarte so fine that the point of the weapon might have turned within a wedding ring   122.38406135646088
you must see that to be an utter impossibility said villefort   116.6859258279665
during ten minutes he alone kept the crowd at bay   83.1188755893672
i rest   183.0347395179769
meanwhile let us sit down and eat   41.07986024736131
but happily there is a postscript   84.36218215588946
i will give you an eagle with outstretched wings holding in its claws a prey which tries in vain to escape and bearing this device tenax   121.67444268648293
besides i shall be happy to pay my respects to him not having yet had the honor of doing so   120.92694322898362
besides you forget that i have a ring likewise   75.14910856100983
said she   173.8112613622296
m   99.78677281083995
i beg you to return me that dispatch   138.1949480912697
then uttering a loud cry followed by a burst of laughter he rushed down the stairs   180.48561251822508
are all your family well   43.97545506890819
so much the better   242.98634172513226
porthos has an excellent disposition but is easily influenced   86.66555598515586
he will not come in time   18.905473838745678
tell me your wishes and i will comply with them   201.8567517197243
the young lady rushed out of the apartment but on the first step of the staircase she found a man holding a letter in his hand   122.76087176314908
cried the king all radiant a complete victory   127.57300709900738
he had reported to aramis what had taken place and aramis not less distrustful than he had increased his suspicions   83.15600017136072
but as the cabin was his last resource he knocked again   178.17158275317348
he will say in that case to the king that i am determined on war and that this measure is my first act of hostility against france   73.21640387221366
i believe so replied aramis   119.75629681364741
i am ready   122.08440911358544
courage madame   63.53888473824154
for what   124.65442737871147
indeed   196.9403904024131
we need scarcely say that all the paths of the mountain were known to vampa   105.06849193877295
but take care   119.97074834228735
it is you who have come to me   284.9402851006212
oh yes in spite of all i could say   71.97416253958639
that was the remembrance of her husband the comte de la fère whom she had believed dead or at least expatriated and whom she found again in athos the best friend of d artagnan   218.4295505025599
he would be in despair if that should come to the ears of the king   115.34984493292363
where is the monk   166.91734788564875
for the comte de la fère it is too little   101.59935122017389
i can not help thinking that he has brought his son to france to choose a wife   124.81743000841838
where shall we pass the night   104.67367482402011
morrel i know there was no one in fault but destiny   126.58104115119649
exclaimed mazarin   95.09616012452491
the prisoner was led away   148.85292207101418
yes i will reduce this rebellious city to ashes   138.84747347818882
then it will devolve on you to push him on in that world where he is called on to occupy a place   147.72920372109493
around in the crevices of the rocks grew a few dwarf oaks and thick bushes of myrtles   1.4929497901289182
i believe so   96.25962804523854
ah sir you are going to save my life a second time   84.66312955364661
no his horse   104.46491711311344
pistols then at eight o clock in the bois de vincennes said beauchamp quite disconcerted not knowing if he was dealing with an arrogant braggadocio or a supernatural being   50.6891504177903
how go then   201.47467111835675
but see there is a postscript from aramis   50.01931619126066
on arriving at the door of the room where the queen was receiving he made a sign for them to wait and opening the door madame he said i hope your majesty will forgive me for disobeying your orders when you learn that the gentlemen i have come to announce are the comte de la fere and the chevalier d herblay   148.65085737918577
if it be but to carry away with me the recollection of such sweet moments i could even thank you for chiding me for it leaves me a gleam of hope that if you did not expect me and that indeed would be worse than vanity to suppose at least i was in your thoughts   98.37022287626068
in a quarter of an hour at most   42.57305008739672
he found her in bed overwhelmed with grief at this public humiliation   124.5135547806199
oh sire what a dreadful misfortune   192.30636531032533
de tréville when the eyes of the king fell upon him he sustained the look with so much firmness that it was the king who dropped his eyes   253.19294779893912
said porthos   47.19817263777756
50056m and with this raillery andrea went out leaving the two girls a prey to their own feelings of shame and to the comments of the crowd   78.45954876488051
these names are too numerous for me to remember them all and i will content myself with the first said the queen graciously   227.712603725137
on the contrary i request it   137.55899163490324
this instant sir this instant i beseech you   95.97231504168083
which you answer according to your fancy replied mazarin   168.22699481448726
the abbé smiled   29.167083964482188
yes you look for the signature and you say to yourself all is not lost for that order is not signed   64.2713466329557
you may copy it give it away or re use it under the terms of the project gutenberg license included with this ebook or online at www   95.816649145145
while i well   154.95212948668677
you would not like poor andrea to have his throat cut by albert   181.66755531525857
this address delivered in the presence of ali who not understanding one word of the language in which it was spoken stood wholly unmoved produced an effect on m   102.61603380461402
in the time of the cardinal people fired better than that do you remember the road to crevecoeur mousqueton   67.29871676190746
the valet went out of the room this time by the centre door but still as silently as before   217.06085854330252
but wait a minute said m   202.7178293498292
cavalcanti his father had been seen in paris and it was expected that he would re appear to claim the illustrious outcast   115.39332085712618
it appears that he had met with disagreeableness likewise on his journey   146.0377320202533
his opinion has been given   135.31403493908203
de saint méran madame de saint méran barrois all fall   85.08521071477206
her dress which was that of the women of epirus consisted of a pair of white satin trousers embroidered with pink roses displaying feet so exquisitely formed and so delicately fair that they might well have been taken for parian marble had not the eye been undeceived by their movements as they constantly shifted in and out of a pair of little slippers with upturned toes beautifully ornamented with gold and pearls   91.73529239956075
i promise you i will sustain my part to admiration   137.75697693444636
he therefore approached the bed and while his companion was dipping the fingers with which he had touched the lips of the corpse in chloride of lime he uncovered the calm and pale face which looked like that of a sleeping angel   129.0340327951895
five hundred pounds   106.46401709373285
the boat must be waiting for us and there is our sloop at anchor do you see it there   149.75369911217018
obey laporte do you not see i have no time to lose   107.78595770306592
ah ah   63.20463344537442
milady smiled to herself at the idea which had occurred to her that this might be her old chambermaid   147.6704944650104
i hope so at least said cromwell rising and putting on his cloak   110.66545660459232
and yet it is important for the honor of my memory and this surely is not vanity but a justifiable pride it is important the world should know that i have consented by my free will to stop my arm already raised to strike and that with the arm which has been so powerful against others i have struck myself   115.06770150191939
and at these words felton feeling that he could not long maintain his severity toward his prisoner rushed out of the room   91.31222973258815
in 43 he said just before the death of the late cardinal i received a letter from athos   24.455280595059023
his nose quite straight and projecting direct from the brow was of the pure greek type while his teeth as white as pearls were set off to admiration by the black moustache that encircled them   101.95590344676772
monsieur duke said the king i understand you   173.74408116856875
think often of raoul   129.87523117829136
i said mazarin with his most smiling expression   87.9539084261478
e   171.10158239952386
pardi answered athos we only carried off his mother   57.368807939915996
bonacieux   66.86215765230733
she must live that my infamy may diminish hers   147.89156263463477
and tell me did you ever see at the court of ali tepelini whom you so gloriously and valiantly served a more exquisite beauty or richer costume   161.61452750162206
said athos how much time we have lost   2.328829969811352
ejaculated caderousse almost suffocated by the contending passions which assailed him the poor old man did die   110.22788081354977
there was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order to talk over and settle the affair   78.26916663322406
had been distinguished by his white plume at the battle of ivry   89.0297800835166
poor fools   113.14208626642461
the young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eyes of his neighbor   76.83770893774098
said the executioner   43.36474579123204
dinner was waiting but as albert had told him that he should not return so soon franz sat down without him   94.23324540301749
has anyone shown the mercy towards me that you now ask at my hands   129.74267057873118
he sighed and set to work again   155.49457506115135
he quickly saw two heads appear above an abandoned work within thirty paces of him   56.66219937157164
all around him were lying the palikares writhing in convulsive agonies while two or three who were only slightly wounded were trying to escape by springing from the windows   40.056180443740104
enormous ones answered beauchamp   176.74643773657846
because as i have told you it has to do with a great queen   77.92342848493769
i will say he had doubtless given you the plan of this house in the hope the count would kill you   70.28974980560214
and from fromelles she had set out for armentières   92.9735016203365
d artagnan did not know where he was and wished himself a hundred feet underground   70.84738678996118
what a misfortune it is you did not follow your first vocation   111.70122669230568
said the procurator maliciously   21.437621926375897
just the person we require at a time like the present said a second   87.78489830451547
have you ever heard of him   151.98090931314056
i have something important to reveal to him   112.6924897529512
the pleasure of satisfied pride was necessary to her domination   189.64078871533943
four or five men are placed in ambuscade in the first room   87.95502071303017
she directed her course towards the faubourg saint germain went down the rue mazarine and stopped at the passage du pont neuf   104.09208636588617
the second because he was not sorry to have an opportunity of reading his own thoughts and endeavoring if possible to fathom those of this woman   35.15992726794342
for the countess after gazing with a puzzled look at his face burst into a fit of laughter and begged to know what had happened   117.98501560144858
d artagnan ran to the door and pushed the bolt   121.04741896242624
truly the parisians are idiots   184.29322362380822
so your majesty must perceive there is no time to lose   115.50446898405676
when he had passed one group he began to breathe more freely   118.95318180625067
thought porthos as he walked away it appears i am getting nearer to monsieur coquenard s strongbox at last   115.14643961318254
de saint méran is dead   16.24029129056173
but for d artagnan all aspects were clothed happily all ideas wore a smile all shades were diaphanous   63.62837182419918
this feast is not very succulent   119.5646318935301
was it a transient vision or was he face to face with reality   157.68359804160917
he felt his heart beat and taking his mother s hand within his own he said tenderly yes you will live   112.8801808198596
we four will go   163.10163742308612
near the merchant s signature there was indeed the seal of the sublime emperor   44.20419832145511
chapter iii   115.9305454758598
no it is for the first expenses of your settling in paris   68.7863228953504
tis easily guessed   92.65719938077552
good   93.7008908679562
meanwhile albert had arrived within ten paces of the group formed by the five young men   183.79320878300064
can you be a coward   107.87807236442154
nor even ancient greek my dear count   147.87938901767737
where   127.72301166969356
for if i dared tell you what i have seen certainly no good would befall me   132.99408455014185
unfortunately it is a thing that i can t perform at any time i choose   160.34304763121736
that is very simple   111.46110963372197
that is enough to drive away all my pains   185.78145193677716
at the very moment when the queen quitted the convent to go to the palais royal a young man dismounted at the gate of this royal abode and announced to the guards that he had something of importance to communicate to cardinal mazarin   138.42704181086657
noirtier said d avrigny   194.38718980422243
the question is this monsieur the principal thinks that my thesis ought to be dogmatic and didactic   120.21355338538588
all fell to their knees   187.54811441226883
the young man did not wait to be told twice but passing under the horse s head disappeared at the corner of the rue guenegaud   96.68103663178239
the noise startled madame de villefort who shuddered and dropped the curtain   119.91295013162336
replied albert   211.60191927793224
yes buckingham   154.9171919028577
it was to visit her king henry iv   83.13994699233973
yes   173.30895893439492
chapter 65   167.69285918220686
he asked   85.40349052167491
what have i said   74.30502799466996
again danglars bit his lips   140.86844232897153
i have blessed you and you are sacred to me   49.06291921061421
villefort took a chair but valentine remained standing by her father s side and franz before him holding the mysterious paper in his hand   222.70011786375375
i serve the queen and that draws me naturally into the service of the cardinal   83.83418535329886
then d artagnan told m   129.59679144118076
placed where he was d artagnan could not perceive the face of aramis   124.96868563376863
it is unpardonable   121.71174856521279
9   105.87322775110391
it led through a grove of lindens to a conservatory   126.89346041869533
at this last command all the sails were lowered and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards   174.9789822708487
the people believing that he had escaped by some back entrance retired and left him at liberty to retreat   145.04357167877845
oh replied danglars since we can not leave this port for the next three months let us hope that ere the expiration of that period dantès will be set at liberty   73.27814980780296
he again arose and went to the door   29.075255440795814
uncle and nephew   245.26785932920924
i am safe for a few days at least   159.19801416139427
when i shut my eyes and think i seem to see it all again   185.69043980888398
but a fresh allusion soon brought back the conversation to his eminence and then the laughter recovered its loudness and the light was not withheld from any of his actions   103.35120067595292
all at once felton stopped   90.60103749116352
ma foi   29.83370268257103
no answered porthos mouston has no desire to fight   92.88018172310704
he also morrel like you considered himself the unhappiest of men   79.26664829936517
fontrailles his aide de camp had an arm broken   203.80003975171815
you didn t know king charles   67.82196144954862
tranquil yes replied cromwell   185.9715164155079
listen said he to him   46.81345700573944
had you continued to remain on amicable terms with me i should have said patience my friend   69.9010236065044
everything in its proper time and all comes right to those who know how to wait patiently   69.57087084899044
this time milady really pushed him away from her   54.901611626038
dantès strove to do this with his nails but they were too weak   103.54036662938674
a light moved rapidly from time to time past three windows of the second floor   129.05126750364582
and then i knew you were seeking me   1.5641337025472097
she was attending to the education of her son   108.53482789579932
well   77.91235948604813
and i shall have succeeded in doing nothing for you in spite of all my efforts   68.11063292980836
but you know guitant we poor ministers often want men with other qualities besides courage   108.53928297163465
this strange chain of domestic afflictions followed by the no less strange death of his daughter strange   117.34401557493906
well let us set out   78.00624586134849
you will then be at my service   65.35338024873698
she is beautiful   92.40903495464427
the one i mentioned to you had one of its faces scratched by accident   71.36755270936249
in that case said andrea everything is all right excepting your refusal which quite grieves me   94.17262015352587
monsieur you run no risk for as i told you i will stay here   86.40787320130401
and far from being incredulous mazarin was superstitious   143.4969464721063
your lordship does me much honor said the host and i thank you sincerely for your kind wish   30.529417287025538
tis the same thing you understand me d artagnan a court   85.90523078012038
athos and aramis left paris after this coup d etat which took place on the very evening of the day in which the parisians had been beaten at charenton   182.03129044285228
said d artagnan to himself to whose mind the niece of the theologian reverted pardieu it would be droll if this belated dove should be in search of our friend s house   121.98386361337818
but i make an agreement with the man who pastes up the papers and he brings them to me as he would the playbills that in case any person staying at my hotel should like to witness an execution he may obtain every requisite information concerning the time and place etc   61.68146211679984
i call on you where are you   153.7161221919877
said athos laughing   134.42326271952726
no it will all go well   132.39908908347024
i did not know when i came with such haste to you that i was to meet an enemy here   120.13326195560579
said monte cristo feigning uneasiness   75.66243490358143
indeed   142.6514545240954
said d artagnan with an astonishment which this time was not pretended   67.97247712821724
bonacieux   62.643729282780235
besides the scriptures say confess yourselves to one another and i confess to you d artagnan   110.81008280898632
answered d artagnan i wish you joy of it   132.0798961976778
you are right my dear monsieur bonacieux my friends and i have been on a little journey   152.08856955499147
if innocent to be set at liberty   90.3376379382174
who ignorant of what had happened followed him in astonishment foreseeing some new catastrophe   56.344530815788644
bending on one knee he placed it reverently by the side of its mother with its head upon her breast   63.91168437875738
this duet is one of the most beautiful expressive and terrible conceptions that has ever emanated from the fruitful pen of donizetti   161.27053796655943
what an appetite you used to have   123.96358789819865
let me see him   192.23186618047163
this was m   87.72888966744313
at this moment he saw the light of planier gleaming in front of him like a star   174.27587990236853
de morcerf in epirus for guilty as i knew he was i thought you had no right to punish him   164.97187297249485
the court of his hôtel situated in the rue du vieux colombier resembled a camp from by six o clock in the morning in summer and eight o clock in winter   113.55024137954739
the window was again opened slowly and the same face appeared only it was now still more pale than before   138.82844953787946
but without doubt nothing hostile passed for he saw albert disappear arm in arm with the peasant girl   113.52664236696572
ah cursed gascon that i am i get from one hobble into another   96.0330386247355
it was acting as a supernumerary that was so tedious   118.85664179619053
can he have guessed my errand   41.95675507907737
no said jacopo   168.04162139711576
then turning to aramis aramis he said break your sword   157.77368150717237
yes   96.13431575281683
if it but lasts most capital responded porthos   87.32585624089715
it is impossible   96.52398970686056
make one   193.80181568745257
but i was going to tell you that i met m   135.43146732327403
and let him be no longer king cried the queen   76.06885870449956
there is a weapon which despair has placed within the reach of every creature who has the courage to use it   52.01435836851584
one of them carried a roll of paper on which were written these words they are following us   46.57932506315562
the tutor followed them   217.6355723950159
yes   115.23274175354544
no he cried they have not wounded but perhaps they have robbed me   180.60990447958665
like shakespeare s polonius he died for another   121.90046696575477
her poetic and excited mind pictured it as the soul of her grandmother   233.59908152067564
heaven grant that this light prove not a devouring fire   186.2521253864644
they fancy that their countryman is still emperor   124.92479336578435
to crown his happiness monsieur de chavigny had started on a journey that morning and in his absence la ramee was deputy governor of the chateau   20.876368228761038
otherwise i would not fight with m   120.87225590083865
the lackeys were ordered to act as sentinels   141.14251519058766
the rest concerns another person   9.254390332737444
ah i know said she lowering her voice and going close to the old man   143.50799764932987
at this moment the abbé pressed down his side of the shade and so raised it on the other throwing a bright light on the stranger s face while his own remained obscured   21.605861906998612
to sea viscount   172.00737608700962
i shall come back to dessert   87.28158679816548
i ve remarked that your puritans revel in that color   189.5858474674242
noirtier sent for the notary   127.44997999437624
cried d artagnan   97.41938842087097
when you spoke to me of experiencing a vague and indefinite sense of coming danger i placed myself blindly and devotedly at your service asking no other reward than the pleasure of being useful to you   124.22116689508084
and the ill treated people have drawn up the following which i have the honor to present to your majesty   113.81968324727727
the chief approached and it was indeed planchet   186.99865374119543
you buried my child alive   172.6803604739008
this very instant   179.88783459058158
how can you know that   157.16299130658552
dear benedetto said he i think he will not be sorry to inherit his fortune and he who hastens the day when he can touch his five hundred thousand will not be his worst friend   97.13930275795408
at these words he uncovered the small cup which contained the substance so lauded took a teaspoonful of the magic sweetmeat raised it to his lips and swallowed it slowly with his eyes half shut and his head bent backwards   210.16322895357234
but your future career d artagnan your ambition porthos   152.47911576374622
there was therefore nothing for them to do but to follow the prudent advice of monsieur d arminges and beat a retreat   137.12436846563054
he had only two hours work to do to open communication with the king and according to the calculations of the four friends they had the entire day before them since the executioner being absent another must be sent for to bristol   33.83738187917341
if you make a single step to find her you are lost   109.37481246983043
i deliver them to you without compulsion   171.93137203577896
it appears she resumed that he sold it he sold it in order to save me another time to be able to send a messenger to the duke to warn him of his danger he sold it to monsieur des essarts on whose finger i remarked it   58.22955357952396
no returned the jeweller giving back the diamond and the ring to caderousse no it is worth no more and i am sorry i offered so much for the stone has a flaw in it which i had not seen   112.40228794149313
to the huguenots as places of safety there only remained la rochelle   4.5287424596452155
you see   99.21640007160451
meanwhile the guests seeing that the two friends were longing to be alone prepared to depart when a noise of dogs barking resounded through the courtyard and many persons said at the same moment ah   97.32615772704779
and you have chosen the path strewed with flowers   214.5552292057826
after which his majesty grumbling entered his apartment   93.32488380740155
but philosophy at half past ten at night is somewhat late   146.80310586319757
a shout of laughter followed this brutal jest   127.92374280596802
then turning toward that one of the guards who had declared himself the friend of bois tracy besides continued he i have reflected my dear intimate of bois tracy that i am not less tenderly his friend than you can possibly be   168.89969686080315
ha ha ha   285.7242332225194
this battle of folly and flame continued for two hours   171.1491037264323
you know the interest we both take in this poor little madame bonacieux   201.47637159851985
beauchamp turned to look at some paintings   139.40412885426423
an hour after the vehicle was at the door   134.73942137719783
morrel evidently discomposed came to meet monte cristo less with the intention of receiving him than to exclude his entry   89.99602170974842
monsieur said m   114.57446281046478
but my dear love reflect a little upon what you require of me   38.41688283294303
your punctuality really alarms me   143.9924457882521
devil take me   136.39695193782532
very fine anne   119.54421229484348
in the left side was it not and with a knife   37.49835546018669
cried albert whose courage revolted at the idea of being plundered tamely not make any resistance   86.70276662151578
but what is that to me provided i see you again   147.15705431590894
yes   186.4267710866498
for before everything i wish to avenge myself   98.9586172784353
you may now retire   128.13432668961264
for in good truth you see more clearly into my life than i do myself   21.889449157043998
but do you think asked albert that we ought to accept such offers from a perfect stranger   103.29877082569297
debray smiled   76.70543985008055
vampa was twelve and teresa eleven   92.96807947308876
i can not i replied   159.7762516212996
dantès said danglars bowing to the young couple   105.88636968899333
on a sudden she stepped or rather bounded with outstretched arms towards the table   135.5546915934902
of how much does he rob you every year   139.10118482829682
and said villefort is it at your house in the champs élysées that you receive your visitors   39.189971104171775
it was a signal   146.45651093276535
besides i am an italian and not a frenchman and belong to god and not to man and i shall shortly retire to my convent which i have only quitted to fulfil the last wishes of a dying man   10.92331763624162
be good enough to hurry yourself a little monsieur monk   184.58660262977708
as for me i am sure of it said the duke   97.29906836603126
you are a faithful friend felton   172.86144220170812
unfortunately for d artagnan among the spectators was one of his eminence s guardsmen who still irritated by the defeat of his companions which had happened only the day before had promised himself to seize the first opportunity of avenging it   93.81215713511008
get up   145.26959471918744
and with the ten parts of grimaud which are not worth a ducatoon i regained the diamond   211.63462882182932
whilst they pursue him the king might escape   74.75251035577114
from these rocks that i had the good luck to cling to while our captain and the rest of the crew were all lost   143.8618158805379
as he approached it noirtier s gaze followed him and his eyes appeared of such a fiery brightness that villefort felt them pierce to the depths of his heart   161.91222675171582
to marseilles   102.31889599872555
now monsieur de chavigny piqued himself on his infallible penetration   215.65717679621338
holà bazin   167.43223214697016
quite quite alone replied the man or at least practically so for my poor wife who is the only person in the house besides myself is laid up with illness and unable to render me the least assistance poor thing   94.06480254698292
you are right said she i have often thought of it   131.75520418900686
the noise increased   107.11903732297846
and me too monsieur said blaisois   160.73428009402193
one look was sufficient to tell her that her grandfather was suffering and that there was much on his mind which he was wishing to communicate to her   166.4121675841502
it is true nevertheless   52.82214469800808
three days passed thus during which his prayers were frequent if not heartfelt   191.30989287768355
i have his letters said she   174.47075205176273
oh you frighten me   150.00292792625754
and the latter begged for two days time to ascertain exactly who would be most likely to give him full particulars   210.1750143726369
the soldiers whom he was nearly trampling ran away   179.36876944716968
the first time he saw d artagnan you have come off well said he to him   89.433326040634
yes   134.091904699146
vicomte said athos to raoul follow the duchess   180.30561599159614
peste   120.71345444875367
truly sir you overwhelm me with benefits   126.20074357516803
it was at the brigantine that had left in the morning and the tartan that had just set sail that edmond fixed his eyes   162.3312534960697
eating what   78.97568513716024
what horses   94.28770319921576
as the envoy of the prefect of police arrived ten minutes before ten he was told that lord wilmore who was precision and punctuality personified was not yet come in but that he would be sure to return as the clock struck   104.85529561477834
there is only one thing which grieves me observed the major and that is the necessity for my leaving paris so soon   129.76639393825565
he added looking steadfastly at the queen   165.60905182827008
perhaps they can yet save my life   205.86972588493597
aramis pointed toward heaven   45.293667081083825
d artagnan was on guard at the louvre   82.61112437787406
there is no doubt but that one of the chief accomplishments of a courtier is to know when to forget   186.61764766455047
sir said the president rising with gravity be careful what you say   161.0863140144171
there s what you want on that table said the waiter   220.95141368640782
the other leaned against a tree supported there by the two valets and was praying fervently with clasped hands and eyes raised to heaven   116.98500661125655
awaken me   222.41174792067739
said mme   149.4178018622691
there he ascertained that the bracieux estate was four leagues distant but that porthos was not at bracieux   73.99818646596731
felton cast his eyes round for means of escape and seeing the door free he rushed into the next chamber in which as we have said the deputies from la rochelle were waiting crossed it as quickly as possible and rushed toward the staircase   32.00852623106364
oh   71.2248846202065
oh i recollect him perfectly cried m   144.6148296880201
when i say i will not do a thing i mean it   63.942770461278506
cried the wretch falling on her knees   61.305345489131376
yes sir you shall see them   72.80848268647296
asked beauchamp   99.89014618509744
he was very taciturn this worthy signor   109.36468650568145
but suppose i should happen to be brought in contact even four times a year with such intelligence and devotedness why i should be a ruined man   129.28581721259985
they never overtook the chimerical friend yet andrea frequently inquired of people on foot whom he passed and at the inns which were not yet closed for a green cabriolet and bay horse   168.2385509894316
i will not quit you said vasiliki   13.521779768995287
de villefort   105.26113280726202
one fine morning the king commanded m   80.28300621827805
and you have i am sure the fullest confidence in my honor   76.32103513761245
here s half a pistole   134.6524767951773
he also spoke of it to monsieur de chavigny who promised that he would not oppose it in any way that is if he approved of the person proposed   78.9255187297291
i saw amid the shadows the table sink through the floor   122.8462829526067
pursued the notary   177.05181675354544
should anyone else interrogate you say to him what you have said to me but do not breathe a word of this letter   54.88342939530751
my dear friend said monte cristo you appear to be relating an adventure which we all know by heart   159.77815052669118
moreover he reckoned much on the interest of the danglars to hush up the rumor of their own misadventures   86.32711423110356
the cries died away in groans and next morning as soon as wasilio s wife could muster up courage to venture abroad she caused the door of our dwelling to be opened by the public authorities when assunta although dreadfully burnt was found still breathing   125.47615043177751
yes said grimaud   49.12659758152276
did i say dead or alive   91.02616273232297
the stranger cried that he acknowledged no other king but his eminence   28.856735355973527
still i found nothing nothing the chest was no longer there   256.31002110752144
i think so   109.01051174912433
well we won t speak of it any more then   130.05563864325745
should it not be found in the possession of father or son then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said dantès on board the pharaon   171.2876577433662
you may be overheard   153.84671368778504
etiquette had no minutiæ unknown to him   92.75385046970572
you may convert to and distribute this work in any binary compressed marked up nonproprietary or proprietary form including any word processing or hypertext form   148.21638533091073
and as was well known the vengeance of his eminence was terrible   161.19812833437786
how long a delay do you wish for   256.5329929049643
then come back here and clap your hands three times and we will give you wine and food   68.37243661358777
the sides of the walls seem to close in even to press against him   180.33450091934594
are you going to rejoin your cardinal   106.24487048042373
come come sleepy head   109.25106470865842
still further the jew told them that if they would sell it to him as it would make a magnificent pendant for earrings he would give five hundred pistoles for it   169.10079954228755
not even me   135.21009531050697
asked a gendarme   164.67985801876478
ah my yellow horse cried he   92.23389907261961
i wish to know can you tell me pray is anything fresh occurring in this part of the town   190.36415074747396
bradshaw waited and as there was no reply there was a moment of silence   139.38416852732848
the deep bronze of his complexion had been succeeded by a mortal pallor which betokened debility   141.88104291613578
but as to the sword he said it was sealed to its place and should never quit it until its master should himself quit his lodgings   115.0717675918938
bertuccio   136.00699779957125
the queen will never banish me and even were i obliged to yield to the populace she would yield with me   238.0426797519993
take this pen and write   69.3270412513721
then as it was cold he asked for his gown which was brought to him   129.08455352973402
athos understood all now   142.03418985713336
it was the fault of that blockhead pastrini that i did not sooner assist you in your distress   21.336368917799447
and you my friend there is a demipistole for your trouble   128.90611183983975
will you this ring would certainly only recall very bitter remembrances   62.36941358556162
and now my dear girl said d artagnan you know that it is not good for any of us to be here   62.668488159582374
that s the man my dear fellow   112.50534885445565
well signor pastrini said franz now that my companion is quieted and you have seen how peaceful my intentions are tell me who is this luigi vampa   64.582849090942
la mazzolata chapter 36   193.11259940843223
well said morrel changing his expression of calmness for one of violence well and if i do intend to turn this pistol against myself who shall prevent me who will dare prevent me   156.5561125662474
it would ruin me replied the abbé   158.70871133655692
i am as certain of it as that we two are christians   76.2079645241256
and in justice to villefort it must be understood that m   45.43793154676631
i take them said d artagnan for myself   40.782527075723934
the young man remained immovable   108.00113340187207
you ought to be brave for two reasons the first is that you are a gascon and the second is that you are my son   129.06703850021728
but you must in the first place reveal to the cardinal all you know of your wife s relations with madame de chevreuse   111.79211116638933
well try the hotel de luynes raoul and ask if the duchess can receive you   67.816448193285
he put one hand on his heart to still its beating and the other over his eyes that he might not witness the slaying of his faithful friends   243.52517205891286
but on the contrary she threw herself back in her carriage and called out coolly to the coachman go on home   114.04571645198335
unhappy man   7.472738794307162
said mordaunt   85.75675294106733
why i made a vocabulary of the words i knew   3.8754682289159916
personally i am on bad terms with him on account of the quarrels between madame de montbazon my mother in law and madame de longueville   136.8090148363894
consequently the procureur is very active in the affair and the prefect of police very much interested   157.55095855203493
replied athos   174.87010834312414
not the least in the world replied bonacieux   82.41970227174049
we can wait for him   158.21464009280416
danglars immediately recognized him as the man who had called out in such a furious manner put in your head   148.86467560490837
the animal uttered a cry during the transit but arrived at its destination it crouched behind the cushions and stupefied at such unusual treatment remained silent and motionless   76.74076091680878
omer   141.5786764879163
but it appears that is not possible   143.78802447827482
you know the rest   76.95341065461963
and then when he saw the light plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the château d if and heard the distant report he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one whose coming and going like that of kings was accompanied with salutes of artillery   133.94131922998298
but you know that god who loves martyrs sometimes permits the innocent to be condemned   61.23830617523094
you are acquainted with the young viscount are you   63.17599112270128
but what has de rochefort to do with this manner you have of invading my room   95.63451625700309
and yet your father a man accustomed to judicial accusations ought to have known that all these deaths have not happened naturally   30.70915700429009
she snatched me from the cushions on which i was sleeping and on opening my eyes i saw hers filled with tears   89.13845173718029
the sailor departed without reply   172.2548871916789
i will not have you left alone so long   100.33467603510641
it is true that when a man possesses a young and pretty wife he has no need to seek happiness elsewhere   90.94451153413794
will you give me a lesson the day after to morrow   157.16153188859562
buckingham also was pursuing a private vengeance   202.3483502168521
monseigneur i see well that i must call grimaud   113.50736369621077
he lowered his gun in the direction of the traveler   183.78821663486667
one day he was surprised in a lonely road between a huguenot and a catholic with both of whom he had before had business and who both knew him again   66.52762046444606
that s agreed   89.31234812407885
then he entered the empty dungeon closed the entrance and slipped into the sack which had contained the dead body   134.2098474302454
my dear friend here athos spoke rest assured if we were mazarinists we should come well prepared with every sort of passport   219.84823319241409
none   248.67833663755172
let us entice them away   131.85864493750853
still one place where the grass was thin attracted my attention   115.15467613686683
a few moments after the little door was opened and a man entered   67.85847904769898
madame said athos passing his arm under that of d artagnan we abandon to your pious care the body of that unfortunate woman   182.51196244399725
i must then place my life my honor my reputation in your hands   94.58505585606355
oh sir   31.748086005711173
madame danglars uttered a scream and fainted   101.22923644505568
and that is the reason why i have the honor to inform your eminence of what has happened   75.66295402937487
in what language would you like me to converse with him   146.74411349698312
grimaud nodded   171.3563457993431
when the reading was finished he remained silent with knitted brows   124.07269991805964
porthos   22.96627322588202
let them come in   169.81757246851646
i wish to see him at once   203.91063869235103
tomorrow i will come and announce to you the departure of my messenger   174.26751915511653
thought d artagnan she is charged with some message for me from her mistress   316.9784519784278
at that moment bazin entered with the spinach and the omelet   65.64471743870925
the major drew an armchair towards him and proceeded to seat himself   195.8199286583536
but from whom did this ring come to you athos   132.36262666862368
but why have you not fled   228.11477744832274
and he took hold of one within his reach   31.086393355433913
it is not known whether it was the devil who gave way or the monks who grew tired   123.07941726134032
well pardieu   36.28489852622751
the doctor flew to his patient   39.28282723352916
therefore he has gone and i am free forever added madame danglars in the same supplicating tone   179.50195474860914
repeated madame danglars her staring wide open eyes expressing her alarm   142.89681622161598
hurrah for you then my beautiful lady cried the captain   116.82436862349239
said the inspector   23.534026559482072
the thing is worth looking into and i will take pains to investigate the matter thoroughly   184.9928092476082
asked debray   47.405144904970896
and you are not afraid of that athos   78.25735861299091
the only difference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated by these two men   78.25168146866078
now he added with a sigh it is you who will conduct me thither   90.1794165754817
ali having pointed to the apartments held up three fingers of his right hand and then placing it beneath his head shut his eyes and feigned to sleep   70.19676811504866
i could therefore expect a higher rank and who knows what might have happened had the elder branch remained on the throne   138.36116733260783
cæsar poisoned at the same time escaped by shedding his skin like a snake   211.2680511718
he is he would have added edmond dantès but the count seized his arm and prevented him   165.55037712662357
it is yours   130.48635710262948
no my dear vampa replied the count   146.10013319897539
well my friend i am come to give you this very title which you wish for so much   162.27828917256528
said he in as pure french as has ever been uttered between rouen and tours   82.16393186171935
athos went close to it and distinguished some words that appeared to merit so great an interest that he made a sign to his friends to be silent remaining himself bent with his ear directed to the opening of the lower orifice   174.19609666949134
as for her she returned to her place with a smile of savage contempt upon her lips and repeated blaspheming that terrible name of god by whom she had just sworn without ever having learned to know him   45.13645229333687
and i promise to give you the satisfaction of a gentleman if your scheme turns out as ingenious as you assert   115.33162531578593
and eugénie who with haughty air and disdainful lip had retired to her room with her inseparable companion mademoiselle louise d armilly   25.65601099700936

if he send me his poniard it will signify that the emperor s intentions are not favorable and i am to set fire to the powder   172.5519311671172
but it was perfidiously stolen from me   23.145533342448616
and he will be guillotined will he not   90.57411595611065
neither mercédès nor edmond observed the strange expression of his countenance   127.33289478437973
i must obey you though you bade me call forth the dead or walk upon the water   143.38851595293391
it is nothing and has already passed away   143.76337934639636
it is a little worse for the journey but that s no matter   70.23424566519702
as soon as the two friends met they began a conversation which was emphasized by frequent gesticulation   148.2849608455098
you must understand it would be impolitic not to accept such a positive invitation   174.9606294811019
an h and an n surmounted by a baron s coronet   69.26070132374701
of high treason   108.12128816301527
her hands are icy cold cried d artagnan   172.33528940625578
yes i see too plainly that it does exist   164.63118626910796
look at it aramis   149.3319931349223

i ask if you are certain of it   97.74124251282844
religion and its observances had made felton a man inaccessible to ordinary seductions   144.439255234276
then everything was still excepting that valentine heard the almost noiseless sound of some liquid being poured into the glass she had just emptied   92.66260808065633
said felton with increasing exultation   152.43417850301887
farewell my son said the curate till tomorrow   49.869538540184564
he went straight to the queen and in an altered voice said why madame have you not thought proper to wear your diamond studs when you know it would give me so much gratification   3.780334687648505
then resuming his mild air you are deceived gentlemen said he this handkerchief is not mine and i can not fancy why monsieur has taken it into his head to offer it to me rather than to one of you   160.19964782612217
asked the lieutenant   58.08997378801508
then he arranged all his beautiful turkish arms his fine english guns his japanese china his cups mounted in silver his artistic bronzes by feuchères or barye   26.301343935530824
you shall take him with you there   130.47333894293862
before i leave you mercédès have you no request to make   118.01355260116453
but mazarin notwithstanding this permission instead of reading the letters took the knife which the dying buckingham had snatched out of the wound and sent by laporte to the queen   14.978449161895583
living my best friends would avoid my house   99.44406054417068
therefore i shall return to italy as soon as i can   95.37370128171084
a man   116.95933861617138
was grimaud s laconic reply   184.01630362137428
you see then said athos there is a god in heaven still   134.164887657376
lord wilmore having heard the door close after him returned to his bedroom where with one hand he pulled off his light hair his red whiskers his false jaw and his wound to resume the black hair dark complexion and pearly teeth of the count of monte cristo   122.08873637585457
her vices i know them not   140.4558149627759
i may be mistaken but i believe that raoul will be as accomplished a gentleman as our degenerate age could display   86.13991653497331
fernand departed with the rest bearing with him the terrible thought that while he was away his rival would perhaps return and marry mercédès   104.42149084350214
live the cardinal   154.18310012779705
and now absolve me for i am dying   43.91832429724822
egad didn t you hear   73.85819021962206
athos seemed to grow calm as the critical moment approached   149.72278508008844
exclaimed the man with gray hair   78.85745642289302
stay said d artagnan and do not come till you hear me drum my fingers on the door   54.61875093107377
yes let us chat brother said she with a kind of cheerfulness decided as she was to draw from the conversation in spite of all the dissimulation lord de winter could bring the revelations of which she stood in need to regulate her future conduct   120.17144697451353
and turning on his heel was about to re enter the hostelry by the front gate beneath which d artagnan on arriving had observed a saddled horse   51.22387878347652
i never saw such an expression of cupidity as the flickering lamp revealed in those two countenances   84.6939806910395
let things take their course   133.60881101559886
d artagnan trembled   92.19082850186928
i will not detain you long   36.69947157568646

the young man s eyes gradually resumed their dull and glassy appearance and he fell into a profound reverie   71.93476916463743
for forty years he produced and distributed project gutenberg™ ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support   65.34650976610693
wait a moment said athos perhaps they do not recognize your majesty s voice and await the order of their captain   87.9161967019323
once outside the city d artagnan overtook the gentleman as he was entering a little wood   134.64657351775298
immediately m   107.95765473230567
you heard it for the first time at marseilles twenty three years ago the day of your marriage with mademoiselle de saint méran   92.60606188868535
days and weeks passed away then months dantès still waited   116.09905870117485
come this is no longer our home   90.83077147173974
above you there is the king   58.808134324869016
hold athos said aramis perhaps there is yet time   108.34815465611916
scarcely had the two frenchmen touched the ground when a door opened and the voice of the valet de chambre called out make ready   99.75713288657614
paris is a horrible place in summer   94.832990316792

i merely tell you to look into my conduct during the last four years that we have ceased to be husband and wife and see whether it has not always been consistent   153.069043754752

well i own it   107.08789013617168
yes   36.437329006121644
his panegyric has been uttered   69.02998175625657
he then related to his friends word for word all that had passed between him and his host and how the man who had abducted the wife of his worthy landlord was the same with whom he had had the difference at the hostelry of the jolly miller   101.9251271557618

on the contrary this dantès saw a means of accelerating his escape   40.65024043959218
throwing down his spit and ordering his wife to do the same with her broom handle and the servants with their sticks he set the first example of commencing an earnest search for the lost letter   79.10380417598515
athos still within the inclosure of the window watched this scene with a smile of disdain on his lips   37.015379717609434
debray instead of answering allowed her to remain in an attitude of nervous inquiry   48.73315475222165
it was morrel alone who remembered with alarm that if he had to repay on the 15th the 50 000 francs of m   65.28501831418427
the discourse is over   193.48592477940036

lord de winter came toward five o clock in the evening   153.61668433695235
whom do you suspect   152.00867345330016
he sent for me answered the mercer proudly   216.19986665428655
he had sighed deeply therefore when accepting the gift of the pony from m   109.78115466324388
ah so much the better i feared this little precaution might have been forgotten   96.02186501498674
my lord added henrietta with a melancholy smile it is sad and almost shameful to be obliged to say that we have passed the winter in the louvre without money without linen almost without bread and often not rising from bed because we wanted fire   133.10620612861618
planchet went in search of the postillion who had driven her and found him   99.74710109852825
whilst lord de winter turned to her with a glance which said did i not answer for them   94.44407418378566
they went towards the forest and soon entered it   176.18276518186624
nobody saw her replied d artagnan and he related to m   67.02127914703891
therefore i am delighted to be able thus publicly to mark my gratitude and my esteem   3.2281567937505287
but do you not fear to find him a bully   196.26509470889596
oh no my lord   35.79663486649973
d artagnan who never turned his head did not perceive it   201.5731602387341
i know what i wish to know   120.20271396070193
ah madame said porthos in the most melancholy tone he could assume when we are about to enter upon a campaign a campaign in which my presentiments tell me i shall be killed oh don t talk of such things   47.17707710042282

d artagnan would fain have declared that he was not fatigued but athos insisted on his retiring to his chamber conducted thither by raoul   100.8282042478132
and he has no children with all these titles   12.226356845366297

d artagnan tried with his sweetest smile to touch his lips to milady s but she evaded him   72.41218152202114
porthos was the first who came to himself   47.558091958865475

what   187.91621702522568
what the mercer s wife of the rue des fossoyeurs   64.82530393198684
as we have seen therefore he permitted his former host to retire without attempting a recognition but fully promising himself a rich indemnity for his present forbearance should chance afford him another opportunity   92.03253816071489
but his strength failed him and he sank into a chair   85.6105850408645
at notre dame   99.76757297612268
said the three musketeers   127.90136209169893
there was no more to do in the room so the poisoner retired stealthily as though fearing to hear the sound of her own footsteps   169.76374261158776
be cautious or you will make me believe in supernatural agencies   81.26794085628228
the drum beats   154.35295473887047

cried d artagnan   103.886658217877
he believed himself transported into that famous country of giants into which gulliver afterward went and was so frightened   78.31287804819311
that s a capital arrangement   91.34603720216953
replied d artagnan who knew nothing about it but who wished to appear to know everything that was going on   174.25697456884464
said franz hesitating   83.86151952159443
go monsieur de bragelonne said the queen and rest assured of our affection   140.74603467534874

excuse me excuse me but i owe this money to the charity fund a deposit which i promised to pay this morning   205.48852566607923
i inquired of you if poisons acted equally and with the same effect on men of the north as on men of the south   69.5452217258039
how   109.26961701463604
i promise my lord replied mordaunt   94.48503532024591
one of them was made of debray château renaud and beauchamp   90.29397586181302

thanks father thanks   35.15266938324284
d artagnan s friends reminded him that he had a visit to pay but at the same time bade him observe that there was yet time to retract   112.36151049037042
he then returned to the captain said a few words to him and as if from that moment the vessel was under his command he ordered a maneuver which the crew executed immediately   68.85943665992325
and morcerf with a forced smile arose and making a low bow to m   119.47724251474165
no   40.102469152946085
there s ten o clock striking at greenwich   72.0369543142877
you my poor child suffer poverty and hunger   121.18677751822531
said mazarin thoughtfully   84.3896957342395
d artagnan replied that he had been sent thither by m   191.3461806200304
but to what do you attribute this conduct   129.44712669931644
athos took the paper returned the pistol to his belt approached the lamp to be assured that it was the paper unfolded it and read dec   162.9037663680999
the pharaon left calcutta the 5th of february   52.52073868893842
and it will be so far advantageous to you to accept my services that upon edmond s release from prison no further change will be requisite on board the pharaon than for dantès and myself each to resume our respective posts   190.48902328561178
then compelled to quit rome he went and got himself obscurely killed in a night skirmish scarcely noticed in history   139.76423872331702
conscience what hast thou to do with me   125.41797760079584
murmured athos thinking of d artagnan and porthos   75.52858500893132
i would rather have had a hat said d artagnan   74.35138513124892
there were two palaces and a vineyard behind the palatine hill   140.02817109224637
it is a color very well known in botany but till the present time very rare among horses   154.42969836141555
that s a good idea for it isn t warm   79.1488610575711
i will go and see about that and then we shall have the honor of presenting ourselves to the general and receiving his commands for his eminence   84.89066586953864
and when they were two hundred yards outside as the frenchman became somewhat too forward beppo put a brace of pistols to his head the coachman pulled up and did the same   144.2533883568488
milady shut the window extinguished the lamp and went as felton had desired her to lie down on the bed   121.10808963901104
no   129.93532825962922
they sailed   138.92536610008418
murmured villefort   98.52688276441779
i swear to you you shall receive the consolation that you ask   38.6440780628391
well said raoul the poor man will get his priest but by heaven the penitent appears to me to have a better conscience than the confessor   145.97129503627497
which asked he the viscount or the count   139.0269760079265
motives of hatred against dantès   97.89478196039148

i should myself have recommended the match had not the noble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to it   160.42741307556213
what occupies him in england   138.59897623159415

the abbé busoni said la carconte   92.38966923269
here is a letter which must be taken to its address   113.314580799079
i seem to hear the noise of a troop of horsemen exclaimed porthos leaning over his horse s mane   85.00494017428505
no sir said d artagnan   95.45012031206429
your guardian   52.76024190694824
felton lowered his head without pronouncing a syllable   176.03600641024525
that which was given to me assuredly   131.90274079559003
said the governor to the jailer who had charge of the abbé   190.90463817572845
40046m yes   171.98836319601202
said the same voice in the same commanding tone   134.6398218595888
oh come gentlemen my master is ill   96.93179950091852
valentine shall come down into the drawing room   167.71209069631684
chapter 20   50.39868148550346
exclaimed debray   209.92845969337242

i am pleased sir to hear that   130.30478848288402
then i should advise you to leave off wearing that style of dress   175.5888475324704
the weak man talks of burdens he can raise the timid of giants he can confront the poor of treasures he spends the most humble peasant in the height of his pride calls himself jupiter   68.16167684395319
that is to say with our enemies   75.11478988306769
it is well understood that he did not breathe a word about the other   97.12203940034661
to you i will say have you not madame put aside some of the surest deadliest most speedy poison   81.7093280315116
what cried athos are you selling my horse my bajazet   88.11371103190126
as soon as she perceived him she cried you have promised your protection   206.90422785791316
he borrowed this from don quixote the only book he had ever read but which he still slightly remembered   107.38009932519945
then turning to the prisoner what is it you want   27.344316619911666
garters of deerskin worked with a thousand arabesques and a hat whereon hung ribbons of all colors   5.623892897125927
but this expression was fleeting as the reflection of lightning   29.402266814594867
the fifth of september the extension provided for by the agent of thomson french at the moment when morrel expected it least was to the poor shipowner so decided a stroke of good fortune that he almost dared to believe that fate was at length grown weary of wasting her spite upon him   222.41550517836504
five minutes had sufficed to make a complete transformation in his appearance   103.71913492005692
how so   104.97165795270088
yes i insist   108.60415162985785
nothing nothing   168.68751164677994
ah   73.04965707236138
whether i am in my senses or not answered franz that is the way i feel   56.40176177441044
how soft and perfumed was the air   130.60261514651822
valentine rushed towards him   54.1750750009909
we are both of us able to kill you and your eight men we two only   152.38260869959643
then about twenty minutes afterwards the gentleman would also leave buried in his cravat or concealed by his handkerchief   135.33332689922472
this time we were the vultures   158.36269255479854
never mind   14.275775397544962
having recognized the laced hats of his companions and the golden fringe of the cardinal s cloak he waited till the horsemen had turned the angle of the road and having lost sight of them he returned at a gallop to the inn which was opened to him without hesitation   14.129870020052408
yes and france is about to pay for her king s refusal with a war   59.57467079275836
at what   69.95443759452132
rich   173.34063156375183
they both mingled as they had leave to do with the servants and peasants   113.69316091422503
a minute   86.02914125426491
do you not guess monsieur   95.01286535909341
only do not allow me to be insulted   8.244132653753951
what would you do   113.66442154026544
then while madame de saint méran remained on her knees praying fervently villefort sent for a cab and went himself to fetch his wife and daughter from madame de morcerf s   140.35251945186374
you will learn horsemanship swordsmanship in all its branches and dancing   68.30497232178455
in a tone of reproach ah monsieur i had your promise as a soldier and your word as a gentleman   59.7575560849507
a surgeon   88.65681429813556
monte cristo looked upon morrel with indescribable tenderness   170.93214610759696
surely if i am culpable and if i ask for pardon i ought to be forgiven   163.55880888338464
bonacieux   88.79854523294502
whilst he was thinking that he should first taste the liquor which the tankard contained before taking it to his companions the door of the cellar opened and a man with a lantern in his hands and enveloped in a cloak came and stood just before the hogshead behind which grimaud on hearing him come in instantly crept   117.1736458916919
he rose in his turn and seizing handfuls of confetti and sweetmeats with which the carriage was filled cast them with all the force and skill he was master of   196.55960875691645
as the rochellais who guarded the bastion were ignorant of the intentions of the man they saw coming toward them they fired upon him and he fell struck by a ball which broke his shoulder   117.0257180204582
poor things   143.57623444790835
mr   150.71760832490043
loose half drunk imposing the king s musketeers or rather m   197.28844791474785
exclaimed the baroness   107.78258277063769
no   114.99486248362446
yes   139.27705265093087
have you neglected to obtain information on that point   89.84895545743905
you are a provident person i see   185.16116928357042
then he disappeared after throwing a farewell glance on valentine who slept with the confidence and innocence of an angel at the feet of the lord   103.72122862943809
villefort knew not when he should return and renée far from pleading for dantès hated the man whose crime separated her from her lover   147.64118825485505
de villefort   84.9948173312759
well then he deputes me to give you this   50.90774971782102
yes sir   108.01791097544782
and if i were a woman and fate had made me a banker s wife whatever might be my confidence in my husband s good fortune still in speculation you know there is great risk   119.15571418216281
no   64.76561685388019
and what did these two sovereigns give you in exchange for these magnificent presents   134.48219523274196
and now your excellency he added bowing his head you know everything you are my judge on earth as the almighty is in heaven   235.33584864400711
cried the duke opening the door of the chapel patrick   90.87341687826788
here said he to him are the diamond studs that you came to bring   131.70670711648157
there are loaded pistols in your holsters   57.5910226011399
and the guardsman   181.54125944757152
on receiving the warning letter you wrote to me i had this woman arrested and gave her in charge to a loyal servant   74.576298022173
and so being beautiful witty somewhat talented as the comic operas say and rich and that is happiness sir why do you call me unhappy   130.5177728781835
well that tends to confirm my own ideas said franz that the countess s suspicions were destitute alike of sense and reason   121.04080332284481
i drew near and found he was bidding a hundred pistoles for a chestnut nag   192.92073863663063
an idiot who held the life of lord de winter in his hands and did not kill him by which i missed three hundred thousand livres income   42.057869259301995
monte cristo is a little island i have often heard spoken of by the old sailors my father employed a grain of sand in the centre of the mediterranean an atom in the infinite   115.27989516516541
danglars   109.78633098407603
the captive who was the source of so much alarm to the cardinal and whose means of escape disturbed the repose of the whole court was wholly unconscious of the terror he caused at the palais royal   107.65733124103595
this very day   136.9959659666926
consequently i shall marry my daughter to the baron franz d épinay because i consider it would be a proper and eligible match for her to make and in short because i choose to bestow my daughter s hand on whomever i please   123.64182267069563
i dread almost as much to receive any tidings of my vessel as to remain in doubt   59.895838814662454
and then sir do you wish me to speak freely to you   106.27034500015179
but this is indeed civil war which you propose to me dear aramis   179.96274869234392
he found the troop in the glade supping off the provisions exacted as contributions from the peasants   174.335167735265
his costume of guardsman in the company of m   210.07450939572578
sir you know well i would risk my life for you   128.05798066257918
poverty overtook you   190.22687364710453
my lord i ought to have a fortune of six millions but it has been taken from me   118.83305638119344
no with the baron   39.08606960411042
the result of these reflections was that d artagnan without asking information of any kind alighted commended the horses to the care of his lackey entered a small room destined to receive those who wished to be alone and desired the host to bring him a bottle of his best wine and as good a breakfast as possible a desire which further corroborated the high opinion the innkeeper had formed of the traveler at first sight   105.81230499032492
valentine whom we have in the rapid march of our narrative presented to our readers without formally introducing her was a tall and graceful girl of nineteen with bright chestnut hair deep blue eyes and that reposeful air of quiet distinction which characterized her mother   74.25972494321081
cloud and not elsewhere before the d estrées s pavilion and not in another street   147.2627038526535
oh of the most unfortunate kind monsieur   128.64007698484914
that is he wounded in the shoulder   200.01139995671144
i hope so   105.91651134365677
he said   16.70995342076975
why   132.38830137247172
50189m oh   80.69656120471794
then the foolish criminal is taken imprisoned interrogated confronted confounded condemned and cut off by hemp or steel   40.558808707997926
then if through excess of love i have rendered myself culpable toward you you will pardon me   63.04664527610533
her elbows were placed upon a mean table and she leaned her head upon her two hands which were white as ivory   115.29651567476809
i mean to say that when i came in although i had the key of your apartment in my pocket and that key had never quit me i found a letter on the green table cover in your bedroom   140.67245309946173
said the count   58.41057075342723
you first mousqueton and he stopped his friends directing the valets to go first in order to test the plank leading from the pier to the boat   43.55865226307668
i am afraid that what was first done was unskillful if not worse than useless   107.11533234854716
yes   32.423052824388265
the marshal then entered the rue saint honore but there he was opposed by the barricades of the mendicant of saint eustache   134.9504389723185
said the major half aloud   115.10027745774781
monsieur franz is his friend you know   99.32277651483601
good   213.42399138464407
monsieur de chavigny handed his cane to monsieur de beaufort   10.722613038619315
the queen do you say   71.05338518914886
attention then   89.35066589700828
but i ought to be gone too   182.70419586275744
someone was taken in the mousetrap   111.25224436685107
the two musketeers were already there and were playing together   181.66792518815407
75   152.40355340002927
the child conceals it   210.31532854509737
monseigneur your eminence is a hundred times too kind to me   71.89508108735825
20057m maximilian smiled   155.89940208366096
but the two young men sought the privilege of passing the night together and it was accorded them   112.76741419740438
inquired the king   95.88022687145025
no not at all   176.9497157122388
i recalled to my mind that the moment of vengeance or rather of justice had struck   111.88488828547744
that is just said richelieu   224.1174935801027
alas said d artagnan it is because i am the most unfortunate   63.73862744459823
when do you leave   159.22818757338734
observed debray   30.216092995332573
he turned towards the fortress and looked at both sea and land   87.25713218500664
the door opened and a dim light reached dantès eyes through the coarse sack that covered him   140.1152239941572
i am even sorry that this evening i almost repulsed but there will be a conference to morrow and we shall see   195.29034667616543
d artagnan shrugged his shoulders   61.70054504835
on one side was the vast wilderness of the saint lazare on the other paris enshrouded in darkness   98.1000946681451
the second a good soldier like porthos   138.76325466935825
he returned to london at the first sound of war   84.65058861438135
oh the admirable police have found that out have they   127.22787769703366
so in reaching the walls which surrounded the palais royal the cardinal knocked at a little door and after thanking d artagnan and requesting him to wait in the court of the palais royal he made a sign to guitant to follow him   53.2569366025556
so i think replied d artagnan   233.42012588969607
said the curate mechanically   198.2941358285164
gentlemen continued he addressing the guardsmen i request you will be silent with regard to this adventure   70.38342739228665
so that thanks to her friend s generosity teresa was the most beautiful and the best attired peasant near rome   79.03393047350244
it was mercédès who hearing no news of her lover had come unobserved to inquire after him   131.96983265733402
but proceed i beg of you   104.06831353785066
this door was guarded by a sentinel and there was also a guard placed in the courtyard ready to obey the orders of the prince de conti s lieutenant   99.05684759249797
during the last hour his own crime had alone been presented to his mind   43.61550579300227
when the time for action comes you shall be put in full possession of what i require from you   155.71125871225473
athos whose keen eye lost nothing perceived a faintly sly smile pass over the lips of the young gascon as he replied we had a short discussion upon dress   92.41844643192495
what is the matter dear grandfather   167.47219865907346
asked athos   115.72273367659481
in the concierge that opened the gate the count recognized cocles   180.12316570034082
we have undergone a great deal of fatigue remember and a little rest will do no harm   251.85585714442885
alexander vi   88.7825815125098
by the way said the major you know i have only the 2 000 francs which the abbé busoni sent me   177.53184720932066
with this cloak you will not be cold   163.07004048873637
with all my heart replied the marquise   146.0273916316181
poor dear woman said debray she is no doubt occupied in distilling balm for the hospitals or in making cosmetics for herself or friends   166.2660167454926
cloud   81.40925698539147
i shall adore god sir said raoul respect royalty and ever serve the king   52.999336648543796
so my dear viscount whenever you wish to be regaled with music come and sup with me   151.99762511209713
you will find my will in the secretaire in my bedroom   167.26672708438042
the travelers had chosen crossroads in the hope that they might meet with less interruption   164.15731965119278
but your father was not allowed to fall   126.22303715486268
are you a doctor   126.58077482319496
i did not seek one i did not ask for one   147.80657518741856
there is no danger dressed as i am in this pilot coat on a night as dark as this   100.37522733572327
the morning air has made me hungry   80.54183031604083
i shall be at your orders said monte cristo bowing   73.21499366935338
it will soon pass away and as he said so the old man s strength failed him and he fell backwards   104.7024815090563
asked morrel quickly   127.0203450721629
he and the count de guiche are like each other s shadows   105.02057312557857
then he will be able to give us an answer tonight   95.19700390424882
it is as if you said for example chastity modesty innocence it is a kind of baptismal name as you parisians call it   207.13556266149942
he saw a lady a fashionable elegantly dressed lady and yet the door remained almost closed   35.93605191043203
cromwell placed his hand on a hidden handle and opened a door so well concealed by the tapestry that the most practiced eye could not have discovered it   102.14603037086431
you are too late madame   84.94254130133348
every soldier must be ambitious must he not   32.94130272769006
edmond replaced on the table the bread he was about to devour and returned to his couch he did not wish to die   65.09050319776297
do you wish for a name   18.214002998345833
how can that be   146.3630454532259
albert repeated danglars shrugging his shoulders   136.46316213271302
eagerly inquired the two youths   98.59900869265049
rich   153.0243528499405
well asked franz what think you of the count of monte cristo   44.23474909860424
come come calm yourself madame puritan or i ll remove you to a dungeon   99.24464807882626
one was a young man of three or four and twenty who was in love with m   147.2083131723984
mousqueton duly instructed was put at the head of this sudden and new business   52.07596353790305
if anyone comes call me   85.13400646139632
germain   132.23373034655887
i ridiculous   79.41272869110779
and if the worthy broussel were there whom you so stupidly helped arrest i should tell you to excuse yourself to him at once and kiss him on both cheeks   155.0009299545474
four in the king s room two at the door between the rooms and two at that by which the friends had entered   125.17546995725719
asked milady   182.0602111286347
the story volume two chapter 28   47.531102047311165
but through the door she fancied she saw the luminous eye of the count that eye which lived in her memory and the recollection overwhelmed her with so much shame that she asked herself whether any amount of gratitude could ever repay his adventurous and devoted friendship   92.27098234418773
go and tell him the ring is his d artagnan and bring back the two hundred pistoles with you   188.701521231051
on the same day the cardinal received this letter the king put his customary question to him   132.55246537553188
i must tell you resumed mazarin that it is in a double envelope   128.73069872821875
no mysteries no cloak to hide one s self in no cunning policy here   167.95232884531475
no he arrived accompanied simply by the guest i am going to present to you   130.11861555019172
said caderousse   84.92377662233662
no aramis replied   99.66072399702149
what does the executioner   144.31789616757163
there was a third point in view which will appear hereafter   130.87030449754312
do you speak spanish grammont   178.2141101385619
no doubt she fancied the count would speak to her while on his side the count thought she was about to address him   150.26733788514503
now an enemy is never so near and consequently so threatening as when he has completely disappeared   108.49721595556164
here is night coming on   87.0174832321211
de villefort held a high position in the magistracy and maintained his eminence like a harlay or a molé   97.79537988829482
de tréville announced this good news to the three musketeers and d artagnan inviting all four to breakfast with him next morning   61.722965708686566
we appear to make a very sorry figure here   124.26437073418032
so that you have lived for three months on sixty francs muttered edmond   65.83138018570398
i am a gascon said i only when i succeed   140.5456377994803
so then   107.8739948802536
wait then wait   167.44063999461267
where you please returned monte cristo since i know nothing at all of it   161.41144988331553
at the appointed hour i shall be ready   142.1096984500706
replied tréville haughtily   224.90932471552716
unlucky for my stomach is getting more and more upset   116.15677426560693
said château renaud i would rather end my career like m   149.78600846329257
anne of austria cast her eyes upon the treaty that d artagnan presented to her   42.02033834013643
because they have but fulfilled the mission confided to them by queen henrietta and we have betrayed that confided to us by mazarin   123.49063922110135
i also have made my preparations this morning   67.36962639396401
asked porthos   34.18135347456183
gondy bowed respectfully   98.72703044815128
what do i see in it   60.45492933526343
well said the baroness do you leave m   64.86522373303112
she gave albert no sign of her existence the morrow or the day after   152.09619937194765
said she clasping her hands forgive your child for being the bearer of evil tidings   51.74723121696046
then my keeper would begin to trust this man and to depend upon him and i should have news from those without the prison walls   71.40231728507143
then i have full occupation for i am so   140.1257284399462
the irony with which these words were uttered did not escape the marechal   122.39734335016989
monte cristo gently smiled and said i was there   87.3158893465435
ah   99.01885041005411
you are not guilty toward me and i have already pardoned you   134.75842918472938
sir said d avrigny to villefort so loud that all might hear poor barrois has led too sedentary a life of late   10.210920780271707
he is calling you said the count   32.846447451555136
you know he always has wise advice to give   128.67469400572784
or the holy blood i will spit you all like ortolans   111.63455481391458
they are sixty feet high and i doubt if monsieur de beaufort is sufficiently weary of life to risk his neck by jumping off   84.3141032437525
dantès was on his bed   86.4747672710129
i no longer begged for liberty but memory   128.57911186079215
an apology on the ground   31.032231601275
tis this when we escape together that i shall go everywhere and be always first   211.04828788970173
i m your man   139.65428785361848
the hand of your time piece will not be more accurate in marking the time than myself   77.75191137488027
ah good evening my dear m   61.838371522743415
the cousin was received with resignation that was all   193.37964322237525
you thought to make us unhappy strangers trot at the heels of your processions like so many lazzaroni because no carriages or horses are to be had in your beggarly city   106.44805326569985
i require honorable guaranties   50.66077269896567
i know nothing certain   181.3136471920779
do you not remember   197.25318276194565
yes   50.98021336902785
the pharaon   30.36042633146114
to tours   84.5180725017371
how can i tell   118.88430640527073
said d artagnan to himself   110.41417159243399
was not that nearly what you said   118.13590239953186
i only request you to give me one by which i may have the pleasure of addressing you   222.081421203462
cried anne to humble myself thus   95.60130493864179
twelve hours delay was all that was granted that is until nine the next morning   9.546690125079579
that is to say the sudden disappearance of his mistress and the wound in his shoulder   218.03979016605703
to your house dear porthos at pierrefonds   153.24572339278245
what says the abbé   169.7504211038634
did you not say she was dead   80.89853888258102
ah you fellows are good managers   239.99241946852658
the gascon is full of ideas said porthos with admiration   51.19610072172512
athos smiled   2.44555168011361
from you   124.86144990449773
asked bernouin   127.48697361407409
he pushed open the door and found the first room empty and deserted   88.60353219081676
my dear athos he said i am going away   28.778492228603184
i am a friend of the count s   113.27459121015734
but buckingham in vain tried to make out the writing   125.43525292503759
that is precisely what i mean said danglars almost digging his nails into his breast while he preserved on his harsh features the smile of the heartless though clever man   78.65613632379782
it was the first time franz had ever seen a guillotine we say guillotine because the roman mandaïa is formed on almost the same model as the french instrument   183.89275858853847
this chance did then for him at once more than he would have dared to ask of providence   170.1698062603915
only remember on the 5th of october morrel i shall expect you at the island of monte cristo   115.27785024834716
what can she do in it   145.90200732475782
cardinal mazarin as king   42.16044561377794
and he signed it rapidly after having first run his eye over that part of the deed in which were specified the situation of the house and the names of the proprietors   66.42338390421617
tell him also that i am acquainted with all the details of the adventure at amiens   134.96408729830844
wait a moment said monte cristo   100.91037994739376
has it ever happened to you   23.31175193288216
40190m these words restored albert   128.68850177256843
this to me who expected but to find a blank enclosure surrounded by a straight wall is i assure you a most agreeable surprise   145.75212036126328
said the king with hauteur   51.435467471299305
as mademoiselle de scudery remarks   101.68609836056903
the valet entered   189.87669013426114
to remain silent and dignified in his presence   145.32590765284658
the prince procured for marie michon the dress of a cavalier and for kitty that of a lackey   125.29468508305328
twice or thrice during the dance the young girl had glanced at luigi and each time she saw that he was pale and that his features were agitated once even the blade of his knife half drawn from its sheath had dazzled her eyes with its sinister glare   12.750758803226574
what the devil my dear do you think you can wear a star from heaven on your finger and nobody observe it   166.120319386797
if there were any danger to be apprehended on the road i am going i would request you to accompany me   146.4904238069001
but my correspondent has disappeared   175.02546621560992
mazarin s face smiling as it was became clouded   92.12483654016643
then it appeared to him that monte cristo smiled not with the strange and fearful expression which had sometimes revealed to him the secrets of his heart but with the benevolent kindness of a father for a child   230.15904935250816
it is my turn to be of use to her   129.57834541115378
exclaimed julie   167.00467646145907
the procureur shook his head   145.45042028616996
then you pity me   176.1078743957625
said caderousse emptying his glass here s to his health   169.30971044785383
make your mind easy he is in good hands   111.88523863670878
this could only have been accomplished by means of unnatural strength supplied by powerful excitement   90.0073907906511
several times even i felt a smile on my lips   58.16758377529893
then replied m   63.40366805065609
rent the air and thirty blades glittered about their heads   108.48487314200325
deschamps the notary that he received from the postman a small billet which he knew to be from valentine although he had not before seen her writing   29.388662020920876
the president rose appointed three members to accompany him and got into the carriage with the general after bandaging his eyes   181.5845228524089
now he is gone it is your turn to get out said mme   137.5697167633261
yes among your friends of other times   57.40441178719078
that is all   103.55557547925149
said the young man   107.57986573035912
d artagnan passed to the head of the column and leaving his friends under the guard of porthos went straight to harrison who recognized him as having met him at cromwell s and received him as politely as a man of his breeding and disposition could   24.194142728780093
immediately i hope   6.587007537853964
what   105.20700998854224
they told him so frankly and he received their excuses with the air of a man who appreciated their delicacy   130.67994067452835
oh that coat is not his own idea   137.19221305134838
oh yes   61.908391146157385
you may count upon me my lord provided you want to make a complete upheaval of the city   204.77103153419455
ah the young rascal stealing in a garden he does not know where that may lead him to   132.53180685369085
i have seen a ghost   203.79463886722942
ah   103.24919184604823
valentine whose heart is pure as a diamond or a lily   112.36731619579795
more than once the king had been humiliated by the cardinal whose police without having yet attained the perfection of the modern police were excellent being better informed than himself even upon what was going on in his own household   110.22732459478134
i am a great captain that i am   41.25018983554463
bazin wore his dress it may be observed with equal dignity and saintly propriety   189.76018491348606
that s my room replied groslow   142.98204991868027
that if the astrologer in question made almanacs i would advise him not to buy one   27.332903363805386
to the great lady she had given a heart vile and venal   85.48188587384547
i will not detain you monsieur continued the countess   141.2332758179083
i think it would be well to sleep here and to start again very early to morrow   151.82606178413988
i was indeed said the stranger with a tone of sweet melancholy and with the sonorous voice peculiar to the east   108.81155452409627
d artagnan said athos gravely i assure you that you do me wrong in dwelling so upon that   107.66107851715968
help me   195.94947793438047
at any rate said she since i am to be married whether i will or not i ought to be thankful to providence for having released me from my engagement with m   132.98157985532137
you owe me an explanation and really it is but fair that i should know what circumstance has occurred to deprive my son of your favor   66.17435400717852
it seems to me that it is neither your majesty nor myself who can charge himself with such a mission   108.21350016526789
impossible said madame de villefort   125.32188859905756
his eminence sent me   175.7848515797026
you have my word monsieur and here is my sword   80.05521877185733
they directed their horses to the city   160.8519033455454
now then asked albert eagerly have you found the desired cart and oxen   71.43135583157328
but how could a dose prepared for m   210.57451434952577
and yet notwithstanding this want of respect he felt an uncontrollable passion for this woman boiling in his veins passion drunk with contempt   142.73167689691783
port wine   198.71158790725636
cried his custodian gaily   78.80704040461515
no bring me all four together   199.464959551273
the nasturtiums and other plants which his father had delighted to train before his window had all disappeared from the upper part of the house   128.55411438608604
he looks like a big bug said another   193.07989497446948
it was evident that if they one day learned positively that they must not count on buckingham their courage would fail with their hope   75.07144864659416
oh then my father has really a very large fortune count   116.83696580171932
my dear athos i shall no longer count the number of times i am indebted to you for my life   82.26004158050691
no my life has been passed in frivolity   3.779963299574561
morrel smiled with an expression very like a grimace and then turned round to monte cristo as if to ask him to extricate him from his embarrassment   138.2791512133952
you sent me away   181.3498492698833
so much so that yesterday i would not take the two hundred francs   134.19116377279158
they have some business with you i think from what they told me the day before yesterday   83.82107647512808
however my resolution sir is unchangeable but you have only to search for yourself and you will find alas but too many objects upon whom to exercise your benevolence   199.52236024589365
you blackguard   11.2400772776693
i regret not having heard them   139.65110869720522
i mean that behind the misfortune which has just happened to you there is another perhaps still greater   105.58763194415276
where is my son   84.51124807854657
noirtier cast on barrois showed that there was something wanting which he knew where to find   29.30884174009492
well   146.74634340940338
d artagnan turned aside to conceal his ill humor   154.82673783481778
a transient pallor overspread the speaking countenance of the prime minister   59.60369682717389
the favorite of a great lady will not be allowed to be inconvenienced for such a paltry sum as he owes you   159.13113842668307
it seems that they have been looking very far away for it while it was actually very near   75.2213846121359
and very likely i may not have to go so far as the prison to effect that   209.31430109508568
i have the payment under my hand   101.60257102677022
what a dire misfortune   78.24993838287367
precisely   77.30196385945271
so would i said porthos   159.7466506848592
without the loss of an instant the carriage was placed on board and the two travellers embarked without delay   49.64461170166862
i leave that to the princes   56.12474804596502
at ten o clock every one was in his appointed position   175.9454732496401
or rather i will go for him myself   102.32448635359131
greet each other then   176.775447123612
you were telling us about the extraordinary death of valentine   127.51928337083353
about seven in the morning andrea was awakened by a ray of sunlight which played warm and brilliant upon his face   175.11225742751844
a good journey gentlemen   109.73627468401591
no madame i did not say as much as that replied the count with a smile   130.1568748530918
farewell monseigneur   168.5458829963062
as that poor edmond will not have long to be loved by you   88.19786424609657
yes monseigneur   210.02769906318576
demanded he of the cardinal   124.49738867323947
oh   86.90579243737574
anger mounted to d artagnan s face   162.80084541619092
it is from no personal ill feeling towards the viscount that is all i can say sir replied danglars who resumed his insolent manner as soon as he perceived that morcerf was a little softened and calmed down   134.73101750304505
this battle won by me the king will have no further resources in england or in scotland   180.2302569395732
but for the intention only for the information you must agree is not likely to be at all agreeable   42.954334025811164
planchet grimaud bazin and mousqueton presented themselves and received clear positive and serious orders from athos   76.6158531459223
perhaps he never came here or if he did cæsar borgia the intrepid adventurer the stealthy and indefatigable plunderer has followed him discovered his traces pursued them as i have done raised the stone and descending before me has left me nothing   119.61874964004967
he had just expired with clenched hands his mouth in a spasm of agony and his hair on end in the sweat of death   68.42225959082808
presently the army came in sight of lens   140.24268695620685
to whom then   178.74823137333192
well said he let us go to valentine   111.36332084918865
murmured the dying man that they may not separate us if you save me   112.35639011768029
and drew upon us a patrol of archers   106.56526587433301
upon this occasion an unmistakable sign from madame danglars intimated her desire to see albert in her box directly the curtain fell on the second act and neither the politeness nor good taste of morcerf would permit his neglecting an invitation so unequivocally given   62.783282758622605
i hope that you will sometimes too think of me and if at certain hours you should miss me if you should feel any slight regret at my absence i shall be overwhelmed with joy at the thought that you appreciate my affection for and my devotion to yourself and that i have been able to prove them to you whilst i had the happiness of living with you   149.6390102647888
and by what   146.82749644629908
7   140.2310720944875
but it was risking the failure of our plan to come up here love   154.2188291591038
good bye albert said beauchamp suddenly carelessly extending his hand to the young man   85.80900321268295
asked the count impatiently   137.23441365887425
then they shall go for him directly dear grandpapa   138.33423138616985
the count was no longer young   87.06297549785208
very well said d artagnan i consent to bazin with all my heart but grant me planchet   17.409557130067682
there it is   117.9371405228275
diavolo   91.0179136987773
said the astonished athos   57.59342167516013
morcerf alone knew not why such profound attention was given to an orator who was not always listened to with so much complacency   122.53809909070908
asked the young girl with the velvet eyes   94.41701138863206
at the noise he made in pushing the bolt milady turned round   236.09479600228727
for the people had learned that broussel and blancmesnil had made speeches in their behalf and although the eloquence of these deputies had been without avail it had none the less won for them the people s good will   203.54494498826182
he was in the country as i was told by the person who recommended him to me   75.18960425238767
now in 86 400 seconds very many things can be done   135.9314223916208
your position as secretary to the minister renders your authority great on the subject of political news   64.72551045676431
porthos replied that in all probability his sprain would not permit him to depart yet awhile   119.02899941733997
please follow me and he went on before followed by athos and aramis   93.78892018096464
indeed you give me more credit than i deserve   72.21593961963535
ten minutes afterward she was at home   122.2832185093316
40130m no he wished to speak to your excellency   122.13443035465667
ah ah   141.75451353352437
i maintain my original resolution   100.05719862018987
my opinion is that on the ground the drunken man was not intoxicated   150.60546682851952
haydée s arms fell by her side and she uttered a deep groan at the same time looking towards the count as if to ask if he were satisfied with her obedience to his commands   60.55173862406175
he had been struck to the heart by a frightful recollection the conversation he had heard between the doctor and villefort the night of madame de saint méran s death recurred to him   203.31235882954107
while d artagnan was running through the streets and knocking at doors aramis had joined his companions   41.57804445262367
and athos sprang into the boat which was immediately pushed off and which soon sped seawards under the efforts of four stalwart rowers   185.58189860377007
you forget that i am her best friend   112.13377912664649
let our readers reassure themselves   61.70019923513168
30 the miser in molière s comedy of l avare   150.48141233471324
the day after to morrow is a holiday   128.18988150275743
asked the sweet silvery voice of mercédès   142.50581626048069
we are all invited my father madame de villefort and i at least i understood it so   44.21206760741629
you have acted kindly count in bringing me back to the place where i have enjoyed so much bliss   112.56439859292355
what can be done with four   109.60940461269891
gentlemen cried the coadjutor tightening his sash which he wore after the fashion of the ancient military prelates over his archiepiscopal simar there s the enemy approaching   167.96368197802104
said athos   82.91037591737121
the english do they dislike wine   9.831456596661553
well i think andrea stopped and looked around   69.11144628274825
the red duke is capital   94.660436576547
as soon as you feel able to swim we will go   113.55260193794281
ho   50.483738753008055
speak one word madame and i take upon myself to punish him for his want of courtesy   108.09065384389754
when you like   161.28186836422753
de morcerf has any enemy   143.0893920490325
speak   129.22993285010085
and how old were you at that time   15.74656937765505
but dantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man   181.15761902320054
do you wish me to do so   206.7694331517461
he had been seen falling from his horse and had not been seen to rise   164.3020983589902
and the matter created some scandal which obliged me to renounce the cassock for a time   101.95612386257386
said grimaud he is coming out   138.36288198004542
exclaimed baptistin eagerly   126.99481326431926
there is not a hope replied faria shaking his head but no matter   116.21889566059737
in that case said d artagnan i begin to believe that monsieur de la fere will receive the visit of his eminence   104.0822370734787
do you love me still   119.27501622980267
the aldermen did as they had done before and preceded by their sergeants advanced to receive their illustrious guest   119.51803346103891
yes devotion   168.51924540690726
two one here and one there   79.54975430929886
twenty times he interceded for edmond   210.32873358221366
d artagnan was secretly touched with remorse not at inducing porthos to enter into schemes in which his life and fortune would be in jeopardy for porthos in the title of baron had his object and reward   169.70229527022488
oh indeed i can not permit you to go   175.56216815082814
said the captain   115.17870382635394
the orientals are stronger than we are in cases of conscience and very prudently have no hell that is the point   99.63327181690849
you will see that i had no time to learn it   109.03591772742207
that is not a family name   157.6588261952794
said de winter   99.10491982119052
monseigneur well well said the cardinal i don t wish you any ill   139.21660463446344
you have seen your dream realized   115.60933667298029
he waited silently striving to pierce through the darkness   183.1277360621832
is there no merit in repentance   84.9879232305332
grimaud turned round with a jerk recognized me and pointed to the man in the mask   117.10348017022655
stay sir said anne to him   144.26280621417135
it was the voice of a cavalier mounted on a magnificent black horse who was charging at the head of the english regiment of which in his ardor he was ten steps in advance   46.673768100083834
at the end of ten minutes fifty thousand lights glittered descending from the palazzo di venezia to the piazza del popolo and mounting from the piazza del popolo to the palazzo di venezia   143.45389471954508
upon your honor   214.94462387360062
what do you say to a thousand crowns   113.98383796965575
pah   53.75218589121929
the first squadron moved off   144.66282815720893
then you will start after the queen   155.77206111967155
it was still more impossible to remain in the department of the oise one of the most open and strictly guarded in france   149.21129136668918
are we mistaken and is dantès triumphant in spite of all we have believed   114.994491275588
god gave that spectre the form of the count of monte cristo when he at length issued from his tomb enriched him with gold and diamonds and led him to you   111.94665827488393
at first the king answered that he would not go   79.890253270618
and i will save them all   174.86145749651098
the light was so faint in the room that albert did not perceive the pallor that spread itself over the count s visage or the nervous heaving of his chest and shoulders   13.74580622219166
during our expedition to béthune the husband of my duchess died   152.72292361999308
and with my grandfather s consent i shall fulfil the promise which i have made you   149.6062194125442
the horses are waiting   141.06560253485048
she is quite well replied danglars quickly   78.42765569734654
and certainly his handsome features lit up as they then were with more than usual fire and animation seemed formed to excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful and intelligent lover   156.331945208469
he said to himself   66.16641173624332
blaisois a tall simple youth who understood nothing but what he was expressly told asked therefore for the abbé d herblay and in spite of bazin s assurances that his master was not at home he persisted in such a manner as to put bazin into a passion   158.70256938160765
ordination   42.6271388741459
you were asking then   174.4370800537429
grimaud nevertheless was resolved for certain reasons not at once to come to a full rupture with the prisoner   183.57223097880728
can he be inconstant before being happy   94.1776482513887
and instead of the proper and lofty speech he had prepared as a prelude to his challenge he found nothing at the tip of his tongue but a gross personality which he accompanied with a furious gesture   138.43156815911416
something in his favor   70.4120730678099
i monseigneur knowing that dueling is prohibited i seized a bench and gave one of those brigands such a blow that i believe his shoulder is broken   2.31757954647523
do not be uneasy you little coward   123.9070946387965
how is it that it has escaped from the depths of the tomb and the recesses of our hearts where it was buried to visit us now like a phantom whitening our cheeks and flushing our brows with shame   196.29560888838319
asked monte cristo seeing morrel return   130.784506658887
we are not of the same religion   88.03189899284152
yes said grimaud with his hair standing on end   90.7148605948442
good evening m   100.48294518885754
my end will be achieved before i grow old   143.70583227976945
certainly a call to the visitors room had scarcely astonished andrea less than themselves for the wily youth instead of making use of his privilege of waiting to be claimed on his entry into la force had maintained a rigid silence   107.21942008877883
sir the distance will be diminished said a subordinate   152.29629524632637
monte cristo stopped and examined it attentively   100.17938132959728
no one had taken up the remark about the general and no one had recognized in the officer who betrayed the castle of yanina the noble count in the house of peers   147.8402283350848
i thought for a long time that he was dumb   101.46216075499319
have i not already told you that there is nothing between me and the duchess de longueville   166.29283472202115
count returned signor pastrini hurt at albert s repeated doubts of the truth of his assertions i do not say this to you but to your companion who knows rome and knows too that these things are not to be laughed at   238.21133062662855
porthos effaced himself against the wall but he could not render himself invisible   130.61144327824755
asked château renaud of debray   144.41951525681966
absolutely monseigneur   178.53124341100465
row   28.52481279586037
yes   149.61214906027294
oh this is too much   103.94978530595853
muttered villefort saluting the minister whose career was ended and looking about him for a hackney coach   28.922088276226276
the universal response was that the fare was detestable and that they wanted to be set free   22.451262951241702
in fact the pursuing vessel had almost overtaken them when fortunately night came on and enabled them to double the cape of corsica and so elude all further pursuit   74.67416224118205
yes you are right d artagnan a fatality that will separate and ruin us   115.38432287261149
friends he said we must leave this craft at once or we are dead men   125.65680364745184
said the president   175.9282559045779
my father was endeavoring to pierce with his eager looks the remotest verge of the horizon examining attentively every black speck which appeared on the lake while my mother reclining by his side rested her head on his shoulder and i played at his feet admiring everything i saw with that unsophisticated innocence of childhood which throws a charm round objects insignificant in themselves but which in its eyes are invested with the greatest importance   91.11841997316967
give him money if he is recommended to you and the recommendation seems good   67.9244604724189
have you wanted money father   222.6957960908486
yes and at his age alexander cæsar and napoleon who have all made some noise in the world were quite behind him   234.1797026498633
winter then left the tent   217.6344896803161
let us be off gentlemen let us be off   66.38678657080341
you are now on the right path said the count crossing his arms over his broad chest   112.07365427921573
they were those we rode on   140.1873937394736
pray said the lackey say nothing about it monsieur   66.5974323711375
chapter xxxiii   96.83613828640536
there is so much fog in that detestable country at least so d artagnan declares   78.05844972046648
he was too very learned and rational enough on all points which did not relate to his treasure   110.6161744477142
if you received the work on a physical medium you must return the medium with your written explanation   111.83608979064314
gather your strawberries if indeed there are any left   74.37511436039222
she continued when my mother recovered her senses we were before the seraskier   253.5057658010755
for being friends of m   124.23591764690863
20333m certainly your excellency   183.27065140090824
saturday   138.23358710899987
murmured d artagnan   120.79469873456262
porthos s chamber is you say on the first story number one   111.82759906312566
i say so and i repeat it for the third time   119.36411915605896
there are a few things that you can do with most project gutenberg™ electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement   102.41008516407037
so you are not a mazarinist   131.88258978573674
the fellow is not so drunk as he appears to be said danglars   97.89316742561935
here am i milady here am i   6.279027582197145
i have come therefore to discharge this duty and to express to you my overwhelming gratitude   145.59729926998025
the chieftain of the party drew near   242.71800865948165
it is a rock of almost conical form which looks as though it had been thrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean   154.8114754093546
then d artagnan disposed to become the most tender of lovers was at the same time a very devoted friend   32.62583254674598
i am waiting for no one replied d artagnan who was beginning to be angry   127.47667120664673
it is madame danglars   124.23480799279301
you mistake sir said morcerf with a gloomy smile   52.5647979097147
oh   293.4280150409329
athos in his turn rising without speaking went and unhooked his sword   107.20858935577955
the voice and gesture of the man who followed danglars ordered him to do the same   86.2800509701454
mordaunt bounded with one step to the cabin and kicked open the door   161.60464141101875
shall i row you ashore   98.81916389829928
the four friends listened and the sound of the drum plainly reached them   53.22832534047975
what promise of future reward have you made me for all the submission and obedience i have evinced   76.98534421023066
on our arrival we began to discharge our cargo in the night and to convey it into the town by the help of the innkeeper with whom we were connected   156.19100014868343
mazarin listened intently   15.32581828511887
the eyes of the mendicant dashed with cupidity but he quickly suppressed his emotion   229.91778232838334
raise money with it and let your husband set out   160.27687109830185
he uttered a cry   156.64458528981956
what is the matter then   90.38651286711229
andrea reached the anteroom beyond the little drawing room   159.31798645509969
if my brow be severe it is because many misfortunes have clouded it   139.3112293329216
i should have cried i should   37.162225455913145
a learned italian seizing in his arms the friend so long and ardently desired dantès almost carried him towards the window in order to obtain a better view of his features by the aid of the imperfect light that struggled through the grating   178.8251778770292
ah   109.6471037744688
nevertheless if you wish it i am ready to go   113.95838425963265
and you know who i am without doubt   54.5808692679739
horrible   135.13332639521434
well you wished to conceal your journey from me and yet i knew of your arrival half an hour after you had passed the barrier   213.83034832514375
mazarin felt a shiver run through him a chill even to his heart s core   50.06082716157347
the successor of father marteau who makes the excellent pies you know of   135.42322453510732
albert was not deceived for the next evening franz saw him enter triumphantly shaking a folded paper which he held by one corner   91.00640456177896
afterwards he was made to promise that he would not make the least attempt to raise the bandage   103.60357421909504
well that s a good one   152.00597759066815
at last said aramis we are ready are we   107.76211860968375
i was tutor to his nephews who are dead   127.65648660553708
danglars watched these preparations and his mouth watered   140.19459634872214
three or four times he has said to me and certainly without the slightest premeditation at such a period i was five years old at another ten years old at another twelve and i induced by curiosity which kept me alive to these details have compared the dates and never found him inaccurate   168.723953310578
and i perceived with terror that a man was standing within a few paces of me   183.86668219628055
he was induced to undertake this journey of which the day before he had not even thought and which had not occurred to andrea either by the arrival of bertuccio from normandy with intelligence respecting the house and sloop   142.78318635573146
well   41.68653945855583
he raised his head and appearing to be perfectly sure of privacy ah ha he said here you are peppino   40.36348562449541
then you must suffer hunger   74.39030608290527
mousqueton trembled in all his members   162.62939008904058
when her hands were loosed he took some sea water and sprinkled it over her face   78.98455869064487
a light cloud passed over the count s face   273.160063481016
ruined yes that is it   92.38967500166449
therefore i will retire for i can not endure the sight of blood   94.28322156290194
franz had already made seven or eight similar excursions to the colosseum while his less favored companion trod for the first time in his life the classic ground forming the monument of flavius vespasian   133.56887757593717
and m   165.85461529918976
this kind of life fatigues and oppresses me   74.9510728301768
those devilish scotchmen are always thirsty   55.70437660733834
but however great was the power of this woman with eyes of flame in reading the hearts of those whose secrets she wished to divine she met this time with a countenance of such impassivity that no discovery followed her investigation   125.0568332749524
come gentlemen come   122.10574586372213
yes you   71.17790856166042
and mint and hoffman s drops are among my favorite remedies   9.470706459783443
i should like however to comprehend said porthos   61.16498388898927
ah bah   107.26800012176163
will you sell him to me for that sum   3.5224573660822216
thanks thanks said monte cristo judging from the steward s utter prostration that he could not stretch the cord further without danger of breaking it   209.70079684903052
the face of the steward despite one slight shade of care light as a summer cloud seemed a physiognomy of absolute felicity   116.44828325587999
just now before i came down to you i drank a glass of sugared water   148.81850928474591
to all of which her husband would calmly return an unvarying reply in these philosophic words hush la carconte   163.74535360788218
the councillor placed himself at the window   96.81720782575556
is it not a curious affair   183.0769258707458
from time to time noises came in the direction of the public markets   74.07375101581597
in order that you may not doubt the kind intention of the writer of this letter you will find enclosed an order for 2 400 francs payable in florence at signor gozzi s   90.93360791981799
then raising his sword sound trumpets   96.44825920635927
athos cast a glance at his feet hands and hair those three marks of race   114.89386687866559
bonacieux pronounced these words with tears in her eyes   11.901572337571835
when they reached the side of this felucca mordaunt dexterous in his eagerness for vengeance seized a rope and climbed up the side of the vessel with a coolness and agility very rare among landsmen   123.19300192592483
you were sent by some other person   133.12340687373995
down with mazarin   93.84730851840031
0041m explain yourself   3.102226572362582
and we are not always twenty years old   147.7527337839617
bonacieux wore a mask and likewise that that mask was most disagreeable to look upon   157.70708262456884
pardieu   146.63680920687833
madame said athos when must we set out   168.15929868610635
cried porthos   69.46653872976883
and if it were not would be sure to become so thanks to the remedies applied by foolish doctors who are generally bad chemists and which will act in favor of or against the malady as you please   132.47748435730762
d artagnan who had unceasingly maneuvered to gain this point was not at more than three paces from it   50.196643867582836
i think i shall feel better there   122.3147511134114
well then that is settled   249.03331496819138
d artagnan knew that although a gascon m   155.0326946194744
my father who was such a brave soldier whose career was so brilliant oh well he will add we are warranted in believing that this fernand is not the illustrious count of morcerf who also bears the same christian name   98.5354993597884
d artagnan who had been at first the most eager in pursuit of milady sat down on the stump of a tree and hung his head covering his ears with the palms of his hands   68.50814904864191
enough said morrel   70.26866792194666
my lord i have been so long shut up that i am only of one party i am for fresh air   145.51629840922888
paternal affection   18.45471366001763
monsieur de tréville said the cardinal with the greatest phlegm does not tell your majesty that this innocent musketeer this gallant man had only an hour before attacked sword in hand four commissaries of inquiry who were delegated by myself to examine into an affair of the highest importance   184.14873291751888
d artagnan at once comprehended that this was his recompense   157.5595414990617
the duke who had latterly been allowed a fire burned the letter but kept the ball and went to bed hiding the ball under his bolster   134.78159855797108
pardieu   102.64687500672683
scarcely had he shut her door when mercédès called a confidential servant and ordered him to follow albert wherever he should go that evening and to come and tell her immediately what he observed   96.67719898993377
has the queen any further commands for me now   161.57068419715225
no no continued d artagnan it was not the measured step of a foot soldier nor was it the gait of a horseman   137.52011585260598
cried d artagnan the cardinal is about to visit the comte de la fere   26.28474784545304
it was at the traitor s cross that his journey and his destiny were about to end   141.67164649468762
but your wife monsieur what has she to do with all this   116.15163022463688
how so   114.26951174800675
not so   74.77215022965083
really i think the thing very difficult   150.77600301161357
now in the opinion of d artagnan it was certainly the man in the black cloak who had carried off mme   168.44221607928785
but i must make you see this time that it is too late to retreat   98.87236837364426
eh   95.3683846154742
yes   138.92886962784047
nothing said milady smiling with that painful expression which she knew so well how to give to her smile   151.64493846305666
what i hate to day i adore to morrow and vice versa   82.44926240274975
know of the existence of this treasure which   79.27877447910323
i will send word to the governor   153.89179071427213
and thou planchet   64.29324016261504
and i don t know whether it is the game which leaves no scent or the dogs that have no noses   192.13691325591714
and i will be bound that sooner than relinquish any possible means of vengeance he will allow himself to be beaten to death   102.15316119041842
in the first instance to marseilles madame   170.740125852897
and rather than not recognize the guilty purchaser they will recognize twenty   74.84327077459209
cried the host   233.66893266834398
asked athos when he had closed the letter   97.45469467987049
she fell into so deep a reverie that her eyes gradually closed   139.44740503564017
faria started have you indeed   208.36814032106497
we shall be driven by a state councillor   88.97691162902876
i shall get nothing from these fools he muttered   55.05316425753401
for during his fainting we rummaged his valise and found nothing but a clean shirt and eleven crowns which however did not prevent his saying as he was fainting that if such a thing had happened in paris you should have cause to repent of it at a later period   66.65026303172017
among the turks   107.81612207617296
what is it   95.36241821798053
haydée would it please you not to leave me   214.3634897410699
only during the respite the absence of his rival afforded him he reflected partly on the means of deceiving mercédès as to the cause of his absence partly on plans of emigration and abduction as from time to time he sat sad and motionless on the summit of cape pharo at the spot from whence marseilles and the catalans are visible watching for the apparition of a young and handsome man who was for him also the messenger of vengeance   12.128619130540486
thank you i have just returned from sea   128.55404779924962
in ten minutes luigi and the traveller reached the cross roads   12.87724608992491
yes yes i see   211.96081526225112
waiter said danglars pen ink and paper   139.96484283506535
he who has negotiated these matters forgive me if i begin by speaking of myself but i must claim that importance which has been given to me not assumed by me he who has arranged matters for the return of the cardinal ought it appears to me in order that his reward may not be unworthy of your majesty to be made commandant of the guards an appointment something like that of captain of the musketeers   75.31569976434972
he feared that the emotion of his voice would betray him   109.6763981219026
but be easy no blood will flow   33.44864175703211
i am really sorry to go away without having seen grimaud   96.50248514833368
this is a fruitful soil and i feel certain that the seed sown will not be cast on barren ground   99.56115612214373
the count was it may be remembered a most temperate guest   89.68384932147143
mademoiselle herself packed all the medicines which were sent to m   117.30166879619144
by my troth yes   125.75290179743288
the number of lights had been intentionally diminished but the young woman could not conceal the traces of the fever which had devoured her for two days   137.7865814207879
as for myself that i may put you at your ease i tell you that i am generally called sinbad the sailor   189.0393151271873
you raoul not sleep well   95.21884010679126
well replied monte cristo it will be the way everybody says of trebling your fortune in twelve months   145.6572749054544
but i have sworn to kill that man   82.86369585170725
you must take grimaud and olivain   177.42998642483064
the two immediately started across country toward the road to paris followed by mousqueton who after being too cold all night at the end of a quarter of an hour found himself too warm   249.2373683876646
at the same instant the eyes of the little group were fixed on the same line which at daybreak they had mistaken for fog and which the morning sun now plainly showed was an army in order of battle   5.050732411963423
this league was directed against france   101.92122020415177
the count had learned that the two friends had sent to secure a box at the argentina theatre and were told they were all let   95.80555038586998
yes almost said aramis   82.76746762452126
excuse me sir said franz since m   115.16716876770845
he was a man of execution this worthy porthos   116.58824795526964
she looked like a woman destined to live to be a hundred years old from her apparent sound health and great activity of mind and body   74.97660529092325
albert found in his anteroom two guns with all the accoutrements for hunting   116.47130481328902
no sir   87.97033145485238
these are melancholy doings your reverence which always fall again upon the poor   68.18338028929873
i was inspector general of the pasha s troops replied morcerf   69.97501804363944
monsieur porthos was six feet high   223.69619428696686
now i have confessed to these learned ecclesiastics and that in all humility that the duties of mounting guard and the service of the king have caused me to neglect study a little   126.88112591127987
the cardinal therefore rose to open it   112.13397951409252
very well let us say no more about it   130.91965015597455
i have been thinking of your firmness all night and i said to myself that justice must be on your side or man s countenance is no longer to be relied on   125.27346183800567
your honor in the library of the chateau of bracieux there are a lot of books of travels   170.05490274923403
you are not hurt   30.82238675700556
you have had three horses foundered or killed   100.74933518393868
the corsican ogre chapter 12   80.27007545186086
he looked to see if the dish of beans was still there   69.00232400656826
m   36.98123626247471
cried the man in the skiff   161.15412858975762
we had anticipated this kindness on the part of the count said beauchamp and i have brought some weapons which i bought eight or ten days since thinking to want them on a similar occasion   142.53746237397624
therefore if you part with m   153.07295167786347
it is a miracle it is a providence that we have not been discovered   87.58038728306722
the strangers were indeed no other than the count and haydée   196.25621236036199
and you are right my dear la ramee said the duke wiping away the sweat that stood on his brow wide awake though he was   157.84164070268463
the queen bent in token of submission and followed the ladies who were to conduct her to her room   194.022498841737
when he reached the door a stream of people who had been disappointed in not being able to get into the house and to make amends had collected to see him come out stood on each side as he passed many among them glaring on him with threatening looks   96.17558652093463
asked he by a gesture   102.4248408276755
he was nay probably may still be a bonapartist and is called noirtier   22.77735769158876
then let them explain themselves   61.142158081970265
having said this villefort quitted the room with his wife leaving his father at liberty to do as he pleased   177.59158759045275
and as i am going to the red dovecot myself i shall know if you have told me the truth   58.0946662778115
i do not want you   146.79763126330448
that s good said albert with a gloomy tone   186.04589253258143
yes the queen   68.4879139853245
very well said albert extending his hand   212.0090491176212
and supposing a second restoration you would then pass for a great man   170.5818478830447
thought d artagnan   106.21069584010363
this athos was connected with three young musketeers named porthos d artagnan and he stopped short   104.64763078001107
and eugénie with her usual precision opened a printed paper and read m   98.36016654454252
and driving the coadjutor s carriage   59.971369267219245
if paris has injuries to complain of who has not some wrongs to be redressed   111.84770703489919
danglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that overwhelmed dantès   134.37873040581732
sir replied bazin the true friends of a christian are those who aid him in working out his salvation not those who hinder him in doing so   183.50853074383232
so that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy prisoner at the same time   100.23641004230777
in fact milady still held the harmless weapon in her clenched hand   154.7177490987009
and who told you about it   112.91112629723456
perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no room for such thoughts   25.414628705740498
the queen bit her lips and moved impatiently on her chair   95.67400178419359
but dress me as well as you are able only make haste   75.70657413501195
as for the remission of your sins we have the archbishop of paris who has the very greatest power at the court of rome and even the coadjutor who possesses some plenary indulgences   150.3069056899527
that it is i who have opened the others which ought to have been opened by de wardes   132.32393026355905
milady smiled and d artagnan felt that he could damn himself for that smile   167.3952545008845
this money was for her   76.20934450894856
aramis read the letter and passed it to athos   105.43042263739298
so you know beforehand you must perish   97.51960202090375
pack up all you want for a journey of a fortnight and follow me   36.77296093876457
but do you not remember that he spoke of the fact to you   177.20881957650425
answer me without acting as if you were on the stage   171.4795621370024
tomorrow my angel   51.94726744153867
andrea was indebted for this visit to the following circumstances   113.78360776422093
d épinay in order to give him the opportunity of himself renouncing his claim to the hand of mademoiselle de villefort   21.18930429856084
peppino mounted the seat behind   25.207308207995624
and all the sovereigns of the earth even cæsar borgia himself could not deprive me of this   120.12423239871747
at times there passed before me clouds which pressed my brow which veiled my eyes   42.33951659432155
you offend the good god   58.61905971747719
fernand answered mercédès shaking her head a woman becomes a bad manager and who shall say she will remain an honest woman when she loves another man better than her husband   65.21882219706526
and you porthos do you only wear such a fine golden baldric to suspend a sword of straw from it   139.01522526587993
he found that he was in a grotto went towards the opening and through a kind of fanlight saw a blue sea and an azure sky   121.12014315104737
he advanced slowly toward milady who had seated herself and taking an end of the murderous rope which by neglect or perhaps by design she allowed to be seen what is this madame   188.1609340472099
chatillon bowed in token of assent and they all went out stopping at the window of a gallery on the ground floor   144.78961661095147
it was too insignificant an occurrence to delay people so eager to get on   107.67042805484736
in malta i forget what   153.6580450516602
you can tell within ten crowns   108.44047735827807
the king quite delighted inquired if the cardinal was still at the louvre   105.39778814354396
we have had a narrow escape   76.33929967504045
at least you should tell me what i should have to do in london replied bonacieux who remembered a little too late that rochefort had desired him to endeavor to obtain his wife s secrets   53.00089396147213
marie michon oh what do i not owe you aramis   18.2778151149696
he told him that he came from paris on an affair of life and death and that he must speak with his master instantly   186.05959019224377
the bell summoned him to his seat and he entered the orchestra with château renaud and beauchamp   121.0090975087768
no   125.63764173887591
entirely   147.8755710999661
asked madame danglars   93.66015781512733
your majesty on your side said d artagnan is as much mistaken as to our intentions as the cardinal mazarin has always been   132.1320893629342
me   142.72943704819048
and you will please to accept the word of monsieur d artagnan that he will go straight to la rochelle   147.12251052783114
to any one not acquainted with him he seemed to be in his normal condition   56.328966836318344
ali will drive   117.14305173521124
he recalled to his mind the details of the first night and with a beating heart and a brain on fire he re entered the hôtel and flew toward kitty s chamber   105.61022818868386
and since i do not give it said the musketeer   174.73883285302023
well such things have been   66.57023429089614
lord de winter passed before the door without stopping and they heard the noise of his footsteps soon die away   225.71652124682333
vade retro satanas   47.32645433928354
that would be useless   81.84325656338072
very well as far as i could judge from the sight of him   112.03355349126424
but she made an affirmative sign with her head as she lay on her father s breast   221.0354245055658
be kind enough madame to listen to me said danglars   34.09869285204218
said milady in an anxious tone   74.04465114726608
sir my right hand correspondent redoubles his signals   159.58325512372554
haydée saw at a glance the same expression pervading the countenances of her two auditors   117.50887721929509
the door was opened and the young men eagerly alighting found themselves opposite a cicerone who appeared to have sprung up from the ground so unexpected was his appearance   123.33581956119954
and you have them   124.60466588839425
but how   93.95194366124173
porthos my friend said d artagnan don t distrust providence   108.90309633961067
perhaps i turned pale and trembled but certainly i smiled   113.19726342707479
no no do not be deceived   157.42667151908515
ah but what is the matter with your hand d artagnan   107.34892113006501
porthos kill every one who stands in your way   138.29735487882635
there s nothing in the wake of the ship   138.64820138370317
last night after we left you   11.751084582891508
the duke took it from under his pillow and gave it to grimaud   4.195626688012354
in thirteen throws i had lost all in thirteen throws   138.09883843099695
de wardes   142.90879757502267
grimaud made a sign in the affirmative   199.85838803726782
i have warned m   33.548376260208215
he was in bed but surrounded with all the paraphernalia of war   165.77780658625363
ring then if you please for a second knife fork and plate and we will dine together   85.09477308122248
said porthos   155.67373958548967
my dear sir the government is rich and does not want your treasures replied the inspector   79.89612403824492
fernand rose impatiently   78.24739554689278
judge if i should not put myself under its protection   136.78522834345324
d artagnan shrugged his shoulders made a sign to his escort and started   54.374525424607796
said athos   57.04228380588329
formerly replied bazin aramis was his name of perdition   211.64759500230315
he was an irishman one of the most skillful of his craft and who himself confessed that he gained a hundred thousand livres a year by the duke of buckingham   109.16290089158147
touches upon the strange effects a half pistole may have   172.3392320356233
he did not see a fissure without introducing the blade of his hunting sword into it or a projecting point on which he did not lean and press in the hopes it would give way   172.7874183637373
inquired the stranger   122.45577392590998
you know of my engagement to louise   11.904111744433905
there is a providence   78.47278401074732
chapter viii   78.54623272155435
whereas on my honor monsieur de chavigny though i ve been here a week has not ordered so much as a tartlet   184.02727407064197
50109m certainly he said your receipt is money   46.143617770920585
but i think i remember that there was a question between him and monsieur mazarin as to making his estate a barony   69.7897668775999
you say she is in a convent   71.6304801261887
and the count placed the packet in the man s hands   117.15989276039765
it was at this moment of discomfort that the inspector s voice called him to the visiting room   115.26417659291258
i can not believe continued felton in a voice that became more sharp and rough that your grace knows that it is to milady de winter this relates   176.17361020092116
asked d artagnan with anguish   145.74922205539926
they arrived thus screened by the lining of the trench till they came within a hundred paces of the bastion   61.154428110124144
speak sir speak boldly replied louis   153.66728889892653
tell the angel who will watch over your future destiny morrel to pray sometimes for a man who like satan thought himself for an instant equal to god but who now acknowledges with christian humility that god alone possesses supreme power and infinite wisdom   45.34008563740872
replied signor pastrini with the air of a man perfectly well satisfied with himself   134.66500874543348
then the musketeers for two and twenty years staunch friends of d artagnan   169.93458629774685
well my dear aramis you don t want three horses   1.1776200997219064
as for raoul he remained bewildered with what he had seen having been forbidden by d artagnan to leave the room until the tumult was over   177.50831409263054
however difficult it might be or rather as he pretended it was to astonish our young traveler this pastime really astonished him   4.529304467974228
40306m volume five 50009m 50011m 50019m chapter 96   232.94565721651955
i have said what i have said   18.615850099850633
we therefore represent six fighting men   113.65170658897519
he placed his hand on his dagger and stopped   263.59289213461693
the third proceeded to barricade the doors and windows then returned and the three united in stifling the cries of terror incited by the sight of these preparations and then dragged assunta feet foremost towards the brazier expecting to wring from her an avowal of where her supposed treasure was secreted   142.28293227495325
ngle in the second   30.82712335606233
his person had undergone a change analogous to the change in his dress   119.7041733640955
such are my reasons for not liking to marry mademoiselle danglars   92.45487573815662
said dantès wiping his brow with his sleeve   123.05269672565817
the family name was fully given   140.2641526006929
she cried   67.85877716948417
i am indeed most wretched replied mercédès   174.35665038478484
demanded villefort turning over a pile of papers containing information relative to the prisoner that a police agent had given to him on his entry and that already in an hour s time had swelled to voluminous proportions thanks to the corrupt espionage of which the accused is always made the victim   151.35634856813584
go there   139.15972797092599
no   98.78894112287111
captain said felton this is the person of whom i spoke to you and whom you must convey safe and sound to france   118.58395466206267
my lord   47.562284690517785
they merely attached a heavy cannon ball to the feet and then threw them into the sea   72.54326702883034
unfortunately the qualities of this horse were so well concealed under his strange colored hide and his unaccountable gait that at a time when everybody was a connoisseur in horseflesh the appearance of the aforesaid pony at meung which place he had entered about a quarter of an hour before by the gate of beaugency produced an unfavorable feeling which extended to his rider   75.6145460006682
d artagnan rattled the gold in his pockets   23.719567765630742
reckoning still further that as long as you do me the honor to remain in my house i shall never speak to you about rent very kind   140.1945554048027
good   98.42437233161901
say no more i entreat you   84.37638929077065
i require the proof of a pre engagement   154.83257795108986
you are silent   106.2480077420176
only a few minutes ago they brought me the tavolettas   90.82085928187234
asked buckingham as he opened the letter   60.76521428876314
said valentine and she endeavored to recall to mind all the things which he would be likely to need   77.59535817171587
as you wish then   145.2423916548968
such was albert s opinion of the count and as franz well knew that albert professed never to form an opinion except upon long reflection he made no attempt to change it   142.2652850066969
do not conceal anything however serious let us see the island of elba is a volcano and we may expect to have issuing thence flaming and bristling war bella horrida bella   56.38847401836164
i do not think so added château renaud with the air of a man who knows the whole of the european nobility perfectly   126.16423470948301
besides it does not seem very dangerous   77.5436216438791
yes   49.60629461062082
do you say the procurator s wife is old and ugly   124.4484740394694
god sends me this and i hail it joyfully   93.67914994378549
cried rochefort   191.14058539577024
villefort shrugged his shoulders   45.45900012268501
but i am wrong to dispute with my master   180.5190671414336
besides i can find my way about the city with my eyes shut   142.6696676011876
give me your arm and let us go   121.06680613959155
well said monte cristo what do you see in that to annoy you   59.200982456509934
the young men impatient to learn the cause of the firing spurred on toward the servants   10.11249904648588
ing invited to dine by his holiness   114.70452867151874
that great man who was so revered by d artagnan the elder served as an object of ridicule to the musketeers of tréville who cracked their jokes upon his bandy legs and his crooked back   151.84472871407525
de monte cristo at the opera yesterday he apologized on the ground today   10.2123857873857
the reference is no doubt to the wistaria frutescens   116.57948845585913
i see   86.92842411456112
thank you monsieur you are not brave enough to be of any use to me whatever replied mme   157.50733984886716
at the sound of the key turning in the lock and the creaking of the hinges dantès who was crouched in a corner of the dungeon whence he could see the ray of light that came through a narrow iron grating above raised his head   208.99033845727013
in person   144.69223455968972
it will make a little change   121.0337317309423
and me also said porthos   72.43120600231626
all now replied la ramee   97.44391585474399
dust i am and to dust i return   21.00185504785334
peste   136.4076972487585
by the light of one of these torches d artagnan perceived men in uniform   58.12743875961696
yes but after you had fired off your thirty thousand guns they would take the donjon   0.6017306073548241
at his door he perceived a figure in the shadow that seemed to wait for him   103.87142360439839
sir said valentine my grandfather wishes for a notary   64.1551239347622
20181m this precaution taken they went to the theatre and installed themselves in the count s box   96.63911462130947
i am going to fire   130.93162483314927
is he not the son of general d épinay who was on our side and who was assassinated some days before the usurper returned from the island of elba   121.37503360474048
well replied the latter blushing what must i say   41.42965817846306
said villefort   144.88484490620877
my lord de winter continued athos what is the penalty you demand against this woman   77.15489527952147
but if i can serve you in any way i shall be delighted   34.69954825369132
then it is danglars   101.72110040532897
are you there now   122.48574028368019
i alone am to blame for the indiscretion   170.84783667200398
i see you are spoiled dear friend   67.2562007280716
now then what do you say to that   85.23566108399123
are you willing that i should this evening pass with you the time i generally spend with your mistress   41.55375447305953
nearer nearer still   44.57615235369752
a man wishes to see monsieur at home replied bazin   95.27233080994728
thought d artagnan in this direction i am satisfied   133.38058137006863
and yet said milady with a persistence that proved she wished to see clearly to the end of the mission with which she was about to be charged if he persists   175.58068853582063
poor dear girl   80.86308903315776
it was time for just as i jumped the deck burst with a noise like the broadside of a man of war   57.757502646547096
athos   21.40797738612659
then caderousse sat astride the coping and drawing up his ladder passed it over the wall   135.02078891476376
for according to the advice of aramis it was prudent to sow repasts right and left in prosperity in order to reap a few in time of need   139.4633498420243
but whom are you seeking debray   169.58603283481855
i have no right to it   91.34612106806739
conclusion epilogue author s preface in which it is proved that notwithstanding their names ending in os and is the heroes of the story which we are about to have the honor to relate to our readers have nothing mythological about them   168.9978770448912
those studs were enclosed in a little rosewood box which he held under his arm   171.86396994611687
ah it is you monsieur   123.0260026419719
an hour passed during which dantès excited by the feeling of freedom continued to cleave the waves   46.463925763818565
that s right   125.45976135589657
alas   142.7831827941241
franz and albert descended the carriage approached the palace   124.60262309950038
no i did not know it   218.09117801656237
the captain gave him a loaded carbine   118.53229916521536
for i am low very low   164.61083610737245
the truth is replied dantès that i am too happy for noisy mirth   139.40025783966763
i understood from edmond that she was the daughter of a simple fisherman beautiful but uneducated   147.79153114636824
still i agree with you in thinking that my present ignorance of the first city in europe is a reproach to me in every way and calls for immediate correction   73.13706624210977
impossible   113.56736156740888
poison death   92.28778916951153
the right idea has just occurred to me   73.9484702119369
now jump onto your horse and let us overtake the carriage   144.5742678038996
i put this creditor off till tomorrow and i intend leaving today to escape that tomorrow which would be rather too unpleasant for me to endure   180.7484005510122
a new source of noise and movement was added to the crowd   76.77553602565862
yes yes mazarin continued whilst his wonted smile full of subtlety lent a strange expression to his pale lips   113.11991257690255
de villefort   206.3202949014825
and your business is that of a confectioner in the rue des lombards   100.65264015911383
the stronger reason why it should be sold replied athos   98.52989705374233
porthos and aramis were so engaged with their game and athos was watching them with so much attention that they did not even perceive their young companion go out who as he had told the guardsman of his eminence stopped outside the door   99.06348736387709
permit me to thank you   112.01681605422381
faria at the age of fifty had devoted three years to the task   124.11808375739025
and he had no doubt but that with his eccentric character his characteristic face and his colossal fortune he would produce a great effect there   116.1903916568316
these words made a favorable impression on behalf of the accused   81.10695045501092
come you shall take charge of the money i of the jewel box   148.3811727617672
i have finished mine   15.924285992249196
but he flew into terrible rage   56.45840477091866
the revolt is at the door of those who think my people can rebel cried anne unable to dissimulate before the coadjutor whom she looked upon and probably with reason as the promoter of the tumult   40.05903521309152
cried he throwing himself on his horse   30.01527748544551
there was the crime bertuccio that was where you became really culpable   62.32780881850299
continued athos shaking his head mournfully upon my soul you make me the most miserable of men   61.920723373692695
morrel will have nothing to reproach us with we have tried to save the ship let us now save ourselves   99.0578397681348
franz arrived to sign the contract just as my dear grandmother was dying   199.0163374945946
about two hundred persons had accompanied her in her flight   57.79872921175589
it was the portrait of a young woman of five or six and twenty with a dark complexion and light and lustrous eyes veiled beneath long lashes   129.25272121405223
my lord fronde is the name the discontented give to their party   205.19737760112156
he listened all was silent as it had been for the last three days   157.4139978079669
come no hypocrisy   55.365689768763744
and is that all is that all   56.01109522417213
there are the horses   189.07161199667428
fortunately twenty times at least from misanthropy or fatigue dantès had received his jailer in bed and then the man placed his bread and soup on the table and went away without saying a word   126.78794246436652
the fingers resumed the jesuit st   33.34075701119205
in the meantime d artagnan was defiling with his company   59.13709822719245
the stranger placed the point of his sword at his throat   137.64277077029146
with 200 francs we can reach marseilles   102.31615455472043
do you leave me   66.71134810838555
alas yes   25.149338540657055
we must now only think of you my dear friend and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your flight possible   60.89509095591953
but athos took his arm and passed it under his own and the young man was forced to regulate his pace by that of his friend   116.50548153617947
the duke smiled with bitterness   104.28593782693393
i swallow every morning a spoonful of the mixture prepared for my grandfather   144.17049266739005
that my orders go far madame   52.813572397228974
asked the officer   37.77042379256436
that head has never conspired murmured he but it matters not   65.84818298252975
my lord as to the report you allude to guitant perceived that the cardinal wished to make him speak out i know nothing but what the public knows   100.58893410506975
i am the bearer of a letter that is all   110.11359506018367
when pressed they will confess everything   164.5679400933074
i am sorry to have had anything to do with this matter   17.38364313800909
my dear fellow   138.53030869487054
why   189.1235727141989
the ball contains a letter   131.5923970778755
oh yes was the ready answer   99.51913921446209
well now let us talk a little seriously said milady in her turn drawing her armchair nearer to d artagnan s chair   146.3068908945992
dantès was occupied in arranging this piece of wood when he heard faria who had remained in edmond s cell for the purpose of cutting a peg to secure their rope ladder call to him in a tone indicative of great suffering   91.7312913710393
he might have been executed at that moment without his making a single gesture in his own defense or uttering a cry to implore mercy   176.84707453768516
and he was obliged to confess to himself to the shame of the procurator s wife and his own regret that he did not see that fire that animation that bustle which when a good repast is on foot prevails generally in that sanctuary of good living   94.15892791050464
that will make me at least partly happy   106.36141802721458
m   141.63047296677922
said the patron   124.35594527562905
d artagnan burst out laughing at the idea   70.34625478856638
you must stand in need of repose   117.6108468967587
the yard was empty   72.39027557811073
said grimaud   228.3416087077826
well sir by the help of two signs with which i will acquaint you presently you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather is still in the full possession of all his mental faculties   82.58570728618997
i believe so said the major   13.30033738301671
ah monsieur   50.472171280201806
you must have had enough for today   142.87615748485493
and that his eminence was incapable hold your tongue   67.61330620847333
well said the young woman what you dreaded has happened   177.9123894816368
then through an opening cautiously made the policeman began to watch the length of the rue cocatrix as if he was waiting for some one   148.02582990199102
the two children met sat down near each other let their flocks mingle together played laughed and conversed together   94.63304148026864
but to return to these registers   207.85910429095628
his first remark on entering was you know sir i do not speak french   113.56109303434762
yes said athos doubtless you would commit great follies   54.7689978869632
inquired one of the officers who accompanied the governor   159.08993927975726
his heart failed him   160.1247566656556
as to d artagnan he remained standing like a man in consternation with the deepest affliction depicted on his face   114.36466305947657
when we have a fog   70.3848954328361
asked d artagnan   60.7194873733752
oh you are a thorough democrat said monte cristo smiling   77.69998522524465
i value your friendship and feel grateful to you for your welcome for this is the first time for many years that i have thus yielded to my feelings   109.02780093783845
d avrigny opened the door and took from the hands of the chambermaid a cup which contained two or three spoonfuls of the syrup he then carefully closed the door   79.87195130787224
exclaimed villefort unable to repress an exclamation   121.94100569424776
the true nobility laughed at him the talented repelled him and the honorable instinctively despised him   153.52512557633642
cried d artagnan whose impatience was increased by the disregard of the authorities athos where is he   70.57048982579148
true   184.5220467577858
oh   67.87981130944911
being no disciple of cagliostro i was wholly unable to do this   120.32137884559343
as he touched the ground he opened his eyes   156.90039448470924
but stop   72.6813707207899
at least he believed so   104.74404468177747
the other one the gardener s   115.58696821388735
didn t i say so   12.50934240654611
you bring me down to your own level and demand explanations   94.97989797187728
i a protestant   48.62004623275445
well you may be assured that your horse will not be half so serviceable to you for that purpose as good golden louis   47.75409205435186
he had scarcely gone ten yards in the street when he perceived that he was followed by a man wrapped in a large cloak   54.21669297160553
it was at this moment that people came flocking to the scene of action from all sides   146.4703780924715
the thieves had already approached andrea some screaming la savate la savate   108.37891574153491
they ll be afraid and will disperse   69.28867887672178
bernouin took up a candlestick and led the way   73.9927805033474
a man was introduced of simple mien who had the appearance of a tradesman   184.4007231576614
alas how gladly would i exchange the half of this wealth for the happiness of at least sharing my father s love   169.4438917209011
asked the king   119.7737182552265
asked franz   19.48480488387169
if my pardon be complete we shall return triumphant to yanina   79.64046977524995
will you not come with me   96.11077628060629
would you have given up the letter aramis   75.34932687282439
as i said monsieur lubin did not know me and told me our adventure from one end to the other   44.99807296310192
a carriage was to await you at nice   151.41122014326527
it might have been thought that he hoped the beverage would be mortal and that he sought for death to deliver him from a duty which he would rather die than fulfil   156.91438226511062
you have a sad air   158.10732571819813
a note which you will find at home will tell you   94.82879056173671
one morning the gardener went to him and told him as if to please him that he was going to plant a bed of asparagus for his especial use   76.95483102442847
porthos however found that he had no straw left for himself   28.375857624120584
i repeat my words aramis and then if you desire it and if they desire it let us separate forever from our old friends   148.23758382216732
but it has not been so with me i see and always have seen during the last sixteen years   177.79991748328865
gone murmured valentine   158.4331433189056
don t you remember said the patron i told you that among the crew there were two corsican brigands   102.77155191798201
no   107.04871416983565
said he however far i may come it is not you who can give me a lesson in good manners i warn you   64.8575185013364
he was well known at the hôtel of the musketeers where everyone considered him a good comrade   70.7621890809659
and you   154.8417934118988
don t be afraid said he smiling   44.867417240726894

chapter xxiii   110.49035005094608
the same evening when the flock was safe at the farm the little luigi hastened to the smith at palestrina took a large nail heated and sharpened it and formed a sort of stylus   65.74567383416596
and he felt from one cause or another that this woman was his own as she could look to no other but himself for a support superior to the danger which threatened her   114.76910567847216
before his departure the count went to haydée s apartments told her his intention and resigned everything to her care   155.6082418793398
you can not but perceive that all this must end some way or other   197.076395284554
but for pity s sake spare my life my honor   99.73094036704376
but i repeat it to your grace without your having personally on that account more to thank me for in this second interview than for what i did for you in the first   120.88685474299513
upon my honor   230.98644775426538
but the soil was moist   52.833020055330316
this is the case said d artagnan   185.58357937994708
it was a chamber whose furniture was at once appropriate for a prisoner or a free man   182.24571164325778
i trust all this will soon be taken away   198.2654497793459
i follow you   46.506011354476215
i thought we agreed for the price i asked   160.1526731876419
continued caderousse half rising and with his fist on the table hallo edmond   170.60212791513896
do you believe then that at the day of the last judgment god will separate blind executioners from iniquitous judges   132.51761050126714
then only i rushed upon the reptile and cut it in two just at the moment when it was rising on its tail and hissing ere it sprang upon me   159.19601921806327
yesterday it was choisy to day it is la riviere to morrow it will be some one else   165.01342529879622
exclaimed an inspector   67.1874505275199
there was no time to lose   181.16944126960163
you need not fear   83.71258683124164
i will send you to constantinople   99.87535910910564
well you are indeed exacting my dear fellow   118.68141751075407
and if ever i am reconciled with the court i shall prove to you i hope that i remain your friend as well as that of what the devil are their names d artagnan and porthos   145.3503631048
yes cried morrel make haste   183.18801188555108
we have them ready made   239.9138639085238
this paper my friend said faria i may now avow to you since i have the proof of your fidelity this paper is my treasure of which from this day forth one half belongs to you   107.20372299919634
the coadjutor whose eyes devoured her slightest movements seized the paper immediately the signature had been affixed to it returned to the window and waved it in his hand   222.25493171988907
in this garden mercédès had found at the place indicated by the count the sum of money which he through a sense of delicacy had described as having been placed there twenty four years previously   120.67221000599496
that is a spanish name i think   60.84736153780666
he said as to your friend tell him he may sleep in peace   36.99405965785064
danglars rushed out of the room and made but one leap into his coupé   203.6575836601936
look you my friends   7.003347803127156
the funds rose one per cent higher than before they had fallen   119.61547539309689
he then said it is time to start   2.980130447465342
d artagnan ground his teeth   32.18777033526044
never   156.33754007575283
with the opera the jockey club and other diversions can you not amuse yourself   76.32872966112944
exclaimed the king   173.35527001887513
and before dantès could open his mouth before he had noticed where the jailer placed his bread or the water before he had glanced towards the corner where the straw was the jailer disappeared taking with him the lamp and closing the door leaving stamped upon the prisoner s mind the dim reflection of the dripping walls of his dungeon   143.11158526329814
only three days since we looked on him as our best friend   153.96128087520583
let me know always where to find you   114.37000142886059
the receiver started back   18.458300142672684
i get tired of it and leave it   162.5188375163295
for example here is debray who reads and beauchamp who prints every day a member of the jockey club has been stopped and robbed on the boulevard   126.23104314348284
at the same time continued d artagnan notwithstanding your forty thousand francs a year and perhaps even for the very reason that you have forty thousand francs a year it seems to me that a little coronet would do well on your carriage hey   198.54063782627782
he was therefore instantly recompensed either for his address or for his sensibility whichever it might be termed   157.95931699067876
who can tell whether dantès be innocent or guilty   28.163976972484377
we separated as you know   193.28450452861864
i killed one man if i recollect rightly replied d artagnan with a look of inquiry directed to athos   146.0728298368656
d artagnan s intention was to go out without speaking to the worthy mercer   67.48841812253707
de morcerf   65.6506239873684
bonacieux holding out her hand to him and placing the other upon the knocker of a little door almost hidden in the wall   96.22566274808617
for our young man had a steed which was the observed of all observers   178.85636733333553
a man is there who picks it up   198.95382750153237
m   69.15740651541847
but what makes you doubt it   186.13814209480472
asked villefort quickly   49.220727999683774
their horses were fed but not unsaddled   82.41728833839426
d artagnan however could only see enough to recognize the form of her vestments not enough to distinguish her features   196.6143374043413
the king turned his head away as if these words had not been intended for him   115.59556214453592
la ramee ran in haste to obey the call   149.45100910998912
his eminence had something to communicate to her majesty something secret and private a mission that could be confided only to a sure man and so has sent me to saint germain   157.80599491656625
he then sent word to his nephew to wait for him near the vineyard   96.11198327086765
at length one evening my enemy resolved to paralyze the resistance he could not conquer   41.27406679690887
asked felton   7.876824510298533
to how much   43.02996672377644
so to night mordaunt go to greenwich and ask for the captain of the felucca lightning   66.03320743090717
from the rue de bons enfants to that of the ferronnerie from the rue saint thomas du louvre to the pont neuf from the rue richelieu to the porte saint honore there were more than ten thousand armed men   188.90362833218109
it is there you are to take up your quarters   96.32402573714786
and you selected it yourself   118.71890148558512
said caderousse groaning with pain   84.90616762849872
let me hasten to add continued he that the testator having only the right to alienate a part of his fortune and having alienated it all the will will not bear scrutiny and is declared null and void   50.59049141365159
oh you will give me five minutes grace replied morcerf for i also expect a preserver   70.48770469385371
yes it is very soon said the doctor looking at the corpse before him   139.50453566232966
yet i think this will all pass off and that you will one day see her enter your study   173.43900200176708
when the ladies had finished their supper the queen feigned extreme fatigue and passed into her bedroom   104.62617484490367
la chesnaye said the king   116.13194352088792
explain yourself   127.23278252692782
said the doctor i did not know that i had a rival   142.88859945045994
it is only half past ten o clock come in   165.14822802381013
said madame danglars   51.31362377749731
grimaud said athos still on the breach another musket   116.57817244117285
it is probable you are ignorant of this little fact said athos   77.16116113400516
cried d artagnan   120.6221664780775
well then why it does not much concern us do you think it does   88.21928685967507
suddenly edmond saw the gloomy pale and threatening countenance of fernand as it was defined in the shadow   155.10581357994283
but a most enormous price was offered me this morning for them   148.98225830145427
ears have they but they hear not   130.57531036551978
ah grandmamma murmured valentine pressing her lips on the burning brow do you wish to kill me   88.16118414336607
how s that   121.04235437197643
true the garden is not large   161.48284199213649
oh monsieur le comte replied the old man had any misfortune happened to you i should never have dared to show myself to the marshal again   160.68038017246275
cried m   30.277647973355684
france needs tranquillity to establish on solid foundations the throne of her young monarch   202.51839141692892
but we have not seen him   148.16956638364508
offspring of the brain of the poor abbé faria had they not died with him   111.0570220659085
but i have you must know always had in spite of my bands warlike inclinations   114.12764095396456
had this been all it might not perhaps have greatly signified   73.85560039997603
d artagnan swore loud enough to be heard in the skies   66.38859976149365
besides although sure it was he who had been in the box the previous evening he could not be equally positive that this was the man he had seen at the colosseum   122.8414932680811
give the lackeys money and they will start   147.3171173496306
at the last hour we must confess this action and god knows better than we can whether it is a crime a fault or a meritorious deed   70.55178201809031
what do you mean aramis   135.27959186889308
but is there anything impossible for my d artagnan the noble and loyal gentleman   137.54544240445597
what do you mean by that   85.6116483298126
go   136.69508159032358
i do not know if he does not even go so far as to say that it rains   138.67420929701575
blue and clear eyes of a strange brilliancy with black eyelids and eyebrows   182.35576708440885
d avrigny with astonishment kissed her grandfather on the forehead and left the room   174.6027595006181
therefore your lordship may suppose they are only assumed names said athos   0.9394870274472993
the handle of this saucepan was of iron   115.8087913497937
i understand bertuccio has been sent by my protector   158.31548697246615
noirtier s room   235.21447598412522
and have not all these fernands united made lieutenant general the count of morcerf peer of france   126.31460052693386
be on the qui vive   78.32749166175913
as to d artagnan he remained perfectly insensible to the enthusiasm of the two men in black   103.43517118748548
none monsieur   144.5563597014631
yes said d artagnan   50.33000993612929
they will know you are deserted and think you also poor for i alone know your real financial position and am quite ready to give up my accounts as an honest partner   17.887979663857863
that last order is useless interrupted d artagnan   164.63681346869095
i inherit my father s name and i do not choose that the shadow of disgrace should darken it   125.15076677378593
come that is something   71.00142640848017
it is of no use for you to know anything about it said the young woman whom an instinctive mistrust now impelled to draw back   102.69220753694339
because you are robbed by your steward   236.00457464650515
yes   224.53157543206012
and what cares he for that replied gaetano with a laugh or any authorities   183.99359505553218
this was in case of ill fortune a means of temporizing and obtaining good conditions   123.81393853982453
needless said the englishman   120.90765745657373
for me   229.8541445762739
d artagnan the younger notwithstanding the efforts he made to remain firm as a future musketeer ought nature prevailed and he shed many tears of which he succeeded with great difficulty in concealing the half   92.09481182802249
never have we incurred a greater danger than we are now encountering   80.2719727246924
aramis dismounted and went to porthos whilst athos approached d artagnan   65.82899912076351
you said that porthos had received a sword cut   84.66788093347158
oh yes it is you indeed   59.22347038020265
oh madame said the count when valentine had left the room was it on my account that you sent mademoiselle de villefort away   136.46744357400752
take my arm and let us go   172.2798143665225
i pardon you said he the ill you have done me   121.06138861856753
neither could give the others any information for all were ignorant who this man could be   144.7604962136493
but scarcely had he stepped out of his carriage when the porter met him with a parcel in his hand   110.11114651253543
dantès spoke for the sake of hearing his own voice   94.12270376547913
let us see said aramis how are we to act   164.3949772788455
de saint méran my mother in law madame de saint méran barrois and my daughter valentine   111.97786144687551
i was pretty drunk yesterday d artagnan said he i can tell that by my tongue which was swollen and hot this morning and by my pulse which was very tremulous   165.02952161984575
demoustier says and i will not retard its course or disturb its calm   21.59205824083672
willingly my lord   150.99310342623468
he wished to speak but his tongue refused to move   112.66242297100965
i stand in need of being taught and consoled   214.45162706963845
at this moment a man entered without even knocking at the door   93.06142720648938
that tells me their name and nothing else   116.23725777836492
you are coming to sup with me are you not   82.41928212228152
the young man was already dressed and was reading a new book by m   174.03348513549736
how in the wrong   89.50404093369512
i am a stranger and a stranger to such a degree that this is the first time i have ever been at paris   242.14845857711381
when they reached the street aramis said well athos what do you think   102.01935402398082
i will take all the blame on myself if you find i have led you into an error   120.69337949973347
the dog shook his head   101.65032220084339
just our number so that if they prove troublesome we shall be able to hold them in check   133.76498687398882
asked planchet   175.82171493012953
he began as you begin   109.56387562861828
had madame de saint méran any enemies   1.9919763234164378
come come   128.9011921910373
come take the lantern and let us visit the garden   5.874402410733069
the gratitude of anne of austria   242.00206531708392
said athos shrugging his shoulders   215.54260706713825
but who knows what has become of them   142.5571466935598
he traversed the island after having followed the traces which the footsteps of the giant have left and re embarked for marciana   83.38997491078723
no   135.60510875102938
you must be tired said she to the jeweller   16.890431108879
cried raoul feeling an unknown enthusiasm for that young general who seemed to him so worthy of his renown   99.47522721206145
well a fowl fish game it signifies little so that i eat   153.42791499078191

the foundation s business office is located at 809 north 1500 west salt lake city ut 84116 801 596 1887   136.24411416637943
noirtier closed his eyes   61.72477689513773
i shall bring that forward as an extenuating circumstance replied eugénie   128.7646845962361
madame de villefort instantly hastened to her assistance and aided her husband in dragging her to the carriage saying what a singular event   82.62401019835625
my position is not sufficiently elevated for that   82.5600949245113
now i belong to this last named class   134.77072247781743
and you too my poor monsieur mouston are out of place in this poor hotel are you not   98.91494912166651
to no one by heaven   122.11363769826315
your father major bartolomeo cavalcanti   191.29189314781283
but one word more count   104.60209358235151
but you have seen him   128.34128864587944
but as soon as she perceived the other two men she fell back and they went into the chamber   189.95847325072174
but you   222.1044171420559
and when he had played upon honor he always awakened his creditor by six o clock the next morning to pay the debt of the preceding evening   95.47804135527838
like ourselves he is on his way to join the army and may prove agreeable company   187.1532937993889

d artagnan became very pale   78.37385331807964
i was just beginning the soup and you will dine with me   74.54884553912837
near them were saddles and bridles   117.28667989155561
i shall remain and look over the accounts with danglars   210.92721762276955
this desperate resistance could not last long   96.64215082397473
do you not understand   87.7476944480723
five or six days hence at the latest   68.41523813306577
you overwhelm me with joy   57.45050035359743
jesus dieu   146.64021248025642
asked the fruiteress on the opposite side   121.5262130257228
i could almost believe myself at the café de paris murmured danglars   84.0348416984368
the corpse was conveyed to the morgue   111.51277643008198
with you sir replied the baroness one can wish for nothing one is so sure to obtain it   93.87671329299894
i fear valentine replied the lover that were she living i should never have had the happiness of knowing you   100.38989921993563
do you believe there is a spot on the earth which the cardinal can not reach if he takes the trouble to stretch forth his hand   93.18360963303782
well sir really if like you i had nothing else to do i should seek a more amusing occupation   144.41558631802266
m   123.76811914486626
enough viscount   14.360563152988647
everything was conducted in the usual manner   51.583461982847226
besides that he doubtless has some trembling heart to comfort   172.83457459762906
well are you coming   125.61299202737928
if i thought the fellow knew me by my name i would be rebaptized for fear it might be thought i knew him   99.0709394670951
have you any idea what became of them   60.641097286470114
and you suffer that you wretch   75.01932777314937
that is to say that without forfeiting the gratitude of the king he had made a friend of one on whom in case of necessity he might rely   141.3980052069502
so that this strain of the knee continued d artagnan my dear porthos keeps you in bed   71.63468599356216
d artagnan could not get over the surprise created in him by this minister who thus open handed sported with men and millions   103.29958941746499
very well it is your own doing   244.6932165125571
and if you will wait only a few minutes for me as soon as i have concluded my business with that friend as it is growing late i will come back and reconduct you to the louvre   122.11222644964403
but outside your orders there is a service you can render me   137.1519229286902
on learning of the death of the duke was that such terrible news might discourage the rochellais   136.9045207519055
eighteen thousand men and thirty six cannon   88.39538830783289
paris for two hours past had been dark and seemed a desert   55.0149658197351
it is humiliating   110.35141734240167
now then said the count returning his tablets to his pocket make yourself perfectly easy   158.31246938382225
there are only two persons who have the key to that door murmured morrel cocles and julie   19.757723728326795
and on what have you written all this   125.65753884266813
said bonacieux you are a jocular companion   127.83129063812245
her arms bare to the elbow brown and modelled after those of the arlesian venus moved with a kind of restless impatience and she tapped the earth with her arched and supple foot so as to display the pure and full shape of her well turned leg in its red cotton gray and blue clocked stocking   157.6889690131278
but alas his elegant toilet was wholly thrown away and one of the most worthy representatives of parisian fashion had to carry with him the mortifying reflection that he had nearly overrun italy without meeting with a single adventure   126.85605923723014
on your return you were received by an august personage and i perceive with pleasure that you preserve the souvenir she gave you   154.71143184646078
the islands of tiboulen and lemaire are a league from the château d if   130.62028435918018
and as everyone who had been personally acquainted with prince andrea cavalcanti experienced a lively curiosity in his fate they all determined to spare no trouble in endeavoring to witness the trial of m   162.75736527782502
the standard   22.75902650533388
but i wonder she is not here   80.73038747619256
spaniards englishmen and italian malcontents adventurers of all nations and soldiers of fortune of every sect flocked at the first summons under the standard of the protestants and organized themselves like a vast association whose branches diverged freely over all parts of europe   72.5443087178958
prove it danglars   193.6327663033727
preparations were making on every side   115.67688773816458
what   31.89701319745342
cried mme   84.51454436825173
asked bradshaw of the king   268.1144731464201
julie said he to her cocles has just given me the last rouleau of a hundred francs   134.90398286728924
i have filled those papers and have made out the accusation against the assassin benedetto   94.79630987804508
i am acquainted with it   83.68482294326748
five answered groslow one every two hours   79.91240920047903
as he spoke he sprang into the vehicle the door was closed but not so rapidly that monte cristo failed to perceive the almost imperceptible movement which stirred the curtains of the apartment in which he had left madame de morcerf   182.88225107757086
m   88.37513739551275
tell me   244.76018614405007
then resting his foot on a small ledge he made a sign to show all was right   221.892999921767
by a murder   228.73051636434104
inquired the sentinel   132.81999129708657
chapter xxxiv   108.161062877562
were i in her majesty s place said gondy coldly i should not hesitate   94.47316840884471
in short madame danglars not being able personally to examine in detail the domestic economy and household arrangements of a man who gave away horses worth 30 000 francs and who went to the opera with a greek slave wearing diamonds to the amount of a million of money had deputed those eyes by which she was accustomed to see to give her a faithful account of the mode of life of this incomprehensible person   119.74813340770012
in the name of heaven explain yourself   80.64853937833661
40168m no   126.78800229881968
very well   40.76447320069671
it can not be   157.06005471920108
the marechal de grammont and the comte de guiche had returned to paris and he was quite lonely   57.7627376865236
the poor girl under the caresses of d artagnan lifted her head   102.9263665377224
then he took the boy upon his knee   111.92459222993135
i fancy i remember it   132.96461244454395
in the first place he himself furbished a sword which he drew from its perfumed leather sheath   15.475075713900893
1   107.80837183129435
and sliding from the shoulders of dantès as dextrously as he had ascended he nimbly leaped from the table to the ground   43.55692005067188
plainly enough   170.13256711431134
why he is a second ariosto   141.7434550648019
dispose of me then as a friend   54.307220943230554
all right   164.58072726361397
he who was thus looking without being heard or seen probably heard and saw all that passed in madame de morcerf s apartments   9.030653362576686
yes i heard this news and knew it even before you could   50.857304675861954
ah devil take it you speak in earnest and must have a definite answer   63.73505870552438
they had only halberds before now they have muskets   96.82776290758804
said peppino in italian and taking danglars by the collar of his coat he dragged him to an opening resembling a door through which they entered the apartment which the captain appeared to have made his dwelling place   69.3296837127264
the count s well known courage will render unnecessary the aid of the police whose interference might seriously affect him who sends this advice   43.01830134452429
besides he had long known the prince whilst raoul now saw him for the first time   123.01038844214774
it is very clear notwithstanding replied the young man with an artlessness wholly free from affectation   152.275701888958
gramercy   45.052493497041084
and we did not surrender no   179.5783809733011
monsieur du vallon whom we used to call porthos   144.5872116598702
exclaimed d artagnan this proves to me that not till to day has your majesty had a just idea of us   33.3751600708832
speak sir and pray begin at the beginning   81.7049276810857
he does know how to destroy and that is half the battle   42.07127047504257
but morrel disappointed in his expectations of exciting fear was conscious only of the other s condescension   96.32840160042572
like mère simon s son who has not chosen the worst strawberries   96.70833013609857
not to reply would be a blot on my name and my honor   25.907989661591188
there s the article of remunerations and indemnifications to be discussed and set to rights   22.500401533986505
the prisoner is hostage for the security of the messenger   157.04262276290072
dantès uttered a cry of joy and surprise   25.117885823587926
i your excellency   18.7780422856612
to old times he said   110.4992475823799
d artagnan passed the day in exhibiting his musketeer s uniform in every street of the camp   173.52511518511648
the horses excited by pain and emulation raced over the dark road in the midst of which was now seen a moving mass denser and more obscure than the rest of the horizon   59.86130880157392
but ye shall know i am no ordinary favorite   50.93272526334016
it seems that i am named la bruyere remarked d artagnan   168.66631940864778
ah   210.0088071344083
and clutching his gloves in anger he left the apartment   80.777190664562
i have measured them   49.79889552127793
no   63.0850178686062
madame danglars had started when villefort on the count s invitation offered his arm   125.59258026789689
the only question was had she ten or twelve   144.3901978843453
ignorant of their real enemies they do not perceive that it is not the italian who speaks french badly but those who can say fine things to them in the purest parisian accent who are their real foes   129.49794012375668
i have during ten years considered myself the agent of thy vengeance and other wretches like morcerf danglars villefort even morcerf himself must not imagine that chance has freed them from their enemy   121.90249718165904
made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow   167.68877870666478
but what has the french academy to do with all this   81.50288062131361
saying she would go and make some inquiries into the cause of his sudden disappearance   201.43409058691006
said bertuccio in so calm a tone and with so steadfast a look that andrea was moved to the very soul   64.21910740030545
come in gentlemen   188.36730780381467
when i am dead you will go and examine it   114.85379224520446
then after an instant of gloomy reflection come i will go to see the morrels said he   144.09283614090043
i think he has not been arrested and as i am his wife s confessor if she knows where he is i shall know it too   73.17199236106828
this woman was now his whole thought his whole soul   129.0474448617674
and he tapped gently at the door   132.17636076587738
consider by becoming a gardener i effectually screen our meetings from all suspicion or danger   205.33750361610043
i rushed towards the staircase clutching my hair and uttering a groan of horror   137.69220125904334
the chevalier who no doubt was near the door entered immediately   108.43886332052014
and for a captain s commission i would not write it   155.11104109693275
no   137.06823458923543
so he only said that she had gone out with her step mother and that she should be fetched   19.69787880943828
one may soon see that you re a soldier   8.064544248673627
exclaimed the king to fight   75.76758477240696
and if i give you this password said she would you forget it as soon as you used it   20.553964689036732
is it possible to insult you madame   117.04264054073428
she asked   118.21372264660657
her grief which she had hitherto tried to restrain now burst out in a violent fit of hysterical sobbing   120.63512393194615
gracious heavens m   187.54272301357224
not only on account of my own interest but for your safety   39.53638896156916
blaisois was the tall youth half groom half peasant whom we saw at the chateau de bragelonne whom athos had christened by the name of his province   63.39514379492147
la carconte continued to gaze on him for some time then shrugging her shoulders she took her seat immediately opposite to him   127.94690767578328
patience monseigneur we are coming to it   134.72409809495406
for if you knew my name perhaps you would not be so pressing   55.65936333676897
and i will return to paris and will see you again and will be happy for an instant   185.1730410701257
de villefort cried he i am delighted to see you   15.32570618436479
besides we are conversing in italian   35.09849493072561
nothing my dear replied the unhappy man the tears starting to his eyes at this simple question nothing only i want it   150.5828163609713
raising my scaffold   123.02467336429447
d artagnan sire   141.11695497522558
at this moment the expiring embers threw up a fresh flame from the kindling of a piece of wood that lay near and a bright light flashed over the room   106.47652221045084
30097m you are right in some degree   126.79360386897585
monsieur cried dantès i can tell by your voice you are touched with pity   179.83177490278868
but that has passed away as suddenly as it came and is forgotten   116.0484700280805
but after all asked porthos who is milady   97.11881851610087
are you satisfied my lord   153.8528754270332
when he had finished with the orange tree he began at the cactus   117.20388319104958
slight stains of blood which came from the wound inflicted upon the man who accompanied the carriage as a courier or from one of the horses dotted the road   69.06712415691774
let us rather persevere in our researches   160.8485762909192
how was that   149.48250245719038
d artagnan on his return sent the twelve bottles of wine to the refreshment room of the guards with strict orders that great care should be taken of it   100.82812727427975
40221m château renaud was at his post   128.74569916646954
morrel s salon   108.25934244850114
let him have his say d artagnan said athos with a smile of sadness and contempt   119.07886589131415
he burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated me   115.77021805616128
you will restore them to her majesty   55.21934513799632
the result was that our seven travelers were outnumbered in weapons   0.5749446509305898
and the immense stream again continued its course between its two granite banks   105.99480070999321
you promised me something else   83.47421538939156
it would seem so   136.070410408322
but as regards your wish to visit our fine city my dear count i can only say that you may command me and mine to any extent you please   55.91759991467209
but listen and you will understand   159.67713699992765
asked caderousse   155.34818777391837
well cheer up   106.46551811863826
we need not say which portion of the garden was her favorite walk   118.0488111448665
he went on guard because he always kept company with whoever of his friends was on duty   67.75322484564742
this time felton immovable as he was or appeared to be could not resist the secret influence which had already taken possession of him   77.89069047959482
said the captain   72.09358965565798
it is not you alone this matter concerns but my lord and his unworthy servant myself   86.16039836676082
i know these airs   41.223962879501016
and la ramee resolved never again to disobey these injunctions   156.70031469978653
hem said danglars   221.76890058142794
and dantès saw that it came from mercédès chamber   142.91121828978538
after breakfast it was agreed that they should meet again in the evening at athos s lodging and there finish their plans   29.562971353142785
keep the 50 000 francs you have left i give them to you   87.7885654722219
i am very anxious to see this man   72.69434889603775
asked caderousse   87.63736017403797
in favor of some member of your family   156.22986248744348
and then must not all be over   213.63288103000892
the traitor   47.274146668136794
and i said tréville coldly i have some pretty things to tell your majesty concerning these gownsmen   160.36790400266577
for in the midst of this obscurity franz was not without uneasiness corsica had long since disappeared and monte cristo itself was invisible   86.42706390986385
every one was impatient la ramee to sit down to table the guards to go and drink the duke to escape   86.64363826604409
at least it was impossible for the wounded man to see her any longer from the spot where he was   55.14582184848846
i was born in no   152.22624057428732
well done guitant cried the cardinal to the equestrian   128.3068917116609
intact my dear friend   102.61206874407138
oh no   189.59749468040633
the queen although astonished at this language to which she was not accustomed from her courtiers argued from it a happy omen of the zeal with which d artagnan would serve her in the accomplishment of her project   164.85653830716507
oh as to the robbers said joannes here is something for them and he drew from his pocket a pair of small pistols loaded to the muzzle   70.29915922239451
i believe so   47.950987982737985
my husband could accompany me   61.053338482196985
but without listening to his protestations of alarm d artagnan slipped him gently down into the arms of athos who stood immovable at the bottom of the wall   83.82390798061934
i was at the festival of my marriage monsieur said the young man his voice slightly tremulous so great was the contrast between that happy moment and the painful ceremony he was now undergoing   207.4436105044856
the gate is shut said aramis but if these gentlemen like a cool retreat under the trees and perfect seclusion i will get the key from the hotel de rohan and we shall be well suited   79.87506546631238
inquired emmanuel   223.332378013602
yes   115.66311812691697
in these books your honor tis told how hungry voyagers drifting out to sea have a bad habit of eating each other and beginning with the fattest among them   19.849426287419035
for the poison which she pours there is no antidote   119.17374173106785

the stranger had written to lord wilmore requesting an interview which the latter had fixed for ten o clock   15.163228787140866
monsieur le marechal said the prince with that wonderful glance that was peculiar to him it is with small armies that great battles are won   169.47535552365457

debray did not defend himself very warmly for the idea had sometimes crossed his mind   174.68191937764527
said she shrugging her shoulders i am not ill   105.80453030754477
the queen read it recognized the writing and since there were no details in it of what had occurred asked for particulars   20.389563202104355
halloo   18.154502858306756
but he could not resist five armed men and was forced to yield   77.66093043899502
he therefore went forward without a moment s hesitation although there was no beaten track but he knew his path by looking at the trees and bushes and thus they kept on advancing for nearly an hour and a half   186.46037565239243
bonacieux was   71.54104030859406
partly to drown the recollections of the past that haunted me partly to supply the wants of the poor widow i eagerly returned to my trade of smuggler which had become more easy since that relaxation of the laws which always follows a revolution   210.3658540230866
you are the son of my aunt consequently my cousin   63.380611225807485
oh no not at all vicomte athos replied   76.54843633051505
the cemetery of the château d if chapter 21   172.45772257507014
peter blessed with the fingers   46.56554000920934
if he knew anything about horses he would dispute the price   181.10975513477428
as for me thought porthos giving mordaunt his whole attention were it not for breaking in on the majesty of the situation i would leap down from the bench reach mordaunt in three bounds and strangle him   40.76977167650581
and i can picture her approaching your pillow with her hypocritical smiles and her sweet exhortations   162.3643469038954
d artagnan on the contrary remained concealed behind them   129.11017773021658
nevertheless as if they had been aware of the numerical weakness of the friends the rochellais continued to advance in quick time   85.47722126930721
ah   236.03672997274344
de tréville loved incense as well as a king or even a cardinal   207.81942768511476
de villefort s communications on the subject were very limited and concise   101.40781790358086
raoul obeyed   66.49753516559838
alone valentine has no power   49.682719184631594
your horse is falling said porthos reining in his own   125.40649586539041
it was not he then you came to seek   44.931047641742026
i don t know   110.37466627364826
that of napoleon on the column of the place vendôme   17.485013936142735
give me a simple assignment of your debt   109.78831004656037
and yonder are five hundred persons as you may see through the loopholes taking us for heroes or madmen two classes of imbeciles greatly resembling each other   116.62001014954154
twenty five years old   138.35815080576955
0075m oh to be sure   47.99280516734609
i will say continued the count that he followed and watched you the whole time and when he saw you leave the house ran to the angle of the wall to conceal himself   129.22827617563527
and the royal father of the princess isabella taking his daughter by the hand swept round the stage with majestic strides the better to display the rich folds of his velvet robe and mantle   121.33707074154495
he clapped his hands three times the ordinary signal of lovers   127.91538380686457
and indeed for a man in andrea s situation an arrest meant the assizes trial and death death without mercy or delay   158.4046653156203
that man made a deep impression on me   82.14531619218161
where am i   177.7604083794116
the two musketeers reddened to the whites of their eyes   127.76734217806023
my brother said she as she placed his knapsack on his shoulders be careful of yourself for if you are killed i shall be alone in the world   134.54107734758693
a pallor overspread the young man s forehead and he looked around him with anxiety   123.17150726564007
doctor my house is accursed   185.80510265862995
his resolution was made   224.55343221308556
the air that could only enter by the newly formed opening had the mephitic smell dantès was surprised not to find in the outer cavern   142.85977952955102
the inspector kept his word with dantès   111.48366221301814
athos smiled   56.41410930461443
it is the same   66.04128800018728
ah yes said porthos there is nine o clock   97.93494813108471
i suppose you have no more money and that they will be welcome   78.31402173936445
it was a dull foggy night   34.199354430140716
yes said porthos let us break the door in and fall upon him   138.50663672164018
that it is no longer a riot madame he replied but a revolt   167.6589620014641
and as he had only gone there for the enjoyment of seeing it and hearing the music he took his place at their head beating the drum on two pieces of slate and passing from that exercise to that of the trumpet which he counterfeited quite naturally with his mouth in a manner which had more than once called forth the praises of amateurs of imitative harmony   91.83400350294166
and this i swear by the two beings most dear to me upon earth my father and mercédès   91.48066469879736
d artagnan therefore followed mme   97.89655941775615
the young girl much astonished raised her head to look at him but his face was so gloomy and terrible that her words froze to her lips   96.3170844581254
the price of his blood   89.79264494582846
ah   71.05548790666637
however they left the castle behind   23.21482041591156
but on the frontier he was met by lesly   215.9529040723265
he now saw where the breastplate was weak and prepared the blow   116.78257281793753
de château renaud a handsome young man of thirty gentleman all over that is with the figure of a guiche and the wit of a mortemart took albert s hand   112.41553182138703
yes   121.78806719313506
and the five and forty thousand francs inquired caderousse in a hoarse voice where are they   185.04295745906637
d artagnan went from captain groslow to colonel harrison and from colonel harrison to his friends   152.42183626944555
we can not see your signs   32.63098872235196
your wife in going to rue de vaugirard and rue de la harpe did not go to find linen drapers   222.11333556528194
and whenever added athos we meet in battle at this word place royale   188.66421733164162
for iron nerved as you are you must need repose   101.57955429462356
villainous host   129.60765820109143
milady looked at her lover in silence   110.1512442107804
back   77.28734313670046
morrel i shall always have the greatest respect for those who possess the owners confidence   50.44253499923295
athos who had been observing him and guessing his thoughts took his arm and led him into the garden   38.91740191868509
he guessed likewise by induction that porthos was taking his revenge for the defeat of chantilly when the procurator s wife had proved so refractory with respect to her purse   136.67228409402776
he merely came and freed me from the hands of signor vampa where i can assure you in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and unconcern i did not very particularly care to remain   124.44978510033837
chapter 7   134.07351500502403
in the morning when they entered milady s chamber they had brought her breakfast   101.57499779316949
the cardinal made a sign to his attendant who drew near   96.20231653148488
d avrigny in the same pitiless tone m   90.45005583965475
he grew deadly pale placed his hand upon his heart which was breaking and at once perceived all the treachery   118.4348164691585
and when they had arrived at a distance of a hundred steps from it monsieur d arminges took his usual precautions and sent on in advance the count s two grooms   80.42476984903439
it is a rich study for you who as i learn have seen as many lands as are delineated on this map   85.4641968137957
the fourth as we have said was dead   61.01889342612912
madame bonacieux with whose retreat the cardinal was unacquainted   26.564607000157253
and three months afterwards around the twelve or fifteen small vessels which had brought these gypsies of the sea a small village sprang up   123.4278869259139
he has already been invited by my father   61.04398013186848
in short he had been a soldier and arms ennoble a man   40.29009441365518
some of the chieftains left the ranks and broke their swords in two   168.27871500479895
suddenly an idea occurred to him he smiled and the perspiration dried on his forehead   85.10927306239292
what do you intend doing   63.03968213249731
however the duke contrived to hide the ball under his bolster and as soon as the door was closed he tore off the cover of the ball with his teeth and found underneath the following letter my lord your friends are watching over you and the hour of your deliverance is at hand   129.11723452435626
i have not said adieu to him   71.05488195939003
de morcerf   131.37426692695246
the servant instead of answering pointed to the garden   39.89171052782686
said mazarin whom that single word always inspired with a great respect   165.44669495798857
hold your tongue hypocrite said andrea   39.015502272298505
at these words he threw me a crown which i picked up and he took the ladder   98.40937398621047
finally the cardinal whose vengeance i have balked   114.09574639313651
at the same time and with the rapidity of lightning the stranger drew his   195.37316428395565
maximilian was obliged to let him pass but he followed him   100.74134456715984
both were men of courage and honor   136.88012845138377
who is he   75.8179899448323
0327m so much the better for you if what you assert be true said the abbé   91.07218456654175
two of the men appeared bearing the woman in their arms and carried her to the carriage into which the little old man got after her   163.6399894138948
and you are certain that the queen and he did not see each other   7.331142038869871
oh as to that i can speak positively your eminence   73.62414758305844
said porthos   43.820229864558684
every morning morrel called on noirtier to receive news of valentine and extraordinary as it seemed each day found him less uneasy   150.6660953524759
you don t love me   143.6465902075475
i can not tell you my name since i do not know it   90.99602345576318
be it then as you desire   173.41799284434455
monsieur bertuccio you understand that i intend entertaining company on saturday at auteuil   48.88153590749823
in less than one week from this time i will ascertain who this m   22.49271094478982
for if you are rich madame coquenard then there is no excuse for your refusal   176.64744158518988
the treasure if it existed was buried in this corner   17.325690154581963
i pronounced no name for i knew none except his mother s as a young girl and it was by this name that he recognized her but he knows that his uncle was among her judges   160.78764063734388
the reputation of being out of his mind though harmlessly and even amusingly so had procured for the abbé unusual privileges   87.12606345383657
morrel fell back in his chair his eyes fixed on the clock   64.0119392539028
by us you mean   40.13338107041639
remain then where you are and do not exhaust yourselves with useless fatigue   129.61308654840388
3   158.0248892580856
and she opened the letter and read madame being unable to have the honor of writing to you myself by reason of a wound i have received in my right hand i have commanded my son the count de guiche who with his father is equally your humble servant to write to tell you that we have just gained the battle of lens and that this victory can not fail to give great power to cardinal mazarin and to the queen over the affairs of europe   168.58521834740256
you will tell him my lord resumed the queen despairingly that i can do nothing   119.33566620650411
and now my dear franz let us talk of something else   186.0109696516518
as to his going or staying i feel too much gratitude to the cardinal not to leave him free in all his actions   138.2492242670334
they obtained information at ablain and a statement of their route was left for grimaud   192.07758307544728
the daughter of henry iv   120.15041755299288
capital   151.21666864876283
where can we find another sword   98.85524839540952
yes but monsieur groslow is not a captain of the ordinary kind   160.59590886214474
halloo grimaud   68.65477620803841
yes   90.47923853724288
faubourg saint germain said château renaud   95.45226134260305
how do you know that   31.670057395583186
in fact her position was terrible   147.32804319505996
it is very evident what is the matter with her said madame de villefort   101.73705654052299
when the gentleman who came three months ago the agent of thomson french arrives announce his arrival to me   203.08343045098158
as soon as i have done i will knock on one of the panes of glass   102.57724579454181
not at all said athos calmly   118.8045878933751
everyone spoke harangued and vociferated swearing cursing and consigning the cardinal and his guards to all the devils   172.66693223063794
asked he after a moment of silence   129.6772524209268
in case i am killed the captain s name is roger and the skiff is called the lightning   88.16901302626584
do you place confidence in our landlord monsieur bonacieux   119.07232928654533
asked felton whose looks became excited   127.04932537165948
and madame danglars four   109.86267017500772
whispered he   188.6826919590217
not worth speaking of   156.93768458620437
but the daring of these four fencers appeared to him the strongest he had ever heard of even in gascony   232.10684166352905
the count is fond of travelling and being rich possesses a vessel of his own   62.817999218868714
go on   76.03679090164313
said milady   176.7095173034948
we might be interrupted in the most interesting part of my story which would be a pity   79.45627739094702
three replied aramis smiling   207.9230025499649
what fine things we would do together   54.65746957972655
the youth s dark hair was neatly parted and hung in curls forming a sort of dark frame around his face   209.8918947902439
yes   9.455441220882534
capital   173.4242580419237
so replied de winter laughing that beautiful hair so skillfully disheveled that white skin and that languishing look have not yet seduced you you heart of stone   141.9962011651001
in stock   158.5395633486129
god knows planchet that i should fly from a sight so sad if i did not wish to show my respect for the illustrious shadow of what was once the comte de la fere whom we loved so much   110.85427750574138
a bad plan   246.19099261068826
from that moment he grew very guarded   107.46294073495045
well a pleasant journey   67.70453426065322
were the accomplices of ravaillac or of jacques clément ever known   162.6737874497931
then tis something else   101.63056553153035
i shall have courage   133.15689857410803
i could not   54.18855077217953
people fight for all sorts of reasons you know   140.47194317933088
with two companions   42.61722721471547
the bandit gazed on this scene with amazement   164.13667787966807
it is impossible to form any idea of it without having seen it   89.60580727002466
let whoever likes talk of the king and the cardinal and how he likes   116.36917615507201
is that you dear friend   64.41433117654253
let us suppose one thing replied the duke let us suppose for instance that my maitre d hotel noirmont has purchased the shop of pere marteau well   59.17915186693275
i suspect no one   101.89578511400481
i reached the age of twenty nine without loving for none of the feelings i before then experienced merit the appellation of love   111.66072841132798
but the count exercised over him also the ascendency a strong mind always acquires over a mind less domineering   197.25166547785713
madame de villefort followed the litter in her carriage   36.82347680345622
do you find me of sufficient rank to do me the honor of crossing swords with me   199.83705217048947
emmanuel went towards the pistols   104.27705726446618
there was no one in the whole group in a bad humor except cardinal mazarin   83.01757118642797
the cardinal related yesterday while playing with the king with an air of condolence very displeasing to me that the day before yesterday those damned musketeers those daredevils he dwelt upon those words with an ironical tone still more displeasing to me those braggarts added he glancing at me with his tiger cat s eye had made a riot in the rue férou in a cabaret and that a party of his guards i thought he was going to laugh in my face had been forced to arrest the rioters   143.2046597721693
athos smiled   157.49375291603118
the devil   162.30527331197072
unless a copyright notice is included   156.73932307470142
never has a complaint or a murmur escaped me   145.8809665807916
then the shots were repeated without regularity but always aimed with the same accuracy   70.05541736039837
i wish to tell you that though remaining invisible to your eyes i have not lost sight of you   74.97959517544227
cried franz   111.91703737356866
i assure you i intend to play the devil s game to night   144.62560637589155
apropos continued he franz is coming soon but it will not interest you   186.61038996390647
all these hopes were so many sweet thoughts for milady   81.0918942148345
i am a gentleman born and my blood is warm as you may have remarked my dear d artagnan   51.827305888064146
said la ramee shuddering   166.66524716656366
yes i was expected and very impatiently i acknowledge   146.22831793448006
my faith said aramis we are all alike   86.51160707827462
but it was in vain that he carried his torch all round the exterior surface of the grotto   115.41775530438198
but that is not all   80.87884227580331
why my companion   55.95190644931294
the scaffold will be ready by to morrow but the headsman will be wanting and they will put it off till the day after to morrow   92.06590724679813
and when is he to be married   51.80829720339656
and we sailed under mizzen topsails and top gallant sails   102.18992931122578
said debray   107.12355429406114
asked m   164.9295338438246
where are you   41.16319094151045
come then i see that i must trust unreservedly to you   93.79779032604952
an order to conduct you to a room and to leave you there to talk to me   169.89677517404874
locked   63.00165928948607
and who is the man   129.60402183574283
what   126.74998485404774
do either of these gentlemen know where he is   80.56753767656996
the taking of la rochelle was the preface to the revocation of the edict of nantes   195.91347255868743
on their road they perceived lord winter marching at the head of his regiment   100.40162547911419
athos perceived this embarrassment and by way of supplying an effectual remedy called for four bottles of champagne   114.81590319456478
teresa alone ruled by a look a word a gesture this impetuous character which yielded beneath the hand of a woman and which beneath the hand of a man might have broken but could never have been bended   134.89739315618007
he saw franz and m   153.9646147810865
like all popular movements the shock given by the rush of this mob was formidable   30.000356133519887
he stooped down picked up the bag of money and placed it between his teeth   85.87700474174288
you think he has   81.18218525179589
never did a perverse nature declare itself more prematurely and yet it was not owing to any fault in his bringing up   101.08724622431825
exclaimed emmanuel   176.63145328642992
she was also one of the greatest beauties at court   138.43887420077425
always   126.41915855474217
but i was base and for want of courage acted against my judgment   133.55140120408745
your hesitation your evasion tells me at once on whose side you are   142.433861321177
in heaven s name   47.605933808922046
i am not in any want thank god my living is suited to my means   11.553821970296326
this intelligence restored every one save athos to gayety   162.30085079413485
here i am my lord   134.37488150369487
i was going to say there s no longer a queen   231.87696065462183
i am no longer surprised at my detention murmured dantès since my only protector is removed   106.01057724871964
d artagnan was perplexed   166.3405641460571

in his convent   99.90293600221257
it does not signify gentlemen continued the cardinal without appearing to be in the least swerved from his first intention by the diversion which athos had started it does not signify gentlemen   106.57531648743148
and why   77.06348853654416
there was no longer any doubt the treasure was there no one would have been at such pains to conceal an empty casket   236.28241082120695
said the inspector   0.0554597369644938
d artagnan rushed out of the room   205.0477640804662
trembling and awe struck caderousse hastily shut the door and returned to his guest while la carconte lighted a candle by the smouldering ashes that glimmered on the hearth   234.60923199222992
i consider myself as brave as most men but when i drew from my breast the little key of the staircase which i had found in my coat that little key we both used to cherish so much which you wished to have fastened to a golden ring when i opened the door and saw the pale moon shedding a long stream of white light on the spiral staircase like a spectre i leaned against the wall and nearly shrieked   28.047124933766213
he cried   121.82361870292216
yes she said at your advice i have made the trial   56.512666420140874

ah you are a cardinalist then monsieur are you   257.43088173679814
only his hair which was too light gave his face a most singular expression and added to the vivacity of his look and the malice of his smile   71.99357803321388
but as this dream can not be realized since mademoiselle danglars must become my lawful wife live perpetually with me sing to me compose verses and music within ten paces of me and that for my whole life it frightens me   140.92580011350543
d artagnan smiled   170.72821461031708
upon the landing leading to the chamber and crouching against the door he found the poor girl all in a tremble   142.52574968992008
and the nine combatants rushed upon each other with a fury which however did not exclude a certain degree of method   80.59469966238655
a quarter to ten   45.98235864648345

there was nothing else left for franz to do but to take up his hat open the door of the box and offer the countess his arm   88.78830686588677
all that he had heard from these three different men comminges guitant and villequier confirmed him in his conviction that in case of serious tumults there would be no one on his side except the queen   12.463737785091013
i have not seen you consequently i know nothing of your dinner   139.34733766562394

but this chase loving diana continually surrounded by her nymphs gives me a sort of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of actæon   98.27256736260361
then the hand was withdrawn leaving in his an object which he perceived to be a ring   53.38607389961451
the day had been burning hot   61.24788391105762
and what said the abbé   49.53947306368512

but can you find your man   165.66757603614775

this time a small troop advanced consisting of from twenty to twenty five men   259.0166099195043
d artagnan obeyed   217.31375355110222
although la rochelle was invested however certain success might appear thanks to the precautions taken and above all to the dyke which prevented the entrance of any vessel into the besieged city the blockade might last a long time yet   227.4597560217597
but what then is the noise   97.12311192181375
no no dear d artagnan said the figure tis not the devil tis aramis   104.83502282604178
d artagnan hearing the musketeer swear wished to escape from the cloak which blinded him and sought to find his way from under the folds of it   76.60626219197967
you persist then   167.01744626559812
how do you mean   167.12074699640937
its purple visage and its violet colored hands showed that it had perished from suffocation but as it was not yet cold i hesitated to throw it into the water that ran at my feet   57.629692298655584

the prince   104.57896385533175
haydée had remained until the close of the meeting   218.5231453625323
oh oh   72.03613182544592
he had tried to speak when alone but the sound of his voice terrified him   176.67728569682055
then listen said he   189.6170249791213
i think so   88.61888100925201
yes if he does not put mushrooms in his pies   145.68765404065596
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements   157.97357211413663
he is a very strange man she said and in my opinion is himself the adelmonte he talks about   119.70196506077751
and the valet placed the cup on the table nearest to the sofa which was like all the rest covered with papers   149.92251332766466
and the four friends rushed out of the fort gained the field of battle picked up the four muskets of the privates and the half pike of the brigadier and convinced that the fugitives would not stop till they reached the city turned again toward the bastion bearing with them the trophies of their victory   130.8243554027862

recovering himself however he wiped the perspiration from his brows and stopped not again till he found himself at the door of the house in which his father had lived   108.18469123550372
come monsieur he said you are good in council as we have already discovered   97.9166911509681
but this i know you have some motive of personal hatred against dantès for he who himself hates is never mistaken in the sentiments of others   115.64767183831184
mazarin came within three steps of d artagnan and pushed a spring in the wall   142.65001754855092
who are you in the first place to ask me to take a turn with you   249.41799369367376

well then read this paper which i have never shown to anyone   2.890560995040147
the two young men looked at each other with an air of stupefaction   90.68001348998827
did you hear   193.32337261628007
but go on i beg of you   27.39842118464088
raoul bowed   139.92075331400497

the same   13.966412185101333
the host who saw two young noblemen richly clad promised everything they required and our two cavaliers after seeing that preparations for the reception were actually begun started off again and proceeded rapidly toward greney   175.1607148687568
no albert take my advice   86.5201664117774

had doubled pomègue and approached the harbor under topsails jib and spanker but so slowly and sedately that the idlers with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board   196.28662580795503

he had been occupied in leaving his letters of introduction and had received in return more invitations to balls and routs than it would be possible for him to accept   80.2086333218839
d artagnan thought for a moment then took his sword and put on his cloak to go out   105.67692099117785
and this officer asked albert do you remember his name signora   119.4454692811667
but you said replied madame danglars he would require it as a proof   189.56400177940014

de monte cristo appears to exert a mysterious and almost uncontrollable influence over all the members of our family   72.27725162658777
d artagnan was a woman and still more a mother   103.52471908041892
come haydée come   85.5803752911459
you see m   164.55959990465226

whence then will come the help we need from chance   129.2282006328362
buckingham the executioner of this angelic creature   77.96218305719898
perhaps some accident has happened to him   188.38822606040668
said aramis the rule of the convent is very severe   141.8819973964865
f   183.69563389224393

the duchess was the first to speak   89.040410414828
over these dark and sombre chairs were thrown splendid stuffs dyed beneath persia s sun or woven by the fingers of the women of calcutta or of chandernagor   21.86865668939683
my father said haydée raising her head was that illustrious man known in europe under the name of ali tepelini pasha of yanina and before whom turkey trembled   159.51935347515723
he was going to his banker   89.88191948075617
it might for the cabin door was open and stay   106.1947404708857

fix your own hour for tomorrow and my cashier shall call on you with a check for eighty thousand francs   169.68186667816497
but d artagnan was so preoccupied by the mistress that he noticed absolutely nothing but her   63.596780144574886
adieu dear captain said porthos i shall always be happy to welcome you to my barony   73.49409218080083
and athos whose domicile was established in the rue guenegaud found himself close at hand   95.4230009419083
i expected as i told you to reach the outer wall pierce through it and throw myself into the sea   73.05603501654072
but his quickness was not of much use to him   141.82276467957402
i can do it said porthos   165.78322156680701
and yet if we burn it who knows whether monsieur cardinal has not a secret to interrogate ashes   179.27687399776684

de chatillon saw him fall and announced it in a loud voice to his men which raised their spirits and completely disheartened their enemies so that every man thought only of his own safety and tried to gain the trenches where the coadjutor was trying to reform his disorganized regiment   65.04792622477652
he had come to no determination and as nothing in the count s manner manifested the wish that he should recognize him he did not know whether to make any allusion to the past or wait until he had more proof   205.05342973781913
at these words it was still possible to observe in monte cristo the concentrated look changing color and slight trembling of the eyelid that show emotion   36.457335756306804
i have an inventive mind   161.0414425651844
grimaud obeyed   170.57461683508365

the queen attributed this joyous feeling to the beauty of the fête to the pleasure she had experienced in the ballet   25.569092943288197
and then perhaps on entering the convent he changed his name   161.67956860064174
and she assumed upon sitting up in the armchair a still more graceful and abandoned position than when she reclined   35.716888673121304
when i first came here   180.71593868080663

many observations were made the import of which was a unanimous opinion that there was something sinister about the room   50.66336043293889

in the name of heaven madame said villefort where is the doctor   212.46628431254214
and lord de winter ranged himself by the side of d artagnan leaving the place free for another accuser   24.59437026471332

what will they leave him   146.7841377716543

sire it is fatality   224.79599503451095
luigi asked permission of his protector the steward that she and he might be present amongst the servants of the house   75.7919836306897
at the cries of m   38.736536412846036
yes sir replied the youth with deep respect and i have performed the commission that you gave me   56.63100201409186
during all this time a sentinel who had been relieved at eight o clock had been watching his door   87.56138726405726
yes that is my companion s name   117.28936318199959
i remember the last time she came as well as if it were to day   25.83078042707946
a mortal enemy   85.94503744065126
bertuccio bowed   161.92105797509805
the stone seems very brilliant answered the count   66.81399131390819
the wall had closed again   186.5771553895394
very possibly   201.09339388361838
do not let me interfere with you in anything my friend said the count   232.64132119643327

from time to time i hear of them indirectly but in what part of the world they are devil take me if i know no on my honor i have not a friend in the world but you rochefort   64.123531631384
and they both returned thoughtfully to the procureur s study   110.33744266514603
d artagnan pursued his way   116.18899515369107
they wished to carry him to the shore   143.7640198376011
morrel said dantès approaching the vessel now rides at anchor and i am at your service   87.97125724261971
i am mate of the pharaon belonging to messrs   140.54944277902956
this was the same emery who became eventually superintendent of finance   176.36406395225845
the scotch   87.77327562050787
said monte cristo   82.93698887310211
dresses in fine style   161.31828673373502
truly   75.78064090929131
besides this time my visit has a motive   85.24753433160721
i neither reproach you nor hate you my friend   225.6224244494437
felton uttered a groan   62.35007107979771
he will have fallen asleep waiting for me or else he will have returned home where he will have learned that a woman had been there   33.44245197847877
for god s sake tell me did you know this englishman   89.00543850546126
several inns were visited by them several innkeepers questioned without a single clew being given to guide their inquiries when at montreuil athos felt upon the table that something rough was touching his delicate fingers   87.39924197457283
well said he filling the glasses let us drink to captain edmond dantès husband of the beautiful catalane   87.67004817158974
they carried valentine away   135.3388601982603
bonacieux raising her hands to her forehead i shall go mad   97.56295472568114
monte cristo remained as unmoved as if the reproach had not been addressed to him   166.5722453493786
said the cardinal in a low voice   124.17832307317359
i neither remembered having undressed myself nor going to bed   119.87626115412942
germain   125.45353808376521
and whom i advised you to strangle porthos said aramis   109.57780746523994
edmond made great exertions in order to comply   95.75334420319392
general quesnel it appears had just left a bonapartist club when he disappeared   109.47729674037592
yes   126.97213910854887
hush   79.06891643249274
on a word from the man who rode at the side of the carriage it stopped   107.0469625015387
that is the reason of your being shut up in the bastile   131.6859943769901
but valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the same effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of health   90.86478466955077
but this is tyranny   106.31509649729855
my dear fellow exclaimed albert what can there possibly be in that to excite uneasiness   115.0364744806483
at what   125.93872834097861
madame de villefort appeared more and more thoughtful   172.7724355176549
he was one of those fine ingenuous natures which assimilate themselves easily to the dispositions of others   227.2334943813018
d artagnan has conquered her her that invincible power of evil   85.2613832456754
those lips were magnificent   118.38586143968753
danglars was tired and sleepy   77.16672913616148
one alone is left to me but he is one of those known i believe to the cavalier of whom your majesty did me the honor to speak   40.47194648464786
as monte cristo approached she leaned upon the elbow of the arm that held the narghile and extending to him her other hand said with a smile of captivating sweetness in the sonorous language spoken by the women of athens and sparta why demand permission ere you enter   174.33189543107414
probably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire to make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the day   225.39453790237698
the general again daunted by the superiority of the chief hesitated a moment   73.46251819712847
milady was no longer for him that woman of fatal intentions who had for a moment terrified him   35.01777357699932
on account of political opinions   114.17737341139424
the count of monte cristo is unquestionably a man of first rate breeding and knowledge of the world   92.9647314695962
his chin had joined his throat   197.38834131816267
d artagnan was not willing to abandon his companion thus and stooped to raise him and assist him in regaining the lines   17.044687016284882
yes i know said franz that human justice is insufficient to console us   98.26219429216125
he made blunder upon blunder and the officer with whom he played found him easy game   45.40134953471237
why on board the tartan replied the sailor   133.0564413165705
baptistin opened his eyes with astonishment   84.9648545609528
athos followed the footman who led him through a long succession of apartments and paused at length before a closed door   195.07401820945978
no my dear coadjutor said mazarin   83.55432303580537
athos filled a beaker with champagne and gave it to him   85.72169108436539
alas murmured edmond to himself this is a terrible relapse   56.59185647474669
as soon as his engagement with the patron of la jeune amélie ended he would hire a small vessel on his own account for in his several voyages he had amassed a hundred piastres and under some pretext land at the island of monte cristo   137.8746096302453
i thought so my lord said felton   156.90837142824645
if we stay here five minutes more there s an end of us   103.048306046103
d artagnan put the purse into his pocket   94.22049096143375
a bright spot burned in either cheek her respiration was short and difficult and her pulse beat with feverish excitement   133.34586755447964
all the others remained on the right hand bank where they fell on their knees   116.65801613239242
they then rang the bell and carrying away four swords out of five they took their road intoxicated with joy toward the hôtel of m   45.26193914874726
aramis parted from athos went down from the scaffold in his turn and took his way to the hotel whistling the air of a song in praise of cromwell   73.09689118472055
oh sir she stammered i beseech you do not believe appearances   115.14752061618937
villefort pronounced these last words with a feverish rage which gave a ferocious eloquence to his words   107.85245294211614
said morrel what has become of her   126.63235274066436
did you know that   166.94611463022179
and you aramis you were going i think to visit madame de longueville   119.37424011008923
not only was the first gendarme still there but the young man now perceived a second yellow blue and white uniform at the foot of the staircase the only one by which he could descend while a third on horseback holding a musket in his fist was posted as a sentinel at the great street door which alone afforded the means of egress   129.14982758893933
but d artagnan had reckoned without the wind   65.14964219378324
a fresh practical joke now occurred to the duke   157.00054541689155
with respect to aramis though having the air of having nothing secret about him he was a young fellow made up of mysteries answering little to questions put to him about others and having learned from him the report which prevailed concerning the success of the musketeer with a princess wished to gain a little insight into the amorous adventures of his interlocutor   125.48146772566938
we must content ourselves then said beauchamp with rendering the count all the little services in our power   119.86529778224691
then with a promptitude which indicated that this was not the first time she had amused herself by adopting the garb of the opposite sex eugénie drew on the boots and pantaloons tied her cravat buttoned her waistcoat up to the throat and put on a coat which admirably fitted her beautiful figure   20.02436793098468
five seconds afterwards he was at the door of the room   209.70155059434512
consoled for what   147.46604654165978
the executioner   173.7727095145924
oh you beautiful good little creature   99.56841849892331
well look through this opening and you will see the beautiful new horse which i rode here   141.39593449983832
where are you running to   118.52271582685412
but i forget this sometimes and there are even moments when my mental vision transports me beyond these walls and i fancy myself at liberty   135.05576080669124
well then said milady i confide in my brother   150.64057553546982
the moon lessened by its decline and reddened by the last traces of the storm arose behind the little town of armentières which showed against its pale light the dark outline of its houses and the skeleton of its high belfry   36.366815088718056
we came merely to inquire after your health and to take your orders   152.47495250460736
de villefort   130.5256936777989
all had plainly seen a woman s head appear at the window but none of them except athos knew mme   125.44936133935957
i kept in the background as you wished and waited not for the decision of your heart or my own but hoping that providence would graciously interpose in our behalf and order events in our favor   79.91467321746575
said mme   107.44543657198885
not at all   142.33217416239538
at the rue guénégaud she called a cab and directed the driver to go to the rue de harlay   240.86115184148173
sir replied the wounded man believe me there is no time to lose   72.53421898365193
indeed   183.50319462746887
it is for that reason perhaps that they do not quit me   76.54767728699092
we didn t exchange them   182.77117151902735
save your skin   209.3189250914911
what could i do   89.50627610246792
and in truth if you had not found me here said the count it might have proved a gallant adventure which would have cost your friend dear   153.0028758102989
there is a congestion of prisoners in the bastile who were cooped up in the time of monsieur de richelieu   29.275360962989396
oh my god   45.41522453074549
the abbé then showed dantès the sketch he had made for their escape   187.4173803379802
the assizes the benedetto affair as it was called at the palais and by people in general had produced a tremendous sensation   136.69709472114255
among them was one of a very singular form which appeared to have come from a distance   132.44398023457558
near the louvre the four friends met with m   39.66347922028258
poor concino concini   250.8702469023247
he is also the bearer of a second confidential epistle for his eminence   108.31696084616593
why the devil then do we plague ourselves about money when there is a diamond   113.17678792323179
this woman or rather this apparition for the carriage passed with the rapidity of a vision was mme   153.36143044223834
so rich dear sir that your fortune resembles the pyramids   35.02256678274395
now as we are wont to complete ourselves each by all the rest and to depend on one another for assistance as one calls his other hand to aid the first i looked around instinctively to see if porthos was there   137.0713372509505
three days afterward the four musketeers were in paris   55.16592253195554
it seems sir steward said he that you have yet to learn that all things are to be sold to such as care to pay the price   109.73178830679785
la chesnaye   171.65662825006933
that confirms what i said just now blood will have blood   198.86886440260378
chapter lvi   136.50685458782783
his smile is so sweet when he addresses me that i forget it ever can be bitter to others   177.00564537601628
oh my god thou knowest whether i am guilty   77.1045684234877
thou man of noble heart   101.55428188721521
2   36.653635459269125
well then believe me athos your mission is ended and ended nobly   109.67083192238292
juxon led them away and this time the doors were left open   88.6735801969362
she exclaimed rising   112.84674231225567
and who affirmed as i said that he had received orders from his master or mistress to place the horse in my stable without informing me whence it came   108.46579812922813
the young man was himself astonished to find his heart beat so violently   106.08035646360685
the marshal introduced the two young men and placed them face to face with the prince   158.07409603316137
he was now a lieutenant   83.7749408068583
unhappy he who on the brink of misfortune broods over ideas like these   100.63435342798846
ah this gentleman is a hercules killing cacus a perseus freeing andromeda   100.63122187814903
well then if we can get athos all will be well   115.65073596956981
yes in truth yes answered the young lady turning very red i do remember conversing with a person wrapped in a long woollen mantle   133.6567541104572
when the afternoon arrived and he felt that the hour was drawing near he wished for solitude his agitation was extreme   120.3006724533318
i will answer for nothing   153.2545751353714
my only fear is that he will be too strong for you   190.3322808591721
thus talking they traversed the streets full of people on account of the fete and arrived opposite the old cathedral where first mass was going on   213.98608832669157
the file on the corso broke the line and in a second all the carriages had disappeared   119.54976202320434
in the midst of these screams they saw mordaunt upon the poop with a torch in hand   7.976273024714573
there is something horribly mysterious under all this athos   99.48400130206753
d artagnan went up to him   119.61721062126912
said danglars pretending to restrain caderousse who with the tenacity of drunkards leaned out of the arbor   83.4010307358618
no but it may be sent in something else   163.7904949615434
cried d artagnan to him   133.86551059318958
yes a fowl   65.55723218934587
i will go and take a turn in the garden to recover myself   69.44826416183419
morrel replied villefort   71.56009585155562
murmured milady between her teeth   139.89241025402632
and i shall find your eminence ready   111.51239638262896
did you witness the injury sustained by comminges   166.28846153170736
said aramis   54.381660712893655
you are among men of honor who will use every means to convince you before resorting to the last extremity but as you have said you are among conspirators you are in possession of our secret and you must restore it to us   107.39565790314253
murmured the old man clasping edmond s hand convulsively adieu   79.50501247391136
she was struck no doubt with a superstitious idea   3.306839352299747
yes i do sir   209.08512545888334
a letter which was sent to your abode in your absence and which was given to me for you   157.13375225112702
by right of the objections you have raised and the explanations you have demanded which certainly must have some motive   111.29753069079288
he might perhaps have been bought for less   181.16371272541141
although general d épinay served under napoleon did he not still retain royalist sentiments   155.04017288908722
i am ready   124.88459977698001
ha   93.50751795966715
i say sire that the minister of police is greatly deceived or i am   125.52318297110308
all at once i see you pass through the barrier with a groom a tilbury and fine new clothes   154.77270556845275
the count understood him   33.857799169068045
the young musketeer was in excellent disposition to die heroically   100.92575671434673
the steersman glad to be relieved looked at the captain and the latter by a sign indicated that he might abandon it to his new comrade   76.18467355943619
i make no requests or commands   102.23435839637929
i   101.46563067218698
no   104.87421758444479
cried d artagnan to the man with the scythe taking one of the pistols up by the muzzle and preparing to strike with the handle   143.40749820371977
and was told on inquiry by comminges that he was looking on the back of the pavilion where d artagnan was confined   122.84470966001675
she cried   134.21279775689385
the first person who sees her   134.85974484382723
i can not account for it but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the danglars   20.820479343899237
but as she saw him advance with even step and composed countenance she endeavored to repress her emotion   162.218573265617
and the queen laid her beautiful hand on her bosom   121.34579740579449
do you think his uncle de winter would have brought up that young viper   88.42169509658822
asked the abbé   93.34168242316511
sinbad the sailor   194.39204175420713
d artagnan and his two companions turned their backs and commenced a retreat which resembled a flight   168.79366941577752
it was about one of those purchases that interest women a purchase by which much might have been gained   79.26209415723332
at the very moment when i was about to pay you i had placed my purse on the table   155.1573175625363
the comte de la fere madame replied the young man bowing   84.67952001602242
unfortunately said villefort there are the treaties of 1814 and we can not molest napoleon without breaking those compacts   165.56719748834672
your wishes shall be fulfilled   188.73630306392675
there came up from all nature in the dawn of day a perfume of herbs flowers and leaves which delighted the heart   235.0188609020475
on this promise being given porthos who had never doubted his friend s assurance turned back with him toward the castle   70.80451596865066
then i shall place myself at the cardinal s door a door with glass windows   102.6398434583439
the bargain was concluded   118.07475883366914
said the cardinal sternly   212.9408568936974
said the count to the veiled woman   77.43216327709705
nevertheless let not your majesty be uneasy we will find means   202.9049721702154
excuse me sir replied the notary   92.31829674986369
cried felton covering that hand with his kisses   59.196832815521425
you have an excellent memory milady   62.0322378747829
there could be no doubt she owed this information to the cardinal   135.80125664396857
in spite of all appearances be so kind therefore as to finish your duty by fulfilling the formalities described by law   147.55395939404386
ah that is where the art comes in   236.56409073050452
time however passed away   145.2556894823021
lead me into the queen s oratory said d artagnan announce to her i am here and put this parcel with a well loaded musket under the seat of the carriage which is waiting at the foot of the private stair   42.58851266500332
d artagnan arrived at the bastile just as it was striking half past eight   107.23863383154088
tomorrow for instance he is going to spend the day and night there   122.84949912849522
i made some curious observations on this at charenton   78.34829803405816
but if we four had resolved upon it we should do it most certainly   29.69472071864226
and how did it happen   117.72349070227274
silence prevailed for an instant during which monte cristo gazed intently on the picture   181.88828472318625
they immediately all three halted closed in and waited occupying the middle of the road   145.36395169913493
asked the young lieutenant   121.73218378787159
a count and a rich one too eh   96.40935068798375
but it is almost always sold by lackeys   41.90839557521032
thank you   153.97310789022666
i tell you that you know these things as well as i do since this gentleman has forewarned you both as a doctor and as a friend   85.1625867443726
a mournful sob burst from villefort s heart   109.74204884620367
well read then   119.77100215032345
monte cristo with a smile on his lips uttered in the depths of his soul a groan which would have made villefort fly had he but heard it   172.9722527847688
porthos you are as vain as narcissus   77.1798482684521
a step a gesture a word on your part denoting an effort to escape and you are to be fired upon   81.89592113812242
an instant after dantès entered   85.80730080867602
as for me he added with one of those singular smiles which did not escape the young man when i have completed my affairs in paris i shall go and die in the east   38.238192913959864
yes   249.28375308098884
with a blind valor a quick eye and a prompt hand   110.29136713640064
that is true   55.78722694043221
cried the jesuit   117.76153094196573
aramis seized his knife   69.3216846733182
the abbé told me it was worth 50 000 francs muttered caderousse   116.87110948126256
she raised her head with an effort   201.11468879101392
we are betrayed said the king in a low voice   34.48282365379886
and i am certain that captain or not she will remain ever faithful to me   185.22123319500795
do you not know what became of him and the share he had in edmond s misfortunes   86.34646466575256
when he had dazzled her eyes with the honor bestowed on her by the king in holding her child at the baptismal font madame de longueville contended no longer except as is the custom with pretty women to contend and defended herself only to surrender at last   88.59041162110441
and where will your worship drink   77.46738397458404
now gentlemen cried the king forward   133.37783913259145
when he was left alone the cardinal looked at himself in the glass with a feeling of self satisfaction   166.6675751557646
d artagnan smiled he was just the man to understand the astute italian   97.20567888096306
he took a pencil tore a page from his tablets and wrote my dear marshal in an hour lens will be in the enemy s possession   145.12680294251973
it will be useless for him to find you here   156.06367934815444
but the delightful days of youth are not lost beyond return   28.128181247957073
that health which excellent my dear friend   189.95210165107216
but what must i do   57.171272154617114
my father too is dead said morrel   155.25252200391193
be good enough to open to me for i wish to announce to monsieur le comte that my master one of his friends is here and wishes to greet him   120.11771779303884
and have you done all that is possible father to meet this disastrous result   141.5816509397112
for instance was marvellously served by his conscience after the putting away of the two children of edward iv   102.76446647546597
indeed cried eugénie you are very pale   180.72092323922368
i followed her i caught her i bound her   183.48216099248975
but this time instead of avoiding him the stranger jumped from his horse and advanced to meet d artagnan   12.903615277191832
he heard me patiently and when i had finished burst out laughing   188.88365217643556
said caderousse supported by a supernatural power and half raising himself to see more distinctly the man who had just taken the oath which all men hold sacred   48.465957721033575
i understand replied porthos   88.94642590585126
yes   169.74849692117485
cocles went first and the stranger followed him   102.61517770792413
where is their road   249.37328905008735
villefort maddened with horror stepped back to the threshhold of the door fixing his eyes on the corpse   97.85050329503724
and as i desire to continue to merit the confidence of your eminence deign to unfold it to me in terms clear and precise that i may not commit an error   164.05069091536288
good   51.79083450523139
the morning drum had just been beaten   128.42147241825236
exclaimed athos   104.54468323420375
by adding all that he heard from the mouth of the young man to his own remembrances he was enabled to form a pretty exact idea of a position of the seriousness of which for the rest the queen s letter short but explicit gave him the clue   105.8250272274186
i have not forgotten all i owe thee   47.73944306703946
asked the prince in a low voice addressing his brother   134.6052400091824
what of that   204.4932398579964
our companions will be riding horses dogs to hunt with and a fishing boat   148.78430958530134
your very grateful milady clarik that s all very simple said d artagnan   84.63839592413602
ah to see me   201.1753324998371
i do not think it likely sir   137.3770077703981
no monsieur returned the count   75.50152732509162
but it was no disgrace to your friend to have been deceived   170.95563804988365
believe me you ought now to take a rest   39.93869497276299
yes   161.0834887216721
then seeing that none of their replies could throw any light on the subject porthos called the host and asked for dice   138.21550574949876
he himself was not in question but his horse was   94.2536442437618
cried porthos   101.33399888614
tis a noble gentleman monsieur athos   109.75196590707976
but d artagnan was still in a desponding mood   117.96121887931913
de monte cristo is our enemy   140.0266427605526
my voluntary confession of the assassination at auteuil proved to him that i had not committed that of which i stood accused   53.298104276812175
egad   37.861280836065546
as for you you have acted like a barmaid   71.43698882709502
you know that i am not alluding to you   148.85652411378365
the eyes of the paralytic expressed a multitude of tumultuous thoughts   35.70829339961995
because we dare not speak aloud in one or the other   157.44235083752199
not the least in the world said aramis and athos at once   152.83638955618306
ten times as i told you he came to see dantès father and offered to receive him in his own house   118.28793084839234
oh if he knows the contents of this   153.04852657413318
do you hear baron   39.76899492710315
no it is even ridiculous for me to name it to you and believe me i take no heed of such dreams   42.36049863745521
and if he does not return instead of accusing him of the inconstancy which you insinuate i will tell you that he died loving me and me only   167.91459530833808
then he put the butt of his carbine to his shoulder took aim at the ravisher followed him for a second in his track and then fired   99.38499131229696
and if you wish for more said porthos putting his hand to his pocket thank you sir replied raoul blushing   169.40321630670195
but as though to prove the truth of the fanciful ideas in heathen mythology its indiscreet rays reappeared on the summit of every wave as if the god of fire had just sunk upon the bosom of amphitrite who in vain endeavored to hide her lover beneath her azure mantle   168.94170210273677
standing before the chimney was a man of middle height of a haughty proud mien   171.62964754880343
whereas tis very possible that between the castle and the convent we shall sleep on hard beds dying with hunger and thirst   150.6676300160134
let me see   81.40955630981247
anne of austria at the age of forty six   188.71662688228457
at the same time through the streets of grenelle saint honore and du coq a double stream of people broke the feeble hedge of swiss guards and came like a whirlwind even to the very legs of porthos s horse and that of d artagnan   173.6890776560054
but there was an airhole in the cellar and the wine was in bottles   124.74521958888587
tis your fault you simpleton answered the duke   83.59758796854945
it was that paper you read this morning   172.58439759699684
he was so pale when he appeared at the door of the ball room that valentine ran to him saying oh father some misfortune has happened   44.717254285052334
and d artagnan answered having first asked the word of the cardinal louis and rocroy   122.69758914037372
but are you not still in the service you d artagnan   62.386772710019514
but hush here comes somebody   135.32740579141486
it is of this homicidal thought that i now bear the punishment   113.03593497349829
yes yes   150.72112784612852
and whether it was the result of chance or whether a similar feeling had possessed them both while he had donned their costume they had assumed his   105.6003629488628
oh yes sir you are right it is fatality   89.55964675625012
demanded the host   101.58882891126966
meantime between charenton and the royal army was left a space which looked ready to serve as a last resting place for the dead   23.362107581138275
bonacieux   125.05714090101114
ah i am an unfortunate king monsieur de tréville   70.10712091443907
but she reflected that she would be totally lost if she confessed having assisted in such a machination and above all that d artagnan would also be lost to her forever   91.38260530543705
f   140.19224897983338
is he not albert   87.7999827664136
why you are squeezing that letter into your pocket   154.71268092351545
d artagnan following the strange custom of the times considered himself at paris as on a campaign neither more nor less than if he had been in flanders spain yonder woman here   199.7176388821478
does monsieur de bragelonne remain in paris   131.21953179526884
he had moreover looked upon the customs officer wounded to death and whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter or the chill of human sentiment this sight had made but slight impression upon him   25.72573914690045
de villefort locked the garden door and returned upstairs   96.95651161583697
the jailer shrugged his shoulders and left the chamber   258.49302927319104
leaving the church a woman and a young girl dressed in black the one as a widow and the other as an orphan have re entered their cell   70.39708614242556
in truth the lieutenant s horse stumbled and fell on his knees   94.29996645854533
ah yes i understand replied the patron to find the entrance to the enchanted apartment   88.65139755145952
there are pirates like the bandits who were believed to have been exterminated by pope leo xii   150.8781381079258
he asked again   125.0724210850854
there is one comfort we are all in cash said d artagnan   132.5935501247514
i am but a minister who wants no servants being myself nothing but a servant of the queen s   138.4706108820613
the noble carriage of this gentleman for whom he believed himself to be engaged had won planchet that was the name of the picard   161.96307599007284
i must know what you mean to do   147.43066051126135
and he held out his hands to be manacled   121.18714727330767
that is strange for it is a week ago   120.53879170027602
yes yes   57.35941729405486
general said the chief of the assembly one man may insult fifty it is the privilege of weakness   200.47284924076365
has he by any possibility gone to change his face which was too like that of monsieur de mazarin   26.60203490938322
said porthos   120.23675183670741
he will never see you again   39.50291343134715
woman woman why do you have such ideas   123.95832855121837
that s what i wanted to know   166.0110421660383
cried porthos with a laugh that shook the windows   166.5484588368066
inquired albert   122.30256973352347
well go and talk with the boy said d artagnan and make out if you can from his conversation whether his master is dead   151.6083129421772
bazin who had been standing listening to all this controversy with a pious jubilation sprang toward them took the breviary of the curate and the missal of the jesuit and walked respectfully before them to clear their way   50.7665843880516
the same orders for her as for the two sailing vessels   156.91634872158204
he recalled a bit of advice which athos had once given him and made his horse rear   31.65805974424589
in fact he said as he was about to mount and start on his dangerous mission athos for generosity is a hero of romance   122.16715708453755
her hand   109.86935736116537
and yet you laugh   129.97063730388666
what   107.64909182332804
milady let one of those looks fall upon him which make a slave of a king   59.098690658038784
as i have said she was twice married once in france the second time in england   48.54154903780791
the absurd reports have died away and should they be renewed i would be the first to oppose them   200.6025225539658
none whatever replied eugénie   128.76243852756795
the two things agree marvelously well   112.09707902620279
athos who had till that time said nothing for fear that d artagnan interrupted in his turn should not have the time necessary from this moment declared that his name was athos and not d artagnan   58.90023426976821
and if mme   130.19850579324768
true   143.5474259215516
but we do not invite people of fashion   82.79519243320877
i am lost said he   19.863270474869367
felton my brother my friend i conjure you   202.9355148683053
he was delighted also that the high qualities of athos appeared to promise favorably for his mission   124.99159549466145
but worn out as i was with fatigue and fully purposing to proceed onwards directly the tempest abated i determined to obtain a few hours sleep   94.4024567481145
how many shots   126.53374559895573
he was a very contrary fellow and might come back on purpose to have us hanged   10.564792487709909
it is magnetism she says and when she dreams a thing it is sure to happen she assures me   28.472454889177612
de morcerf sets you the example   142.73523739478154
gloves of gray kid matching the hat well displayed the form of a slender and elegant hand   74.22472391545875
these baskets contained four pyramids of most splendid fruit   157.71288174794168
the young man was opening the door of the stable   168.65496370757825
michon seamstress tours   49.250643690515844
forward   101.8489684695613
you think so porthos   131.62446918231893
replied d artagnan   130.23368352773497
but lord de winter makes cruel accusations against you   121.93530040456817
i may also enjoy the precious privilege of assuring you of my fond faithful and unalterable affection whenever you visit your favorite bower unless indeed it offends your pride to listen to professions of love from the lips of a poor workingman clad in a blouse and cap   46.05952083352676
it could not indeed my daughter is her only heiress valentine alone   121.800564070051
i wish i had never seen you   140.633936998804
an island situated on the other side of the equator at least two thousand leagues from here replied the count   132.49869857543956
and moreover my dear child continued d artagnan i am making use of the privilege conceded to me by your guardian   43.7251057625472
i had but one wish   92.84658505963586
i will give you three replied the stranger   84.79981607825046
you are right sir replied the governor   39.16849578550041
for from this moment we are at feud with the cardinal   23.904553792690763
go on i am curious to know two things   152.8409258918701
i will take the first conveyance i find and hurry to marseilles whence i will bring you word how all is going on   190.8019443185666
apoplexy is a rare disease among fowls i believe but very common among men   67.48752793425749
this was a great matter in the way of honor but very little in the way of wealth   118.14758720593487
athos smiled   2.857821332325088
maximilian hung his head and obeyed with childlike reverence   175.54041730372765
then for the present m   93.91822087400857
0289m chapter 23   137.00938373380782

anne of austria opened the door to him herself   127.74583372039463
on reaching the palace d artagnan sent to his eminence the letter in which he had been ordered to return without delay   170.12686300684675

they had now arrived within sight of the little inn and could see on the opposite side the procession bearing the wounded man and guided by monsieur d arminges   96.63256294650108
the monk had disappeared   9.273586348122677

let me assure you madame said lucien that had i really the sum you mention at my disposal i would employ it more profitably than in troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the count of monte cristo whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being twice as rich as a nabob   113.6920910872433
o reilly   49.80449816529406
but i doubt that your object was like theirs to rescue the holy sepulchre   50.12430828955863

but do you suppose i carry five hundred francs about with me   83.85542022088791

besides you owe me some thanks   129.28432250086314

ma foi yes   119.3127165758554
now the sight of this chateau had taken raoul back fifty leagues westward and had caused him to review his life from the moment when he had taken leave of little louise to that in which he had seen her for the first time   54.19676559327828
but tell me i pray what has become of poor edmond   63.14474743939785
he went to a corner of his dungeon detached a stone and with it knocked against the wall where the sound came   16.562392179488413
in that case gentlemen said the footman on hearing the names which the queen had so often pronounced with hope in that case it is another thing and i think her majesty will pardon me for not keeping you here a moment   174.2557151276676
well i will mention you to him   72.6565528790541
i see you require proofs   88.67224564369766
mordioux   91.65651756728779
monte cristo uttered the last words with so much meaning that morrel starting up cried out you know of whom i speak count do you not   93.95602227178378
d artagnan retired to bed not to sleep but to think over all he had heard that evening   88.74361233175469
the count then hastened to us and took us into his house where he speedily recalled my poor edward to life   102.85633503041615
besides it was necessary he should stay at chantilly to wait for the answer from his duchess   133.25582631853553
athos waved his flag turning his back on the guards of the city and saluting those of the camp   91.51190429729894
ah sir he exclaimed it was you   128.02274194756262
then said morrel i understand it all and this scene was premeditated   219.40685972406897
the queen took the two hands of the young woman with a burst of emotion gazed at her as if to read her very heart and seeing nothing but sincerity in her beautiful eyes embraced her tenderly   83.45050980091023
aided by the remaining fragment i guessed the rest   23.910095766063563
and bassompierre had little chance of leaving his prison   121.97608229393828
said morrel intoxicated   87.85705379609523
it was just in time for valentine s head swam and she staggered   6.910434355959211
at least i advised him to do so   170.8088673528009
so would i said porthos unwilling to be behind d artagnan in generosity   217.23070859182866
they had just finished their double prayer when a nun softly tapped at the door of the cell   66.34425707484553
what have you done to him then   111.27102073443987
ah the traitor   175.06428992925504

chapter xvi   136.1689114729812
he seemed eager to put a question which yet he dared not ask   60.08361798724408
do you prefer i should seek m   47.62720897136599
no one could guess what the dirty rag could be   38.439913397268
thank god thank god   100.9186364451324
raoul entered at this moment   122.88556921599687
de villefort so harshly that the child started up from the floor do you hear me   191.3529654251016
not at all   68.75525271553417
yes   164.8861896021581
the storm broke about ten o clock   99.43627741115736
then when you have carried off the golden trophy of victory instead of setting any value on it you give it to the first handsome woman you think of   127.34064732196113
oh saved saved   223.44652536049458
murmured she   286.30105861080926
they were the men of the beggar of saint eustache   110.97273852336515
the doctor closed the door after her with a gloomy air   170.8520520680683
and bowing to all the astonished persons present the young men took the road to the bastion st   113.14075432149713
tell me what i must do this time   210.17654420267823
but d artagnan stopped his hand and in a hoarse voice cried wait   3.1552244310337585
murmured d artagnan our honor as soldiers is lost to us forever   214.1652900685978
it was then with a sentiment of uneasiness whether planchet who alone could give them information was alive or dead that the friends returned to the place royale   77.94916797572634
in the streets the lively crowd is dressed in the most fantastic costumes gigantic cabbages walk gravely about buffaloes heads bellow from men s shoulders dogs walk on their hind legs   152.16827105471512
the count told everyone that this adventure had happened during his absence at auteuil and that he only knew what was related by the abbé busoni who that evening by mere chance had requested to pass the night in his house to examine some valuable books in his library   103.64837007076248
but in the meantime we shall part good friends i hope   171.81744104536816
yes said aramis i understand   196.81095002014263
on the exclamation of the doctor and the cry of the father the servants all fled with muttered imprecations   128.76430373436182
the moment i understand it there will no longer exist a telegraph for me   15.215730891561421
you will be none the worse off physically or morally   198.0945550205425
what a question   100.65952197593143
and if that were the case it would be worth while to make some sacrifice   5.607999234823865
just then the sound of finger nails slightly grating against the door of the library informed valentine that the count was still watching and recommended her to do the same   73.84166601475815
and i tell you sir that you are mistaken   144.22284947947065
i was there when he fell   88.92435414725618
i left it when i was but five years old replied haydée   216.70538939636864
and yet his features wore an expression of smiling tenderness such as franz had never before witnessed in them   34.56409508425705
but i did nothing of the sort i suffered him and his band to depart   148.58945022635862
when landing at boulogne after a two days passage she passed for a frenchwoman whom the english persecuted at portsmouth out of their hatred for france   92.44110855958935
cried kitty springing forward to meet her mistress   207.1914536604695
gutenberg   155.5315034532617
monsieur   245.21212807182656
yes why   75.25564744302476
behind the door keeper walked a woman enveloped in a large veil which completely concealed her   74.24985592692444
0311m edmond preserved the most admirable self command not suffering the faintest indication of a smile to escape him at the enumeration of all the benefits he would have reaped had he been able to quit the island   104.07142456076144
but none the less he conceived for the officer under whose orders he had for the moment placed himself that consideration which even prudence pays to careless courage   122.53698509537328
mme   111.05965162479535
athos was not altogether the queen s dupe but he was not a man to run away on suspicion above all when distinctly told that he should see his friends again   126.86314419671072
then become general peer of france commander of the legion of honor you consent to again commence a second apprenticeship without any other hope or any other desire than that of one day becoming useful to your fellow creatures   131.23235461564218
lieutenant   151.14158869861575
his back was turned towards me so that i could not see the expression of his countenance neither should i have been able to do so had he been placed differently as his head was buried between his two hands   44.050916200094576
he was lost in these reflections when the goldsmith entered   72.51053825307672

there was a moment s silence it was evident that the doctor was examining the dead body   84.85008565265018
where   82.7856402183112
i thought perhaps said danglars with supreme impertinence that you had a deficiency to make up   122.4254931780495
grimaud understood that it was to be a breakfast on the grass took the basket packed up the viands added the bottles and then took the basket on his arm   84.79964211020281
i will do my best   154.8136735902808
ah he is not generous neither does he possess that supernatural penetration which you attribute to him for if he did he would have perceived that i was unhappy   63.17984970809472
his really sincere royalism made him youthful again   124.42098161347981
only to our host   152.359573846294
i have ordered masses for myself and for you gentlemen which will be said gentlemen for which i have not the least doubt you will be marvelously benefited   32.11371205926062
there is but one person or rather one cause to whom a man like me can be useful that of the king   62.95324954299765
yes you were thinking of it and with justice   93.08332808811275
patrick let no one enter   119.7205437766417
but first give me this letter   68.04507352262121
you have then decided to come to england again said lord de winter in spite of the resolutions you so often expressed in paris never to set your feet on british ground   83.92494736448555
louis xiii   121.00188991315854
this other musketeer formed a perfect contrast to his interrogator who had just designated him by the name of aramis   67.69878420041576
then he descended with cautious and slow step for he dreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned should happen in reality   217.33875743758063
m   7.232788416111234
your excellency will judge for yourself   147.37355165629285
they went to rueil cried aramis   66.41239945617295

with which you are at war is it not so   42.39175969114248
grimaud drew out a pistol   74.4486816135362
you see i make an ample allowance for all delays and difficulties   72.13490935026097
the lightning answered the captain our felucca   161.27631612334488
lord de winter warned of your arrival at portsmouth   135.83741893578824

your excellency lodges at pastrini s hotel   152.17081171706857
did you not yet know me   117.70421900729465
he examined the stones and sounded one part of the wall where he fancied the opening existed masked for precaution s sake   171.5752468382222
the duke undid his belt and gave it to grimaud who tied la ramee in such a way as to satisfy him   72.64724425364555
oh yes returned the young man smiling   163.42911450544224
madame de saintot has hastened to him with broth   87.9144518304848

andrea turned pale but as it was dark his pallor was not perceptible   183.44253414993324
for the cause which today takes us to england   37.8898577313831
fear nothing he said   112.84592135808018
and in spite of the protestations which the master of ceremonies made for the honor of his office and principles villefort was introduced   124.79261728694532
in the middle of the street they saw grimaud and blaisois who were coming to find their masters   137.7353767781197
because i have a terrible secret to communicate to you said the doctor   240.6411838645489
order four men to conduct them to my lodging   146.34552625844634
yes the poor man may be expected to leave me a widow any hour continued she throwing a significant glance at porthos   112.7000478952568
having said that they went out of the stable   77.01350539774955
and your princely father is he rich very rich   148.70913441854904
asked the notary   39.346853135039225
if it were one of your friends you would hesitate then   161.1238595683923
at that moment planchet put his head modestly in at the half open door and told his master that the horses were ready   64.72237026716196
it is true sir said monte cristo with his dreadful calmness   148.69531314974523
he threw himself at the feet of cromwell and in spite of the efforts of the puritan general who did not like this almost kingly homage he took his hand and kissed it   180.81990888107828
yes said the man thrusting his hands into his pockets and looking impudently at the youth   56.4597025077337
there only remained in the closet of the wounded duke laporte and patrick   51.95999047902457
the sergeant burst into a fit of laughter   68.00425760427947
he was a simple looking lawyer s clerk elevated to the extraordinary dignity of a provincial scrivener   263.6421133273036
whether noirtier understood the young man s indecision or whether he had not full confidence in his docility he looked uneasily at him   91.85483907620785
hush   87.73320845441705
ah   113.66572652490512

well m   145.38484481472028
in the midst of this tumult the voice of the president was heard to exclaim are you playing with justice accused and do you dare set your fellow citizens an example of disorder which even in these times has never been equalled   65.77740934630037
easily said monte cristo   74.85284994094198
then said tréville it was also for your majesty s service that one of my musketeers who was innocent has been seized that he has been placed between two guards like a malefactor and that this gallant man who has ten times shed his blood in your majesty s service and is ready to shed it again has been paraded through the midst of an insolent populace   53.00784083528581
his head hanging down his eye dull his speech slow and painful athos would look for hours together at his bottle his glass or at grimaud who accustomed to obey him by signs read in the faint glance of his master his least desire and satisfied it immediately   131.22268698014625
but as i am not quite properly dressed i chose my opportunity that i might not compromise you   65.98608375415981
briefly what did you learn   108.27176306551418

and how when he had reached the bars he fastened his ladder   184.15186685944684
once there a large excavation would be made and one of the flag stones with which the gallery was paved be so completely loosened that at the desired moment it would give way beneath the feet of the soldier who stunned by his fall would be immediately bound and gagged by dantès before he had power to offer any resistance   142.98277941780432
six o clock came and although they were not to sit down to table until seven o clock dinner was ready and served up   128.9960656456981

take them to yonder shed my friend said aramis pointing to a low building on the plain   153.0415862276442
i know you to be a man of resolution   13.939244617724341
ah that is true said athos   101.36091191717244
there is nothing truer than that said porthos   138.93021697251055
if you go accompanied by any other person or should anyone else go in your place the porter will reply that he does not know anything about it   201.95861038087344
in one of these risings the duc de beaufort pillaged the house and library of mazarin in order to give the populace as he put it something to gnaw at   84.06418401382467
oh no said villefort   64.78611890377941

and i inform you with regret that no one becomes a musketeer without the preliminary ordeal of several campaigns certain brilliant actions or a service of two years in some other regiment less favored than ours   141.85267286562396
when our turn comes our revenge will be sweeping   139.26780304634036
tis not too warm to walk resumed d artagnan   62.365873282610785
monsieur porthos has just been to your house and has left this for you saying that the letter was important and must be given to you before you left   121.63338902580364
go laporte said the queen   114.76728214239499
you have more experience than i have   17.146157796434622
but i do not wish anyone to stay with me   188.7967697569894
what a fool i was said he not to tear my heart out on the day when i resolved to avenge myself   265.61006602065413
how do you mean   185.83397163719016
but i know he must be so at present   67.59996759927452
they may do what they will with me i will never leave you   132.8644488501764
but scarcely had she done so when pride burst forth and she began to weep   159.57400403557466
as to our liberty we have that   92.33558442160465
ah forgive me said valentine perceiving the effect which her words were producing on maximilian i have done wrong for i have given utterance to thoughts concerning that man which i did not even know existed in my heart   80.02742991311824
you of those whom you love and i of those whom i love   136.07323594498092
the next morn broke off the coast of aleria   115.3553175844407
said milady   150.14601161305333
ma foi   78.44989764732767
and your excellency has one which was let to prince lobanieff   60.09710235484573
now hastily interrupted the jesuit on seeing that his acolyte was going astray now your thesis would please the ladies   106.07893927955044
i do not know what reason government can assign for these useless visits   65.9097774043577
indeed i do not know what he is   91.00755483334089
some voices passed and faded away and the sound of a single footstep approached the door   72.83845077923007
ah dear constance i have found you then   131.8300119038883
asked the young man   165.6006625782061
let us not misunderstand each other replied monte cristo   183.02571685328257
not so bad yet replied athos   102.07531091647807
let us only remember the present   84.02551473085255
and you sir   170.67132573429018
it was evident that his neighbor distrusted him   208.00956767197493
then why did she go just god   178.6972172532948
well undermine in them the miserable prejudice of respect and fear of kings   143.72406361945457
yes madame replied the officer   191.1826265533869
did you ever occupy yourself said he to franz with the employment of time and the means of simplifying the summoning your servants   88.64382281920223
the cardinal would be infinitely pleased with me   109.15971855350745
so at least the duke believed   7.569849599495058
but it is very hard for me my poor caderousse you take advantage bah said caderousse when you have access to countless stores   129.74009304119525
in which the plot thickens chapter xii   183.7474236708309
de saint méran and that no less surprising of the countess   117.3670403973033
then from the bench she went to the gate   139.06995911961855
quite so replied the lieutenant   174.18925373301195
then she went to the fireplace and lit the fire and although she had just left her bed she could not resist the temptation offered by valentine s sleep so she threw herself into an armchair to snatch a little more rest   188.93386084842382
mazarin resumed his reading it is important therefore monseigneur that i should be informed as to the intentions of france   159.63976927206235
i have tried to make you a happy man and you have turned out a murderer   160.26711993423615
do you recollect that ball count where you produced such an effect   144.68103093109025
but d artagnan   215.83304401397027
here i am ready to give you any explanation you desire   194.49806452302616
i am not an inspector but a traveller brought here by a curiosity he half repents of since he causes you to lose your time   177.0943021083537
de villefort have the kindness to wait half an hour   107.37841396280257
from athos   140.86011257391038
well said he let us see gentlemen what are his eminence s commands and d artagnan unsealed the letter and read m   1.140972217494678
in fact the count s face brightened   110.07167345225886
for your example has given me at the same time hope and courage   129.21310814111328
the count is a speculator who will certainly ruin himself in experiments   195.03712115677897
blacas remain   84.34253459852243
i will do everything in my power to carry out your wishes your excellency   109.8737688168034
as the service was drawing to a close a boy entered the church in great excitement ran to the sacristy dressed himself quickly in the choir robes and cleaving thanks to that uniform the crowd that filled the temple approached bazin who clad in his blue robe was standing gravely in his place at the entrance to the choir   56.507239879562
i know him well there   132.48091935542024
go and rejoin your mother and sister   82.95060281992971
gentlemen resumed the newcomer you are as i am in search of a woman who added he with a terrible smile must have passed this way for i see a corpse   200.0691279740695
you agree do you not that obtaining a carriage is out of the question   124.23942897730839
i have made up the loss of blood by nutrition   115.33022503151568
he was about at last to pass that mysterious threshold to climb those unknown stairs by which one by one the old crowns of m   183.84495170973483
he produced the ring his mark of authority with which ali pasha generally sealed his letters and which the latter had given him that he might on his return at any hour of the day or night gain access to the presence even in the harem   78.10097123707448
the blow struck her like a thunderbolt and she fell senseless   107.05786522272817
yes if the thing be possible   78.99045031734221
give your orders   161.87522999924693
the patron turned towards his vessel which was rolling on the swell in the little harbor and with sails partly set would be ready for sea when her toilet should be completed   52.02889229092612
he wished to articulate a last farewell but his tongue lay motionless and heavy in his throat like a stone at the mouth of a sepulchre   80.41513053353252
who wishes to speak to a lady recently come from boulogne   181.5880225869197
the women had already fled taking refuge in vitry   100.32052449370464
villefort bowed   60.805572192876184
would you dare to touch a cardinal   85.40088085719375
he cried with a smile of satisfaction   190.27065954195734
there there midnight sounds   194.29689738567492
yes sir   134.1807922608366
in the first case i shall leave directly and in the second i shall wait till i am of age which will be in about ten months   148.36202140554423
better fare if you pay for it books and leave to walk about   160.13083105201562
give me a light   181.90162329879817
i cried the steward with a strange expression   167.76240272044805
and i too said d artagnan   74.58182607040843
said the general   214.91924424090348
but as if to contradict his statement at that instant a violent clap of thunder seemed to shake the house to its very foundation while a sudden gust of wind mingled with rain extinguished the lamp he held in his hand   45.39902051289906
ten minutes afterward planchet joined him at the stables of the hôtel des gardes   20.049960244949773
how happy i am   96.9295342060449
well i vow i felt exactly the same sensation at sight of that man when he said why do you ask me that   152.10357026340358
almost immediately the door of the carriage was opened the young man sprang lightly out and presented his hand to milady who leaned upon it and in her turn alighted with tolerable calmness   160.28252129273164
yes my wife pointed him out to me one day   137.55255621996764
i left him about five minutes ago and he is now occupied in dictating his will to two notaries   150.0048765116402
he replied in monosyllables and athos and aramis looked significantly at one another   165.32120323878033
we at least must keep close to monseigneur   144.05760267705946
monte cristo quickly appreciated all that albert had collected here old cabinets japanese porcelain oriental stuffs venetian glass arms from all parts of the world everything was familiar to him   32.285698462783486
but at the foot of the stairs d artagnan remembered he had forgotten his cane   164.94181258405436
demanded the lieutenant   80.74647802483705
look at it and tell me what you think of it   143.72271878238897
oh he was not a gentleman i ll answer for it   74.19739539172845
i knew you were gloomy and always brooding over some old history of the vendetta   135.8510426283384
i will therefore fight in my doublet like yourself   129.5103969915294
but remember i only allow you half an hour   172.7249187671132
well now that all is arranged do not let these newly awakened remembrances be forgotten   112.69204618065552
she said that   225.24783987596783
her majesty did us the honor to ask our aid for her husband   94.33245926543128
so saying the abbé again drew the small box from his pocket opened it and contrived to hold it in such a light that a bright flash of brilliant hues passed before the dazzled gaze of caderousse   146.1903397419541
then half carrying half supporting him he managed to reach the abbé s chamber when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed   171.85635599313858
they asked   96.25936660925957
then gloom settled heavily upon him   53.279732417147294
but what will people say   191.60589008648196
the ground was trampled by horses   112.5879549576393
benedetto has become the son of a great lord   198.68154448836873
and you you would pass rather a sad quarter hour with the red duke replied aramis   157.51266271031756
come speak my worthy corsican speak   167.3612080093893
ah true cried blaisois with evident admiration   158.18216827081378
non siete spagnuolo he said   160.76715990906135
instead of aiding the movements of my horse i paralyzed them   96.85758973092615
my dear fellow replied porthos to be candid with you i am not happy   119.27180216749863
how does he call himself   120.35245100525634
the coadjutor started   212.51973703805055
at their approach planchet came out leading the two horses   70.83350360035246
the world excuses and notoriety ennobles you   54.54286220217546
now four devoted men around the king to protect him from his enemies to be at his side in battle to aid him with counsel to escort him in flight are sufficient not to make the king a conqueror but to save him if conquered   47.94892176026727
suspicion instantly seized me   108.59299161738336
cromwell observed the young man a moment in silence then with that profound melancholy shakespeare describes so well mordaunt he said you are a terrible servant   34.10273663568822
there are tears in your eyes   187.43041911355414
i asked you continued villefort in a perfectly calm tone where you conceal the poison by the aid of which you have killed my father in law m   165.11571598434674
the second visit was a long one and when he returned the kid was roasted and the repast ready   30.10835748193159
yes since you have such a good memory   93.58340504068354
her brother   45.655496048187686
and yet what   161.53558941487694
verses perfumed with the odor of the billet from the attendant of madame de chevreuse   98.54369200982332
it is fortunate for you although your name is bernajoux to have only to deal with an apprentice musketeer   115.60765225583754
he came there and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving elba the projected landing etc   66.30863665000791
then a voice reached them once more sending this threat to our next meeting sirs in england   113.25195146858096
i have taken from you one carte blanche to give you another   109.03977049566265
inquired the astonished merchant   234.08975385521035
it seemed to the prisoner that he could distinguish a feminine form on the beach for it was there mercédès dwelt   197.30871437908786
that the owner of the horse was lord ruthven himself   132.98540047577202
as long as the procurator s wife could follow him with her eyes she waved her handkerchief to him leaning so far out of the window as to lead people to believe she wished to precipitate herself   83.380416426296
and he is made a member of the academy of sciences for this   71.41053736876033
we have learnt nothing forgotten nothing   88.85857073423487
he fancied for a moment that he had been shot and listened for the report   94.1612214370091
sir he said you have made a mistake   38.44311935208539
we still have five minutes replied mousqueton   73.89607302634131
d artagnan unfolded the paper   136.8957516580197
asked milady   67.34364739317493
as to felton he hesitates   165.96219460014495
impossible doctor   172.42522339472993
monkeys are not found in our woods chained to trees said i   163.7422779097163
he said he was going to the catalans and he is going to the city   73.20666872956666
i could live upon a hundred francs   137.84152867332958
i do   123.6527622579573
i pardon you and i weep for you   165.65634869488593
stammered planchet more dead than alive ah monsieur what an escape i have had   94.2519004922116
soon however his surprise vanished for he heard the murmurs of a soft harmonious voice   117.4040317543874
to mademoiselle de la valliere   90.88502632332879
franz questioned albert as to his intentions   218.77617018557675
well i will certainly drink to their health with all my heart but i will not drink alone   201.31221448679804
he therefore shaped his course toward that place and dismounted at the dauphin d or   138.71540370862593
on paper   102.5094462378976
1   64.81961274845352
you see nothing to keep you a little longer in england   70.58781146523808
somebody there received your packet and gave you a letter in place of it i think   120.22694217681911
had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy i should have conducted you to monte cristo   119.72282389014734
le baron franz d épinay   141.93922350763364
pardieu   93.50978964382172
a bright yellow streak crossed the sky and seemed to divide in half the poplars which stood out in black relief on the horizon   83.38979829966922
barrois reopened his bloodshot eyes   175.68251622010007
was he to be thus stopped at the beginning and was he to wait inactive until his fellow workman had completed his task   60.714361390031065
then put me to the proof   86.63059085823019
asked the countess   37.753649032992996
run and seek athos porthos and aramis   179.686575144146
it is only for a moment and i know that i belong to you   153.0040274141676
no matter this was a greater reason for proceeding if his neighbor would not come to him he would go to his neighbor   147.83946685008618
he quietly regained his seat and wrote under the other lines i bequeath to maximilian morrel captain of spahis and son of my former patron pierre morrel shipowner at marseilles the sum of twenty millions a part of which may be offered to his sister julie and brother in law emmanuel if he does not fear this increase of fortune may mar their happiness   222.17382598027126
as to myself i shall go around to see athos   159.4937817294934
when you have finished your story god and i will judge   105.32552330450056
his disturbed mind told him so   77.82259276476022
yes   124.53190629340959
the witnesses endeavored to insist but the president bade them be silent   141.42659144278596
he conjured the evil spirit with abundance of prayers offered up by the monks   175.1646340116855
my wretched curiosity has brought all this about pursued the lady   251.2496987749323
he is quite a child   106.60248412714762
the news caused a great sensation throughout the house   64.23397680043182
that it seems is where he meditates on state affairs   92.82577701208905
i do not know i only guess it because that sort of thing is generally found in prisoners cells   158.9928455931808
felton entered   115.26661975894474
and what was he before he went to vincennes   120.15769889221876
to what purpose   90.16809811189171
replied aramis   209.302627115203
in that case i can give you proofs   19.83765027769134
and yet it was not because the damp had been excluded from the garden   142.53614447291227
beware my dear d artagnan   127.33273540729778
sign it then   114.14022387595925
and after having assured himself that the prisoner was gone the deputy procureur hastened to the house of his betrothed   226.02269905915745
d épinay   94.44375977993374
and indeed i am mad to trouble you with such things when your coming to my tent at such an hour announces that you are the bearers of important news   77.67941330549036
that s a different thing   149.9732889194854
it was estimated at fifty thousand francs   126.11677076020558
danglars sold yesterday at 405 and pockets 300 000 francs   98.1077786493014
this is what has happened my brother who was coming to my assistance to take me away by force if it were necessary met with the emissary of the cardinal who was coming in search of me   89.0432663341737
and profiting by the preoccupation into which the sight of the handkerchief appeared to have plunged the two personages now on the scene he stole from his hiding place and quick as lightning but stepping with utmost caution he ran and placed himself close to the angle of the wall from which his eye could pierce the interior of aramis s room   128.24687483042587
i saw my father s hand tremble   25.959532513691727
i don t know much about it said athos   149.53968872225533
perhaps too the natural and instinctive love of life made me wish to avoid endangering my own   45.93006934476453
the commissary designated by the same gesture athos and bonacieux let them be guarded more closely than ever   174.03271965040764
ten fifteen or twenty thieves have been arrested in a café on the boulevard du temple or in the thermes de julien and yet these same men deny the existence of the bandits in the maremma the campagna di romana or the pontine marshes   98.74431101591306
come come we must be off   23.895360847657486
athos smiled   99.01685071997508
he is quite unaware of them and i have but one fear which is that he should disapprove of what i have done   118.4249616283208
yes but i   124.12628008257269
they will all disappear like the fabrics children build with cards and which fall one by one under the breath of their builder even if there are two hundred of them   80.75571487831829
we know that said beauchamp   112.25514082907397
you will see because you will leave me at the door   122.71068828529701
do not put yourself to the slightest inconvenience   115.71477770657951
oh sir said danglars after he had convinced himself of the authenticity of the documents he held and rising as if to salute the power of gold personified in the man before him three letters of unlimited credit   111.87089004616129
and you answered me that the cold and sluggish habits of the north did not present the same aptitude as the rich and energetic temperaments of the natives of the south   71.84769772004914
the old man looked at her with that stern and forbidding expression with which he was accustomed to receive her   166.15510231555947
demanded milady with a certain terror   214.20004909119433
email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the foundation s website and official page at www   100.65335285244082
the company went on speaking of the poet voiture   140.08258067085924
on her side but as softly as possible kitty turned the key of the lock and then d artagnan opened the closet door   47.08181127475392
but come resumed the englishman are these men of yours dangerous   82.4443098945446
my dear albert one word for i must give poor lucien a respite   76.64671528805616
nay madame   188.05915972809254
ah true a diplomatist   116.26865189221054
they are costumes of battle   213.07111939826183
she asked   264.2500720813547
no your excellency returned bertuccio   190.01828469626508
there were a thousand ingots of gold each weighing from two to three pounds   94.53535032396069
keep the commission   148.13467063331709
he murmured   83.32616692476626
and the more respectable your fist is porthos the less attractive it is   115.5200029611668
ah this letter gives me an idea a capital idea   186.38583064533094
he then took villefort s arm and at the same time holding that of madame danglars under his own he dragged the procureur to the plantain tree where the shade was thickest   10.811483067010855
probably not   18.11836186114607
why they are our men   33.71268993449357
then rising with his head still covered in the tone of a judge rather than a prisoner charles began   226.6551341380576
then who are you   110.64646797287615
athos was delighted to find he was going to fight an englishman   101.46189899509424
at one o clock this morning she had not returned   108.60358554776678
but tell me well what do you wish to know   136.2925670558968
that was the reason of your running away from us   89.47990603234072
in that respect unlike you my dear aramis for you are still the same   102.5423977608742
said cavalcanti   61.81805897907238
the three cavaliers continued their road on full gallop   112.7984453345682
and d artagnan presented to the cardinal the precious piece of paper which athos had forced from milady and which he had given to d artagnan to serve him as a safeguard   81.90583387261223
let us dine quietly and afterwards go and see l italienne à alger   72.17237283524494
i believe so   55.99841448161915
said oliver with a slight curl of his lip i forgot that every service merits some reward and that up to this moment you have not been paid   182.04058360625456
he is one of cromwell s most enthusiastic disciples   135.19775798376455
asked the young man   189.10326781552936
but your highness has never seriously thought of it   140.43372021465086
do you want money   129.69007977672976
it is monsieur d artagnan   108.14985055765858
what i require is that justice be done   69.65446463262629
i have discovered a sort of subterranean passage which runs beneath the street and we shall only have to raise one of the marble slabs before the door to open you an entrance and an outlet   171.5075439101356
but i do know you have nothing more to fear   91.85183412573164
mazarin contemplated these proceedings with a thoughtful glance   128.85474215884813
he has made up his mind to take a wife from paris   83.29004732765591
that is right   301.9975869984597
in pronouncing these words albert had raised his voice so as to be heard by those in the adjoining boxes and in the lobby   54.88994813562656
speak on madame speak on queen said buckingham   182.61167240002686
but it was not the gloomy horizon of vague alarms and which he had seen before he slept but a blue transparent unbounded horizon with all the blue of the ocean all the spangles of the sun all the perfumes of the summer breeze   150.95047940172864
but said monte cristo do you not know any cause for this hatred   152.85966250750386
how do you mean   62.403787823099975
then he bowed   35.74937373576694
ah   89.0147579197692
from lord de winter   140.37052357630506
should your confessor be less indulgent to you in your dying moments than you found the abbé busoni send for me if i am still on earth and i will soothe your ears with words that shall effectually calm and soothe your parting soul ere it goes forth to traverse the ocean called eternity   90.00055668346671
i have studied it in all its forms and in the effects which it produces   184.7518729688016
yes there is something i wish to see   81.57607294801014
alas like most things in this world which have nothing in their favor but appearances the baldric was glittering with gold in the front but was nothing but simple buff behind   155.44971038021646
have you not mentioned that name to me   16.608075579205575
from their beds of dried leaves or wolf skins at the back of the chamber now arose the companions of the man who had been found by albert de morcerf reading cæsar s commentaries and by danglars studying the life of alexander   93.1227419256812
bets were offered to any amount that she was bound for spain   217.37538627172162
in all probability this time his master would not retract   86.38563931132094
the moon which had shone for a short time disappeared behind the clouds   175.1527863869184
said the brigadier stopping the servant the person who is ringing appears to want something more than a waiter   292.4377387217861
well   171.6138703069558
here they are and 200 more besides   98.48250694950022
the two others took their places opposite and the carriage rolled heavily over the stones   194.4700111409204
the comte de la fere   116.1672643294697
it was many years since d artagnan had opened his heart to any one   140.73921909414904
i had vague perceptions of space traversed of the rolling of a carriage of a horrible dream in which my strength had become exhausted   164.24834121564456
the count of monte cristo offered his arm to madame de villefort   34.714117696459525
but d artagnan kept it free from her grasp and presenting the point sometimes at her eyes sometimes at her breast compelled her to glide behind the bedstead while he aimed at making his retreat by the door which led to kitty s apartment   103.09306097756057
oh   199.5649638566387
diavolo   163.15735970437612
but the friends of aramis were not at all convinced by his denial and one of them addressed the young musketeer with affected seriousness   92.01211796629475
on   81.06379450027573
namely that four years afterwards this colossus of power would be overthrown   164.00837201679838
why so   160.5784086618705
i will go down seize the man unawares and bring him to you ready gagged   152.63420437503976
but however and whensoever he did escape what hatred he must cherish against him to whom he owed his long imprisonment   45.63463146068669
m   104.31625875875118
if on my return justice has not been satisfied i will denounce you with my own mouth and arrest you with my own hands   151.49962197878037
we can only save you by being free ourselves replied d artagnan in a rapid low tone   81.99501208614286
d artagnan came the next day to milady s and finding her in a very ill humor had no doubt that it was lack of an answer from m   58.42056846796297
oh nothing but that he might get me out of this if he were favorably inclined to me   124.1603041507892
you tell me to lay aside the mask and i will do so be satisfied   50.3089395726755
lead two sheep to the butcher s two oxen to the slaughterhouse and make one of them understand that his companion will not die   230.98526313022103
it is upon one higher placed than i am that god has laid this responsibility   87.7272970856425
for an instant without an exclamation without a cry for help athos tried to sustain himself on the surface of the waters but the weight dragged him down   186.77091802879454
captivity the fifth day milady had however achieved a half triumph and success doubled her forces   62.498105165227784
she required to be alone that she might put her thoughts a little into order   105.8020543051521
oh   143.1508520373874
demanded the host after a few minutes of useless investigation   127.34917175950861
la ramee went up to him and looked over his shoulder to see what sort of a book it was that had so singular an influence over the prisoner as to make him put off taking his dinner   76.72639436599289
he was forced to confess to himself that this reasoning was not only comprehensive but just   66.37656838781189
and now he said when he saw that dantès had read the last line put the two fragments together and judge for yourself   172.276857477392
monsieur de beaufort placed it horizontally at the height of one foot   178.9762944453973
we no longer know anyone madame   91.03821875795057
nay perhaps you will even have a double reward   63.60053097953426
cried felton he again he always he   187.2892852628318
as they drew near the island seemed to lift from the sea and the air was so clear that they could already distinguish the rocks heaped on one another like cannon balls in an arsenal with green bushes and trees growing in the crevices   138.67484681682976
i don t say exactly answered the gascon confused   175.8262962112589
but do you forget that it is among the catalans a sacred law to intermarry   115.55030913751338
the count who perceived that m   135.84277091885656
ah if you laugh if you doubt me replied aramis you shall know nothing   50.899675413334734
yes i think i received a flower pot upon my head   36.19000795889575
at this word apologies a cloud passed over the brow of athos a haughty smile curled the lip of porthos and a negative sign was the reply of aramis   3.439515817626642
haste   112.08623159266612
ings have been made   151.96462080889754
it is you who have been his mistress madame   93.51667469689681
they say every year adds half a pound to the weight of the bones said another lifting the feet   97.85529731464936
are you likely to be more humane to me than others were yesterday   18.52026172899039
zaccone   62.113535682790975
well then come along   90.92728130136123
this is strange returned monte cristo seeming to yield to his reflections that you should find yourself without any preparation in a house where the event happened that causes you so much remorse   134.92135581332988
and it was no bad one i believe since here we are   100.973359922251
she is simply a duchess   73.50015373796123
good   187.68046819733968
my sister thanks you for your good and eternal remembrance   115.43763382254885
he who at the moment occupied the upper step kept his adversaries marvelously in check   196.84557557085895
it was empty and dantès emerged from the tunnel   177.257806771979
for my misfortune   111.65178926117069
cried the pit in chorus   80.78435547149641
you might as well have tried to stop number three of the barberi who gained the prize in the race today replied franz   121.7430510393187
he who followed us and spoke to us awaits us there   117.91150849064633
and he heaved a sigh   113.15860245221991
yes sir   56.3596552026944
two watches hung from his girdle and a splendid poniard was in his belt   161.64866258165043
cried the brigadier   171.94937435283094
you should always strive to see clearly around you   48.15730203851763
nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states   179.93806927542062
yes but he must make haste   122.50050421779923
the doctor stood before him with one hand placed on his shoulder   109.37476909586087
my dear athos said aramis you speak like nestor who was as everyone knows the wisest among the greeks   57.24030866648434
i will remain with monsieur le comte   26.76660106670468
bonacieux   86.1663197120335
is he not peculiar   73.26359201181634
stop there madame for this can not last   193.35161254483273
cried villefort in a contemptuous voice   99.31044319665284
the three musketeers chapter i   96.78021787081022
as for monte cristo his head was bent down his arms were powerless   130.214673461914
he gave his address to the driver and springing in threw himself on the seat and gave loose to dreams of ambition   181.36009460419967
how they must be looking for monseigneur in all corners   126.78251874864031
mousqueton grimaud and blaisois have our horses saddled at the end of the first street   225.2096457792155
why count exclaimed eugénie what has happened to your ward   117.07567172809219
hope is so sweet a comforter   173.33475234226978
the parents of little la valliere have for a long time perceived and been amused at it   106.3361505952828
there was a moment s silence   167.04839381725475
you think that it was a good deed to kill my brother who was a bonapartist because you are a royalist   88.82816465706324
and porthos in full dress mounted his finest horse taking the part of supernumerary musketeer as d artagnan had so often done formerly   40.47769116971564
but who then is this assassin this murderer   216.0124485116363
de bruy   152.1885678776701
i never rightly understood those men said the queen as she watched him retiring from her presence   30.147564647722362
read the letter again from the commencement   76.7214188725383
have you really measured the world by scrutinies or through alembics and crucibles   105.69057424741514
you are brave monsieur d artagnan continued his eminence   192.9706411692156
it was the same court of which raoul had so often heard the comte de la fere speak except that its aspect had much changed since the period when athos had himself been part of it   132.84506300610485
it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement   77.44348663123549
reiterated the duke   150.53381446674868
he asked himself what had become of mercédès who must believe him dead   2.241442288505894
we shall then be matched four against the remaining five   95.71514433591196
no she said   29.140272659949048
stupid fellow yourself   139.12975869487366
yes   167.7091228996468
de villefort s office   104.92295416611891
the evening arrived   58.50676618819909
villefort had calculated rightly   74.52644623307444
asked benedetto with his most ingratiating smile   39.12403890655415
de morcerf   210.05590341850035
this feeling was so strong that at the moment when edmond was about to begin his labor he stopped laid down his pickaxe seized his gun mounted to the summit of the highest rock and from thence gazed round in every direction   159.30032944602095
this time in spite of my terrors in spite of my agony i began to feel a devouring hunger   157.82448002309923
a puritan yet disguised as a monk he travels alone in france   43.520429339064776
well he of whom i speak is the lord and master of this grain of sand of this atom   89.26715996489081
bonacieux   129.81728589527205
really all you have related to me is exceedingly interesting said monte cristo observing the young man with a gloomy satisfaction   131.02012164975363
the king sighed deeply as if his heart would break and then buried his face in his hands   157.61776628706235
take care madame said athos for he knows neither his father nor his mother   130.53142407640078
but the sight of the gunpowder in the tankard proved to him that his dream was a fatal nightmare   154.19507456454767
much studied but not solved you still remain an enigma do not fear   113.57977138486221
now what would you say to an ensign s commission in my guards and a company after the campaign   56.12255565982012
you are ill perhaps   178.5188364259547
i promise   100.94600622141012
and mademoiselle d armilly said the banker   163.27523120763829
oh my lord   79.01237952971547
ah count said he his father loves him so much   98.6543090518414
is it not then curious to study the different ways by which the soul and body can part   35.56543381710006
he remembered that before they were buried their heads were generally cut off and he felt that his head was still on his shoulders   73.41185297719814
cried the stupefied musketeer   172.47857517339008
you have committed the first wrong since it was you who suspected the queen   139.2409297260502
i confess he asked me none   194.91699139966573
accept it my lord accept it said aramis   82.62293780797317
i informed them at the hotel that i had the honor of passing the night here duke said franz and desired them to come and inform me of his return   52.86121822018301
yes let us go to the library please   213.45359812783926
i was there   123.55047813663575
cried he as soon as he perceived the horsemen   98.12783678159576
and i know i shall drown before reaching it continued blaisois   81.5836879234902
asked the owner with an air of considerable resignation   24.228082021569875
from the time of his arrival in paris he had been mixed up with public affairs   82.80641413463377
the young woman only replied by the beautiful glow which mounted to her cheeks   156.15253151607806
but who after watching over her child during the brief period allotted to her in this world now i fondly hope watches from her home in heaven   112.03475706672512
but there he is in the hands of justice   151.79400738536248
i faith aramis believe me there is little left to regret   149.6965647170266
cried milady struggling   73.71650644170093
one would have thought the king was going to bed and not to his coffin   114.05305285203136
chapter xlii   66.88902265557671
no no i wish to do away with that mysterious reputation that you have given me my dear viscount   136.98395889567752
on saturday   20.499375632165354
france has already received queen henrietta and unintentionally doubtless has maintained a centre of inextinguishable civil war in my country   185.7297880418814
de monte cristo may have heard it and to enlighten himself but why should he wish to enlighten himself upon the subject   132.00776727838354
exclaimed porthos without supper   35.842098457979105
this wine will give you strength drink   148.00091265704123
we must play the game to the end and consent to be blindfolded   151.21888474605225
d artagnan translated this for the others   135.86071227790652
the young officer preserved silence   87.92906377096615
the abbé rose took his hat and gloves   220.2188157606006
oh dear mother it was a dream   102.77645277027162
it is the same   176.90002506407814
on leaving the paternal chamber the young man found his mother who was waiting for him with the famous recipe of which the counsels we have just repeated would necessitate frequent employment   127.66965326087632
yes sir   27.622861347283177
oh said danglars becoming very pale how you are running on   73.36084491480344
bonacieux   79.92131294898843
you will put yourself at the head of the first   28.20984848894352
i have seen nothing of him the last three or four days   137.78633067015446
he arose bowed went out returned by the same way he came re entered the hôtel and went to his apartment   113.96470781677063
and why if you knew me do you let me die   57.644056303019354
cried the hollow voice of athos i can hear d artagnan i think   210.79119295211007
i may as well blow my brains out and all will be over   155.79616937265132
the concierge looked upon the count with surprise   56.149898973720695
the poor mercer remained standing at the door while the eyes of the personage we have just described were fixed upon him and appeared to wish to penetrate even into the depths of the past   144.30760848196292
this young boarder of yours has she tried to fly   98.62086303972876
where is the count friend   137.1221968312302
however we have them safe in prison and they are just sufficiently culpable for us to keep them in prison as long as we find it convenient   64.66667085693005
he was in a subterranean passage by which he was to leave vincennes   151.463970662319
if you wish it   112.73071965249463
this might be a kind remembrance of monsieur the cardinal   264.94685122715873
it is frank at least said morrel   215.95422003970302
can it be he   109.25887617135521
he started when he saw renée for he fancied she was again about to plead for dantès   151.09844256832287
as to that no replied athos laughing   154.8441028416742
cried bonacieux follow you at this hour   156.33464856740005
but for me who engraved it myself it is hardly worth a piastre   101.20654997489844
for twenty years i have tasted nothing but water   195.6831039569316
the door opened and monte cristo turning round saw albert pale and trembling followed by beauchamp and château renaud   73.0033998674183
this corridor was guarded not by a sentinel but by a confidential servant through whom in case of urgency charles could communicate instantly with his faithful subject   59.600166491312734
sire your majesty will i trust be amply satisfied on this point at least   224.7989659949074
ali with considerable animation made a sign in the affirmative   90.77677283126087
the first advantage had been gained by buckingham   132.44775845698607
what are you doing   213.38812692649353
speak monsieur speak said d artagnan who instinctively scented something advantageous   147.83176307689754
but i understand that she is going to italy   166.7562260968132
the opinion of all the commercial men was that under the reverses which had successively weighed down morrel it was impossible for him to remain solvent   92.52315688008542
no monsieur   173.76895370097833
i went and threw myself on the bed without parting with the emancipating knife which i concealed under my pillow   145.38106673619603
the chief beauty of trees consists in the deep shadow of their umbrageous boughs while fancy pictures a moving multitude of shapes and forms flitting and passing beneath that shade   163.58403748682653
he has lost five ships in two years has suffered by the bankruptcy of three large houses and his only hope now is in that very pharaon which poor dantès commanded and which is expected from the indies with a cargo of cochineal and indigo   149.54554423571827
d artagnan   182.1959348759234
we are for the king and the princes added athos   103.2145733576722
i recollect now   123.75154807717065
and besides the crime appearing useless it would be folly to commit it   22.17775603190246
my fault   107.34956571767131
40142m high walls   65.12102084998803
but at the moment when buckingham crossed the threshold he turned round and seeing the hesitation of the young man come in   162.41957930032726
i dreamed that i saw you lying bleeding wounded   157.11673987443524
asked the young man   172.68383671142746
and as he had already perceived that these men were musketeers he did not doubt that the three others were those called the inseparables   156.92800544701328
a little basin was near him and he held a holy water brush in his hand   199.41818843093785
but true parisian as he was bonacieux could recognize every street by the milestones the signs and the lamps   103.67062749681094
oh replied morcerf reddening slightly i have left the service monsieur   89.96124161972789
dantès smiled   198.05335956897858
albert still extended on the chair covered his face with both hands as if to prevent the light from reaching him   115.5337126534311
athos did not leave his chamber   49.091816893884726
his first look was certainly directed towards monte cristo but the second was for andrea   112.41926256424802
begone quickly   142.22171312246007
luigi vampa s bill of fare we awake from every sleep except the one dreaded by danglars   136.4425317501803
anne of austria bent down and whispered in the young king s ear say something gracious to monsieur d artagnan my son   201.32049109256377
and at nine the vessel which with letters of marque from the cardinal was supposed to be sailing for bayonne raised anchor and steered its course toward england   23.417808071576673
it is not madame bonacieux about whom i am anxious cried d artagnan but the queen whom the king abandons whom the cardinal persecutes and who sees the heads of all her friends fall one after the other   204.14002501048395
have they not obeyed me   168.8751965811194
excuse me sir said baptistin who had followed his master with indescribable terror but i think i see a carriage down there under the trees   104.43573062760625
ah   149.81692971979354
tire to him as my sole heir   95.42728014908002
bonacieux had also reflected   117.64096778661076
my cloak stop up the aperture with it   164.83073028517398
for the man we are looking for is the chief   79.84009194050773
porthos who could never see anything that was not self evident talked to him as usual   81.43365933255583
if the supreme being has directed the fatal blow said emmanuel it must be that he in his great goodness has perceived nothing in the past lives of these people to merit mitigation of their awful punishment   172.99333027520544
i am completely ignorant of it madame said the cardinal accompanying his words with a slight shrug of the shoulders   38.25611654011395
noirtier regarded the lovers with a look of ineffable tenderness while barrois who had remained in the room in the character of a man privileged to know everything that passed smiled on the youthful couple as he wiped the perspiration from his bald forehead   101.49933404855952
not to me i hope   173.29404070735882
said he you have just lost one woman whom you call good charming perfect   117.40170821815569
without opposing their arrangements he allowed morrel château renaud and debray to leave on horseback and the ladies in m   152.39948343429282
on whom then   38.22211451947388
in private   223.58016820365472
i will respect his age as he has respected the honor of my family   138.94628652088403
noirtier who on the previous night was the old jacobin the old senator the old carbonaro laughing at the guillotine the cannon and the dagger m   108.67212324913568
d avrigny   124.69412213351163
still he ought to have been here said debray   233.04509241588022
asked villefort with a last effort   87.34469383490143
what do you say m   125.31265338784566
nearly so   156.49022459074985
up to this point said faria interrupting the thread of his narrative this seems to you very meaningless no doubt eh   90.8745178060407
as usual this hôtel was full of soldiers of this company who hastened to the succor of their comrades   102.9277011663432
but where and when shall i see you again   138.16259772364256
the heart of the young man overflowed with joy   25.18660757691616
the effect of the present revelation was stunning   174.90935279433683
let us see   137.68751750049805
d artagnan leaning on athos made a sign to porthos and aramis to keep near them and then placed himself behind the man with the bare arms who was still laughing at his own vile pleasantry and receiving the congratulations of several others   66.38336164320893
asked he   23.931616422830018
of the great cardinal   194.4898315297344
de château renaud m   184.99262984145662
having accomplished these three social duties monte cristo stopped looking around him with that expression peculiar to a certain class which seems to say i have done my duty now let others do theirs   85.3519879176923
then running downstairs she left the hotel walked to the rue de provence called a cab and drove to m   123.95059364352093
and kill him said porthos   225.14149902233615
the abbess only crossed herself without approving or disapproving   100.38811661069565
your majesty knows how every report confirms their loyalty and attachment   46.3953094316401
said athos leaning down his head as if to remember who it could be   136.08819302344136
danglars   124.88115126867713
my dear fellow i mistrust women   183.9705168739554
but felton did not come   206.0827271215
you are sure replied the stranger that she did not suspect the intentions with which you went out   152.49855396401108
he said   205.06698561030464
they awaited while gratifying the eyes a destination unknown to their owner himself   140.96018809891297
but now hasten on board i will join you there ere long   114.71263143053794
besides what dantès had told him of his interview with the grand marshal and what the emperor had said to him embarrassed him   127.34203422249885
at length at the gate of the entrance court he found a carriage surrounded by four guards on horseback   161.839966858586
he s the son of one of the wealthiest merchants in london   23.8665060972218
please to know monsieur porthos said she that my strongbox the strongbox of a procurator s wife though it may be is better filled than those of your affected minxes   162.54719420423862
go out this way said she opening a small private door and come back at eleven o clock   157.10220405250382
at what number   207.5945361080161
woe to that man who should happen to contradict my master at this moment said mousqueton to himself   135.9580147672357
himself   66.71812192981872
because paris is going to be reduced to dust and ashes like babylon of which you have no doubt heard tell   157.413708723536
as he entered the chamber of his friend dantès cast around one eager and searching glance in quest of the expected marvels but nothing more than common met his view   71.53205111620909
omer without drawing bit   166.1250304159213
de villefort whom i shall endeavor to interest in edmond s favor   22.935201140411706
no   72.95278709820374
it will refresh you   66.78563032565621
d artagnan s arm dropped to his side   129.09067514592545
he told me everything and desired me to watch instead of him and in his place to conduct wherever they wished to go the gentlemen who should bring me a handkerchief tied at each corner like that one which you hold and one which i have in my pocket   189.01895951665745
and taking barrois under the arms he dragged him into an adjoining room   159.38563122937518
dantès gazed with admiration but he had some difficulty in believing   88.20479020854823
so my dear the coffer of the defunct holding out its arms to me i shall marry the widow   148.8316495257815
said d artagnan placing his hand eagerly on his ring   77.6335471122084
you do not understand me gentlemen said d artagnan throwing up his head the sharp and bold lines of which were at the moment gilded by a bright ray of the sun   157.96320696297087
only tell me beforehand where you will wait for intelligence from the cardinal   112.2311210312158
morrel   131.82754334357955
chapter lxxvi   159.5797554865494
and they continued their route as fast as their horses could carry them but without adding another word   222.5159152532524
look   130.5031103528079
his hand of iron grasped quick as lightning firm as a pair of blacksmith s pincers the soldier s throat   76.49190620742641
milady had then made a breach by her false virtue in the opinion of a man horribly prejudiced against her and by her beauty in the heart of a man hitherto chaste and pure   117.36400463530913
oho   67.52241672688146
i wished to inquire why you stopped at the island of elba   130.38842683947962
exclaimed the gascon tis a dreadful night my lord   108.84059575189308
and availing himself of one of the privileges of the spectators of the italian theatres who use their boxes to hold receptions the two friends went to pay their respects to the countess   183.69262083554986
yes said porthos smiling at the remembrance of his former exploits   178.24874529189808
do you know said porthos that to twist that damned milady s neck would be a smaller sin than to twist those of these poor devils of huguenots who have committed no other crime than singing in french the psalms we sing in latin   99.54448017480814
thus then the young men made no attempt at resistance but blindly and confidingly surrendered themselves into the care and custody of their conductors   49.48783904290323
at four o clock in the morning they heard a terrible riot in the stables   50.67992657127178
do pray contrive some means for me to meet the count of monte cristo at your house   177.89444621359632
de tréville of the exploit of the morning which was the talk of the whole camp   113.671697195011
although said villefort it will be a serious thing for valentine to lose her grandfather s fortune i do not think that m   56.27734059978813
and that is nothing   70.98476092237726
by aramis is meant simara which is the name of a demon   174.54248415400937
at all events young man rely upon one who has been thirty years at court   51.60574674970327
have you not just rendered him a service that can never be forgotten   95.20514344912402
chapter xxxvii   69.23194773187411
the guests having eaten the soup were about to lift the first glass of wine to their lips when all at once the cannon sounded from fort louis and fort neuf   141.120412775968
and you my lord   216.11940413876903
she was awakened by a soft voice which sounded at the foot of her bed   172.71202602491053
yes yes he said i will pardon you if you tell me all   38.588657080138276
well within a week i am to deposit four millions for my share   207.1659884368371
and what did you reply to his most illustrious eminence   98.67034898559176
and all the precautions of the cardinal will not prevent it   145.2314230509821
he offered millions to anyone who would set him at liberty   230.9391235454555
you were walking one evening in m   190.5867108073134
and you say you will wait for me at armentières   195.57637331173527
you have not returned that visit and you were wrong   115.50804132431884
ah then i suppose you heard haydée s guzla   175.28939520768722
for you know if a wound in the head does not kill at once it is cured in a week   73.16871057536275
a woman of the neighbourhood has been sent for who will be tomorrow at the castle and will return as often as you desire her presence   158.84633460749143
asked morrel   176.19200507499357
luigi vampa s bill of fare chapter 116   131.1361973265428
not one struck him   93.9801066725378
de tréville   24.19940379789935
but we are now about to mix in society to visit and be visited   89.00150689343707
you accept it do you not   100.30411643212064
alas said athos we depart alone   167.97858737025047
bravo monsieur grimaud   135.96396507672327
asked d artagnan seeing a look of vexation on the face of the youth   169.9202698726129
they went downstairs raoul looking every now and then at the count to see if the moment of farewell was at hand but athos was silent   120.40546598874793
i did go there   181.63410750495842
comminges bowed and left   149.9384370041957
it is too bad a habit   176.80018025833598
and then monsieur de chatillon will not come to the place royale to look for you   63.15874267754147
for within an hour the ballet will commence   115.02751195548586
the duc d elbeuf obtained payment of certain sums due to his wife one hundred thousand francs for his eldest son and twenty five thousand for each of the three others   151.86019669250283
he preferred to use the sitting room upstairs which was more library than parlor and was furnished with theological books and parchments in which he delighted to bury himself for months at a time according to his valet de chambre   84.07838444764968
monsieur jests but monsieur will see   149.1639559061178
my father took me in his arms telling my mother i was dead wrapped me in a napkin marked with an h and an n and carried me into a garden where he buried me alive   183.5062848915979
make your mind easy resumed athos we are all faithful servants of his majesty   188.36412288331536
the count then placed his foot on his head saying i know not what restrains me from crushing thy skull rascal   162.2279287749896
the king is surrounded by an army which is conducting him to london   99.03923494172017
de boville   130.07510795870698
i must be able to present these proofs for his appreciation   175.34433610463293
let us be open with each other   134.15241670211805
this affair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which occupies our attention and the death of general quesnel will perhaps put us on the direct track of a great internal conspiracy   150.51879273541255
he is a priest learned in cases of conscience and we will tell him ours   143.88144809150046
deuce take it   109.17657708989724
de tréville being there to claim them   257.1543076871591
nor do i wish to be there replied the young man rising   125.8879033839286
cried he throwing his sword upon the bed this man must be the devil in person   129.32958109778895
oh my mother   78.0726841838776
he rapidly devoured his food and after waiting an hour lest the jailer should change his mind and return he removed his bed took the handle of the saucepan inserted the point between the hewn stone and rough stones of the wall and employed it as a lever   123.89323067695199
beware said m   19.162676596242562
and you ought to thank her raoul   75.99154725925499
i have looked around me said mordaunt and i have seen neither goat nor kid caught among the bushes of the plain   165.36756153606802
pray tell me the whole story   51.24449936860573
i am at your service madame replied lucien coldly   116.8669037686315
the two found themselves in a small chapel covered with a tapestry of persian silk worked with gold and brilliantly lighted with a vast number of candles   82.20311269322798
said he read   72.39971369836054
but before he fainted he collected all his strength to challenge you and to defy you while challenging you   200.21030673023597
but i think i have it said athos   69.96158514833172
de morcerf will accompany me   99.93539640770854
dantès was beside himself with joy   85.13660637105666
de tréville a request which the other with an air of protection promised to transmit in due season   141.51180153439435
no but i heard all   78.05613486148081
was not this murdered man an old galley slave   83.11852544739936
do you approve of what d artagnan has done   60.75055792517663
about the bad quality of the food about the coldness of his dungeon grumbling and complaining in order to have an excuse for speaking louder and wearying the patience of his jailer who out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread for his prisoner   223.3584876000478
bonacieux   68.41762167183393
very well cried i then the place of my punishment will be that of my tomb   192.48687414012076
d artagnan had recognized the voice of his old servant   87.43556047337519
d artagnan donned the robe as quickly as he could mistaking one sleeve for the other so greatly was he still agitated   139.16228716019407
ah this is too much   79.0361761255336
half norman half mecklenburger   122.63270295717544
inquired the man retreating a step or two as if to keep on his guard   173.13086819410182
what did he say   183.16588373432018
it is but christian charity replied d artagnan not to lead one s neighbors into temptation   77.85013390982321
the servant then approached athos and said hesitatingly monsieur le vicomte has no sword   62.54465261030698
take my wealth my fortune my glory all the days i have to live for such an instant for a night like that   87.93118013816171
danglars   164.73954069086176
exclaimed madame de villefort   180.1748195992696
d artagnan detained her by her night dress of fine india linen to implore her pardon   26.899017148276613
alas   144.00255573728347
all these cloaks gray or black were raised behind by the point of a sword or before by the barrel of an arquebuse or a musket   291.3887946402978
is that what you would say   199.53830817917319
de tréville contented himself with asking d artagnan if he could do anything for him but d artagnan answered that he was supplied with all he wanted   138.0887805142565
yes sir provided this war were approved of by the church and would advance the end i wish to attain i mean the remission of my sins   112.51964496841698
he had thought the king and queen charming at the ball   44.93501936644887
well excellency said the landlord triumphantly and without waiting for franz to question him i feared yesterday when i would not promise you anything that you were too late there is not a single carriage to be had that is for the three last days yes returned franz for the very three days it is most needed   20.15412892763858
but will you promise me whatever happens that you will not complain but hope   100.17708177104963
be kind enough then to send me 500 000 francs tomorrow   5.729132417344658
it appeared to d artagnan that he had embraced a statue   153.69203282274896
and therefore said d artagnan to clip the hope which athos s tacit adhesion had imparted to mazarin we shall not proceed to that violence save in the last extremity   98.9830127329211

the truly guilty said milady is the ravager of england the persecutor of true believers the base ravisher of the honor of so many women he who to satisfy a caprice of his corrupt heart is about to make england shed so much blood who protects the protestants today and will betray them tomorrow buckingham   126.43087916264652
the crowd moved to and fro in the rooms like an ebb and flow of turquoises rubies emeralds opals and diamonds   110.47068354678498
betrayed   121.92377586576845
porthos s plan appears to me to be impracticable said d artagnan inasmuch as i am myself ignorant of what instructions i can give you   129.1554311131542
wait he continued renewing his fruitless search   120.62081349725241
but read this paper today   240.99738301522657
such proposals are not to be made to gentlemen such as these   80.14765187609521
i know my place and am not so presumptuous   91.9465822400268
the person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund   98.30260197699731
yes i shall pay if as i hope my vessel arrives safely   171.07406426906067
on the evening before they had scarcely seen each other for a moment at the apartment of the swiss guard germain whither d artagnan had sent for her   134.3337969564793
and you sir   193.87942236364464
you have hastened to me can i have the happiness of being useful to you   94.57947138462438
we make in our case a deposit on a mortgage which is an advance as you see since we gain at least ten fifteen twenty or a hundred livres worth of iron in exchange for our money   114.05355908014593
at last they came in sight of a small wood and spurring their horses afresh rode in its direction   212.48613454517036
ah   163.20375907433012
the very silence of his supporters indicates that they are at work   189.4011183197316
ah he exclaimed it is no longer brucine that is used   219.38900951950916
let us add that in these times of lax morality they had no more delicacy with respect to the mistresses   20.164915199187845
and d artagnan went among those guardsmen with whom he had formed greater intimacy than with the others to invite them to enjoy with him this present of delicious anjou wine which had been sent him from villeroy   169.42981253016427
poor barrois was very thirsty and was thankful to drink anything he could find   190.59204885681825
porthos knocked with his hand   22.455569432192462
cried athos   102.80921361386541
but what have i done to you   6.509322350649114
6   59.41427386380484
no   183.11125009589884
de tréville touched more than ever by his paternal solicitude for his musketeers   92.0761147070659
at any other time i should not have hesitated to make use of them but the great losses i have recently sustained are well known and as i told you my credit is rather shaken   233.54154956824397
take for yourself the better of the two and give me yours   98.0850940087611
her face is very pale and i have listened in vain   42.542723934749844
have you not slept   114.01382516792307
what prevents you from being so   75.65399033229016
pardieu gentlemen said he   77.98606284503356
faith yes almost said raoul   191.14664028185183
chapter 30   149.86831999986276
said caderousse very uneasily   177.97068712048303
danglars turned slightly pale   93.45144126221261
indeed   208.66025603146866
oh you are no stranger at least not by name replied madame danglars and the last two or three days we have really talked of nothing but you   62.19076991276173
but at least we shall not have to reproach ourselves with anything   141.76158604836823
then up the rhine to strasbourg   162.0586996134866
i have thought it no sin to bore through a wall or destroy a staircase   195.4750392428435
morrel with a mournful shake of his head the thing has assumed a more serious aspect than i expected   78.01517710928997
in the meanwhile as the godfather is a second father we beg the reader to lay to our account and not to that of the comte de la fère the pleasure or the ennui he may experience   198.75598679784596
but tell me what interest madame de villefort can have in your remaining unmarried   118.07567304044395
come tell me what can i do for you   28.698505617186
doctor doctor   46.717720088305384
and the travelers buried their rowels in their horses flanks who thus vigorously stimulated recovered their energies   175.72670195440526
you will sell this diamond   87.06838496235486
said porthos and d artagnan at the same time   92.24608452881152
and shall we go and find him   133.24332032121396
now continued he if only de winter does not keep us waiting   127.49961635757133
as for myself i can assure you of one thing the more men you see die the easier it becomes to die yourself   167.05593868378037
meantime mazarin redoubled his surveillance over the duke   240.71750726249815
noirtier   74.62340912665074
said louvieres   101.76439737425483
then the cardinal whatever he said very well knew that the horror of bloodshed in this encounter in which frenchman would combat against frenchman was a retrograde movement of sixty years impressed upon his policy   40.9235428279339
how could i help being astonished when without having the least expectation of such a thing i meet you face to face you of whom we have so often spoken together you whom he loves with all his soul you whom he had taught me to love before i had seen you   68.28379059918899
salute my hero viscount   69.79781790440748
de bassompiere saw clots of blood upon the chessboard   37.531903681612306
they were therefore much astonished and delighted in the regiment when they saw the young man come back safe and sound   209.26904081377475
to this preoccupation of his vanity d artagnan at this moment joined an uneasiness much less selfish   182.3204272091221
after having been so long in love with madame de chevreuse you would hardly lay your heart at the feet of her mortal enemy   55.60908584749365
we say aramis because the young man entertained no doubt that it was his friend who held this dialogue from the interior with the lady of the exterior   106.20614168308462
yes   132.42371353121735
more reason then he should protect a king pursued by parliament   102.02558865131782
hatred evidently inspired the englishman who knowing no other reproach to bring on the count accused him of avarice   124.04224859437849
but the old man resisted and cried so that they were actually frightened   119.18236967690673
i think that disgust is even more sickening than hatred   119.30714799339351
yes like a clap of thunder   125.37710365502953
if all the prisoners took it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues and their guardians consented to accompany them they would have a capital chance of escaping   198.26496805400063
not in the least   127.50966245958357
he showed him the open door the empty room   21.307738786206897
he laid his sword at the head his pistols by his side stretched his cloak over his feet placed his felt hat on the top of his cloak and extended himself luxuriously on the straw which rustled under him   157.29211807807144
he fancied in the darkness that he recognized the young man who had questioned him   42.664599012277094
he was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale and trembling declaring that his son had very nearly been assassinated the day before near the palace   94.97900348770064
the post chaise was happily bought three days since   202.43580246434777
no no be easy on that score   214.75286460857978
all the spectators returned him his salute accompanying this courtesy with a loud hurrah which was audible to the four   105.39852778736082
milady uttered a cry of joy   92.18581471631107
remember that he will most likely be disguised as a horseman   232.19791485010387
it was the medium through which his thanks were conveyed   104.81968511138979
it was there he must dig   169.1985186932802
asked the count with deep emotion   111.78751580141979
said the englishman i have the key of that door   73.4757087632507
well said rochefort taking the paper from milady folding it and placing it in the lining of his hat you may be easy   220.04440494259438
madame replied gondy bowing your majesty is mistaken in qualifying my sincere advice as opposition   95.47682170658233
they found the outer gate closed and not a servant remaining in the house   95.89570438117227
alas said valentine restraining her tears my grandfather is dead   76.95628429358698
he raised himself to glance in the direction which they pointed out saw the monk and fell back upon the litter his face illumined by joy   154.55273346351024
he has probably been killed   139.17579879999613
woman   200.59680964161822
come tell me   172.99700027775407
cavalcanti in that room where he the betrothed of eugénie has never been admitted   170.61758407441852
but it is strange that my voice never would suit any other and a soprano less than any   159.2569741600455
as for himself he dismounted and remained under a beautiful group of chestnuts in flower amidst which were murmuring a multitude of happy bees and bade olivain send the host to him with writing paper and ink to be placed on a table which he found there conveniently ready   108.96679277244584
or from your generosity my friend   199.57720237192365
a furlough is needful   86.04293263415646
hold yourself ready then to join me at the champs élysées and lead me out of this house without anyone seeing my departure   172.67190141719442
he breakfasted heartily and caring little as he said for the beauties of the eternal city ordered post horses at noon   65.05071098571484
you understand tréville an edict is still an edict it is forbidden to fight after all   144.0956484009899
and now in her turn let this woman see that i am not fulfilling my trade but my debt   200.80920475630103
edmond then cast his eyes scrutinizingly at the agitated and embarrassed mercédès and then again on the gloomy and menacing fernand   164.59979440409896
there said he demand thy child of carlini   201.24799434900342
d artagnan found his advice prudent   153.22736730513208
it appeared to me such women as i never weep said milady   135.26103515338613
the messenger is welcome   75.03914054111323
the precaution of changing our clothes   71.57923966010458

i wish to receive her majesty s commands from her own lips   14.516961420158239
bonacieux   70.9676987401019
sitting alone in the front of a box immediately opposite but situated on the third row was a woman of exquisite beauty dressed in a greek costume which evidently from the ease and grace with which she wore it was her national attire   98.76402113240806
and with her left hand seizing the thick mass which her long fingers could scarcely grasp she took in her right hand a pair of long scissors and soon the steel met through the rich and splendid hair which fell in a cluster at her feet as she leaned back to keep it from her coat   30.136742744504375
the city notwithstanding the incredible perseverance of its mayor had attempted a sort of mutiny for a surrender   77.91271346499713
come let us endeavor to get to the end of our story beauchamp   157.8253696935189
i practiced this exercise and as nature has endowed me with some faculties at this day i can throw the lasso with any man in the world   137.68076539105192
but the gates were too strong   135.8517894513367
you have a sister   63.656510544068986
cried the four companions with one voice we would allow ourselves to be cut to pieces in your majesty s service   78.23088854078883
who is he   64.08799423133549
nineteen years of light to reflect upon in eternal darkness   95.17155282066753
said maximilian   106.31941386937166
the two musketeers with whom we have already made acquaintance and who answered to the last of these three names immediately quitted the group of which they had formed a part and advanced toward the cabinet the door of which closed after them as soon as they had entered   18.96572321851319
a great man in every country m   156.2102779826373
6   163.00962092289274
i will wear it i swear to you as a grateful man should do   29.34221318745233
he is walking about and thinking thought d artagnan   146.0014468550034
the feet did not bespeak the woman of quality   24.873100788876684
the carmelite convent at béthune chapter lxii   58.46365352653753
do as i bid you show the chevalier out   105.86901139256884
porthos   152.34458398186803
who are you   101.99643767308027
yes   157.84511955916338
mme   155.1099959477482
but then philosopher that you are said d artagnan instruct me support me   174.76656854069662
alas   111.01456180948713
now will you make me a report of all that has happened   111.25228584479521
long live the coadjutor   99.73164665122856
exclaimed a voice on the stairs   52.37720175435204
there are your instructions said mazarin   275.83651884921176
but when he found that he had come to the conviction that the letter was not to be found he flew for the third time into such a rage as was near costing him a fresh consumption of wine oil and rosemary for upon seeing this hot headed youth become exasperated and threaten to destroy everything in the establishment if his letter were not found the host seized a spit his wife a broom handle and the servants the same sticks they had used the day before   125.98051884551533
he as well as the notary that there might be no mistake in the person gave all his titles to the bridegroom elect   82.78819265522716
30277m indeed   174.82596393075175
and lord de winter do you know anything about him   153.67261052256276
d avrigny i would not accuse anyone   50.008912870022755
was that i saw that i heard   52.87527422998833
interposed laporte in order to turn the subject to whom does your majesty wish me to give the candle   197.35566667508897
night had closed in and paris seen thus by the light of lanterns flickering on the pools of water crowded with ferry boats of every kind including those that glittered with the armed patrols with the watchword passing from post to post paris presented such an aspect as to strongly seize the senses of aramis a man most susceptible to warlike impressions   1.0813098165971127
bonacieux had not been abed   125.91006625569733
monte cristo went to meet him   144.15089175659378
morrel made a sign that he was ready to obey   101.08894755364692
i am planchet planchet whom you know well   92.82629252756256
tell them to stop at rue de la fontaine no   171.8773745396757
i believe i am courageous and since yesterday i have learned the power of will   128.609644079079
but it did not prevent his getting very tired or from talking at every moment of returning to paris so that if the messengers and the spies had failed his eminence notwithstanding all his inventiveness would have found himself much embarrassed   127.47729244039056
de tréville growing warmer as he spoke and his majesty was right   77.76680371975374
then hastily swallowing it went to sit down at the first vacant place and this was by mere chance placed next to the seat on which poor mercédès had fallen half fainting when released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old dantès   188.55119659895348
yes sir   67.5988765711359
you would then be tempted to believe said the abbess that this young person is innocent   88.2196848649279
who could desire my death   159.59543145031694
tis mordaunt   94.82404811405414
wishing to know on what topic the soldiers were conversing he approached with his wonted wolf like step pushed open the door and put his head close to the chink   136.13171182849297
four men disguised as workmen were to get the king out of prison and take him to greenwich where a vessel was waiting   11.995081333436048
while he was thus agitated by gloomy uncertainties wretched waking dreams of grief the first rays of morning pierced his windows and shone upon the pale blue paper on which he had just inscribed his justification of providence   27.879886595106242
as he passed the hôtel des gardes he took a glance into the stables   97.46148789641373
the physician has a sacred mission on earth   165.79108652215317
while we can not and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate   225.99039433708603
and villefort dashed open the window in front of the carriage   118.96990518468247
half an hour will suffice to apprise them   181.0177009846845
morrel advanced towards beauchamp and château renaud who seeing his intention came to meet him   57.867496553124155
where do your excellencies wish to go   24.032951200903028
it was plain that the small shagreen case which he turned over and over in his hand did not seem to him commensurate in value to the enormous sum which fascinated his gaze   67.68523196520013
said porthos to mordaunt i think we have you now my hero   91.05675618530677
for the wicked are not so easily disposed of for god seems to have them under his special watch care to make of them instruments of his vengeance   128.58914517834236
have you really committed the crimes of which you are accused   59.26723694408787
d artagnan seeing athos rise did likewise took his arm and went out   134.47363714651826
spies guards satellites all took me for you and the king blesses you while waiting for you to bless him   37.83895152767471
surrounded by the scotch whom he distrusts although he be himself a scotchman   19.304361771666933
he felt at that instant all the suspicions of jealousy agitating his heart   178.26994670845457
6   137.52060349195915
at midnight my lord   189.73056046008082
the vendetta at what point shall i begin my story your excellency   118.50198914946837
cried mordaunt   218.62054775971723
blaisois found bazin donning his beadle s gown his services being required that day at notre dame   176.10150209294676
during dessert the servant inquired at what time they wished for the carriage   127.86816199076524
accept my acknowledgments for the example you have set me and which i intend following   74.6486414891489
and when you have found the culprit if you find him i will say to you you are a magistrate do as you will   70.95582400014092
thus the attention of many was attracted by this altercation   94.96967986725691
de saint méran advertised it for sale two or three years ago   47.66069399153527
and nothing when he was in that state of mind increased his depression so much as gaiety in others   144.23978538908753
violence is the proof of weakness   200.5652782842988
no dear morcerf   75.70304211659416
i saw the citizens in order of battle on the place of the hotel de ville   186.18553121084886
the whole of the next day was spent in preparations for departure   57.84434813765022
monte cristo cast a rapid glance around him   171.2654289702796
oh then let it be directly   180.65314704759953
if what you say be true replied the count smiling perhaps you will be kind enough to give me some account of yourself and your family   92.87565469626368
but where is louise   29.33453142763568
i see you are a model mentor said albert good bye we shall return on sunday   179.6502034920873

twenty paces   179.9043061428941
that may be done said aramis   119.0119747878425
all the formalities have been gone through   58.70294075601964
a tear trembled in the eye of the invalid   68.60275126875078
generously   121.79822116004337
danglars as well as others   98.67091703772911
they are no bigger than cologne flasks   140.50116083680066
pardon you   46.675661843556384
but mon dieu   36.5290278203241
these men are going to behead your father   76.33207860244946
as d artagnan so constantly frequented the hôtel no difficulty was made in complying with his request and a servant went to inform m   176.93321613618468
1   57.545860152286814
he is my steward replied porthos   115.748892133911

you will not reply however and these gentlemen i am sure will presently be of my opinion   213.741107841217
monte cristo wrote two or three notes and as he sealed the last the steward appeared   188.67620704333245

but if you please let us not theologize aramis   91.88487896318001
i have to pay a visit this evening replied he   57.155362819737675
but d artagnan was at the same time impetuous and curious   129.12618360519647
i seemed to be going mad   212.15741942833216
and king charles is well as i have just heard   69.54983516747066
franz and albert had brought to rome letters of introduction to them and their first question on his arrival was to inquire the whereabouts of his travelling companion   146.64758714346098
he sets sail tomorrow   42.46286640734233
the field of battle instead therefore of being at saint denis or at charenton will be near compiegne or villars cotterets   60.22678436511613
yes it is   201.9004070373619
i think i know him   123.9283574337484
taste this and in an hour you will be a king not a king of a petty kingdom hidden in some corner of europe like france spain or england but king of the world king of the universe king of creation   56.69911101981961
he would then be lost and france perhaps with him   109.36353280513137
you may go   78.71418952487812
the young man is here said the valet de chambre in the same tone   122.66295286037744
you alarm me   65.14102973301337
major cavalcanti chapter 56   141.20079492004515
laporte said the duke in a dying voice laporte do you come from her   171.92906758020766
ah true   94.18508216096888
the traveler made a sign as if he wished to drink and then pointed to his horse and gesticulated like a man who is brushing something   99.81145660297514
i am a tolerable chemist and prepare my pills myself   86.26590291619712
his follies as page   118.49483395613242
de villefort had scarcely said this when the door opened and barrois appeared   136.05923990978513
said aramis he resembles one of dante s damned whose neck apollyon has dislocated and who are ever looking at their heels   188.87449067535675
gentlemen he said the wood that i am carting is his   109.28101128825703
you ought then to have a good hand   159.09429341478844
but the inheritance consisted in this only a scrap of paper on which spada had written i bequeath to my beloved nephew my coffers my books and amongst others my breviary with the gold corners which i beg he will preserve in remembrance of his affectionate uncle   134.47156470013957
0189m dantès had but one resource which was to break the jug and with one of the sharp fragments attack the wall   110.75432834816237
everything was ready at ten o clock for the departure and as athos was watching raoul mount a groom rode up from the duchess de chevreuse   133.29274351801033
but no one entered except two or three marines who brought her trunks and packages deposited them in a corner and retired without speaking   56.212909558388965
your mode of life as a smuggler said he to me one day will be the ruin of you   149.26629409913573
this young man terrifies me my lord   107.18840789636414
plan of campaign d artagnan went straight to m   146.65823715283634
he had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he was almost like a commander on board   155.88579746086717
then come here   140.00111793050937
i assure you you are well known in the rue meslay   111.17210612825527
what do you want   16.550214645881084
he heard her approach and withdraw from the partially open door   245.93805191625196
why is it not done already   8.09587334976112
and from this time the kindness which edmond showed him was enough for the brave seaman   158.23362518912197
said the young man   49.12649936534115
athos made no reply   138.32637890062824
ah if poor mousqueton were here he could tell you to a fraction   164.25498278502604
rely upon it   115.19430617055241
and he looked round to see if anybody partook of his opinion   63.02801757617766
at what o clock sir do you breakfast   246.30924109338076
for the count must be furious   113.44717312801637
for i did not even know of what i was the bearer   188.601832327966
vainglorious as he was porthos could not afford to have a baldric wholly of gold but had at least half   111.30458890879115
franz was deeply affected   132.45767905038417
the fight was therefore prolonged for some seconds   43.901844105090234
madame the possibility of my arrest has been foreseen and should i not have returned by to morrow at a certain hour the next day the cardinal will be brought to paris and delivered to the parliament   105.60010051798209
yes and that s all settled   167.37942036949448
the police belonging to the city being formed by the city itself nothing threatening presented itself to disturb this concert of universal hatred or freeze the frequent scoffs of slanderous lips   81.00357677146587
why how extraordinary   90.9951921124005
liar   4.915421173646067
how extraordinary   49.312096019271934
yes yes yes signed the paralytic casting on valentine a look of joyful gratitude for having guessed his meaning   125.07519096642811
yes madame m   158.3316110151343
i can take you on my shoulders and swim for both of us   40.48184991458298
in the last case i must wait for daylight to renew my search   61.49213009009342
hold hold hold   169.22261860387468
milady smiled with joy   100.44362581371627
we are well aware that this term milady is only properly used when followed by a family name   128.56565045868152
said d artagnan undecided so strongly did the confidence of athos begin to prevail in spite of himself   70.29540559156803
ah true said the englishman with a sigh   189.66106685070616
madame danglars fell into a long seat placed near the chimney   116.80626575436973
well then i wish that order of which you are bearer seeing that i have not one of my own and must have one   37.5707090667582
i fear it   89.60270860850392
ah   116.25232288966919
there is another method said aramis   65.84638518638111
you are wounded said he   157.53619174965084
monte cristo gave the pen to caderousse who collected all his strength signed it and fell back on his bed saying you will relate all the rest reverend sir   93.12180307694466
for the barricades   154.9393066285743
murmured renée   162.58560781666898
if he wished to go out without gloves his hands appeared too white   88.26975505530903
cried he listen to me   98.05894139468809
in a quarter of an hour he was entering the house in the rue du helder   144.04940808742685
as she had a loose muslin dress on and as nothing concealed her figure i saw she would ere long become a mother   149.91743136092515
said he   101.4579874827216
how   51.179884028907736
come on here you others he continued rising in his stirrups raising his sword and addressing those musketeers who had not been able to follow his rapid onslaught   139.18500165978293
was asked a second time   47.38398877162044
what not asleep   82.97720151840673
he hastened to the rendezvous found the lackeys at their posts placed them as sentinels at all the outlets of the hôtel and came to find athos who had just received this information when his friends returned   163.46829593379653
i will listen monsieur for i am most curious to hear what explanation you will give   117.56742117816027
we have just time to finish this fowl and to drink one glass of wine to your health d artagnan   11.761787050411499
then morrel came out from his hiding place with a beating heart and looked through the small opening in the gate   121.93259566628436
the inquiry is already made   150.32988604772004
milady looked at this man and hesitated   112.0796053115536
i was not rich   146.13355739631055
i don t know   156.91116779173288
this however did not prevent his asking with the greatest coolness after his majesty s health   131.1096101019101
all the horrors that disturb my thoughts make your house odious and fatal   109.26805273385318
7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the project gutenberg™ trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1   221.24569069610843
it is no doubt the same said he   95.73149525758598
then my son return to the world still more brilliant because of your former sorrows   175.97302595816086
gentlemen did you ever see a scorpion pinned to a wall   135.21861569921788
but every time he had seen him he had remarked a deep sadness imprinted on his countenance   111.24751348929698
he returned a sign in the negative   112.25532926874772
we are going with some ceremony   12.909633870536112
my father   108.049128835544
he arose and the abbé accompanied him to the door   41.9258274228433
is it possible said monte cristo to himself that i can have met with a man that has no ambition   72.68491825422896
have you brought it   103.46086853194358
the dragoon and the swiss followed him and all their comrades followed the dragoon and the swiss   174.48932617641938
yes doctor cried villefort clutching his hair yes   151.91162490724832
i am a priest and confessions die in my breast   165.39472463435447
and who spoke to him of me   108.79147993783523
it must be done said athos   126.3690643555168
maximilian understood him   134.797267837901
no   115.19389616184172
how should i know where the most beautiful and active of the frondists was at midnight   52.15216535624303
speak said charles attempting to look across the hedge of guards which surrounded him   97.05444253460507
his hand always wonderfully beautiful and strong was set off by a ruffle of lace like certain hands by titian and vandyck   77.89196987737117
do not alarm yourself sir   169.26838842656898
adieu brother   159.00263348926526
and the wife of king charles   190.720644262979
but everything does not depend on wealth and it is a fine thing to have a good name and to occupy a high station in society   128.94037661397226
because fernand and danglars being both parvenus both having become noble both rich are about equal in worth excepting that there have been certain things mentioned of him that were never said of me   75.97795381060395
when she recognized her lover the poor girl extended her arms to him and believed herself safe   61.2018179007456
but let us return to yourself   123.80320997225773
bon jour messieurs   178.76015271244117
well said he to morcerf but i think your father will not be the only angry one   105.87839017502382
really it is only in france these things are done   71.98979479126803
s throne or the still more tragic destruction of the empire   157.37242559399428
he might feel perhaps annoyed but he knew monte cristo s eye was on him   52.83303638343996
by the help of his eyes which are still full of life and as you perceive possess the power of inflicting mortal injury   112.72651589118216
the door was thrown violently open and the unfortunate mercer rushed into the chamber in which the council was held   18.767487526337902
he reflected but he remembered that he himself would have charge of the food and the wine and therefore that no powder could be mixed with the food no drug with the wine   127.40385220982306
exactly   106.47693035293138
useless to look   143.5572824680443
the events which have taken place in my house though they now occupy the public mind will be forgotten in time or if indeed a few enemies should persist in remembering them why then i will add them to my list of crimes   148.16907384170497
chapter v   106.0156707014657
cried the cardinal and welcome your friend too   140.77389429511595
i only ask you one favor   117.80078404362953
the union of physical pain with moral uneasiness had produced the effect so long desired   153.1514643205102
cromwell has time for everything   2.527617622786522
porthos called him drunk and the stranger drew his sword   157.61273270972686
so proceed   167.8893075662198
i will perish if i must but i will know it   96.27296628233496
but not mine mother replied albert   93.11084063698414
this was as we have seen the term which athos applied to d artagnan in his more expansive moods   108.65777851013189
light me   124.73592049444761
bonacieux rising all in a tremble supported herself upon her chair to avoid falling   72.09616679330148
that is cruel indeed   181.30356578133635
he bowed with great friendship to the count   110.06893415947081
de tréville had been so angry in the morning and as a witness of the rebuke the musketeers had received was not likely to be at all agreeable he pretended not to see him   71.11796565960881
believe me we have passed the time of success in intrigue and your fine eyes are not destined to be eclipsed by regretting paris where there will always be two queens as long as you are there   174.2372805915707
unfold your plan my lord and we will see   122.58900461662832
as for you raoul i am sure it is your fault some giddiness or folly   212.76396163494445
his family will inherit fifteen thousand louis a year from him   105.41356228019856
do not let us despond but wait at rueil for my conviction is that they are at rueil   111.9247619805523
and andrea continued his plan   82.59610166141442
you must henceforth be admired and quoted as a model of it   180.40205851862805
is it my father   172.30055925953963
the officer leaned forward looked at her in his turn and appeared surprised to see that face just before so beautiful distorted with passion and almost hideous   125.99673478354786
how do you dare to disturb me in the exercise of my functions   158.98639895628747
he inquired where they were and was answered by a burst of laughter   116.1173838803247
the abbé d herblay   92.88074431119871
did you say a misfortune   168.14451993202806
the antechamber of m   117.27447774276513
you are right said milady   151.87084595116482
to my grandfather s room   161.34029391183276
yes really sir you were in fact a medical man said madame de villefort since you had cured the sick   224.24627562212598
but i feel assured it will not be for long added she   53.92836336382293
ah ha said the shipowner i am not in the least surprised for she has been to me three times inquiring if there were any news of the pharaon   136.01373121683974
upon the whole however the trip had been sufficiently successful to satisfy all concerned   70.02663718268752
had just surrendered to the parliamentary troops whilst oxford and newark still held out for him in the hopes of coming to some arrangement   164.1908400428419
madame de saint méran succumbed to a powerful dose of brucine or of strychnine which by some mistake perhaps has been given to her   123.70723571205308
on the cross i swear if i ever leave this place to call down vengeance upon you from the whole human race   30.8796597838204
it s little enough   87.14727063328021
gentlemen said he monseigneur s order is you know to conduct that woman without losing time to fort la pointe and never to leave her till she is on board   65.49539925670317
said athos   145.80690094180284
the president himself advanced to place a seat for the young lady   84.51746706964965
we are not such devils as we appear to be   75.72141215803595
0056m yes   46.7123243565255
but athos raised his hand   158.25249892762653
she inquired if the baron was still at the castle   175.57052502152652
robert macaire is the hero of two favorite melodramas chien de montargis and chien d aubry and the name is applied to bold criminals as a term of derision   119.1041672811852
madame said mazarin with a smile you may rest easy   127.33388153617133
then as i said before sir very well   35.63052603861985
i know how happy my master always is to receive the vicomte said baptistin   165.46984293729068
but not knowing you would come to see me i had made an engagement with a friend   189.418129759721
for heaven s sake do not speak so loud   165.41549764572386
there only then remained porthos and bicarat   69.82784465538421
give me anything you like it is of little consequence   49.67499073809073
but wishing to make the best use of the time that was left albert started for naples   176.82713319478762
d artagnan cast an inquiring glance at milady   102.43726764564437
three brigands called trestaillon truphemy and graffan publicly assassinated everybody whom they suspected of bonapartism   117.9364041494835
i went to tortoni s where as i expected i found beauchamp and château renaud   82.75653870391432
the office of the king s attorney let us leave the banker driving his horses at their fullest speed and follow madame danglars in her morning excursion   140.70410955127025
d artagnan in fact heard a great noise on the side next the cellar   17.468099553057073
he was born at pampinara and entered the count s service when he was five years old   150.12430184374787
d épinay to arrive that the contract may be signed and the following day you will be his tomorrow you will be engaged to m   94.16078563977109
oh   146.67161348062726
exactly   93.98884170116116
ten minutes later the curate of st   196.0960702436655
danglars watch one of breguet s repeaters which he had carefully wound up on the previous night struck half past five   52.379569415557214
the marines were removed   162.51733685920314
after that i ceased to blaspheme but i cursed my father   98.33220310249322
hem   2.7386178428887007
sweet child murmured monte cristo   155.36140186784567
be assured i will return the favor hereafter   98.51658096781316
what country does he come from   166.70559579960675
therefore let us separate   174.69144787639704
aramis and his thesis d artagnan had said nothing to porthos of his wound or of his procurator s wife   4.303793701561716
in whatsoever way it is absorbed it will be found again in the body of the victim from the moment when it has been taken in sufficient quantity to cause death   114.81822517503771
i thought you had softened   149.09472263195343
i desire to know what is the meaning of this   64.44788473579295
but i who saw him in his dying moments i say he died of caderousse paused   10.811537380113265
i am not so proud as you   45.255428445146066
meanwhile to his great regret as he said he was obliged to keep his bed   84.4419571658274
no monsieur no   157.3554846561321
the work i speak of is called a treatise on the possibility of a general monarchy in italy and will make one large quarto volume   122.53675990985107
my sister is in the garden plucking the dead roses   53.02398634967864
continued beauchamp hoping to take him at a disadvantage   160.35262561475923
i do better than that sir i save you   129.393050901124
you have never seen our africans count   70.85840238294543
then sounding his bell he said to ali who entered i am going to madame s chamber have the carriage ready at one o clock   13.480367133392718
fire   206.25604028217077
good god   157.35471497521849
for if they had been able to keep up with you and if each one of them had done as much as you and your friend you would have kept your word and would have brought him back to me dead or alive   166.78104249426664
you are young replied athos   125.38830899973163
tell me their names   213.01609422775203
and that diamond cried caderousse almost breathless with eager admiration you say is worth fifty thousand francs   104.7280584703894
we do   191.61126230840534
franz could not we will not say see him but even think of him without imagining his stern head upon manfred s shoulders or beneath lara s helmet   125.37793018953569
the queen full of energy and courage was quickly alive to these two virtues in others   104.64649019424851
he was a man between sixty six and sixty eight years of age little rather stout with gray hair and light eyes   155.45047520572388
de tréville made a sign with his hand and all retired except d artagnan who did not forget that he had an audience and with the tenacity of a gascon remained in his place   124.81778890191114
pardon reverend sir said caderousse   13.28064855973932
who i am madame   13.09431824359362
a carriage below is waiting for your majesty   117.47276603381681
what was most clear in the matter was that d artagnan loved milady like a madman and that she did not love him at all   152.74455915550132
but did you not say that my kind grandfather s precaution had neutralized the poison   61.70311954486289
who can say whether d artagnan may not have betrayed us to the cardinal   153.17693660761728
commend me to the cardinal   209.3801587355886
the garden became darker still but in the darkness he looked in vain for the white dress and in the silence he vainly listened for the sound of footsteps   153.01471048460598
debray was not yet come but albert knew that he seldom lost a scene at the opera   189.13242442058134
de guiche fired the first shot at ten paces and missed his man   139.7588141035887
and as to this book added she pointing to the manual with her finger but without touching it as if she must be contaminated by it you may carry it back and make use of it yourself for doubtless you are doubly the accomplice of lord de winter the accomplice in his persecutions the accomplice in his heresies   155.71759170207272
edmond said mercédès i have but one word more to say to you   151.8838226141194
albert s love had not taken away his appetite   30.614018701884305
said he to himself misfortune is over my head   116.4033905481127
just as the brain retains on waking in the morning the dim and misty outline of a dream   160.14606471712014
belay   170.07210077040446
had he lived mercédès perchance had not become the wife of another for he would have been there to reproach her infidelity   141.14000888468115
lord winter you are not the king   130.4238873639886
he introduces himself to madame danglars it is that he may give her a royal present   101.15329846176678
the heart breaks when after having been elated by flattering hopes it sees all its illusions destroyed   142.4372066536409
she was like people who dream they are pursued and who in vain try to walk   51.8686711079981
she was forced to return to tours   203.08115308407204
she passed like a shadow through the lodge and ran upstairs without a sound escaping under the touch of her light foot   144.94856023468282
let your majesty mount on horseback and place yourself in the midst of us   64.32678024904703
m   127.67811633654134
yes   183.4733279166427
said d artagnan with some degree of emotion i struck without knowing that it was you   40.65022219717635
should you not have known me again in spite of my eight and forty years of age   57.16628306355585
where was i then   86.92912738295648
milady uttered a cry of terror and sank upon her knees   130.6197284547852
it is five years since he was here last and he did well to sell the house for it did not bring him in anything at all   123.97261809623868
the breakfast room was finished in oak   221.2103554457966
oh oh   128.68433371087954
rue de la harpe   108.58930203101123

stand on one side d artagnan stand on one side cried athos   138.28660291802322
loud roars of laughter and sullen murmurs arose together   13.761855894049958
lord de winter continued the officer who commands here in my absence you have already seen and therefore know him   136.6609614758832
do you want anything   135.0286670781773
you see   78.80239964505944
a quarrel   181.99988279522807
she was looking at the sea and her form was outlined on the blue ocean and sky   204.9595530842799
indeed   200.5719783474069
ah my lord if i mistake not the chevalier d artagnan is lieutenant of royal guards   126.10038333920723
the devil   92.9074533869079
but the well is now so completely choked up that i scarcely think it would be possible to add another handful of dust without leading to discovery   129.74685316761366
the squall was on us and the vessel began to heel   42.39415672550473
spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach him which he was pressed to taste   9.60142037005842
50119m where is morrel   143.6753331032764

island of monte cristo all i poss   37.761765172678636
at a hundred paces from the gates of calais d artagnan s horse gave out and could not by any means be made to get up again the blood flowing from his eyes and his nose   149.34285559714982
may i ask if you have any news of him   80.21727441304678
the tumultuous agitation of the young man was succeeded by a profound stupor   126.47434673771066
i learn all in the silence of my apartments for instance i see all the newspapers every periodical as well as every new piece of music   201.02318034142309
he reflected smiled and replied to me by a sicilian proverb which i believe is also a french proverb my son the world was not made in a day but in seven   39.67116486475982
germain   26.627114189675353
d artagnan drew himself up with a proud air which plainly said i ask alms of no man   176.88813446297988
go away he said   184.51615512054957
i have the power of so doing said monte cristo   222.2747018627988
he was calm and radiant was he not   186.38117804840425
no sire replied tréville who saw at the first glance how things would go on the contrary they are good creatures as meek as lambs and have but one desire i ll be their warranty   67.03012366655099
the officer entered   18.14926378637584
he cried in a tone which electrified the coachman   169.90253504633014
come and help me   68.18609051473013
yes morrel said monte cristo with a calmness which contrasted strangely with the young man s excitement   106.31282590139809
villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry which however improbable it might be if it did take place would leave him defenceless   170.0480848166175
asked franz somewhat incredulously   58.83427649802795
asked beauchamp   21.313750835780255
what is life to me   240.8456720228216
teresa was lively and gay but coquettish to excess   122.56729569352441
this doublet and hose though new were creased like traveling clothes for a long time packed in a portmanteau   27.083959224820177
every minute athos was forced to restrain d artagnan constantly in advance of the little troop and to beg him to keep in the line which in an instant he again departed from   70.72608589177088
milady breathed again   97.83344400569061
it is a handsome uniform   145.28113470619593
elsewhere the count found everything he required smelling bottles cigars knick knacks   140.09426590049142
at his mother s ball he danced once with eugénie and m   133.26064332698778
sometimes in the midst of dinner when everyone under the attraction of wine and in the warmth of conversation believed they had two or three hours longer to enjoy themselves at table aramis looked at his watch arose with a bland smile and took leave of the company to go as he said to consult a casuist with whom he had an appointment   117.49179415212691
you would then be in present possession of the letter   121.04647586327654
but strange to say this portrait seemed to displease my father and the value of the picture which is as you see one of the best works of léopold robert could not overcome his dislike to it   47.350800894795015
here it is   196.38988166929033
their fathers died before them and they mourned their loss   144.4606481150758
the coadjutor glanced rapidly behind and saw that he was followed by another man   192.58569214314952
but the eyes of the young man were accustomed to the night   147.4489842929259
at that moment patrick entered the room crying a letter from france my lord   130.86057656903967
put an end to my doubts   164.7587094389151
to some elevated spot whence i can look down on lens and the surrounding country in that case i m your man   45.112048408074
let me reflect a little   110.05271838215513
reverend sir since you know everything you know it was not i it was la carconte   168.59956219554425
i accept   224.47493433140573

the rochellais then had no hope but in buckingham   74.53726455775261
at the same time mercédès reappeared paler than before but with that imperturbable expression of countenance which she sometimes wore   132.04770575602967
they are alive that s all that i can say about them   160.48484328544404
and in whose behalf are you looking for them   178.7715738869455
ten millions   72.4107750655414
that is to say the half that was left you understand   105.50921193575728
at the moment of arriving at st   89.9635831573682
from a good source sir   155.21337314457617

am i indeed so happy   155.70876831139097
this arrangement pleased every one   149.74556385808035
but before the notary could answer villefort had drawn him aside   148.50996379818923
if you are outside the united states check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before downloading copying displaying performing distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any other project gutenberg™ work   124.13674227289776
these last words produced a prodigious effect on the seaman   29.134007006313567
the corsican who had declared the vendetta against me who had followed me from nîmes to paris who had hid himself in the garden who had struck me had seen me dig the grave had seen me inter the child he might become acquainted with your person nay he might even then have known it   72.01349251958115
and d artagnan had time therefore to watch bazin unsuspected   84.58274873621329
albert however felt no less insulted   89.79035735946346
the light of day reassured me   205.4904897129852
she looked at the clock rose reseated herself smiled at d artagnan with an air which said you are very amiable no doubt but you would be charming if you would only depart   155.578010086453
it was in valentine s room   130.3703474964712
it is that then replied the young man anxious to find out the truth it is that then i remember as we remember a dream   142.2446702058341
there are only said the gendarme a governor a garrison turnkeys and good thick walls   151.00329281393434

my orders were to carry him off alive or dead   60.8152247279223
d avrigny bounded towards the door flew down the back staircase and almost knocked down madame de villefort in his haste who was herself going down to the kitchen   95.09408917081227
speak   101.79510334617483
i am he   98.87583993793837
d artagnan went out but at the door his heart almost failed him and he felt inclined to return   74.5120381450104
i think not   126.60915398362991
fernand let fall his head like a defeated man heaved a sigh that was like a groan and then suddenly looking her full in the face with clenched teeth and expanded nostrils said but if he is dead if he is dead i shall die too   135.3756730490563
ah i always thought there was some secret understanding in that quarter   199.36925708700846
on the contrary he sometimes amused me very much by telling me stories   135.43058568978535
at this moment m   122.76737220754498
come to us this evening and to morrow we ll return your visit   123.07247427156517
but what cared i for delays or difficulties valentine as long as you confessed that you loved me and took pity on me   233.57026775751044

asked she   67.17580980161287
the count inquired whether any of the ancient jailers were still there   111.40365905856228
we have quitted business   33.54280946442938
felton said buckingham you will withdraw and place yourself at once under arrest   141.61874086733826
yes repeated the executioner   157.60177589281602
good heaven   71.88922252120452
so let us go and get killed where we are told to go   120.26118920778687
vampa in this attire resembled a painting by léopold robert or schnetz   90.97915269236182
indeed   121.3784054877208
precisely monsieur replied monte cristo with one of those smiles that a painter could never represent or a physiologist analyze   138.31515001549374
a ground floor ornamented with arabesques bathing its terraces in the water and another floor looking on the lake was all which was visible to the eye   113.15675358038733
m   118.49800615205868
stay here is another louis for you   162.23790835879046
it is not very difficult to say   75.19731755395219
and he fell back on the bed pale trembling and apparently about to die   103.9780839154747
never more to be separated   141.92558628535858
i will confess to you albert replied franz the count is a very singular person and the appointment you have made to meet him in paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions   183.51989677296714
the authorities had terrified me and you know that an innkeeper must keep on good terms with the authorities   116.19784385210447
org donate   78.17103953670977
as to king charles the question must be viewed differently   150.2272365515435
danglars acquitted himself like a man placed between two dangerous positions and who is rendered brave by fear   129.45388242342113
i do not seek your confidence my dear friend   41.63355207232071
porthos obeyed with military promptness and passed his arm through the opening   62.97499923076181
these places are bought   74.41762560263041
ah   26.945661096207232

te deum for the victory of lens   107.32389788813673
the story interests you does it not sir   11.503109513735566
the count de rochefort   122.33327730645534
the interview   171.13547027981863
they knew d artagnan and knew that he did nothing without a purpose   102.58437088925228
but at the same time rely on our royal gratitude   124.60772380863068
in a handsome running hand   129.28944091355856
at this moment emmanuel entered his countenance full of animation and joy   159.2572742841219
it is without the setting which is also valuable replied the abbé as he closed the box and returned it to his pocket while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated innkeeper   76.74527236622578
he will hurt himself with all his ill chosen barbarisms let him go home and go to sleep   97.32200844760487
richelieu slowly tore the paper which d artagnan had generously relinquished   27.33295733496331
it was evident that madame danglars was suffering from that nervous irritability which women frequently can not account for even to themselves   178.86409233198606
madame danglars gazed on villefort stupefied to find him so almost insultingly calm   119.21397715017488
take care my cries are not heard for if they are it is more than probable i should be removed to another part of the prison and we be separated forever   164.8089010160731
that would spoil my plans   179.5069861547207
and i idem said aramis   144.8317025894297
the sight of the young man was evidently painful to him and there he still was in fact on the rock the beacon shedding around him as it were a doubtful aureole   138.28132534245375
vampa when this man is satisfied let him be free   130.06098082031255

at length he found himself at the foot of a staircase and he mechanically lifted his foot five or six times   106.2079909310046
then after a slight hesitation she resumed   88.3601687929209
on his return from the vatican franz carefully avoided the corso   72.36502022883434
and now said the queen we are forgetting one very necessary thing   154.07677112297316
he threw himself on his knees   63.692838058290974
this edifice which i have been so long preparing which i have reared with so much care and toil is to be crushed by a single touch a word a breath   81.06885493661733
near paris is it not   87.8769670189719
at the siege of besancon i was in the trenches   196.333737124835
he continued his way toward the quai des grands augustins while the two friends went to ring at the bell of the unfortunate porthos   94.25409867380026
she prepared the iced water which he was in the habit of constantly drinking for since his sojourn at the kiosk he had been parched by the most violent fever after which she anointed his white beard with perfumed oil and lighted his chibouque which he sometimes smoked for hours together quietly watching the wreaths of vapor that ascended in spiral clouds and gradually melted away in the surrounding atmosphere   68.40625932704542
stay where you are i will tell you   186.85365768354774

then turning to the crew he said bear a hand there to take in sail   105.01240488310302
ali left the room   204.7049308537898
because that young man so handsome so elegant so polished is a child i have adopted and who does not even know who was his father   94.83887423813468

andrea at his departure inherited all the papers which proved that he had indeed the honor of being the son of the marquis bartolomeo and the marchioness oliva corsinari   164.716495349352
there you stood stammering stupefied annihilated   61.18371275995556

tony he said motioning to his groom to approach   131.9903681822249

in fact the dream of poor bazin had always been to serve a churchman   135.99294423513456
a gesture a smile and a word from grimaud all at once were so unusual that his highness stopped short astounded   86.3664490810885

the captain of the musketeers was therefore admired feared and loved   128.24670190321052
a moment said athos   86.05444858701199
this man except a sword had all the appearance of a soldier   66.90604713288542
milady not seeing me come again would not be able to understand what could cause the interruption of my visits and might suspect something   62.09402197807707

there was no occasion to push the door it was wide open   90.79468256044306
the young man cast a glance at the first musket and saw with a certain degree of inquietude that it was leveled in his direction   145.1266641266041
as she told the queen she had not seen her husband since his liberation   74.10288843691896

yet i think i hear her piano   108.27520345148392
you are right madame and i will not finish   203.2996713637458
d artagnan then saw a musket barrel leveled at him   206.42379687091736
making more use of your cabinet with your pen and your telegraph than napoleon did of his battle fields with his sword and his victories   169.9102071194584
what do you mean   155.69513169352558
i have always had more dread of a pen a bottle of ink and a sheet of paper than of a sword or pistol   116.47532450313261
what comments must be made   164.05158622748093
i have been here six months without the shadow of recreation   88.15180345279623
porthos took the letter and with a trembling voice read the following words the queen wishes to speak to monsieur d artagnan who must follow the bearer   108.07195611787323
at the foot of the stairs valentine found barrois awaiting her   106.6186991994743
she therefore contented herself with saying that m   131.70132434171254

i must tell you that i have not come to any decided opinion respecting him but i think him a maltese   44.658806371776095
the assizes also were about to begin and villefort shut up in his room exerted himself with feverish anxiety in drawing up the case against the murderer of caderousse   126.25851047835863
is that your name monsieur   87.91589761353588
why that s as long as the almighty took to make the world   95.60357806674942
he escapes us growled porthos pushing his huge shoulder against the hinges but in vain   139.4937844089494
what a fine plain for partridge shooting   158.39406922260844
cried felton in a high state of excitement   89.32880213912618
benedetto rejoined his associates and i saw him from a distance point me out to them as a fool   164.42295975280697
edmond hoped he was dying   25.124866546557655
millionaires like yourself my lord are rare in france   114.72121534604247
he assured me that nothing would be easier than to furnish all i desired   118.9595092470805
your age   60.128505867857264
monsieur du vallon and myself came from france with him   90.63630663008193
but monsieur louvieres are you aware that it is simply civil war you are proposing to me   104.99884679484278
but in order to have known everything so well you must have been an eye witness   132.47291627189347
now if you have them   57.87579545044821
they sat down to dinner   104.32403879839669
and he swallowed another glass of wine   105.29748275643544
answer   117.30439807709612
said the count   37.83773825968619
morrel farewell and a thousand thanks   2.054557448848769
really that demoiselle d aubigne is very charming   81.13315599439937
de wardes   13.242384856308306

and you   155.1820746081603
if i should happen to be any distance from you when the carriage comes for you at dinner or supper for instance   137.0740948192917
de boville   166.0462051519986
this excess of bilious humor could not be attributed to play   33.99396312110787
so that i shall have performed my duty without the expense of an outfit   98.11599639544757
well sir said morrel sinking into a chair you have heard all and i have nothing further to tell you   211.4372714952387
like the streams which the heat of the summer has dried up and which after the autumnal storms gradually begin oozing drop by drop so did the count feel his heart gradually fill with the bitterness which formerly nearly overwhelmed edmond dantès   75.26028107625714
d artagnan was pacing to and fro like a caged tiger   68.32963752304178
let us drink while the wine is fresh   158.08336006885156
is not that word known in france   130.47062086190883
but i have no permission to shoot over this island   34.84161966810986
i am not like you viscount   71.48715274847005
i alone can save you and i will   71.83067020999171
and if lord winter s men but do their duty we are saved instead of lost   5.322850693145625
d artagnan made his way through the crowd advanced toward the host and pronounced the word forward   90.50266602162556
he questioned jacopo   191.87738206198208
no   64.10617765754222
the king thanked m   211.06261333652884
and your fee   157.58696692653368
the person whose mysterious arrival had attracted the attention of franz stood in a kind of half light that rendered it impossible to distinguish his features although his dress was easily made out   158.88114475105112
no   100.58178784205279
i suspect a hoax is intended but the instigators of it little knew whom they had to deal with   168.84036688690503
take courage sir   163.8139494447285
by what right sir   55.78281571996193
her eyes however betrayed that perfect confidence which contradicted the girlish simplicity of this modest attire   41.77962520787965
franz felt a shudder run through his veins at observing that the feeling of the duke and the countess was so much in unison with his own personal disquietude   3.999151461642441
d artagnan   77.90116607510444
i didn t understand it all he said but i understand now   130.35152311359718
the reason for so publicly announcing all this is that all good and faithful catholics may offer up their prayers for the unfortunate culprits and above all beseech of heaven to grant them a sincere repentance   221.00751784034918
de villefort and see what this new fancy of your grandfather s is   139.41158845548148

i say our country because you were born not far from marseilles   80.08508888250503
the count and ali ate in haste a crust of bread and drank a glass of spanish wine   58.764990474867645
another salver passed loaded like the preceding ones   125.67375746548643

she saw me also and in trying to jump from the end of a pile of wood on which she had mounted the poor child fell and was not able to rise again   251.20764956797342
whilst enchanted at being all together again the friends awaited his return   114.7393718391299
whence it came no one knew and it spoke an unknown tongue   56.80121192155352
you   69.22798617951142
inquired the king of villefort   91.7269176621878
why the man must owe me a fearful grudge   105.190305987129
speak then i am all attention   108.70588902536005
the handkerchief was thrown down and the iron heeled shoe replaced on the foot of the wretch to whom it belonged   143.9279700221884
but her lips closed again without articulating a word while the color gradually faded from her cheeks   162.40888688090646
the devil   81.8519805235236
sit down dear count and go on with your story   181.64494398993986

come guitant speak if you please respectfully of these gentlemen said mazarin   48.65465165836275

the day had begun to break when athos arose and dressed himself   168.15217383622576
it is my marriage you mean is it not dear grandpapa   94.24814495449132
she with a still smiling countenance took his arm and passed with him under a low arched door which by a vaulted passage lighted only at the farther end led to a stone staircase around an angle of stone   45.53016895555372
a worthy man who had pretended to be a curate for the purpose of getting his mistress married and securing her a position   91.18174893316609
it was therefore easy in the midst of this confusion to remain as unobserved as any one might wish   92.97089900517862
ah   128.2433711323028
chapter lxvi   122.70657479511517

bonacieux was known to belong to the queen   108.44708545691218
you will know that to morrow evening said the coadjutor smiling   145.19136571702214
at this moment one of the door keepers brought in a letter for the president   28.939083843859308
an adventure on the high road   180.47881673402043
i came to tell you   105.15973439161479
well since we must part said the count holding out a hand to each of the young men allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey   109.24946413734158
d artagnan was not one of those foolhardy men who seek a ridiculous death in order that it may be said of them that they did not retreat a single step   143.9898822924311
the smallpox   125.58522883639823
when he reappeared athos received him with the same paternal smile as that which he had often bestowed on d artagnan but a more profound tenderness for raoul was now visibly impressed upon his face   128.93460608673217
bazin uttered a profound sigh and went out to look for the ladder   98.33816611743676
go on while i endeavor to recall circumstances   107.98383574992349
yes sir replied the abbé   87.65752588922297
what we are going to say does not concern your majesty   41.03422227433475
exclaimed dantès   37.41175790718192
the eyes of porthos were furtively cast upon this lady and then roved about at large over the nave   164.2018415508911
you would take your gun you would unhesitatingly shoot the poor beast who after all was only guilty of having been bitten by another dog   43.69554144089986
and what is it to me   118.78294139644795
he fetched from an old secretaire a sheet of white paper and pen and ink   63.593924824051626
and now at last said the queen now that we are alone repeat your counsel monsieur le coadjuteur   102.60676993680532
debray because i have no friends now and i ought not to have any   161.41870859145072
who prepared it   61.32205156089728
i see but one impediment   125.227921478989
could you let me hire a horse of you   75.56044275419286
your bills at least are the first that will fall due   138.03802414058734
one throw is soon made   154.87873088505842
no   178.2097027457267
in ten minutes they will perhaps be here   108.03384092341517
each of them took one which ali lighted and then retired to prepare the coffee   93.18268848275711
with your tastes and means of gratifying them continued danglars you will exhibit a splendor that must effectually put us poor miserable millionaires quite in the shade   136.76513763571748
he was a man about twenty two or twenty three years old but who appeared much older from ascetic exercises   5.239281746133372
said athos rising   59.69413148061568
the conversation had rested there and scarron through sheer obstinacy had seen monsieur de gondy only the more frequently   84.00428027669874
i dressed myself as quickly as possible   95.37726358406199
we should have heard the blow then   197.57615748561028
then he shook his head saying if i were porthos and d artagnan came to make me such a proposition as i am going to make to him i know what i should say to it   265.706883534362
i have not yet seen him   73.74317803236411
doctor pray recall your words   89.69963338018285
and caderousse bowed his head with every sign of real repentance   55.91091197059862
placed between life and death as bernajoux was he had no idea for a moment of concealing the truth   193.13233826535986
all four of us   26.384856952761368
what does he expect to have at the end of his devotion   1.098519450439511
and i shall be at the convent of jesuits   32.91628294209558
in the meantime d artagnan who had plunged into a bypath continued his route and reached st   97.63447167214109
someone has vexed you   113.58685433072114

m   70.77909301661234
answer in your turn or you may repent of your disobedience   97.83257932290473
they broke open the doors and searched the dwelling but in vain   79.14106261027504
unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg 1   124.41273251673486
peste   26.49537786484258
you care about it then so much   79.03626776850678
the queen touched with her lips the white smooth brow the royal child presented to her with a gravity which already partook of etiquette   6.536183742868573
give her that poison recommending her soul to god and save your honor and your life for it is yours she aims at   113.56063315845651
madame madame exclaimed de winter your majesty abandons yourself to despair   8.903484264884455
asked the bandit   87.25183029452768
well then be more affectionate my dear villefort said the baroness   95.94327301189064
and aramis wouldn t swear   160.0824380361997
he sat down without saying a word to anybody and began to reflect   191.707784633831
so if i do not send you more it is because i fear you would not accept a larger sum   127.68272364649417
ah it is no then   130.0104618171757
cried d artagnan i doubt what you say   95.20229204651591
there was no peculiar indication in any organ an excitement of the nervous system that was it   117.72922498475795
all this time the soldiers were calling out stop   143.21253439536872
you must not weep no you must not groan you must tremble   142.59179992874377
in the morning felton came as usual   79.51757483895301
the french army held all between pont a marc as far as valenciennes falling back upon douai   33.34425976791589
i am told it is a delightful place   206.8450018754133
no and your confidence makes you honorable in my opinion   89.69228551756859
my lord replied athos for myself i have nothing to demand   75.97094035907118
the house with all its crumbling antiquity and apparent misery was yet cheerful and picturesque and was the same that old dantès formerly inhabited the only difference being that the old man occupied merely the garret while the whole house was now placed at the command of mercédès by the count   152.60393578220143
i have a slave   114.53333850544107

yes said albert but this has nothing to do with the existence of the count of monte cristo   181.3740264880546
bonacieux could hardly hear what she said to my lord duke of buckingham london   99.6645920672821
it was called the palais cardinal before richelieu gave it to the king   165.50386047803454
and at this moment albert had nothing more transpired your father s cause had been gained   121.72482899691144
i swear to you monsieur commissary that you are in the profoundest error that i know nothing in the world about what my wife had to do that i am entirely a stranger to what she has done   165.1499987979268
he was received in triumph as if he came from conquering an enemy and not frenchmen   167.24900412750338
in brief how much remains   4.56088422485918
and what shall i say to the people   149.32550667071033
no replied d artagnan   78.30910304028404
the only thing the builder could oblige him in would be to contrive a sort of secret closet in the cabin at his bed s head the closet to contain three divisions so constructed as to be concealed from all but himself   188.05580919962784
30047m he did not credit it at the period which i knew him said monte cristo touched to the heart by the accents of julie s voice   105.87626111368037

besides his mind was too vacillating to allow him to carry out an idea   72.27392994888427
the bell here rang for the third time with another shriek of anguish   120.0313801464779
alas dear friend   49.32130201273266
cried the duke   57.042808982021604

bazin sighed   140.28254958026938
dantès ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to pieces   201.76152954512446
you are late my dear porthos   90.01307090889853
the two piastres that luigi received every month from the count of san felice s steward and the price of all the little carvings in wood he sold at rome were expended in ear rings necklaces and gold hairpins   92.79479309178242
danglars was engaged at that moment presiding over a railroad committee   46.76119111075154
well then the place   135.86822477852087
the latter rose and bowed to the countess who inclined herself without speaking   210.12463793578974
rochefort remained for a moment in thought   146.2712825870741
i understand perfectly   131.09005481364056
nogent beautin the fool of the court exclaimed that the queen was very happy to have the succor of religion at such a moment   172.063286067885
yes   84.4636795315341
the detachment now moved toward the town with the royal captive   206.49211897471258
de villefort and begs me to present him to your majesty   159.0902396437895
they saw him in the distance climbing the rock in order to look down upon the boat as it passed   116.08272487848254
edmond was intensely interested   84.13848326294126
m   215.1246384084436
mazarin wrote a few words which he gave to this man   32.51164136929174
in the street   62.81747577463981
excuse me but as you will see i only tell you what is absolutely necessary   81.34589822634084
how was that   151.15645900509645
never mind that said barrois   125.61442400640767
see him and hear what he says   84.56106971080581
then my friends and i took her tried her and condemned her   119.09801432491193
you are a noble minded woman and it was your grief that disarmed me   120.96799289595113
then she ventured to open her eyelids and glance over her extended arm   62.45706519738907
cried athos   70.7897383044934
not on your own account surely replied monte cristo   166.53516519376288
but with the rapidity of thought d artagnan seized athos by the waist and followed by porthos with aramis leaped down from the benches rushed into the passages and flying down the staircase were lost in the crowd without while the muskets within were pointed on some three thousand spectators whose piteous cries and noisy alarm stopped the impulse already given to bloodshed   178.13170640172618
that i am dependent on another i who have always gained my own livelihood honestly   167.93560362172067
these four virtues disputed the prize for a length of time and gave birth to magnificent speeches which we do not repeat here for fear they should be deemed too long   51.740227253774776
the storm still continued   99.86206315257867
why truly replied monte cristo determined not to lose an inch of the ground he had gained my reason for desiring an unlimited credit was precisely because i did not know how much money i might need   144.47294246626518
of all this household only two persons deserve our notice   87.08421386303132
i have been taught these two aphorisms in latin and in greek   120.98029858921922
now as regards the second question   154.24496689363679
he was pale but calm and collected and saluting his judge with easy politeness looked round for a seat as if he had been in m   144.78934584172157
8   121.68953257507829
nothing replied the count   114.8439896772152
franz assured me replied albert that she was sixty six years old   198.17218790774092
30119m what precaution   191.63037517947853
and milady after having lost the first trick was not willing to lose the second   142.7818925439364
yes my lord pentecost   190.14618902770587
i shall be grateful to you all my life   73.93277230567399
i struggled then with all my strength and doubtless opposed weak as i was a long resistance for i heard him cry out these miserable puritans   184.90384154246416
s   152.03141379558855
alas   129.86515258192966
25 in the rue de vaugirard   224.2233036472473
money is as plentiful in that house as fruit in an orchard   220.03470349536676
one day when i cursed providence for making me so wicked and ordaining me to such a fate my adopted father said to me do not blaspheme unhappy child the crime is that of your father not yours of your father who consigned you to hell if you died and to misery if a miracle preserved you alive   116.36513393786615
adieu faltered the count who felt his heart die away within him   148.61150339180543
as he was passing the allée des veuves he thought he saw the count s horses standing at gosset s shooting gallery   176.77718261432287
murmured villefort clasping his hands   108.88013669539464
yes   122.64033008750992
this is frightful   151.58502454751832
on these days he spoke a little   97.08803518130182
cried la carconte do as you will   125.33189989248243
but these monks are subject to such degrading practices   59.78795673504071
a resemblance between the boy and the man explained the mystery of this regenerated existence   147.49580589508463
cried d artagnan   148.84924567643534
i would follow him to hell and that is saying not a little as i believe him entirely capable of the descent   89.24297218208068
you are always in the right my dear friend cried porthos   119.26933301233045
he grew more pale every minute and they were obliged to support him on his horse   135.46156501985197
aramis found athos and brought him   32.70487924675349
mazarin overcome by this determination read the two letters   94.56856186765843
bonacieux called a long time   173.8350124468567
we left england ignorant of the state of politics here having left paris before the departure of the king   124.35143674867719
he rubbed his eyes doubting if he really saw before him athos and aramis   143.32246274125583
the count was silent but continued to gaze around him   189.06575086093608
not the first prince of the blood not the king s uncle but the base conspirator the soul of every cabal who pretends to lead the brave people who are weak enough to believe in the honor of a prince of the blood not the prince nearest to the throne not the king s uncle i repeat but the murderer of chalais of montmorency and of cinq mars who is playing now the same game he played long ago and who thinks that he will win the game because he has a new adversary instead of a man who threatened a man who smiles   63.068252547734424
perhaps he even suspects the person   83.00706708113015
never mind   111.37610071062699
said anne of austria drawing herself up to her full height and fixing her eyes upon the chancellor with an expression almost threatening   105.90511394029632
said mazarin   159.53089024338624
let me die   117.10315495107822
it is you who sold us my mother and me to the merchant el kobbir   189.04638476980364
it was nearly ten o clock   106.0038642861251
ah   58.68378812130135
that s love or i don t know what love is   144.46171911004836
i demand the suppression of the thesis   50.05337463082091
quick   60.96381300024897
this positive assurance seemed to give caderousse a little courage   140.8993811089779
only this time it was no longer from affectation but from terror   64.0331970454814
not one of us has failed the others at this rendezvous   66.54550716189573
poor humanity   115.27991666174178
i am with the person to whom this letter was addressed and to whom i desired to prove that luigi vampa was a man of his word   55.00236013423093
nothing more just   146.6772299599175
you will soon not only surpass the railway which would not be very difficult in france but even the telegraph   169.11641627390628
athos shrugged his shoulders and followed his guards silently while m   200.0916903742782
f   88.37712978807052
59 and i no   162.06586432745294
yes my officer   173.84134820486213
asked gondy   104.5418167947136
do you know what they are saying here   52.86413613381993
on the contrary that time was most favorable for us smugglers but for my brother a soldier of the empire returning from the army of the loire with his uniform and his epaulets there was everything to apprehend   42.92360475208045
oh death death   134.86013357089453
whilst he was talking to this lad a horse was brought to the door of bazin s house   43.06764335447494
that is he except that his beard has turned gray and his hair is white   195.210450351678
bonacieux   126.64030354242841
let you sir   83.2876822214544
de tréville hastened to report himself at the louvre   62.564287681102016
the marquis of saint méran   201.39707027297547
opinions held in common are a ready bond of union   77.8445418009475
and it is still entirely in the power of my husband to cause the will which is now in prejudice of valentine to be altered in her favor   175.0803195427265
danglars nodded to signify that he was satisfied   76.5760494914332
you only speak thus because you are overheard coolly replied milady   46.23260343194359
the count bowed his head and clasped his hands together   182.45258907083974
1   116.31398754512179
the king went away enchanted   84.03523876441861
bonacieux what is that noise   142.25739394403843
it was to this apartment he had desired his guest to be shown with the purpose of overwhelming him at the sight of so much luxury   169.55561830114254
that i have suffered as much as himself more than he has obliged as i am to eat the bread of exile and to ask hospitality from false friends who smile at my tears   86.99624263588852
he said after having swallowed the divine preserve   114.519599009371
but the voice was all   134.72542646122668
certainly   101.15630572109743
it only remained to put it to the vote when the president resumed gentlemen and you monsieur you will not be displeased i presume to listen to one who calls himself a very important witness and who has just presented himself   210.24227476464966
replied the king   151.6396501186613
it is a prison within a prison   100.2471438453701
he possesses fortune a high rank in society and every personal qualification likely to render valentine supremely happy his name moreover can not be wholly unknown to you   191.06560022712264
it was benedetto   128.62707889395784
morrel took leave of him at the door renewing his promise to be with him the next morning at seven o clock and to bring emmanuel   68.96589994899071
i pardieu   126.83948038069644
now said d artagnan i am going to call this soldier and talk to him   111.69759107403722
you know very well that the last was stopped on his way dashed on the rocks and the governor told us next day that we were careless fellows   203.03571160982003
yes sir replied franz   94.11183697059121
you intended to give me a two franc piece and see you gave me a double napoleon   116.38368400371334
it would be unpardonable   63.89607292049428
i wish to keep it in remembrance of your eminence   139.5026991894396
near her was mademoiselle louise d armilly who thanked the count for the letters of introduction he had so kindly given her for italy which she intended immediately to make use of   181.97374320522084
very good said d artagnan   168.61791483942383
you are mistaken   142.45226995158416
replied athos   190.63548583581752
said monte cristo   122.26303387909438
for i have no friend but yourself upon earth who am neglected and forgotten by my father harassed and persecuted by my stepmother and left to the sole companionship of a paralyzed and speechless old man whose withered hand can no longer press mine and who can speak to me with the eye alone although there still lingers in his heart the warmest tenderness for his poor grandchild   153.56991347010515
the nails too were turning blue   92.77860967518413
nearly a year   107.24528757243336
that is to say i visit an englishwoman the one i named   90.77028336808155
albert shook his head and looked thoughtful   126.52033603606007
no no   108.70681762224652
to this monsieur de beaufort replied that since every opportunity of distinguishing himself in arms was taken from him he wished to make himself celebrated in the arts   108.87831643935084
both however cast an inquisitive glance into the tankard it was full of gunpowder   148.73647715446182
for that is i believe the phrase for hopeful ambition   128.75388095721576
he is the son of one of my oldest friends the son of a man who served under the king your father of glorious memory in the civil war   139.0212467765866
the countess took albert to meet madame danglars   34.07962674196281
i thought i must confess that these tales were inventions of the middle ages   39.4251056710266
20053m maximilian my dearest brother   153.80594371181763
copyright law means that no one owns a united states copyright in these works so the foundation and you   128.7695021466925
amusing certainly replied the young man inasmuch as instead of shedding tears as at the fictitious tale of woe produced at a theatre you behold in a law court a case of real and genuine distress a drama of life   216.07698279356686
fortunately deceived by d artagnan s trick they neglected to reload their guns   41.34056646525883
now i recollect danglars himself passed by just as captain leclere was giving me the packet for the grand marshal   200.78863389184235
no   95.66876342111863
at the end of an hour she was completely out of sight   10.77416195498941
ah here is m   76.20686071815416
said caderousse with a voice more tipsy than ever   54.03274910056707
there are a few things that you can do with most project gutenberg™ electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement   174.49824915270602
oh mon dieu   278.4591964050355
at the footman s announcement she raised herself a little and peeped out with some curiosity   153.03628744695166
in reality replied the latter who with his aristocratic glance and his knowledge of the world had penetrated at once all that was penetrable in monte cristo albert has not deceived us for the count is a most singular being   201.52532292434512
pursue your chase after him tomorrow as eagerly as you please   152.2271869879115
then the vehicle disappeared round one of the turnings of fort saint nicholas   184.32046561835438
on the twenty eighth of october 1628 the capitulation was signed   110.9491778309881
now i have thee thou art a frondeur and the lover of madame de longueville   70.914795591775
some complaints arose from the crowd and were addressed this time to the king as well as the minister   146.90888529461864
now madame continued debray first opening the closet then the chest   209.2463107063533
what dreadful sufferings   97.05523001701424
just as the court was settling down in the cathedral a carriage bearing the arms of comminges quitted the line of the court carriages and proceeded slowly to the end of the rue saint christophe now entirely deserted   104.00701520307078
the suicide chapter 93   207.88612785442987
how should i know who they are   25.025799800549976
in that time many favorable and unforeseen chances may befriend us   184.07561357332406
where can my eyes have been not to have seen you during the two hours of the sermon   133.59779471731198
however he remained standing clinging to a window   115.66259510835451
d artagnan had often meditated against the perfidious host one of those hearty vengeances which offer consolation while they are hoped for   119.56907654398655
let us see said athos assuming in advance a critical look   122.37950558733571
her eyes were straining to see the ship which was carrying her son over the vast sea   178.84667840952173
beauchamp s i found madame in tears   124.85694522683929
or else he should not have reached beaucaire   175.62647642151435
asked the old man   124.23182614837046
take this said madame de villefort giving her smelling bottle to valentine   150.96662991502708
it s for some purpose rely on it   181.77224442597426
henry said charles call me your father   109.7597601537444
i don t understand was the reply   75.91880384521218
he said   146.32718013897244
one might have supposed the bastille appeared before you and that the gigantic medusa had converted you into stone   76.0289404595826
what could he say   197.33195690476788
gaetano faltered an excuse and advanced to the opposite side while two sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their way   138.26322820945327
and that is true   139.94900890171783
the butt end of the musket hovered over his head and he could scarcely restrain himself from closing his eyes when with one bound guiche reached the spaniard and placed a pistol at his throat   35.90277751806845
there were two rooms on each floor and he was the only tenant   87.11504460260059
ah father said albert with a smile it is evident you do not know the count of monte cristo   81.17177745061383
but how   137.38190807457877
and you what are you doing here   266.909428738805
said the musketeers   173.2236697425142
planchet shook his head with the air of a man who says in that case things look ill   71.32625498130471
where is he   93.1858985134736
no no continued the count had i to avenge myself it is not thus i would take revenge   154.31641131499072
oh that is not my secret   158.016807661307
the marshal recognized him and hastened to meet him   89.52838477248224
in this room at about ten o clock in the morning the banker himself had been walking to and fro for some minutes thoughtfully and in evident uneasiness watching both doors and listening to every sound   124.51896046128046
after a hundred yards he turned the corner of the thicket   118.08080743914103
your body is covered with a coating of fat which preserves it from the cold air   53.253088292279706
j   164.76146540875436
but we have forgotten to mention one circumstance which nevertheless ought not to be omitted   132.39369280971428
his complexion so long kept from the sun had now that pale color which produces when the features are encircled with black hair the aristocratic beauty of the man of the north   23.611194927564952
you see i am a good sort of a man   171.79642429966864
albert appeared not to notice this remark which was however so rude that madame danglars blushed   93.78134257312207
he saw me hold out my arms to him and he stooped down and pressed my forehead with his lips   130.14374085345986
it is pleasant to have such well dressed brethren   77.7162464068737
oh i take everything on myself   51.6231732296509
and whatever people may say continued caderousse in his native language which was not altogether devoid of rude poetry i can not help being more frightened at the idea of the malediction of the dead than the hatred of the living   57.27352092618146
at the mention of monte cristo dantès started with joy   120.22992339047167
we say proud as a scotsman murmured the duke of buckingham   64.59360710118196
mme   40.280584634302144
his eye elate with happiness was reading eagerly the tearful gaze of haydée when suddenly the door opened   216.7602181823189
but now i will begin with more perseverance and fury than ever since fear urges me not my conscience   9.282749739298495
the count of san felice pointed out teresa who was hanging on luigi s arm in a group of peasants   209.20017496115213
undoubtedly i know it but it is a mystery   182.70051026247808
it is true the cardinal had been particularly ill tempered   145.1432949307535
yes yes murmured cromwell   126.5802977167465
athos threw himself into d artagnan s arms   177.0756481630616
why did her father ask for this key which she always kept and which was only taken from her in childhood as a punishment   130.10398807674738
what is this name of monte cristo   87.38872506060358
now asked athos what are we to do with ourselves till evening   50.447575014658284
what are you going to do at portsmouth   149.462327083527
is it not so   137.58046515237896
but still i owe this courtesy to my old friend a man who had in him material for the most noble and generous of characters   78.58911655475085
and don t you play too when you are on guard   90.47463977031137
the others my lord   137.18460360299682
were i compelled to marry another i would destroy myself   98.65076495809298
that will keep us from going away from the east whither i am tempted to think i have been conveyed by some good genius   97.7936302248769
but what happened after my departure   120.31074176107536
we will judge you in spite of your silence   74.90004054610063
villefort suffocating pressed the doctor s arm   53.45031827674601
a french nurse who sent me away when i was five years old because no one paid her for me telling me the name of a relation of whom she had heard my mother often speak   44.30146554491225
in fact he sometimes asked himself if all that was happening to him was not a dream or at least the delirium of a fever   113.8490197452654

to leghorn   160.55808697421946

andrea that the season of your youth was rather a stormy one   109.62157616717161

it was then that he saw a horseman as it were detach himself from the wall and follow him at a little distance   131.32284228439158
for as he came in i remarked that it was but half past nine by the clock although i had believed it to be later   154.01873789877718
oh my lord said d artagnan quietly shutting the window it is not worth while weeping yet for probably an hour hence there will not be one of your mirrors remaining in the palais royal whether they be venetian or parisian   187.23386938136804
from that day d artagnan felt lonely and powerless without courage to pursue a career in which he could only distinguish himself on condition that each of his three companions should endow him with one of the gifts each had received from heaven   141.18013680248077
and at these words lord de winter passed his arm through that of felton and led him out laughing   117.64113299955089
m   81.8047170803693

the result was that rospigliosi and spada paid for being cardinals and eight other persons paid for the offices the cardinals held before their elevation and thus eight hundred thousand crowns entered into the coffers of the speculators   82.64089288406541
his naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of brown from the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of stationing himself from morning till eve at the threshold of his door on the lookout for guests who seldom came yet there he stood day after day exposed to the meridional rays of a burning sun with no other protection for his head than a red handkerchief twisted around it after the manner of the spanish muleteers   57.8283090023511
the color mounted to the queen s face   100.69596533890311

the conference being finished the queen summoned him to her cabinet   108.31874462826704
she demanded what i meant and when i had told her all giovanni said she you should have brought this child with you   118.30114639877915
the prince looked at grimaud grimaud looked at the clock   155.6367136731044

noirtier s room   153.3859028908734
30279m that is an overwhelming demonstration and you would make everyone vow to live a single life   143.55572967039643
to the swords   64.83301865927237
perhaps we shall have to make certain conditions therefore a solemn conference is indispensable   88.08005155229762
he might by chance hear the hollow sound of his footsteps and call the attention of his officer to the circumstance   196.33111797328908
said monte cristo i trust he is not going to tempt me by some fresh insult   95.9857717059185
you have my word   136.43034438623752
then he saw through the whole thing   89.81927053685871
let us do things in order   111.39119854691687
felton give me that knife   84.56349911007084
gondy smiled   122.69009110919781
do you wish to destroy me   134.0056369179594
there is here no question of crime or treason   127.81784056960596
anne said he you are but a woman and as a woman you may insult men at your ease knowing that you can do it with impunity   245.97891473300842
and however well made the mask may be with a little attention we may always succeed in distinguishing it from the true face   67.94790959719762
well and what then   10.997323147816843
the cardinal repressed a smile   49.43201448867764
but not every one   154.0788686168616
it was necessary that d artagnan should find alone the staircase and the little chamber   77.24067589016654
i will leave you with this stranger   12.764976133510515
tis well resumed the king   79.81477772780865
at that moment d avrigny s glance met noirtier s eye   133.14410492821082
oh said porthos death is nothing it isn t death that can disquiet us since we don t know what it is   121.47207454273645
at ten o clock in the morning the sieur de la coste ensign in the king s guards followed by two officers and several archers of that body came to the city registrar named clement and demanded of him all the keys of the rooms and offices of the hôtel   117.11222897539912
the lackeys were brought by the cries she made   96.78528263104253
planchet was in truth no vulgar companion in these new adventures   124.90029766404186
i do not yet know myself neither is it necessary that you should do so   167.60641728501835
he is in a very picturesque place do you know the catacombs of st   109.26988632819976
the four or five remaining hours before nine o clock arrived andrea employed in riding paying visits designed to induce those of whom he had spoken to appear at the banker s in their gayest equipages dazzling them by promises of shares in schemes which have since turned every brain and in which danglars was just taking the initiative   42.928071953306784
bonacieux uttered a little cry and fled   4.910737810821516
no one enters here without an order from m   119.61239057092969
mordaunt darted to the steps understood all uttered a cry as if his very heart was pierced and fell fainting on the stone steps   110.9395134892773
d artagnan perceived that it would be disobliging athos not to leave him alone   240.49526741035763
you know dear d artagnan i am nothing more than a good honest country gentleman   67.36642244948607
at that moment i encountered the eye of the prince   62.88218691524536
there it is my lord said the young man   170.71044557154582
villefort opened a large register then went to a table from the table turned to his registers and then turning to morrel are you quite sure you are not mistaken monsieur   104.56866476042813
the queen had restored broussel and blancmesnil to the people and had therefore nothing to fear since the people had nothing more just then to ask for   97.06862353875863
the viscount of morcerf can only wed a marchioness   78.00329349699768
you have decidedly some genius at your control   199.0504181738305
monte cristo observed it particularly and by a look asked the banker for an explanation   123.3903385375458
what are you looking at   148.71325434764128
and he had also acquired being naturally of a goodly stature that vigor which a frame possesses which has so long concentrated all its force within itself   0.33594242839774324
he opened at once his little eyes and his great mouth to inhale better the joke his eminence deigned to address to him and ended by a burst of laughter so violent that his great limbs shook in hilarity as they would have done in an ague   132.63387770524406
d épinay saw him enter afterwards go out and then re enter with albert and château renaud   201.0131185968199
devil of a man corsican that you are always mysteries or superstitions   115.82625029763882
pardon my dear monsieur bonacieux if i don t stand upon ceremony said d artagnan but nothing makes one so thirsty as want of sleep   99.61414242189787
your debaucheries and crimes would vouch for it   177.95316267251863
gentlemen he said when he was in his room you do not expect i presume to keep me here a long time incognito   90.97079976717541
the musketeer returned home hungry and in bad humor   89.06878796788563
what then are you   91.07317663942028
to malta   208.60052243831655

yes   75.75979767499058
said he to athos   119.3738246478867
asked monte cristo who could not help looking at morrel with so much intensity that two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that clear and piercing glance   200.9717353767482
at nine o clock the night had fully come   51.26606652498762
d artagnan and the curate appeared pleased   83.29251196619285
it was for him that you obtained pardon   63.48219342661165
broussel then proceeded to his wife s room and asked for breakfast   89.40092537305608
it is not mercy then that you are about to accord sire it is justice   71.62482407065627
in fact as this last reflection indicated this instinctive return to hope sentiments of weakness or fear did not dwell long in her ardent spirit   93.42074319323686
when you spoke to me at the cemetery i answered you my heart was softened   198.01379438808982
m   284.1516733107601
what do you want   30.676214770614877
i was compelled at this period to leave corsica on an important expedition   89.54674377381062
monte cristo saw him advance towards him without making a single step   127.28045538911341
but without valentine the earth is desolate   237.60769538624714
oh my god   112.18900245405285
well she must be at her country seat for she has not answered me   110.31788541247222
but asked danglars in a timid tone how did you manage about the other formalities the contract the settlement   44.16937202169633
in the meantime the ferryboat had floated away carried down by the stream and the shrieks of those whom it contained resounded more and more   34.7510593860852
and as to my other instructions   113.69014345508619
beauchamp one of the kings of the press and therefore claiming the right of a throne everywhere was eying everybody through his monocle   47.15977417984182
aramis conducted them to the foot of the stairs and then immediately came up again to d artagnan whose senses were still in a state of confusion   71.03354956350086
try at least to give me an idea of what it is   52.254022396634184
chapter xc   80.77039449975334
it was evident that there the rope ladder was to be attached   146.8752415266291
franz sprang back but the count seized his arm and held him before the window   112.18061263313687
de tréville as he has ended by styling himself in paris had really commenced life as d artagnan now did   80.23879932327975
tell him all this for me for these are things which a king can not say for himself   85.79125255291902
de tréville was informed by d artagnan and porthos of the circumstance   72.1584691345635
the young men had no objection to this proposition   108.45221597540193
de monte cristo once gave me a lecture on that subject which i have never forgotten   109.41898334837282
why our lord ruthven the vampire of the salle argentina   160.93688489915147
or on sardinia   54.02779467911719
on the contrary speak to me always in the same strain about him   112.5704222340159
thanks my god said he at least thou strikest but me alone   134.2450080035369
so long as you are not mine valentine i shall always think i may lose you   64.65665221583151
but although the jeweler had been mentioned first it was the secretary who first made his appearance   120.08798653146937
inquired caderousse   112.7633737875375
he is here   133.08056044262207
why i have related the events to you   148.4164625561509
the next morning king charles i   62.770653204615385
you said before that you were obliged to leave us monsieur said madame de villefort and you were about to tell us why when your attention was called to some other subject   142.74006917668976
i held back his arm   205.30844319584293
of course we hope that you will support the project gutenberg™ mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing project gutenberg™ works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the project gutenberg™ name associated with the work   149.18183947880743
count   198.84563090095511
it was as we have said the 1st of march and the prisoner was soon buried in darkness   141.06151207888377
bonacieux was in the greatest perplexity possible   193.85616847192057
monte cristo smiled   102.52110614088919
s   205.41240381695695
yes at present continued lord de winter you will remain in this castle   187.86359286635724
no you merely wished to be convinced nothing more   73.48098373619501
excessively   11.840033580041279
then he advanced to the door and asked whether there were any rooms to be let   85.67578338413608
he was of pale complexion with clear blue eyes rather deeply set   57.11589466885128
but now her position in life is assured continued caderousse   141.8523308828132
for very important notes for which closer attention is required i pricked one of my fingers and wrote with my own blood   140.2607594538268
listen sir   126.9065234548471
i almost possess it   47.790130908933946
but you is there nothing that you want   145.6603030156689
if you see him coming on one side of the street pass by on the other   151.99412854986878
mazarin gave however no order of the kind but on the contrary began to be insinuating   68.76491159481901
the duke thanked monsieur de chavigny for having as he said cleaned his drawing paper for him   80.91737840680958
yes yes continued lord de winter i understand   89.26176700076702
i never had a better friend than you   201.05110051389485
oh how charitable kind and good you are   98.2340209056641
allow me then to pass on since it is not with me you have anything to do   76.23307783223919
i did not even draw my sword but i took him who offended me round the body and threw him out of the window   215.37057475727673
asked i of my mother   175.532701327909
shall i draw back my forehead from his embrace or withhold my hand from his   143.00121225872235
and i my dear aramis quietly replied athos i think it would only change monsieur de retz s appearance   140.1999658341235

but he refused to promise that he would not make any more drawings and remained without any fire in the room all the winter   219.54058132712913

yes i am really he   109.34158964009619
d artagnan as we have said had become more tranquil as always happens after a past danger particularly when the danger seems to have vanished   149.2589439043173
replied the sergeant their vehicle has broken down a second time   117.75208130385197
i come to entreat you sir continued madame de villefort as the only one who has the right of doing so inasmuch as i am the only one who will receive no personal benefit from the transaction i come to entreat you to restore not your love for that she has always possessed but to restore your fortune to your granddaughter   168.7109577251329
i do not understand italian   22.919198357393938
d artagnan had run sword in hand through all the neighboring streets but had found nobody resembling the man he sought for   221.3857770132766
i believe not   186.80313893743573
and as for the money three hundred piastres distributed among the band was so small a sum that he cared little about it   92.89460536986965
the duke came straight up to him and said monsieur de tréville his majesty has just sent for me in order to inquire respecting the circumstances which took place yesterday at my hôtel   64.47143057305809
they were phryne cleopatra messalina those three celebrated courtesans   100.30626892367268
not when it comes from a friend   143.6850940903737
listen said morrel   60.986474882201385
well i should think so since the count has found him a false father since the count gives him four thousand francs a month and leaves him 500 000 francs in his will   125.61501564176741
never   74.27178365951826
and seeing that in spite of this application the prisoner did not recover they sent for the doctor   193.1428303725059
the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work   34.33237372306171
franz and the count advanced and the bandit saluted them   37.83586372741432
no said she i do not remember it just at this moment   201.2645587630603
yes answered franz   33.09052992506629
and the result of the sitting was that the procurator s wife should give eight hundred livres in money and should furnish the horse and the mule which should have the honor of carrying porthos and mousqueton to glory   147.0424528075732
porthos would have given ten years of his life to possess this sword   109.1748760885599

not old cavalcanti   49.5098858944981
now let us lay down the plan of campaign said porthos   161.02497755778967
in four days time the shore will be beneath your feet the sea will be open to you more open than will perhaps be agreeable to you for in four days england will be relieved of you   91.0956502369851
the commission might well be called delicate   124.47751973546963
no you will not forget it because you are a man of honor morrel because you have taken an oath and are about to do so again   81.79198622715842

he waited then in the ante chamber with impatience till he should be conducted to them   24.022559384013306
he arose in his turn reached his hand to his belt drew forth a pistol and cocked it   114.73012940644651
what cried morcerf   100.9371101180788
but go on what about the club in the rue saint jacques   168.21706257280562
monsieur is going to marry me replied the hostess between two gasps   161.08133743335162
i am not at home to any one said the duchess de chevreuse to the footman   11.092552950522304
never forget me   132.6047596188411
you can not understand the position we are in   107.43194206002077
the look which m   145.00949746258559

i should like to have seen the count take something in my house if only an ice   14.56435641399716
early on the following morning he commenced the removal of his riches and ere nightfall the whole of his immense wealth was safely deposited in the compartments of the secret locker   105.02356052391553

i am tired of hearing only of market reports of the end of the month of the rise and fall of spanish funds of haitian bonds   67.28418159669943
jump directly down close to monsieur de la fere or on the honor of a gentleman i ll kill you   44.20253243124321
now will you taste our wine and without prejudice say what you think of it   151.32439772313788
but does he know this secret then   28.21091721043892
silence porthos   75.82414159631679
on our account   93.215071271259
go   69.0956484057003
did i not see you the other day smile on the duke of orleans   72.62138570490728
replied villefort looking at his father with astonishment you really do seem very well informed   182.03043566219696
de blacas returned as speedily as he had departed but in the antechamber he was forced to appeal to the king s authority   115.8722504943459
about that time   98.64451117993715
the order of battle on the morrow was to be that of the positions taken in the evening   40.33511775827229
the truth my dear count   169.92144534218266
that s true   28.797494253741363
we shall search for some madame and i think we can find a little and if your majesty approves we will seek for some together   119.4089663363074
tréville s company   64.74974842681888
but i where shall i go meanwhile   98.43720070235673
monsieur said madame de chevreuse i believe you are a sorcerer   44.99359291406466
but that i was to dine to day with two gentlemen who would be able to give me some   88.88655108846788
i said anything i pleased in order that the solemn declaration i have just made should not be withheld which otherwise would certainly have been the case   148.99279960216347
the flash threw a gleam of light over the field of battle   66.24802929637046
danglars turned very red   76.14822283065038
well then see here is a gentleman who had none of these resources at his disposal a gentleman only a simple magistrate who learned more than you with all your police and who would have saved my crown if like you he had the power of directing a telegraph   108.70499844406233
have i anything to pay   125.47724639899596
the house might be stripped without his hearing the least noise   5.673061244299646
i will answer for everything   201.17267397538933
the young man s trembling voice was scarcely audible   145.75147219365434
at least i hope so said the novice with an expression of joy which she made no effort to disguise   112.02943688936142
a love as tender as that of a lover for his mistress dwells undoubtedly in some paternal hearts toward a son   91.72749895290919
fortunately i have them though said monte cristo   62.20941341622441
i will be a sailor   158.90152792077836
milady raised her head saw close to the panes the pale face of athos and screamed   21.61056141152551
morrel said dantès observing the owner s impatience here is your supercargo m   26.183642294170767
yes   173.78571338744058
really said athos to them you are not men but children to let a woman terrify you so   54.65318374534377
but what redoubles my sorrow continued the young girl as if this feeling was to receive its immediate punishment is that the poor old lady on her death bed requested that the marriage might take place as soon as possible   137.31767731114826
content with making me pay for my hat he may desire to become my heir and re   217.38015620762744
i can be no longer mistrustful but you must pardon me my dear count for confessing to some degree of astonishment   76.6207781921563
had not government better profit by it   162.05613247936196
30175m yes looked the invalid his eye beaming with delight at the ready interpretation of his meaning   121.65508142533447
let us see said he i have swum above an hour but as the wind is against me that has retarded my speed   128.90512491293842
alas   134.68371131904743

they reached the queen s apartments but were compelled to stop in the ante chamber since her majesty was at that moment giving audience to gentlemen bringing her news from england   143.2335129525069
steps were heard in the passage   84.64123420788096
she turned toward the wall to smile for there was in this smile such an expression of triumph that this smile alone would have betrayed her   110.43774049135448
besides had natural humidity been wanting it could have been immediately supplied by artificial means thanks to a tank of water sunk in one of the corners of the garden and upon which were stationed a frog and a toad who from antipathy no doubt always remained on the two opposite sides of the basin   51.53929294689608
the duke smiled   87.02860806381908
he is to bring us five fresh horses one for his eminence four for us   96.04028723806537
my sister is five and twenty my brother in law is thirty they are gay young and happy   125.77613383254736
he has been hanged and quartered i hope   109.94931971075009
it was a hack conveyance which was elevated to the rank of a private carriage in honor of the occasion but in spite of its humble exterior the young men would have thought themselves happy to have secured it for the last three days of the carnival   20.743416281053385
at your age we have faith in life   102.77191516427864
d artagnan was again in the presence of the circe who had before surrounded him with her enchantments   65.8287872297129
you are thoughtful sir continued morrel   149.58960171387116
that would be invaluable to us in africa who have not always any food to eat and rarely anything to drink   146.80653506549945
at midnight great cries and loud acclamations were heard   47.231558792154345

what a godsend this would be for his majesty who is seeking everywhere for brave fellows to recruit for his musketeers   134.83629852157986
i said the cardinal and the cardinal is not even a frenchman   96.12435001520792
he stooped and with the most gracious air he could assume drew the handkerchief from under the foot of the musketeer in spite of the efforts the latter made to detain it and holding it out to him said i believe monsieur that this is a handkerchief you would be sorry to lose   159.73182535416788
then turning toward m   123.67609233262682
oh heavens   82.52388871541068
he lodges at the hôtel des princes   89.63220540581372
de villefort flattered himself that to all outward view he had completely masked the feelings which were passing in his mind he did not know that the cloud was still lowering on his brow so much so that the count whose smile was radiant immediately noticed his sombre and thoughtful air   122.60201111866897
come come calm yourself   75.15378658635231
gentlemen in the name of heaven   98.93142939451283
then the steps retreated and the voices died away in the distance   6.33077896049808
you sent me a strange madman this morning   71.03933561553987
you are astonished i see   171.02705365387206
my father s income is about 50 000 francs per annum   98.90811881117202
a dumb and frozen carcass in fact living painlessly on that time may be given for his frame to decompose without his consciousness of its decay   42.50007736751036
nonsense retorted the baroness   200.35657601236392
suppose any one came into the room   87.0589846890523
and that is what i told the gentleman as we walked along   62.463602885086715
meanwhile the heat became excessive   99.8206263395461
i reasoned thus money time and fatigue are nothing compared with the reputation and interests of a whole family   75.99457163854743
you can not think of humiliating me by prancing along by my side on that magnificent charger   147.38314265692713
never   177.05668712912424
however amidst all the prisoner s efforts to elude a systematic examination raoul had recognized his natural accent   85.99720765803202
tobias took the angel who restored him to light for an ordinary young man   108.52961507049415
it is very easy he went on with a smile   125.13449247022983
morrel that s the whole truth on the honor of a sailor   146.4583459111043
but not for me who discover a gentleman by instinct and who scent out an aristocratic family like a very bloodhound of heraldry   93.81053219158089
the first object that met the eyes of d artagnan on entering the room was brisemont stretched upon the ground and rolling in horrible convulsions   106.34035597550351
the two friends were in the via dei pontefici   137.37146434272273
and you couldn t remember   75.0177733179101
he is a bold fellow said the cardinal   130.73037349172387
that happened which m   62.84065770400307
how perfectly he remembered his former entrance into that very room   31.698332432616084
a cap was sufficient to drive out the bullet and from the adjoining room no one would have suspected that the count was as sportsmen would say keeping his hand in   81.9317669102648
org contact section 4   97.13562241552249
be kind enough then to reply to me in the same language   112.41503605314112
in the chamber of d artagnan and porthos the two soldiers had been found bound and gagged   180.02964249125566
it is so long since we were separated that i have not the least remembrance of him and besides you know that in the eyes of the world a large fortune covers all defects   156.25573625747725
and from my knowledge of you i believe you will so take it away from us   131.42336774505083
is not death in my house   83.97793809397339
but you see that in spite of them he has not killed me and did not even fight   139.12546121895906
well those splendidly wild days may chance to come again   163.1677955058003
said he eagerly   104.45894453686384
s blood   22.09104218783372
i recollect you were saying said d artagnan that after having demanded my head of the cardinal milady had quit the shores of france   96.91953886751872
he asked me   144.34248478957218
why   13.252215352971987
so far then said danglars mentally all has gone as i would have it   114.55272801409608
i come from the cardinal said the officer   246.31057909711697
i find england a charming country and i stay but on one condition only   115.72230876295347
no sir said danglars   134.995074768607
de villefort relieved all dantès apprehensions   19.25876762615134
it is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy said beauchamp   80.84365351502001
i intrust to you certain papers which are at blois   68.81651847311255
then i shall really have them   112.5446357806209
very good observed danglars after having read the paragraph   113.56630028471973
the marshal raised his hand in token of assent   143.53974076383474
he wore trousers of blue cloth boots tolerably clean but not of the brightest polish and a little too thick in the soles buckskin gloves a hat somewhat resembling in shape those usually worn by the gendarmes and a black cravat striped with white which if the proprietor had not worn it of his own free will might have passed for a halter so much did it resemble one   152.3861531715439
de villefort that your projected marriage with mademoiselle de villefort has changed the feeling of m   130.9129755576827
what   224.52065439256347
on the first floor a low door studded with enormous nails like the principal gate of the grand châtelet   144.55034912647727
asked the abbé   91.09491666417574
de villefort promised you said the gendarme but i know we are taking you to the château d if   21.80249824023136
said the count simulating total ignorance   210.30315100319274
what   193.0668967283918
noble natures never lose courage nor good stomachs their appetites   128.86166776782545

into the blue drawing room according to your excellency s orders   135.08959893487935
athos she is your wife i tell you repeated d artagnan   50.52711928492565
madame replied planchet respectfully i am called dulaurier at your service   14.451963554394737
ah there you are my good d arminges   82.86007970034856
very well said he   97.08610191649983
i heard the chevalier d herblay say so   183.6626161316949
whether she kill herself or not what matter provided dantès is not captain   98.98420298234689
what would your excellency like   128.06522511075607
you have a charming young person with you tonight count said eugénie   166.8933235279726
it means that monsieur de richelieu was able to find trusty servants dozens and dozens of them   113.80303309785438
but i too have had the idea you have and two or three times the same fancy has come over me   76.14846823009135
they went into the town and asked for two glasses of liqueur at the counter as their friends must have done before them   70.24748207289903
he addressed about twelve words to him   48.50556027045555
after the cachucha he placed a magnificent ring on the stem of a bouquet and threw it to the charming danseuse who in the third act to do honor to the gift reappeared with it on her finger   149.48417316809127
you ll bet for me and those gentlemen for monsieur groslow   225.41536023115236
she exclaimed   191.30152036065937
in her room with the notary   102.01990684676382
and you paid him out of the two hundred francs i left you   106.15869626578797
the king looked at the cardinal   116.7684202668729
his servants are all devoted to him   189.23392209357223
she is my betrothed   99.53401793541337
after reading the first lines of the letter mazarin gave a side glance at him to see if he was watching the expression of his face as he read   143.7741736368465
comte de la fere you wish to perish by his hands   151.66593411673335
40272m and do you know said valentine what reason grandpapa gives for leaving this house   152.30038467546
for a time the delightful remembrance of madame bonancieux left on his character a certain poetic tinge perishable indeed   80.32489006310769
the novice sat down   144.8842346891871
but it appears unfortunately that the fine girl is in love with the mate of the pharaon   182.6311022947893
why all these precautions   29.84634178187663
and this remark proves that you have deeply considered the subject   269.0595229519675
upon gaining this advantage d artagnan was near uttering a cry of surprise   93.19586283608
no   87.62759424359619
chapter 36   219.44096567200705
your orders do not forbid your telling me what i must know in ten minutes in half an hour or an hour   247.97249046339584
is it not true antoine   140.42128353562646

poor danglars looked so crest fallen and discomfited that monte cristo assumed a pitying air towards him   84.83462405371584
anne s head was bent down she had not seen the italian s smile   141.05072013397523

the banker saw the carriage of the count enter the courtyard and advanced to meet him with a sad though affable smile   153.28633860423832
and my advice is that we reach london before daybreak even if we kill our horses   117.74491414148618

the count withdrew without opposition but it was only to place himself in a situation where he could watch every movement of morrel who at length arose brushed the dust from his knees and turned towards paris without once looking back   125.81302437189052

then he went to see his mother who since the events of the day before had refused to see anyone and had kept her room   46.2607192364506
and he arranged mentally while dantès awaited further questions the antithesis by which orators often create a reputation for eloquence   133.0505216291028

it is true that the enemies of the cardinal said that it was he himself who set these bungling assassins to work in order to have if wanted the right of using reprisals   62.0465836716794

god preserve me from another such hour as i have just passed   72.4150004855509

the usher who had introduced me was waiting for me at the door and he conducted me through the corridors to a private entrance opening into the rue de vaugirard   29.739794086268404

an incendiary the burden of whose song was his intention to assassinate me   152.22871396762633
asked d artagnan   126.50896738717215

i made a vow at a time when i little thought i should ever be able to accomplish it said the unknown with a singular smile   107.53388943727585
when he came here monsieur d artagnan provoked and braved the soldiers and inferior officers in order i suppose to have his sword back   135.23135666058656

and she resolved to make that very evening some attempts to ascertain the nature of the ground she had to work upon by studying the characters of the men to whose guardianship she was committed   26.291892011619552
exclaimed the cavalier   200.6975834919234
the duke approached the altar knelt as a priest might have done before a crucifix and opened the casket   183.70125708568116
as for monte cristo after this ebullition he closed his eyes as if dazzled by internal light   16.94214856892451
the domestic peace of this family is henceforth in my hands   110.83077375314883

grimaud speaks   135.9564867021802
indeed   150.59005082188102
andrea indeed inhaled the scent of something cooking which was not unwelcome to him hungry as he was   82.05149265143845
as the religious ceremonies had all been performed at the door and there was no address given the party all separated   84.12983440125149
then you are not consoled   103.02053131646369
what has become of him   162.19868629447632
inquired danglars turning pale   177.37445381944582
oh i am listening with the greatest impatience replied the young man   80.370315258814
and whoever appeared there was taken and interrogated by the cardinal s people   135.98603277840465
why for heaven s sake are your eyes like cats that you can see to work in the dark   122.11414524198722
excellency the frenchman s carriage passed several times the one in which was teresa   176.21624019883532
any other woman were it the queen herself i would send to the executioner   42.981347266010346
no you will lose it for you are going to alter your correspondent s message   124.7493221486917
i pretended to pour out water from the jug but i only drank that which i had saved in my glass   113.63120528326775
and she passed over to monte cristo a bottle full of the same kind of red liquid whose good properties the count had tested on edward   136.69647621870226
i am ready to marry m   83.87889146442612
now since as every one knows asparagus takes four years in coming to perfection this civility infuriated monsieur de beaufort   46.1328140889773
well said danglars did you see him   140.1869045268234
is it not tempting what i offer you and is it not an easy thing since it is only to do thus   178.73449236165519
two hours later thirty officiating ministers from the most populous and consequently the most disturbed parishes of paris had assembled there   41.70676498023694
but both of them had spoken so low that everybody out of respect withdrew several steps so that nobody had heard anything   134.19551032535392
yes replied mme   140.69946656920044
it is clear you do not understand the nature of the courage with which i am endowed and what use i intend making of my strength   66.1236403495253
was it not this d artagnan who wounded jussac one day in that unfortunate encounter which took place near the convent of the carmes déchaussés   132.30837525029432
all this will be cleared up at a later period murmured the young woman   178.89464510402942
ah   106.45403571568885
i see her now as on her knees at my feet with her head thrown back she begged for life   116.80750996497014
we are coming to the point whispered the governor   111.5506350742836
the queen and her minister more especially the latter had reason to feel anxious   112.15553924731628
first one gun l goes under then the other   137.46243649939453
that does honor to your imagination   107.24333512252241
porthos ran to him   125.328410575119
but did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old man   121.47270847767062
he gave me one great proof of his sympathy at any rate   160.62412167240075
cried he   124.33409809683741
you must be well aware that this requires reflection   110.47012879708605
faintly   168.66821428197926
from every street and every corner drove carriages filled with clowns harlequins dominoes mummers pantomimists transteverins knights and peasants screaming fighting gesticulating throwing eggs filled with flour confetti nosegays attacking with their sarcasms and their missiles friends and foes companions and strangers indiscriminately and no one took offence or did anything but laugh   161.94503534947617
franz astonished advanced a step   79.50515331267064
thanks my worthy friend   130.0361803859367

franz d épinay said the count   118.75837901786603
the notary   145.6795002045108
demanded the host   57.856868307697475
three months passed away   111.24142672374978

it was evident from her figure and the perfumes she had about her that she was young and fastidious in her tastes but that was all   136.80593060049907
could i not   133.9508032706366
attracted by the sound of voices she had feebly dragged herself down the stairs and seated on the lower step head on knees she had listened to the foregoing conversation   64.82093274423715
what did he tell you   42.59333006724263
the blood had mounted to the head of d artagnan and at that moment he would have drawn his sword against all the musketeers in the kingdom as willingly as he now did against athos porthos and aramis   132.9713711939067
said porthos holding out his plate to aramis who was cutting up a fowl   154.98137262003598
the left of the carriage was as well cleared as the right and they drew up the blind of the window which mazarin less heroic than the king had taken the precaution to lower   85.00141565412687
by the side of the luxembourg   76.71778877794966
said madame de chevreuse eagerly   85.35827870459954
when does m   98.232741348543

the king parted his hair with his hands and looking at the block he said this block is very low is there no other to be had   72.6665118141559
he bowed and went out   127.22390653387883
or rather tell him nothing   92.2501759248182
still i was but an agent led on by an invisible and offended deity who chose not to withhold the fatal blow that i was destined to hurl   135.10798220249112
she murmured   129.52402091699915
a prisoner repeated porthos quite dejected   252.04443024552117
well said the president seeing that charles was determined to remain silent so be it   113.31712792214387
all the same it is well to be certain   133.5854997930108
as for the two others i had so much the habit of calling them by nicknames that i have forgotten their real ones   105.54589345228582

the coffer so much coveted contained eight hundred thousand livres   122.42961153863355
well answered   60.15467707506867
ten men would have found difficulty in moving that tub but by some mechanical contrivance it had turned with the flagstone on which it rested   120.9333883132099
but to wait surrounded by assassins and poisoners   175.91276448996885
a simple plume of violet feathers adorned his hat   107.65125632471211
thanks my captain   128.9494636340144
the duchess de longueville has invited me to pass a few days in normandy and has deputed me while her son is being baptized to go and prepare her residence at rouen   137.77041904453424
well then with the first money i touch i mean you to have a small house with a garden in which to plant clematis nasturtiums and honeysuckle   103.66223283862749
he put his head out and asked the postilion how long it would be before they reached the next town   43.77594884794064
time presses   168.0871057947458
d artagnan came forward and stammered out a few words of gratitude which soon expired under the gloomy looks of the cardinal   104.1024670489668
come speak   97.68329847798915
yes the idea was yours   203.91312804732274
the lieutenant of musketeers   204.96331467942235
yes and for a most curious one   76.02496066207529
i will go and try if there are any means of speaking to him   58.006322165288935
the sea smooth as crystal was now and then disturbed by the leaping of fish which were pursued by some unseen enemy and sought for safety in another element   117.55142501977119
what is lost for today may not be lost forever   135.18443698753842
you will perhaps smile at me when i tell you that ever since i have known this man i have involuntarily entertained the idea that all the good fortune which has befallen me originated from him   63.082700276232096
are you sure that no one is aware of the queen s project   154.61289608084303
at what time   133.06666153725266
bravo   76.6372134114451
he leaves me in paris as our separation will conduce to his benefit   81.02608873249176
this second attack was much more violent than the first and he had slipped from the couch to the ground where he was writhing in agony   154.36011288398154
you have the means then of touching him   145.6556088527092
but after all he was somewhat to blame in all that business and we may console ourselves with the reflection that france has no cause of reproach in the matter and did all she could to serve him   30.45281808998189
the comte de rochefort   119.23211467828993
with the same frankness i accept them   53.35236170505431
i can work then   77.12661733693922
ah my dear father   158.48004447580558

at the first word before i had even mentioned your father s name ah said he   78.26740853210028
the swiss were drawn up along the road but as the road was long they were placed at six or eight feet distant from each other and one deep only   220.1381846983232
but you should have inquired for the woman   23.564322805867448
but m   112.4150103719101
porthos had been trying a new horse   54.832797333374444
cried de gondy   119.90426887746597
d artagnan breathed again   134.29565207847534
i think she wants to ride on horseback   61.881784521270184
a mendicant   60.839098323814994
my dear doctor there is no communication between m   106.90400290675454
pursued as he was d artagnan would not have tarried here five minutes had he been pressed very closely which gives us hopes that he may have succeeded in escaping   156.06206347581374
i suppose you have some cause of quarrel   45.606138898679035
but now that this ornament may be useful to him or his defenders everything must be sacrificed   159.9426441725862
but instead of adding if your succor does not arrive within fifteen days we will surrender it added quite simply if your succor comes not within fifteen days we shall all be dead with hunger when it comes   170.45642862621003
never   37.053135146701436
ali smiling repeated the sound grasped the reins with a firm hand and spurred his horses whose beautiful manes floated in the breeze   146.19448232433288
this one was dead   149.09894132575133
long live de beaufort   150.48199342682338
all were fully engrossed with the affairs of the day   67.29787780947811
one would say he had never had to do with any but women and children   97.73694326285616
oblige me by taking a seat said d artagnan pushing a chair toward mordaunt who sat down pale but calm   53.829793713618365
i thought you were at smyrna   175.10483429357075
repeated porthos   69.24549386805938
the count   92.41905536828511
go in whatever guise you choose   79.67745236336081
quite alone   235.80395167527854
for if it had remained another year or two uninhabited it would have fallen to ruin   175.32284942885894
and thirdly from my own imagination   64.09158729995463
did you observe anyone during the first act   177.07937439627872
one day you acknowledged that you loved me and since that day my hope of future happiness has rested on obtaining you for to gain you would be life to me   68.12653866437057
asked mazarin   160.04323473662444
the young man answered this invitation with a gesture of indifference and stepped out of the boat   203.500303022183
well never mind how it is answered albert it comes to the same thing in the end   67.4407663306645
her fine blue eyes seemed to start out of her head and her carmine lips compared by all the poets of the day to a pomegranate in flower were trembling with anger   44.5907440626456
de boville who was standing in the waiting room and who was introduced into danglars room as soon as the count had left   145.17094743573097
i know an italian prince rich as a gold mine one of the noblest families in tuscany who when his sons married according to his wish gave them millions   191.7340727644837
madame answered the count you are under the roof of one who esteems himself most fortunate in having been able to save you from a further continuance of your sufferings   98.10797968729246
i could the more easily distrust you   194.2310066038886
i admit the word monseigneur because it rhymes with ministre minister   153.48251212857375
come and may heaven hear you   86.97744817425337
never mind where he is let you and i go and see what is to be done for our poor friends   260.9385771873051
she was sent to me by someone of high rank under the name of kitty   171.99215256305567
and was this conference arranged beforehand   86.18412137663304
they were not even rich   55.57144150174914
bah   125.59622915493233
because replied d artagnan the queen desired every one to leave and i thought that this command was intended for us as well as for the rest   154.73595223014024
in the centre of the room was a roller and blanchet baby grand piano in rosewood but holding the potentialities of an orchestra in its narrow and sonorous cavity and groaning beneath the weight of the chefs d œuvre of beethoven weber mozart haydn grétry and porpora   145.50624106623374
said he   98.02323359290213
and to you a good journey   5.437766534949958
what is this   165.03746306943924
replied d artagnan   25.63564396071365
ah monsieur said planchet i saw one fall at each of his two shots and he appeared to me through the glass door to be fighting with his sword with the others   35.13578010028482
he cried   174.1197570318856
after which the cardinal who had been informed that d artagnan was arrested and who was anxious to see him took leave of the king inviting him to come the next day to view the work already done upon the dyke   127.81680769869483
comminges saw that he was undecided   85.04529464660614
but in his present condition he will promise anything and take his chance of keeping it afterwards   163.62528231681594
now it is revealed this secret so full of horror as the tragic poet says   110.21743160066254
the old man wrapped in a large black doublet in which the whole of his slender body was concealed was brisk and dry   81.51269464930611
the notary looked at villefort   171.8456289044547
d artagnan already fancied himself so rapid is the flight of our dreams upon the wings of imagination accosted by a messenger from the young woman who brought him some billet appointing a meeting a gold chain or a diamond   96.87703660934986
you will speak first and tell him that i am gone on the lookout because certain expressions of our host have given me reason to think the road is not safe   57.42096068462068
i swear to you sir should any harm befall me your name will be the last name that i shall utter the remembrance of you my last thought   182.83092376859128
it was then especially while conversing with madame danglars and apparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation that the count noticed m   20.856797273049906
what blows what blood   166.56293022403744
cried the same voice impatiently whilst d artagnan perceived that they had rushed to the horses heads   88.15127266380213
parliament indeed   175.20755704183995
you received me very coldly   92.78971439759562
yes   104.23171104040235
he did not however lose sight of milady and in a mirror he perceived the change that came over her face   61.02770822210382
in fact three or four of these unfortunate men covered with dirt and blood fled along the hollow way and at length regained the city   175.81070942914323
yes   126.1872317810483
as for me i can only repeat may god protect you and all dear to you   170.68315248996657
then continued the host i replied that as from the moment we seemed not likely to come to a good understanding with respect to payment i hoped that he would have at least the kindness to grant the favor of his custom to my brother host of the golden eagle   79.24043352051001
read me something m   14.900009690492936
where the sun represents the moon and the moon a cream cheese   54.9508502813476
my word as a gentleman never to say anything of you never to do anything against you   118.08669387424543
yes yes   19.433266876827417
porthos placed his hand on the pistols   150.39975956664765
and so i did replied caderousse   125.77687134627251
it is ten years today since i saved your father s life who wished to die   156.0891048994535
bonacieux you speak that in a tone that frightens me   175.01157796403336
that this record should have all due authority it shall bear the imperial seal which the vendor is bound to have affixed to it   162.2086100393596
the door is locked   24.294055470124533
i possess a share of wit and a certain relative sensibility which enables me to draw from life in general for the support of mine all i meet with that is good like the monkey who cracks the nut to get at its contents   195.84372661123174
in such cases extreme preoccupation is only to be combated by extreme carelessness   156.62761784706072
planchet had no need to learn more   25.581759165963163
for a long time i had these words whispered in my ears and i chose the latter   138.0693282186184
said caderousse   212.13805577110907
what is it   85.84596426975756
he dismounted twenty men to make a breach in the barricade whilst he and others remaining on their horses were to protect the assailants   24.339472461654523
nothing of the kind sir replied danglars if such had been the case i only should have been to blame inasmuch as i was aware of all these things when i made the engagement   216.14107538512465
the doctors open the body and say with an air of profound learning the subject has died of a tumor on the liver or of typhoid fever   67.34430161867105
the cavalier laughed aloud which appeared to exasperate milady still more   92.94655667622345
de villefort received the following note the person called the count of monte cristo is an intimate acquaintance of lord wilmore a rich foreigner who is sometimes seen in paris and who is there at this moment   196.07446086998016
anne of austria looked with wonderment on the warlike countenance of d artagnan which betrayed a singular expression of deep feeling   104.59144629169367
and you shall have it   156.4563274798075
who would have suspected it   145.7315756859612
his eye rested longer on the president and still more so on the king s attorney   99.6898605683997
milady clarik received d artagnan ceremoniously   12.98158905481688
i have performed that same distance in forty hours and by ten o clock in the morning i must be in london   160.51917149979465
what are you doing   152.2831710945936
there what do you think now of the affair   141.89110112167052
she will not dare to say anything   136.67884237372908
and yet he reckoned and with reason on milady   46.3655218205471
that is true sir and that is what i like best said the man smiling   77.25022146660476
and you really believe the result would be still more sure with us than in the east and in the midst of our fogs and rains a man would habituate himself more easily than in a warm latitude to this progressive absorption of poison   5.109502890782153
now lift me on my bed for i can no longer support myself   0.21235413760308575
well he has taken nothing yet   97.24914950776103
there is but one way   134.4695580248698
asked the comte   104.35642302439723
as to haydée these terrible reminiscences seemed to have overpowered her for a moment for she ceased speaking her head leaning on her hand like a beautiful flower bowing beneath the violence of the storm   86.53123895790083
oh don t let that disturb you cried mme   59.108944478661826
la ramee became therefore the duke s dinner guest by compulsion an eternal keeper the shadow of his person   38.26729974332751
but she knew athos   54.43383142859124
oh my dear friend if this be the case if you can no longer weep if your frozen heart be dead if you put all your trust in god then maximilian you are consoled do not complain   19.722550863441498
yes i   171.22336930219046
so springing into the room he motioned the host to leave it   122.21167956092036
monsieur el comte de wardes   158.38934220859613
he hoped to meet with m   69.14620701543735
and although debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the impressive look and manner of the count consequently the description given by lucien to the baroness bore the highly colored tinge of his own heated imagination   198.63733170317713
that is what i call devoted friendship to recommend to another one whom you would not marry yourself   154.01130890422573
chapter lxix   149.3738079119903
as for me i hate the court and have but one desire at this moment vengeance   179.8964274023426
and close on their heels are the horses of madame danglars who always go at six leagues an hour   136.6268274439431
let us save ourselves   38.0718212271221
the papers said something about it did they not   120.19566301148303
but he thought this addition would do no harm   36.52343779201496
you have once before thrown yourself in my path   203.12965678063028
sir the favor i have to ask of you is not to call me mousqueton but mouston   174.4204843189422
the road as d artagnan had observed was the way to blois   118.7219666136294
but i hate hypocrites and among that number i place musketeers who are abbés and abbés who are musketeers   152.42573113070037
i give you my word that you will find the cardinal where you leave him   128.8284124795875
you would not fight a duel   58.11285630746396
with a hundred and fifty francs i should be quite happy   146.19223304046727
le procureur du roi said morrel with increasing vehemence no mercy is allowed   99.24548728924944
he turned a spyglass toward the little group amongst which the king stood   176.03952821046937
thanks madame   104.37329786314362
crushed enfeebled he remained standing and with listening ear   216.37189080772382
all the weight of his fallen fortune seemed suddenly to crush him   107.72981700227022
and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the envy of someone   164.72067973772278
you put on a livery you disguise yourself as a servant and yet keep a diamond on your finger worth four or five thousand francs   223.99585342225083
they all left in spite of prayers and entreaties testifying their regret at leaving so good a master and mistress and especially mademoiselle valentine so good so kind and so gentle   58.7272436457483
by demanding my head of the cardinal   69.52355227650483
perhaps it was some man of rank who had grave reasons for hating the fallen king and who learning that the king was about to flee and escape him threw himself in the way with a mask on his face and an axe in his hand not as substitute for the executioner but as an ambassador of fate   149.0325492164178
and therefore continued athos the cardinal the true cardinal the other one determined one fine morning to arrest poor marie michon and send her to the chateau de loches   59.23330203898446
you will then come on saturday   206.4829246271155
milady opened the letter with eagerness equal to kitty s in bringing it   181.13786451093512
said he here is a strange thing   156.43899988304753
they had not been long in the crowd before loud cries announced the king s arrival   162.49971200814312
this man had been four years longer than himself in prison   206.6872125607921
gutenberg   143.1389380797391
ah ah   2.243758889370895
asked debray   131.8240107422883
his heart beat but not like d artagnan s with a young and impatient love   130.4686019917354
what a pity mademoiselle de villefort is dead   71.01028061100557
is it you aramis   122.53579341114103
bonacieux   93.37520440617229
i will said the count   85.21450823320023
nothing has happened to him i hope said the count frowningly   1.2168104917632832
then your count entertains visitors does he   64.09687417385932
yes grandpapa said valentine   101.95272856811918
but come i am waiting for you   143.26303482136487
these attempts did not prevent the cardinal to whom his most inveterate detractors have never denied personal bravery from making nocturnal excursions sometimes to communicate to the duc d angoulême important orders sometimes to confer with the king and sometimes to have an interview with a messenger whom he did not wish to see at home   35.489399195005916
she has neither son money nor friends   78.9124076255497
we shall see said porthos majestically   182.45163998591204
0329m but the strangest part of the story is resumed the abbé that dantès even in his dying moments swore by his crucified redeemer that he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention   78.71046562912284
it appeared as if the ceiling sank upon my head and crushed me with its weight   243.44576207566547
there is port wine in the cellar of monsieur le baron de bracieux   143.412377537687
but hark   149.53604885860972
and were these four men attached to each other true in heart really united   180.5171824185381
god grant i may not have done too much already   81.60622590032375
a dreadful silence followed the reading of this document   76.77553531444804
everyone from the highest to the lowest degree has his place on the social ladder and is beset by stormy passions and conflicting interests as in descartes theory of pressure and impulsion   103.64580808989516
now go   100.11032423561414
if that be the case said d artagnan they are doubtless transporting her from one prison to another   143.502830702242
then come to dress and shave me   176.94862721375597
on the contrary from a firm conviction   152.68944278985762
and you d artagnan   177.8525278164202
the officiating priest was just finishing mass whilst d artagnan was looking at bazin   211.22964013508403
lead me to him   170.7469918677215
cried mademoiselle d armilly taking the bell from her companion s hand and ringing it yet more violently   175.6986775258252
but my dear friend put yourself in my place replied the musketeer   182.49166080426232
he says to you jauntily gentlemen there is fighting going on in gascony or in flanders   90.44065781284925
let us imagine seven such months continued monte cristo in the same tone   124.79593378055009
i have only kept this secret so long from you continued faria that i might test your character and then surprise you   206.21866454361788
several times with terror no doubt the cold sweat burst from her burning brow   128.58628123387936
everything is arranged and decided   143.70955945917996
these recollections were dwelt upon with some pleasure by danglars and restored him to some degree of tranquillity   117.4381825990092
suppose i happen to strangle him   115.8304741370237
answered the voice   65.8149028254308
and i expected to see him leave rueil in the same way as samson left gaza   72.58031441800821
oh how bitter a fate is mine to serve either as a victim or an enemy to all who are stronger than myself while my only friend and supporter is a living corpse   62.664546729895335
a tall pale clerk his face shaded by a forest of virgin hair opened the door and bowed with the air of a man forced at once to respect in another lofty stature which indicated strength the military dress which indicated rank and a ruddy countenance which indicated familiarity with good living   92.23189515477695
why they want to know if the duke of buckingham is in paris and if he has had or is likely to have an interview with the queen   107.2109372146467
to the fearful noises that had awakened me had succeeded the most perfect silence unbroken save by the footsteps of a man walking about in the chamber above   135.4652294308909
you know i have already told you that if you ever call me anything but chevalier i will break every bone in your body   157.0580950416231
i will see about the continuation of it and tomorrow i hope you will be satisfied with the corrections i shall have made in consequence of your advice   150.65080071406115
but he did not return the paper to d artagnan   16.780503761841146
the most important thing was not to kill him only for i had an opportunity of doing so a hundred times but to kill him without being discovered at least without being arrested   167.55909034032402
but when they were alone he said you have done that which you ought to have done d artagnan   86.0530881574792
the cardinal accompanied his majesty from surgères to mauzes   222.21789062110423
you will supply the want of the evening papers   133.20258711104762
asked aramis   65.8837029637389
said athos   35.46279171217415
as for you morrel this is the secret of my conduct towards you   78.78919716442792
you are eating horse   160.94305166597172
what is it   98.5221233647982
the coadjutor and his companion passed through all the streets lying between the archbishopric and the st   141.7468813646663
said cromwell the cloud passing away from his face   59.29668595021599
no   170.5157516699136
i tell you valentine s life was attempted by poison four days ago though she escaped owing to the precautions of m   158.90912620295953
simon and suspended with great pomp in the arches of notre dame   109.05000322839047
but if you love me as much as you say replied d artagnan do you not entertain a little fear on my account   149.821034918281
in prison   114.13149265075306
bonacieux was standing at the door and looked at d artagnan hatefully   195.6594148660747
there is no great merit due to me for we were informed of it   105.78759607172762
he called successively at the abodes of athos porthos and aramis   92.32167446229724
to the king   129.9000021300376
d épinay arrives in paris 30319m my dear grandmother interrupted valentine consider decorum the recent death   106.77110554911815
and whoever serves in a french corps serves the king   129.1240971309589
said the jeweller   22.516593669614807
the coward who feared death rejoiced at perpetual disgrace   200.74283986504642
never   259.16871951118867
40062m well what is haydée to ali tepelini   103.39263787706922
we ll wait for you   127.14271179420966
i am at your command sir   66.12119437037103
are we softened a little   51.32451682773535
but i have seen them drink it   96.83241163692183
he had stopped a moment in the passage to listen at a door and maximilian and emmanuel who had considerately passed forward a few steps thought they heard him answer by a sigh to a sob from within   65.86468314345306
i see fresh tracks   77.32515765442056
d avrigny at the foot of the stairs it being the hour he usually visited her   75.4434452858402
and caderousse began to sing the two last lines of a song very popular at the time tous les méchants sont buveurs d eau   135.29799872118878
in a quarter of an hour the porter returned with a post boy and horses which were harnessed and put in the post chaise in a minute while the porter fastened the portmanteau on with the assistance of a cord and strap   113.95407122684433
he composed his face as we have before described and said i have read the letter sir and you have acted rightly in arresting this man   173.1944027818074
but bazin still the servant of a musketeer when once the blood mounted to his fat cheeks seized a broomstick and began belaboring blaisois saying you have insulted the church my friend you have insulted the church   88.38628354582167
help cried caderousse   114.12627488561598
can t you guess my dear athos   77.61497970734035
let us say no more about it   70.64630342906062
does this man know your majesty personally   94.77911010624715
let them try to pursue him   48.55619047264818
well   96.7699224727875
murmured danglars   88.31572236048433
because i am he who saved your father s life when he wished to destroy himself as you do today because i am the man who sent the purse to your young sister and the pharaon to old morrel because i am the edmond dantès who nursed you a child on my knees   61.729591600754496
but really we have talked long enough of money count we are like two stockbrokers   39.33480685460431
but i felt myself driven on like an exterminating angel   123.50281200426603
my servants seem to imitate those you sometimes see in a play who because they have only a word or two to say aquit themselves in the most awkward manner possible   275.3809453550799
oh dearest marie   148.7308632326908
then the cardinal will be pleased with me   159.59478640564203
meanwhile the soldiers whose duty it was to remain in the king s room attracted by that love of play so powerful in all men had stolen little by little toward the table and standing on tiptoe lounged watching the game over the shoulders of d artagnan and porthos   160.69332438591852
and as he said it was an ancient name   57.10072939533755
noirtier s eyes demanded the nature of her mission   132.24716892447375
and that i am authorized to seek for the suspected paper even on the person of your majesty   139.89674067060926
was he young or old   129.6184723428781
doubtless madame de villefort had just put out her lamp and the nightlamp alone reflected its dull light on the window   234.2171741869477
but on the following day the family from whom all these particulars had been asked received a handsome present consisting of an entirely new fishing boat with two seines and a tender   130.0307558045767
the terrible moment had come but i had so long been prepared for it that my heart did not fail in the least   129.43949033409632
said d artagnan with a calmness which astonished the cardinal himself   122.91586068700647
but i have already told you what that damned magician predicted   115.01021280827493
that is to say eagerly replied the wounded man who doubtless feared that the name of executioner would take from him the last help that he could claim that is to say i was but am no longer   111.07224204226064
kitty came in but milady was very cross with her   279.3874187522928
calm and cool as if on the parade except that his noble and beautiful countenance became sad as he saw slaughtered so many men who were sacrificed on the one side to the obstinacy of royalty and on the other to the personal rancor of the princes   42.75140844446905
i have work to do   144.76192400651146
i don t know   112.06780882402256
he found edmond lying prone bleeding and almost senseless   119.30224327930527
and thanking the captain he regained the state cabin where his friends were   58.122178732996595
said the queen   120.21723941569924
0193m who talks of god and despair at the same time   80.55929788647009
do as you think best d artagnan   105.88110489247245
asked the king   124.72744869523545
my poor friend   116.96933629040477
raoul delighted at the count s companionship perceived or affected to perceive nothing of this byplay   32.44473169867622
i comprehend now   220.4156032721484
it is useless   222.3694013863706
and now leave me alone   49.78828101307758
athos never had concerns which all his friends did not know   131.45769686734778
ideology if the count of monte cristo had been for a long time familiar with the ways of parisian society he would have appreciated better the significance of the step which m   143.01415072837324
you have turned pale and then red successively three or four times in one minute   164.8278825339238
then this house belonged to m   126.45441383714639
and he comes from marseilles   210.95767065228802
i will manufacture you a similar one when you are a capitalist   136.7357974226316
he was aware that opportunity has a forelock only for him who will take it and he was not a man to let it go by him without seizing it   117.63523341398854
he drew out his watch and exclaimed morbleu   144.3726753429729
e   100.99736396071715
danglars has only been a secondary agent in this sad affair and it is of m   169.69293959204043
the abbess suspects nothing and believes that i am taken by order of the cardinal   134.21206151394864
listen   93.89247511091821
the affair was described to the messenger with all the effervescence of enthusiasm   87.01498893156472
oh fear nothing said the skipper showing his face   107.29770855784342
i am a machine then and nothing else and so long as i work nothing more is required of me   77.06020678648795
de monte cristo did not make his proposal for you   127.92884986766065
well well my dear edmond continued the owner don t let me detain you   98.40819805365287

the abbé told us it was worth 50 000 without the setting   209.12504645516077
and what hast thou to say boy to monsieur broussel   127.55478619991055
said porthos   263.66544160727585

what more do you want   83.0641390023062
said he at length   101.29473686720534

from time to time a broad sheet of lightning opened the horizon in its whole width darted like a serpent over the black mass of trees and like a terrible scimitar divided the heavens and the waters into two parts   110.07769000166459
she said   112.3955263011977
your life is devoted from this moment and does not belong to you   155.95469870406316
he was thinking of these matters when porthos summoned him to dinner   125.6355756609944
come louise said mademoiselle danglars to her friend   152.06611031017877
in the midst of his amorous projects for the mercer s wife he did not forget his friends   183.0855458469845
he had noticed that a few rays not of daylight but from a lamp penetrated through the ill joined planks of the door   99.10772833700423
besides he doesn t know you   84.72392663747895

albert too was ill at ease   109.69961367446669
it is men who make you weep   152.01195948299707
i endured the rain during the day and the cold during the night tolerably well but the third morning my horse died of cold   34.75554017623112
inquired grimaud   128.8415464134916
and here madame i must add another word of explanation   171.20813189953995
the count turned round as he heard the entrance of danglars into the room   78.1261004891839
yes that i have suffered   236.19579238231967
he said wiping with his sleeve large drops of sweat from his forehead how lucky it was that mousqueton was thirsty   128.99594095276183
and it is very natural that she should love the spanish who are the children of the same soil as herself   80.87492206484325
and whatever mazarin may say once on the shores of france your royal husband may find as many retreats and asylums as the seabird finds in a storm   71.68663632602417
the valet held a wax light   137.87936608698843
the former sign was repeated   97.16684969312425
exclaimed grimaud   110.29424982198921
oh i can well believe that for neither of them was worth a penny   126.30924493613925
doubtless doubtless athos   121.33985869332801
the eight men would doubtless have failed had they not been assisted by twenty soldiers of the regiment of italians in the king s service who are in garrison in this town so that your friends were overpowered by numbers   167.93319844845502
sir i am ready   162.31500117193968
well   67.12046438807857
grimaud however did not even smile   83.57168113460112
then when all was over they went away leaving the house empty and exposed   75.15064170044238
albert rose to return to his place   65.38305964781594
that is to say those who were called   117.68051566486538
ali placed himself in the light so that his master might see him distinctly and then imitating in his intelligent manner the countenance of the old man he closed his eyes as noirtier was in the custom of doing when saying yes   79.06711073884011
i could interpret one of your looks   174.6459825729911
you promised me take my arm madame said the stranger and let us continue our way   91.68842148121271
no   89.7360006014006
in addition to the sword thrust in his arm which is not dangerous he has received another right through his lungs of which the doctor says bad things   76.858542820693
the old patron did not interfere for he too had recognized the superiority of dantès over the crew and himself   5.529151342924763
thanks monsieur   99.88836472628992
he consequently sprang up again re entered the office with a turn of his finger set the clock right again that it might not be perceived the next day that it had been put wrong and certain from that time that he had a witness to prove his alibi he ran downstairs and soon found himself in the street   130.5903643836022
a body of cavaliers is coming toward us said chatillon   39.43393081453203
seriously said gondy astonished at not having further advanced   52.8792047472666
just then the lamp again flickered   134.09050049444883
large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow while the garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could only guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been fashioned   27.860227085904214

one of its chiefs who understood provençal begged the commune of marseilles to give them this bare and barren promontory where like the sailors of old they had run their boats ashore   70.85961722795497
his hand placed upon his heart was unable to redress its throbbings while with the other he wiped the perspiration from his temples   129.12852750370084
doubtless you wish to make me appear a very eccentric character   145.8122498938951
de villefort was not at table   127.34367257186538
well   147.51392872494654
but there was none   67.56362407395315
asked the valet de chambre whose eyes dazzled by the light could not clearly distinguish our heroes in the gloom   34.9245172497487
felton felt a shudder run to the marrow of his bones   99.78720572993626
but he had too strong an adversary   157.93910074325478
yes   58.51519462465065
have you never heard what oliver cromwell said when he came to paris and was shown the dungeon at vincennes where monsieur de vendome was imprisoned   59.966639618484244
come do you know of what the count of monte cristo is capable   83.24492012859746
the procurator s wife smiled thinking that it was for her porthos had put himself to this trouble   170.61744271643983
this foraging did not occupy more than half an hour   239.61889291812957
when all at once she perceived that no signature was attached to the order   126.44376608320893
but when it concerns your majesty s service then added he looking at the queen with all the grace of former days i precede the count   209.2742654588654
as regards yourself the need of protection   21.93614039381613

she was overwhelmed   136.25797664477034
said athos while d artagnan went to conduct kitty downstairs   158.4707407481066

bertuccio left enraptured so great so powerful and real was the influence exercised by this man over all who surrounded him   144.3256894418572
kitty entered to bring some sherbet   127.22247420465554
madame danglars in whom the events we have related had caused deep anxiety had hesitated about going to madame de morcerf s when during the morning her carriage happened to meet that of villefort   102.06055110761811
i have one thing to reproach myself with said he stopping albert on the steps   147.7356596004154
in fact a moment later m   80.60992194784379
he did not move at the sound of the door and continued his calculations until the flash of the torches lighted up with an unwonted glare the sombre walls of his cell   85.89141830100488
caderousse had become so gloomy that andrea feared he should be obliged to notice the change   152.26598749265185
i understand said athos smiling midnight   130.43541505125037
no   92.46082592219123
standing on the prow was a tall man of a dark complexion who saw with dilating eyes that they were approaching a dark mass of land in the shape of a cone which rose from the midst of the waves like the hat of a catalan   104.2037188459509
when he had once passed the massive door covered with long square headed nails he fell into the midst of a troop of swordsmen who crossed one another in their passage calling out quarreling and playing tricks one with another   139.58121808080995
i love the sea as a mistress and pine if i do not often see her   107.01359691233186
if we had been in their place   100.32689393009403
what will monsieur de tréville say   125.5171359066609
danglars   139.03254138074715
after having well beaten him he forbade him to leave his service without his permission   102.09069874622902
danglars bowed assentingly   139.58877883624018
oh you love her still said kitty who had not taken her eyes off the young man s countenance for an instant   175.6945789083925
a shot was fired that moment   57.463397667164145
avast there all hands   103.24632092803103
but we must not lose time   187.15326120198674
thought porthos this is poor work   203.9095835874514
d artagnan lowered his   84.1313479721741
morrel had thought of danglars who was now immensely rich and had lain under great obligations to morrel in former days since to him it was owing that danglars entered the service of the spanish banker with whom he had laid the foundations of his vast wealth   88.58736101624405

although apparently not noticing albert he did not however lose sight of him and when the curtain fell at the end of the second act he saw him leave the orchestra with his two friends   133.1555675309061
morrel looked obedience to her commands   177.57759256014842
a lutheran   137.12329257282016
and he retired after having first deposited the token agreed on in the place pointed out to him by selim   88.04275177525558
yes said monte cristo i recognized him   37.310900974704396
but in the meantime saves the country added athos   134.07015157056503
and this evening at eleven o clock you have heard what i said   101.49934589821616
and where are we going   108.34569746154493
the secret is said athos that i saw milady last night   134.8769473173154
why do you say that   245.50389383407696
and he pointed his gun at d artagnan who was riding toward him at full speed   112.31940326498848
faith he said in italian as he was reascending the steps and looking at a bag of reals faith there s enough to pay five councillors of parliament and two generals in paris   72.79237910868937
what did he say in the letter   216.51405894666686
i should not like to be groslow if he meets him   51.398423186539546
but where is your wicker flask monsieur mousqueton   99.51346396603407
ja   85.30215808157479
the mendicant hesitated at first but at the sight of the piece of silver which shone in the darkness he consented and walked on before athos   58.75460756483048
he then saw the great aqueducts those stone phantoms which he had before remarked only then they were on the right hand now they were on the left   65.60780722515045
you monsieur d artagnan   139.84150925174663
my friend said aramis take care   168.99126360778752
ah you are there said she at length turning towards fernand   93.98277233692315
at the moment he opened the door the three musketeers and d artagnan conducted by la chesnaye appeared at the top of the staircase   138.8296646386168
perhaps we may one day be united   202.7324620965466
it shall take but a quarter of an hour i answer for everything madame   55.07321787432547
when they arrived grimaud went carelessly and sat down by a loophole in the wall letting his legs dangle outside   145.83920204340515
you know something of that as well as i do i think   94.92836740145675
villefort traversed the antechamber cast a side glance at dantès and taking a packet which a gendarme offered him disappeared saying bring in the prisoner   32.42065082477022
i could recite you the whole of thucydides xenophon plutarch titus livius tacitus strada jornandes dante montaigne shakespeare spinoza machiavelli and bossuet   108.3381627649786
the garden was crossed by a path of red gravel edged by a border of thick box of many years growth and of a tone and color that would have delighted the heart of delacroix our modern rubens   191.22431293028748
antoinette is very well he said and madeleine tolerably so   110.33351593116872
cried the young man and set off at full gallop   3.1836679025460057
the cry of terror which was stopped on noirtier s lips seemed to start from his eyes   90.4529404867143
imbecile   118.02933430672394
it is that we are each of us twenty years older   22.539511691682392

then having renewed his injunction not to give valentine anything he went down again to noirtier shut the doors carefully and after convincing himself that no one was listening do you said he know anything of this young lady s illness   77.0422467732827
said milady embarrassed i know monsieur de louvigny monsieur de courtivron monsieur de ferussac   57.07191948549605
therefore everything which the count de guiche related was new to his traveling companion   33.61983866612853
monsieur de nargonne was a baron and my name is hermine   44.15411330461474
are you afraid that the holy spirit will come as a tongue of fire to open the doors of my prison   81.03764474803302
woman is sacred   46.801589797388516
and what crime has he committed   151.0098803663978

there is a servant active and vigilant not like that lazy fellow bazin who is no longer good for anything since he became connected with the church   75.88181233042175
whilst the two friends were with the cardinal the queen sent for him   157.12453186762343
the weather was mild but dull and in harmony with the funeral ceremony   226.3251607298189
take him out and shoot him   169.506137127457
yes said dantès   68.07703705338942
i ran to the hospital and learned that the same night the night of the 20th of september a child had been brought there wrapped in part of a fine linen napkin purposely torn in half   167.30065686600244
20063m my dear friends said morrel if this be so it must be a miracle of heaven   33.82428158457353

f   64.62165044865152
cried he   19.468172675033884
but the count was too curious to let bertuccio off from this little journey   179.0314830998725
so that you could without trouble convert these tongs into a hoop and yonder shovel into a corkscrew   73.152397701779
everywhere   111.63163604008608
enough   98.45817116092834
villefort pale and agitated ran to the window put aside the curtain and saw him pass cool and collected by two or three ill looking men at the corner of the street who were there perhaps to arrest a man with black whiskers and a blue frock coat and hat with broad brim   96.64432616520699
you watch while i sleep and you have come to bring me some news   71.39381309338847

you say then he continued that the count de rochefort spoke of me to the cardinal   99.85994419971746
his glance was keen but showed cunning rather than intelligence   247.89405720134783
he carried the strictness of this order so far as to detain in england the ambassadors of denmark who had taken their leave and the regular ambassador of holland who was to take back to the port of flushing the indian merchantmen of which charles i   237.2360554266101

oh dear no your excellency unless you intend to commit suicide   212.7138184941252
we are all four lost if by the least gesture you discover that you recognize him   134.25169564988425
you are no longer in my service monsieur bertuccio   143.45093409962692
d artagnan s countenance took an expression of the deepest compassion   129.88073901734245
at each previous visit he had made to rome he had solicited and obtained the same favor   148.9862145557546
but with all that he outstripped ariel and barbare against whom he ran by at least three whole lengths   122.59350749599761
the peasant took off his hat on hearing this revered name   37.19134060864765
i hope he does not bring our breakfast with him   105.19273364693882
carlini flew joyfully to rita telling her she was saved and bidding her write to her father to inform him what had occurred and that her ransom was fixed at three hundred piastres   133.56804525554492
sir said the notary whose interest had been greatly excited and who had resolved on publishing far and wide the account of this extraordinary and picturesque scene what appeared so impossible to me an hour ago has now become quite easy and practicable and this may be a perfectly valid will provided it be read in the presence of seven witnesses approved by the testator and sealed by the notary in the presence of the witnesses   169.4304471280594
you see we had each our mission said porthos   112.41843644217276
then whispering to selim she asked what were her master s orders   173.14894584333564
demanded milady   215.32132188691247
yes the gascon answered   131.1707639882671
he cried   89.34176883202333
demanded the chief   67.51215336621945
we have no time now for suspicions said athos   66.86059864593014
the countenance of old dantès brightened   116.31668528355836
and he went toward the door of the second compartment   116.95082497449216
who has broken his   0.5061826802074165

for form s sake the chancellor paid a visit to the pieces of furniture named   103.78566006293265
was it not i   177.92496354108306
pardon my frankness dear friend   237.46627043754398
yes said the old man   20.052121435889106
is supper ready signor pastrini   126.75021527996894
the abbess listened more attentively grew animated by degrees and smiled   64.26490769360909
of a woman to whom you have told everything   34.68828576233308
these protestations were nothing for mme   89.24880016249843
and he took his friend along the alley where a number of tracks like those which had trampled down the flowerbeds were visible   75.05158503559974
and where did they live   190.88089570675214
what do i see   56.443352476734354
but it was not upon corsica the very houses of which he could distinguish   158.8480345626587
the first three remained constantly in a small waiting room ready to obey the summons of a small golden bell or to receive the orders of the romaic slave who knew just enough french to be able to transmit her mistress s wishes to the three other waiting women   106.68094183625482
he was about to begin his repast when the sound of the bell rang sharp and loud   113.50874834870918
as regards the marchesa corsinari really said the major difficulties seem to thicken upon us   88.67195821178208
valentine reposes within the walls of paris and to leave paris is like losing her a second time   86.94846003943752
and it was necessary therefore to have recourse to some profitable scheme which was a matter of great difficulty in the impoverished condition of exhausted italy   136.14082445664755
you were looking the other way   89.00633457633465
i ask much too much perhaps for i have no title to request it   91.82920790729119
where is thy master   132.41777976133235
tell me therefore who are these men who killed the son with despair and the father with famine   177.72175079644413
he said two words to the chief and i was free   117.49491767560296
athos fenced with as much calmness and method as if he had been practicing in a fencing school   141.6571536380748
on the contrary i am certain he will do so   83.64184656053908
come my friend said danglars seeing that he made no impression on peppino you will not refuse me a glass of wine   171.9218693215551
caderousse was filled with wonder   169.96120502534177
you make me tremble   243.73732691649863
when i say one spoonful i began by one now i take four   75.93049044048487
no matter   103.3599408946712
he has rendered the whole life of one who had the right to expect from heaven that portion of happiness god has promised to everyone of his creatures an existence of misery and infamy   141.7508532770593
her hôtel was remarkably sumptuous and while the most part of the english had quit or were about to quit france on account of the war milady had just been laying out much money upon her residence   270.9564545133094
milady may discover that you gave the first billet to my lackey instead of to the count s   108.60425963686072
had old æolus appeared at this moment he would have been proclaimed king of the moccoli and aquilo the heir presumptive to the throne   136.08420961201836
good enough   194.57062179472553
at this moment the whole regiment came up and they fell upon the few men who had held out surrounding the two frenchmen   65.03447300772183
some wine   165.38429730873318
cried d artagnan quite bewildered at this unexpected announcement   62.6944667256386
the young king would perhaps show us some gratitude   83.27850003855926
i know it well so take grimaud   114.28290118081657
yes   78.15370906423024
planchet alighted   177.24005423085288
come hither i say and don t be afraid continued athos   61.455503250190525
are you not charged with a mission from his eminence cardinal mazarin   42.40663931740497
well yes and i had good reason to be so replied château renaud   160.8011063940553
then while passing he had cast a rapid investigating glance into the kitchen   69.3275745272015
40154m then he added some words in a low tone for the exclamation which surprise had drawn from the count faint as it had been had startled the man who remained in the pose of the old knife grinder   111.72580130149538
i will tell the coadjutor said bazin   160.46031355216476
yes replied the abbé it is very affecting   14.49616740567511
she rather feared that her preceding operations in england might have been discovered   64.88047281958733
but as soon as they were out of sight he said raoul we set out to night for paris   105.2408134015852
at the voice of this last speaker grimaud started and felt a shudder creeping through his very marrow   194.94168395803683
in case any evil should happen to me said bragelonne   143.3370855074826
lens   61.34907605218447
i could defy a nation   129.1477044782652
a moment later the gray headed man was beside him   88.80546149191078
and he held out his hand to julie who gave him hers carried away by the look and accent of the count   158.27171361251743
died poisoned you know by what mistake   124.06563269440214
but observed the honest notary the count is i think mistaken   65.62523471840109
just as the quaint conclusion reached by porthos was about to bring back hilarity to faces now more or less clouded hasty footsteps were heard upon the stair and some one knocked at the door   207.69463995937258
then said the abbess looking at milady with increasing interest i behold another poor victim   97.81747601570842
yes   98.34568153643366
that s true   59.49300578107061
he was to find out whether he could recognize himself as he had not seen his own face for fourteen years   67.16748385743946
to purchase back my liberty   43.34159202684802
bonacieux of whom his head if not his heart was already full   166.78337701681093
the very madness of the abbé faria gone mad in prison condemned him to perpetual captivity   143.55198172926976
i will go continued maximilian i will seek m   196.6341300955483
after so many years of painful separation said andrea in the same tone of voice and glancing towards the door what a happiness it is to meet again   20.69439633870573
said the president   126.5200264254647
but if his morals were shocked on the landing his respect for the cardinal was scandalized in the antechamber   80.16703818045198
i ask your pardon my dear count said albert for following you here and i must first tell you that it was not the fault of your servants that i did so   95.14814511682796
you believe so   122.94779943964086
asked the young man with glistening eye   206.91173355910436

the snow was falling thick and icy   203.08238953080922
if you know this how much must you suffer   69.62526741212784
where is raoul   93.21324335577663
if not as priest then as son   173.2796533371028
but that idea if at last i have it your majesty will do us justice   182.888848985036
connected by marriage you mean said franz laughingly   121.42799495997117
let us talk no more of mordaunt it will bring bad luck   21.809848316334225
and you who have seen the whole world will relate your adventures you shall tell us the history of the beautiful greek who was with you the other night at the opera and whom you call your slave and yet treat like a princess   144.4416671126079
and what is it to be   162.73121054744067
but tell me can you not perceive the russet tint which marks the heavens   108.62548924412123
isn t that what you would have me shout   161.78786625940165
the escape was fixed to take place at seven o clock   96.32911124102009
i will answer for that   97.99069328200586

aramis therefore had written immediately to marie michon the seamstress at tours who had such fine acquaintances to obtain from the queen authority for mme   92.07030132016095
surely you must be mistaken   175.12252079666254
his eyes were penetrating and sparkling   130.59155128315186
and signed by whom by the king   76.18417577633852
yes replied morcerf he said something about it to me   131.69917517618507
oh   125.65146478573112
you are therefore your own master till seven o clock in the evening   93.1141619696126
the night was dark snow was falling the streets were silent and deserted   82.52290252152197
is he a sure man   170.24972080711396
he must then have had some reason for acting as he did this morning and confess that his conduct is more heroic than otherwise   193.77938555276882
morrel who forthwith conducting her up the flight of wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the feast was prepared was gayly followed by the guests beneath whose heavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of several minutes   102.80107711746317
the oubliettes of cardinal mazarin   98.03689616392408
poor young creature   176.66314009870115
the carriage awaited them at the door filled with sweetmeats and bouquets   162.63108766384178
de villefort   108.7378003468916
aramis you think that d artagnan that porthos would lend their hands to such an infamy   95.17798369354625
yes the ground is all sown said the jesuit and we have not to fear that one portion of the seed may have fallen upon stone another upon the highway or that the birds of heaven have eaten the rest aves cœli comederunt illam   152.12178871546507
it looked a race of phantoms   171.85327048710354
tell us about it said athos palpitating   173.26933344318365
accept my thanks for the client you have sent me   86.43432696886859
adieu my sweet haydée adieu my sister   163.79708585204176

what the devil   155.56951375629495
noirtier continued to look at the same object but suddenly his glance was transferred from the wife to the husband and villefort himself had to submit to the searching investigation of eyes which while changing their direction and even their language had lost none of their menacing expression   240.98325334986424
de tréville entered the king s cabinet boldly and found his majesty in a very ill humor seated on an armchair beating his boot with the handle of his whip   125.1606160888675
with a full heart and burning head he desired olivain to lead on the horses to a wayside inn which he observed within gunshot range a little in advance of the place they had reached   149.92965961756587
what on earth are you talking of   107.41271536511752
therefore d artagnan was going to ask leave of absence of m   102.19094240723953
but sir said hermine suddenly if all this is as you say caused by m   117.36189979734532
now i think of it you can do better said danglars   227.8522782444279
milady recognized the step of lord de winter   167.36355560856947
then to recompense you for the service you will have rendered us you shall afterward drink this glass of wine   118.61004670080763
alas replied the weeping girl i am obliged to own that my stepmother s aversion to me arises from a very natural source her overweening love for her own child my brother edward   175.53806876385943

the eagle that soared above their heads and thus he soon became so expert that teresa overcame the terror she at first felt at the report and amused herself by watching him direct the ball wherever he pleased with as much accuracy as if he placed it by hand   79.43912936363506
meaning to say rejoined monte cristo that however thomson french may be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and folly the baron danglars is not disposed to follow their example   111.62163515291043
good caderousse he said how happy you will be   265.9538293392925
many people have been assassinated in a tumult but even criminals have rarely been insulted during trial   165.89230268999103
do you know if the marriage settlement he promised me has come   121.8335190633411
i have two words to say to the count of monte cristo   77.09256663539901
you are fond of gardening   146.77753263820728
yes sire as they always do   173.76245266452554
cried the baroness falling on her chair and stifling her sobs in her handkerchief   142.7039709490701
they explained what had occurred that evening   55.134323462652326
very true but you introduced me at m   60.68973320831122
let us go to monsieur de beaufort   54.76025514828558
morrel to whom next to my father i owe every blessing i enjoy every difficulty has been removed   55.016603854249645
except that which i ask of you dear love   152.8134909009746
i really did not observe whom i had the honor to receive under my poor roof   101.87480845925154
every revolution has its catastrophes returned m   57.733057206776735
because england had need of me to take the tyrant and now the tyrant is taken   201.14800226967557
to whom does this island belong   124.19293692282339
but little by little the general vertigo seized them and they felt themselves obliged to take part in the noise and confusion   137.22856331052486
for an instant the idea struck madame danglars that this eagerness on the part of the young viscount arose from his impatience to join her party and she whispered her expectations to her daughter that albert was hurrying to pay his respects to them   87.16005885587865
but am now back again   186.45019376891838
who knows when i shall be at liberty that i may not satisfy your curiosity   183.08852433450338
he had a great desire to go to the window but he dared not   1.7057573549113556
as usual a pilot put off immediately and rounding the château d if got on board the vessel between cape morgiou and rion island   144.68767654507894
he would have spoken but his voice failed him   113.92192529813646
did you ask for me my good friend   106.3784042299111
coquenard knit his eyebrows because there were too many good things   177.3654500689997
only 700 000 francs out of my cash box nothing more   73.07931226976845
on recognizing her step mother valentine could not repress a shudder which caused a vibration in the bed   165.4867834249882
but he was a man of stone   90.86312849213633
now my dear friend look upon all i tell you as merely the statement of a monk of a man who resembles an echo repeating simply what he hears   166.4229981194183
what she most desires is a letter from her intended   223.98170410159818
but no evil impressions were taken from her grief as she was known to be very much attached to her relatives about whom she was constantly having serious disputes with her husband   120.50472379045127
then without taking any thought for their future he returned to porthos and told him that his commission was completed   132.90122803631144
a terrible howling interrupted these reflections of d artagnan and mme   193.964427242086
yes as an augustine monk   178.12031033903958
he preserved his melancholy and motionless position for some time after his two friends had regained their carriage   115.229328977404
besides it will not be for long   144.26092349827195
i staked grimaud the silent grimaud divided into ten portions   151.3116273857305
and from that date up to the present day a hundred times perhaps   152.6257134157234
bonacieux and was as we have said close to her he saw on the ground a fine cambric handkerchief which he picked up as was his habit and at the corner of which he recognized the same cipher he had seen on the handkerchief which had nearly caused him and aramis to cut each other s throat   109.32629466530774
replied athos   63.972686237490116
moreover no generation ever does the same thing twice   40.96156014730305
la ramee went out but in five minutes one of the officers of the guard entered in compliance with the strict orders of the cardinal that the prisoner should never be left alone a moment   86.80089321224987
1   38.405713907898715

this kiosk appeared to me to be at a considerable distance perhaps on account of the darkness of the night which prevented any object from being more than partially discerned   121.565841687491
what do you mean   55.67469058877649
go on   194.8796843330407
cried jussac for the third time   143.9867828368638
excuse me my lord said the lad   133.80532972627967
sir replied the young man it is on account of an accident which has happened to our little neighbor   28.029249310407792
but the regularity with which the nubian puffed forth the smoke of his chibouque proved that he at least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment of his favorite occupation   93.4084970303814
ah that is something serious   120.77477151818252
and the spies of the cardinal have served him faithfully   169.23553914920416
ah beauchamp i see you know something already   143.96071416460882
but morrel was of plebeian extraction and valentine knew how the haughty marquise de saint méran despised all who were not noble   77.76152472373161
alas poor albert   133.83699829313719
monsieur de comminges is in the guards and not in the musketeers which means i suppose that the musketeers are better soldiers than the guards   153.38466729253017
someone had just died in the house to which that garden belonged   131.98019586446088
and that if she has committed any follies i renounce her i abjure her i curse her   22.864748556427287
cried the novice with enthusiasm   89.86854116701042

athos was standing before the door enveloped in his cloak with his hat pulled down over his eyes   152.45215201755852
always painful always ready to bleed when touched they remain fresh and open in the heart   173.31740778692006
aramis came behind giving his arm to porthos   84.56405177715497
to begin with tell me said she how have you watched me so closely as to be aware beforehand not only of my arrival but even of the day the hour and the port at which i should arrive   135.97125688742696
it was one of those events which decide the life of a man   98.48683032429335
on leaving paris athos and aramis well knew that they would be encountering great danger   168.74946604399003
worthy fellows   93.1869055083641
here i am your excellency said peppino with an eagerness which danglars thought favorable to him   120.83484134285325
but how came that first note to be inserted in your journal   160.59546959203533
m   55.87965507467377
noirtier s eye still retained its inanimate expression   108.72744862820866
athos was invited four times and each time took his friends and their lackeys with him   128.92026334929312
in about ten minutes they reached the ruins of an old chateau   76.82688207892585
yes calls himself   209.14332116273843
the handkerchief was indeed richly embroidered and had a coronet and arms at one of its corners   68.84558666268407
there is something true in what you say said the count with that smile which made him so handsome   66.6369935165608
and you were right cried aramis and porthos with one voice   135.78509672479518
and your majesty has a good memory   177.33287136962988
your name   91.45693817249331
morrel turned away to conceal the confusion of his countenance   187.7237989357848
now i am going to show you how sincere i am   134.27274896020262
monte cristo took a paper from his pocket upon which were drawn three signs with numbers to indicate the order in which they were to be worked   136.81986951919933
well now that everything is decided cried porthos rubbing his hands suppose we think of dinner   50.42043869288979

my brother is reading his two papers la presse and les débats within six steps of her   57.452298817409286
porthos had forgotten that any other address was necessary   200.74314175135027
aramis on the contrary struck right and left and was almost delirious with excitement   56.714361137317475
yes sire replied athos   149.96570346552693
the two men drew back   98.14131677818106
you see cardinal replied the queen that your enemies are mine   78.73818973227094

mme   138.19885019501908
and a frightful demoniac laugh finished the sentence which was lost in a hoarse rattle   228.37730616526642
exclaimed the man half suffocated   115.65883497997496
sir i do not deny the justice of your correction but the more severely you arm yourself against that unfortunate man the more deeply will you strike our family   123.89425269277218
you disapprove of this second project as you did of the first   154.3157367988539
after making the tour of the garden a second time the count re entered his carriage while bertuccio who perceived the thoughtful expression of his master s features took his seat beside the driver without uttering a word   60.12277273745166
gentlemen said he we have been here an hour and our wager is won   118.46878180501193

brother in law of the late king your husband the consort of madame henrietta your sister and your guest and because we did all that we could do to save the life of the royal martyr   100.09259680352959

monte cristo looked at her with an emotion that must have been remarked by morrel had not his eyes been fixed on the vessel   222.02406534239128
yes that really is lucky for it never occurred to me to bring them   117.58112510399846
believe your own eyes   182.72071143696508
i was expecting you   132.51699107617944
athos then plunged into the street the man had indicated with his finger   142.3275229625722
have you no friends in paris then monsieur porthos   121.86933028861796
but danglars had not reckoned upon the formalities of the police and the idleness of the posting master   182.18069753069142
once only had villefort seen his father   199.69202505822835
said faria when the young man had finished reading it   78.85084130943524
this coldness toward the only interests that occupied her mind terrified milady whose questions became more pressing   76.41388578133476
she gave the first to athos and the other to aramis so that should they be separated by chance they might make themselves known to the king   103.23457672119194
the general drew himself up clinging to the curtain   61.98159759152236
m   88.33927389876004
as it is not our intention to give a journal of the siege but on the contrary only to describe such of the events of it as are connected with the story we are relating we will content ourselves with saying in two words that the expedition succeeded to the great astonishment of the king and the great glory of the cardinal   97.40290318876507
he would not have believed that two sentiments so opposite could dwell in the same heart and by their union constitute a passion so strange and as it were diabolical   113.40969466148981
two feet below you   22.136309546570544
under the second lamp on the right you will find your adversary   162.28231426131438
e   85.37270013593033
the general proposed to cast lots for the swords but the president said it was he who had given the provocation and when he had given it he had supposed each would use his own arms   104.54529147702678
as she spoke she extended her beautiful hand to the cardinal and showed him a superb diamond which sparkled on her finger   83.09533530548913
yes i heard it spoken of but i did not know the details and then no one can be more ignorant than i am of the affairs in the bourse   52.96206891315304
then enclosing monte cristo s receipt in a little pocket book he added yes come at twelve o clock   90.34274143468318
he is dead and no mistake about it   121.33485577279357
it is some superior officer making his night rounds said athos   180.898175556598
you do not reply to my question replied the inspector impatiently   156.37733185483748
the lower part of his dress was more distinctly visible by the bright rays of the moon which entering through the broken ceiling shed their refulgent beams on feet cased in elegantly made boots of polished leather over which descended fashionably cut trousers of black cloth   100.89315655084935
she would have killed you   38.18232317354533
how is that mousqueton   41.945733250546255
i shall be back in ten minutes   155.4046485508595
d artagnan smiled   149.56040786046367
the evening of the betrothal chapter 10   180.56175573033246
responded peppino   204.04915902765993
all that you tell me of those by whom i am surrounded monsieur d artagnan is doubtless true said the queen but i have confidence in you alone   169.5442286794654
i only know that he charged himself on my account with a mission which he terminated so entirely to my satisfaction that had i been king i should have instantly created him knight of all my orders even had i been able to offer him the golden fleece and the garter   33.06993077830599
he had now leisure to look to his wound   107.45613803967484
my dear d artagnan you will never make anything but a very bad secretary   211.03117383783382
what monsieur   118.09030547269064
what word then can be found to describe the days which they occupy in descending   35.064658460161766
d artagnan was not so dull as not to perceive that he was one too many   130.86424617021635
i bought some spanish shares   61.19388484804751
consider yourself as in your own house and to put yourself still more at your ease pray accompany me to the apartments of m   72.63237242982339
m   134.28170102559773
yes   16.376597434136954

26   149.84668815985268
oh yes   65.20065835794074
the old man recognized his child and carlini recognized the old man   124.15055853581553
i will efface that blot on my father s character   88.8850622707946
d artagnan   123.65980355124198
i have told you and i repeat it that to night we rescue charles i   8.772114654300708
come in said monte cristo with a voice that betrayed not the least emotion   96.26146953391796
morrel at his death left 500 000 francs which were divided between my sister and myself for we were his only children   22.455991929918568
an opportunity will come replied rochefort   194.88233322170376
yes   137.8330763378353
it was said at this moment that danglars was worth from six to eight millions of francs and had unlimited credit   177.40001271507018
and besides my own sorrow is too great for anger to find a place in my heart   125.85740536602441
then aloud and he has taken his ancient name of vallon   72.14882833867503
you can t imagine my dear fellow the sort of man he is   149.8964446586004
i tell you that you are about to destroy yourself continued the count and here is proof of what i say   78.61611626673869
you are very happy exclaimed athos laughing in spite of himself at the sally of the irresistible gascon   105.53901628892146
cried monte cristo stopping suddenly what words do you utter   136.4305634368722
you look like four conspirators   91.11346585622185
it seems their horses too are breaking down as well as ours   116.8539271021273
but when is this ball to take place   172.39329059708524
ten minutes passed thus and he was convinced that no one was watching him   120.45186258063396
she said and why art thou not at notre dame   113.44457064428369
he ventured to call and it seemed to him that the wind wafted back an almost inarticulate sigh   122.1478532177195
signor pastrini replied that he had only two rooms and a parlor on the third floor which he offered at the low charge of a louis per diem   159.42385386445505
like athos he had noted the spot where the horses had halted   93.14335376531474
yes he said yes doubtless it is painful if you violently break the outer covering which obstinately begs for life   140.07849653168148
the letter shall be given to himself   101.16688557098445
chapter xxii   79.82382311518158
as for me i consider the union with mademoiselle danglars a most suitable one   70.66761826585878
the young man sprang to the entrance darted through it carefully drawing the stone over the opening and hurried to his cell   150.32683614831203
mouston s suggestion appear to you full of sense   187.0767527123981
yes said porthos twill be at least a little change from beer   167.59016320361462
oh death is in my house   148.42253734338078
but have you ever watched him carefully   113.67537223195795
all it can do is to avenge the wrong done   116.27173722812496
you will oblige me   69.36208857624672
morrel s service and a most singular change had taken place in his position   115.96977502549265
because monsieur de beaufort is one of my friends or rather i am one of his   217.00724457751835
tell your client that although i am the insulted party in order to carry out my eccentricity i leave him the choice of arms and will accept without discussion without dispute anything even combat by drawing lots which is always stupid but with me different from other people as i am sure to gain   177.5576311429038
answered la ramee   224.75291840416986
cavalcanti said andrea taking the major by the arm in a confidential manner how much are you paid for being my father   121.68108965325406
and me too   78.34284290938056
and as i had known since morning the reason of my abduction with the help of the sheets i let myself down from the window   118.64040843503031
i will take all the consequences upon myself   174.57625982442377
d artagnan took every smile for an insult and every look as a provocation whence it resulted that from tarbes to meung his fist was constantly doubled or his hand on the hilt of his sword   81.38181468117529
4   17.454882251679948
ma foi   70.61034519306381
1   150.19989357234465
aramis looked first at porthos and then at d artagnan without speaking but the latter understood his meaningful look   191.00161219312992
the king raised himself buckled on his belt and passing his handkerchief over his moist forehead said well what is to be done   214.99259198810825
we thought it dead   221.412615319581
absolution comes not from him who administers it but from god   114.4134841576517
dantès let go of the timber which he now thought to be useless and swam vigorously to meet them   66.67309387543173
in a month then on your honor if i am not consoled you will let me take my life into my own hands and whatever may happen you will not call me ungrateful   219.9820786063031
it was to her he wrote from the siege of rochelle to warn her of a plot against the duke of buckingham   59.97978479614789
and who knows which of you is the most fortunate   32.31014638489647
at the next inn you will find a wounded man now being attended by our servants who has asked the assistance of a minister of god   118.82290415116842
why what nonsense are you telling us   136.91775007147822
then it was to go to her that you left us   150.6712041822999
athos and aramis looked at one another and smiled   110.28296382317744
then today madame oh today i am no further than gratitude   68.90525253213306
gracious heaven exclaimed he   133.23854103193756
who and where is he   74.38222031280651
i do not wish to cause you any remorse   235.22089422729783

come hither   213.45404027523696
asked the queen for i hear them   148.86980461365854
and whilst d artagnan uttered a cry porthos raised the oar and aramis sought a place to strike a frightful shake given to the boat precipitated athos into the sea   136.70111191507152
i saw some very pretty woods which almost touch the convent garden   79.00760811021738
well what do you see from this window   227.458864820627
nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states   138.24647003454567

30115m and you know i am to marry mademoiselle danglars said albert laughing   86.79884511898257
he was ushered into a simple and elegant drawing room and the count rose to meet him with a smiling air   101.85404645898603
yes   91.8325292201904
danglars who never had possessed any patrimony both laid the foundations of their different fortunes   136.87165462978717
pistache made violent signs that it was by raising and lowering his head eight or ten times successively   165.47824509474273
said gaetano   155.7482818666776
and in ten minutes i will answer for it you shall have all you desire   123.80125393168474
d artagnan tell us what sort of a night you have had and we will describe ours afterward   171.52837276258023

what brief   124.31712910253314
you have a sword by your side i have one in my cane   174.62554734215587
he desired him also should he know in the neighborhood any doctor or chirurgeon to fetch him taking on himself the payment of the messenger   55.577672080702186
he had heard so many utter the same things indeed he heard nothing else   58.57369585546076
a sun dial could not have shown the hour with greater precision   81.31474432533754
de monte cristo is relating horrible stories to us doubtless intending to frighten us to death   69.77540704943752
ah me   114.5937180281037
i would however beg your majesty to observe do you then also join in betraying me monsieur cardinal by thus always opposing my will   146.75485981142742
mazarin now understood that cromwell s envoy desired to retain his incognito   142.8250354170192
charles perceived it and took his hand   194.44978924799085
and these men were your friends   88.90050215069687
for he was a quiet inoffensive prisoner happy in his folly and required no watching   41.95202827546754
but unfortunately i have very little time to spare having an appointment at twelve precisely   96.02652877168076
and though she has the look of an angel we must not always judge people by the appearance   125.12299000556166
you are free to do so   123.69334257729
long live the duc de beaufort   64.05827783620214
winter s regiment was ranged on some high ground above the camp   110.88460113105761
i thought i had not heard aright   102.90876963939897
yes but never with the same advantages said d artagnan in a tone of raillery   94.88582297843752
rospigliosi quite set up with his new dignities went with a good appetite and his most ingratiating manner   111.91091871764557
an instant after the boat rowed by two men advanced rapidly towards him   95.14747675064
resumed d artagnan not having seen you for four or five years i concluded you were dead   130.04509050067415
ma foi i beg your pardon but as i have but one son and it is the first time i have ever thought of marrying him i am still serving my apprenticeship you know   139.84337920587234
two ladies sleeping in one bed were awakened by the noise and fixing their eyes upon the spot whence the sound proceeded they saw a man   28.59826787304692
we came here with the intention of asking for something to eat   104.21328426897371
and abbés who give diamonds worth two thousand louis are rare   177.11869429796582
my dear albert replied franz i am glad of this opportunity to tell you once and forever that you entertain a most erroneous notion concerning italian women   116.16458763901966
lord de winter himself could scarcely recognize the tigress who a minute before prepared apparently for a fight   71.84277888065006
cried the duke   82.91216200737338
who is that   110.72560570095557
but said porthos with great wisdom that was impossible for they would have killed the captain and the sailors   141.93050852899273
i have been there mother said friquet but i saw things happen of which master broussel ought to be warned and so with monsieur bazin s permission you know mother monsieur bazin the verger i came to speak to monsieur broussel   80.94786412985113
is the king accustomed to give you such reasons   90.63876769904184
the jailer as he entered stepped on it and broke it   166.8019903830081
de tréville felt himself something like samson before the philistines   97.94262109415898
i do not like auteuil sir said the procureur making an evident effort to appear calm   161.6948641446957
i do not know never may know the persons of whom you are about to speak   198.7378708989964
friend said d artagnan a half pistole for that paper   194.68549780138505
but you can place me in one of the provinces with some lady of your acquaintance in your own country for instance   215.4459933826277
can it be possible   172.47540404776072
at the beginning of this work his servant notwithstanding orders to the contrary came to his room   104.44673020382592
dear friend i shall sacrifice myself and go and see anne of austria   184.1720985943141
i do not understand you sir said raoul   115.43731362940878
what has put this into your head   84.41964475778683
she had frequently observed the contemptuous expression with which her daughter looked upon debray an expression which seemed to imply that she understood all her mother s amorous and pecuniary relationships with the intimate secretary   100.60270526805564
over the doors were painted sketches of shepherds and shepherdesses after the style and manner of boucher   194.91180115965278
oh my god my god have pity on me   30.0556631137473
the noble animals bounded forward   129.05200995740367
her hands clutched her armchair   65.15331118138225
the interests of that kingdom and those of england though taking now diverse directions are very nearly the same   137.65739990813043
her mind was utterly absorbed in the contemplation of the person who from the first instant she saw him had made so powerful an impression on her   154.9676471956121
dantès listened and plainly distinguished the approaching steps of the jailer   82.13166878393753
nothing was wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry   128.82977471941825
she was of the color of ashes   103.42928371748822
on foot yes in a carriage no   131.7791180807746
m   88.84987773639448
monte cristo thus attuned to the interview he proposed to hold with morrel and his family departed murmuring as he went these lines of pindar youth is a flower of which love is the fruit   171.9763466926758
during the six years which had passed since noirtier first fell into this sad state valentine s powers of invention had been too often put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients for gaining a knowledge of his wishes and the constant practice had so perfected her in the art that she guessed the old man s meaning as quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted   66.86028740990918
cried olivain what are you doing   144.17263218902602
i must have time   195.7191798149492
a shudder crept through the body of the cardinal who did not shudder readily   79.98652139233846
that title said cromwell laughing is all very well here but take care a word like that does not escape your lips in public   95.74717149079582
indeed everything offended eyes accustomed to refinement and elegance   91.61159685389745
mazarin sighed   202.88255014674655
asked the cardinal   101.89848277622994
one word more sir   111.60840590730004
but he knew how little reliance should be placed on such promises made by the queen and mazarin   97.87920612100335
they have closed up the grating with a board   210.3194224650456
but everything in the world is unstable and the man who happened to fall into disgrace with your majesty might lose this office to morrow   114.80815007048207
said aramis   196.45644664732885
no said athos   70.5367952907452
repeated monte cristo   120.16571235211035
said she   143.61236305131104
i think not replied château renaud   129.15245393589902
e   118.89149748219887
you have not guessed rightly   37.11743334267712
ah sir indeed you would inspire me with pity were you not hateful in my eyes   147.5073024941127
a false letter altogether said porthos we have not been disciplined   211.58429822512085
i felt sure it must be you   94.55427981710494
replied raoul especially in expression   97.47451716362896
at the moment he went out a piercing glance darted through the opening of the nearly closed door and she perceived felton who drew quickly to one side to prevent being seen by her   75.690958030235
it was necessary   180.1663267498597
morcerf took his hat and left the room   109.30873177334998
you are a man of genius and you know your worth   131.14258599371408
do you then never appear but to act as an escort to death   82.9434208415363
look behind this wall said de comminges knocking against the wall   156.37171698229872
the doctor was right   56.59208118297704
but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their eyes and with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each other s arms   46.91431473820492
athos alighted and calmly opened the handkerchief tied at each corner whilst d artagnan ever cautious remained on horseback one hand upon his pistol leaning forward watchfully   189.95294127109128
rochefort called him his friend his dear bonacieux and never ceased telling him that the cardinal had a great respect for him   122.10805812566522
ah indeed   122.45145702294425
you who are accustomed to the palaces of italy can amuse yourself by calculating in how many square feet a young man who is not the worst lodged in paris can live   146.2266246794884
noirtier s happiness i   136.68234811724372
he turned it gently on its hinges   156.8487870566145
for like all other recollections in this world these impressions were by degrees effaced   127.24248973528002
why do you mention my father   34.72803667560336
it seems that your memory is equally short in everything vampa said the count and that not only do you forget people s faces but also the conditions you make with them   131.87457693559713
well said villefort what is it   66.35445315489571
thus dantès who but three months before had no desire but liberty had now not liberty enough and panted for wealth   60.27719643625854
de villefort said monte cristo fixing his eyes on madame de villefort   156.19941206148383
i think i may aspire to that honor said danglars with a smile which reminded monte cristo of the sickly moons which bad artists are so fond of daubing into their pictures of ruins   102.54480515284149
and at all events it is more difficult to replace a man in the fort l evêque or the bastille who has got out than to keep a prisoner there who is in   126.10436373378931
you have forgotten then   79.34159879241818
for believe me he is the worthy son of the countess   97.71108994779594
an italian from the neighborhood of mantua i believe   119.51073316752368
the count sat down   117.5169489255205
said porthos turning toward another musketeer   116.2049005507731
that girl is not his wife he told us himself she was his slave   58.54435142378572
eh then what are the sentinels about   140.11125909248642
certainly   103.80283616549134
they are names of shepherds   128.2931199648153
i   33.275971755657736
you must attribute it only to natural scruples under similar circumstances   126.90312760545422
i know nothing   224.147362940444
de villefort who lives in the faubourg saint honoré   121.60576824781637
he that man   141.66142851296237
de morcerf these words were accompanied by a most peculiar smile whether you undertake upon my arrival in france to open to me the doors of that fashionable world of which i know no more than a huron or a native of cochin china   129.56006770010202
it was ten o clock at night   90.59342838882401
but make haste i can not stay here all day   133.03444996051803
my lord yes   132.677878050973
milady looked at the officer with one of those terrible expressions peculiar to her countenance and which so rarely failed of their effect   118.89606504320635
stormed   127.87916236583317
danglars made no reply   142.03058047090923
thanks thanks dear love adieu   120.65208931222013
but tell me what   65.47831481198912
this formal announcement which implied or appeared to imply the approval of all the persons concerned in this momentous affair had been preceded by a scene to which our readers must be admitted   149.21392454900283
no count i hope i assure you i shall do my best stammered villefort   134.12635814137934
this loophole which gradually diminished in size as it approached the outside to an opening through which a child could not have passed was for better security furnished with three iron bars so as to quiet all apprehensions even in the mind of the most suspicious jailer as to the possibility of a prisoner s escape   132.17285181820705
i am afraid to do so   121.40645806265542
you have truly inconceivable ideas   118.09215552804356
she will come and throw herself between us   105.05077977275523
do you pretend that all this has been unobserved at the minister s   125.39042416591295
cried the lieutenant   139.94497176817694
ah this one is not like the other and his madness is less affecting than this one s display of reason   76.62525375384877
fortunately the day after tomorrow we leave paris   180.92232081801635
and now added the queen her voice broken by her emotion have you any other question to ask me   33.219989223431526
it was then generally reported that mademoiselle de villefort the heiress of the marquis and marchioness of saint méran had regained the good graces of her grandfather and that she would ultimately be in possession of an income of 300 000 livres   141.0055905427353
this measure somewhat reassured bonacieux   87.69918388909991
while mercédès as we have said was making a similar inventory of her property to albert s while she was arranging her jewels shutting her drawers collecting her keys to leave everything in perfect order she did not perceive a pale and sinister face at a glass door which threw light into the passage from which everything could be both seen and heard   119.95220812329063
but replied felton i wish to know   117.36628574337999
well well said monte cristo such an innocent looking person as you are to do those things m   112.12989951724443
it was the same through which twenty four years ago he had been conducted by a silent and nocturnal guard   116.59703780366898
one evening i was in a garden   162.90097391205398
de la trémouille in whose service he had a relative d artagnan was ignorant of the seriousness of the last wound his adversary had received and pressing him warmly without doubt would soon have completed his work with a third blow when the noise which arose from the street being heard in the tennis court two of the friends of the guardsman who had seen him go out after exchanging some words with d artagnan rushed sword in hand from the court and fell upon the conqueror   114.82787362359718
shouted the three musketeers in chorus   128.10856009541152
and monte cristo drew another packet from his pocket   122.19997810118998
and why has the count bought a rock   171.3660549277052
a totally different subject interests me   33.156108387263174
the queen smiled but instead of answering see de winter she said i have at least gained one thing in being only half a queen   137.84359832909627
oh   146.47946021375532
exclaimed edmond that will not be   97.31255028408526
mme   112.69073016070796
but never mind he is a neighbor who has done us a service on a time so he s welcome   128.41559574129388
and listening discerned that they were cries of joy   107.58949754315337
ah really said monte cristo in a half stifled voice   134.42251102195252
let us get ready gentlemen   91.46087185405433
and the queen had even the indiscretion to give him certain ornaments so rare that they could never be replaced by any like them   91.93478002604115
in a pate   203.53521066771654
added the wounded man in an accent of terror which made the young men shudder   73.72519184043225
by heaven   116.03111186409258
my friend said beauchamp in the most affectionate tone i should gladly make an apology   44.111877152073646
it was our captain of spahis who had arrived on médéah   112.1151361217225
it is indeed the bagdad and bassora of the thousand and one nights   78.36385084526177
one of the three will certainly be at home perhaps all three   101.94435276290716
not at all prince said monte cristo laying a marked stress on the title what have i done for you   102.27361107269465
tis true that mercédès is not actually my wife   78.28721967967402
let us not talk about money if you please   31.980663993899057
at each cross path was an orchestra and tables spread with refreshments   136.67844056318626
from the apartments on the ground floor might be heard the sound of music with the whirl of the waltz and galop while brilliant streams of light shone through the openings of the venetian blinds   179.5314013385283
see he is down there talking politics with that little group of great geniuses   153.15092788487402
la ramee then proposed to send some one to pick them up but the duke remarked that it would be losing time   138.70290570885808
de villefort bear it   84.98763583352721
d artagnan made a violent effort over himself to keep his face from being too expressive   121.4462060142735
in what way   112.61565213591982
england is torn in twain by a spirit of disturbance which i greatly fear blood alone can exorcise   107.04072820793168
he had changed his prison for another that was conveying him he knew not whither   64.54996695301374
albert she said in a voice which was altered by emotion i have always put you on your guard against new acquaintances   108.30368234653852
there all the thoughts which had disturbed me during my year of constant agony came back with double force   80.72732217774202
presently he made such a sudden movement that i was paralyzed with fear   59.37632410622274
that is perfectly admirable   79.88528151184346
with piercing eyes a large brow and a thin face which was made still longer by a royal or imperial as it is now called surmounted by a pair of mustaches   113.06579886626588
exclaimed andrea stupefied   10.49178537458532
bonacieux was to get into the carriage as if to bid her adieu and she was to take away mme   111.22914305897085
oh murmured danglars that bed is probably one of the coffins hollowed in the wall and the sleep i shall enjoy will be death from one of the poniards i see glistening in the darkness   64.15653013056634
the queen entered   120.282108864421
come porthos   53.667625737960186
in receiving and aiding him france will censure the acts of the english nation and thus so essentially harm england and especially the well being of the government that such a proceeding will be equivalent to pronounced hostilities   126.46279873813863
they looked for m   53.87720600212026
do not open the pie till you are alone   91.62528285543794
there is then the second point cleared up or nearly so said eugénie without the least confusion and with that masculine pointedness which distinguished her gesture and her language   60.24987087431603
so said andrea you are speculating upon me   128.24989610538807
but d artagnan well suspected that that which was deferred was not relinquished   146.6271359987232
i ordered dinner at that hour and i do not like to wait   133.32847298980883
immediately   61.37819403357215
but his eye vainly sought rita and cucumetto among them   133.3122596827247
when in a house of whatever kind it may be an individual suspected of any crime is arrested the arrest is held secret   132.3808725398785
it may still be possible to overtake the prisoner   87.58332646635233
you are right aramis let us travel on   120.64519642854177
then also as athos had predicted it became possible to find mme   116.90670987321981
deschamps   114.25835967323158
a splendid nectarine i never ate a better   147.99849667968536
chapter xiv   162.60564611266284
so once more good night   118.87372904255503
the abbé busoni did right to send you to me he went on in his ordinary tone and you have done well in relating to me the whole of your history as it will prevent my forming any erroneous opinions concerning you in future   47.52468316956336
and the two footmen behind were dressed up as green monkeys with spring masks with which they made grimaces at everyone who passed   128.22089462223485
then d artagnan described the meeting which he had at the church and how he had found that lady who with the seigneur in the black cloak and with the scar near his temple filled his mind constantly   203.25547864818517
excellency cried the cicerone seeing franz approach the window shall i bring the carriage nearer to the palace   167.12346344762926
but in spite of that and of his being king s attorney he is a man like ourselves and i fancy not a bad sort of one   53.224604202201704
i told you my dear mother he was esteemed such   107.77683531475999
the proprietors of the mansion had many years before thought it best to confine themselves to the possession of the house itself with its thickly planted courtyard opening into the faubourg saint honoré and to the garden shut in by this gate which formerly communicated with a fine kitchen garden of about an acre   102.53298575596057
danglars thought of the old man whom in his hours of delirium he had seen groaning on his bed   108.04245168954911
beauchamp it is quite laughable   60.32850715943241
and you want my blessing   61.07214783468006
what folly murmured anne of austria who had not the courage to find fault with the duke for having so well preserved her portrait in his heart what folly to feed a useless passion with such remembrances   109.16654999563255
it is instinctive   140.49534971544003
what scotch   160.44797411825812
opportunity is the martingale of man   90.52968906855676
besides is he not a butcher s son   137.55529420649813
the spada family was one of the oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century   213.27973751263474
felton my lad did you not perceive that you were taken for a novice and that the first act was being performed of a comedy of which we shall doubtless have the pleasure of following out all the developments   53.73583999730491
repeated the curate who about as strong as d artagnan with respect to latin carefully watched the jesuit in order to keep step with him and repeated his words like an echo   200.78714375580827
d avrigny took the young man s arm and led him out of the room   94.70252298654717
hear the end   163.4868839709947
f   196.5760096512983
amuse yourself with milady my dear d artagnan   76.29574671798363

i felt some degree of nervousness as i entered upon the history of the diamond but to my inexpressible astonishment he confirmed it in every particular and to my equal surprise he seemed to place entire belief in all i said   76.5229883850438

28 said the count fixing his eyes on the steward to whom he gave this order   93.91361885287208

the count of san felice announced a grand masked ball to which all that were distinguished in rome were invited   13.513763528862057

with monsieur   156.24521994384645
the recompense will exceed your expectations   245.3274724767386
bertuccio wiped the perspiration from his brow but obeyed   153.1210702329683
for at present i can not say that i have seen anything extraordinary   130.1633632489228
asked danglars in amazement   102.01903321353969
only one minute mr   113.12745896441604
my son   142.02774558640496
the couple then although they had not seen each other for eight days and during that time serious events had taken place in which both were concerned accosted each other with a degree of preoccupation   107.79017750134192
porthos next made an effort which shook the solid wall and by the aid of his friend s hand gained the summit   14.476623345697945
my dear madame bonacieux you are charming   91.34284959818159
i found the tenant   207.55346897402387
i am afraid that remaining at blois would be dangerous to his youthful mind   69.85068262904278
she may have forgotten something   105.3171908809015
on leaving the chamber danglars who had shown violent marks of agitation during the sitting and been more bitter than ever against the ministry re entered his carriage and told the coachman to drive to the avenue des champs élysées no   38.05862470212976
i believe that not a stone in paris will remain unturned put in the marechal   67.29328223372455
two minutes later the thunder of a horse s hoofs was heard upon the road   86.49891836747474
well   86.26776633495568
mercédès and albert were in that room   172.53774663955778
what would you have two men without arms do against eight armed men   109.94782783546559
if by artifice by entreaty by accident in short if by any means i can delay this marriage will you wait   48.133426005185626
i comprehend   181.0034665646906
cried the jailer retreating and putting himself on the defensive   73.4597500616552
sir said franz i have one request to make   139.47581576340227
the commissary then instead of continuing to interrogate him made him a long speech upon the danger there is for an obscure citizen to meddle with public matters   162.75917094637055
the carmelite convent at béthune great criminals bear about them a kind of predestination which makes them surmount all obstacles which makes them escape all dangers up to the moment which a wearied providence has marked as the rock of their impious fortunes   69.88037247340064
this caused so rapid and complete a diversion from the attack that d artagnan s adversary while the latter turned round to face this shower of blows sheathed his sword with the same precision and instead of an actor which he had nearly been became a spectator of the fight a part in which he acquitted himself with his usual impassiveness muttering nevertheless a plague upon these gascons   159.65413322518822
more rapidly than thought he darted down the rue matignon and thence to the avenue des champs élysées   220.11384909976985
well m   130.49303893569302
it was doubtless a miracle from heaven that notwithstanding her precautions there should be some trace some proof remaining to reveal the crime   43.2188252043848
cried felton   28.192222874317622
he could not refrain from admiring the severe beauty of his features the only defect or rather the principal quality of which was the pallor   26.987831942964675
there was something melancholy in this brazen voice pouring out its lamentations in the middle of the night   84.93646541493864
the king too who had listened in the greatest agony now breathed again   31.15671106851795
athos waved his hand raoul bowed and d artagnan and planchet set out   109.33819863080987
did you pass through the corso   137.7291556202609
1 with active links or immediate access to the full terms of the project gutenberg™ license   126.07209893055648
but since you say nothing remains but for m   98.7023907603091
on entering the house he had taken off his mask and imitation beard then mounting a staircase had opened a door and in a room lighted by a single lamp found himself face to face with a man seated behind a desk   94.46814901870829
have pity on me doctor   96.55125609423072
the only thing i recollect is that i awoke in bed in a round chamber the furniture of which was sumptuous and into which light only penetrated by an opening in the ceiling   21.730202190591243
the executioner raised himself on his elbow and gazed with a frightened air at the monk who became livid   107.2257587142847
and you will always love him   120.40863225093234
or rather you insult me continued she pressing with her stiffened hands the two arms of her easy chair and raising herself upon her wrists   95.00747249603546
well   59.34813720648248
you are free my brothers   38.07333834180267
dantès told him that the jug had fallen from his hands while he was drinking and the jailer went grumblingly to fetch another without giving himself the trouble to remove the fragments of the broken one   219.49597077148366
raoul stayed only a few minutes near them and then mingled with the group round madame de chevreuse   156.46072419299355
then he stepped into his coupé calm and smiling and was at home in five minutes   207.86450527177297
the letter is still to be seen for it is in franz d épinay s possession signed by me and with a postscript of m   73.61155265102373
hold sire said d artagnan they have just told the people that you are asleep   54.98833266423977
but here was an innocent man whose happiness he had destroyed   139.68922002510652
he received thirty sous per day and for a month he returned to his lodgings gay as a chaffinch and affable toward his master   140.69784242495405
i am perfectly aware of that fact answered monte cristo calmly   98.46815027617674
arrived at the end of the lane d artagnan turned to the left   127.16627029509658
you noticed that i didn t breathe a word as to the purpose of our visit   171.62146906010574
will not the count of monte cristo be here tonight   218.0939700360281
this noble entrance however in spite of its striking appearance and the graceful effect of the geraniums planted in the two vases as they waved their variegated leaves in the wind and charmed the eye with their scarlet bloom had fallen into utter disuse   115.85162554256334
every one arose   65.03972166423767
ah said he between his teeth is there truth in the proverb that fortune comes while one sleeps   107.87463179365322
himself my lord   177.2381432784236
the paralytic motioned yes   146.66891631621388
but who will say your excellency has been to monte cristo   199.98533684572635
well if you are cold planchet you can go into one of those cabarets that you see yonder and be in waiting for me at the door by six o clock in the morning   196.5573851623626
have you made inquiry   189.5677930492121
a letter addressed to monsieur de tréville captain of the musketeers   54.17685473327298
de morcerf has been my friend or rather my acquaintance during the last thirty years   85.95077653731457
d artagnan started off for saint germain followed by porthos   107.947329849996
haste to him and warn him cried the wounded man if he still lives   225.02256008912886
a family affair athos had invented the phrase family affair   148.56757142311739
villefort could lavish the tenderness some fathers do on their daughters   103.08993747184236
this knife was my only hope   157.23946252156887
at last he made his way through the mob which was continually increasing and getting more and more turbulent and reached the hotel   75.34637347310061
that signified as clear as daylight that he still intends to make me a baron   219.38597527893688
listen said she   110.4871032606202
that is what deceives you debray   99.90926338982979
that was d artagnan s road as he was going to the louvre   191.80857866881558
but don t attach any serious importance dear to what your father said   24.34271929449912
without reckoning mousqueton s wound for which i had to have the surgeon twice a day and who charged me double on account of that foolish mousqueton having allowed himself a ball in a part which people generally only show to an apothecary   138.6917414387959
but nevertheless he instinctively felt not to be despised   89.70333465457001
aramis in a black gown his head enveloped in a sort of round flat cap not much unlike a calotte was seated before an oblong table covered with rolls of paper and enormous volumes in folio   139.59096896932815
you will appear at this ball   120.5285122055879
and before you went to the bastile   105.60698350102184
then when the cardinal had ended alas sir   190.26489624511152
you are a woman of precaution i see my dear madame coquenard said porthos squeezing the hand of the procurator s wife tenderly   118.31386527307873
halloo   86.59634083758196
pray sir explain yourself said villefort more and more astonished i really do not understand you perfectly   4.069039910247426
but this woman is a friend of aramis i know nothing of that   191.86767702806245
at last as i seemed to cling to life i was ordered to the south   169.71491518455687
you can not think so dear love   81.1188982880864
will you now have the kindness to explain the nature of the statement which has displeased you   71.06681216773453
lord de winter is only her brother in law   59.973761277031635
and if you admit the efficacy of this sovereign balm you ought to be very easily consoled you the king of finance the focus of immeasurable power   102.16772957198118
why should i   110.37344479904668
take it and there ends the matter   141.71660770715147
yes said cromwell but the lord did not suffer that sacrifice to be accomplished   95.42138389062295
starvation   152.2466294788698
athos insults us   154.69260503179393
conclude then sir answered de chatillon with as much hauteur as aramis   158.89480080043242
d artagnan taking with him three trusses of straw returned to the chateau where everybody freezing with cold and more than half asleep envied the king the queen and the duke of orleans on their camp beds   74.01680822390352
his paleness terrified athos who however consented himself with saying that s a sad throw comrade   208.04956485703354
the quarters of the king were sometimes at estrée sometimes at jarrie   134.48800047792753
the old man s eyes beamed with an expression of gentle affection   98.1629122880933
come and see her and on her bed of agony entreat her pardon for having suspected her   80.75890928527399
and while he smiled as he attempted to regard the affair as a joke he felt his temples get moist with perspiration   165.44611866556505
then i should not have been an accomplice to thy death as i now am sweet beloved valentine   88.6505233750233
the fact is we do not lodge travellers indeed our tavern is so near the town that nobody would think of stopping here   185.69384513576108
said d artagnan   45.059868739053925
whitehall   195.2633306775509
it was only however by means of one of these senses that he could reveal the thoughts and feelings that still occupied his mind and the look by which he gave expression to his inner life was like the distant gleam of a candle which a traveller sees by night across some desert place and knows that a living being dwells beyond the silence and obscurity   71.34258775180407
she had profited by my absence and furnished with the half of the linen and having written down the day and hour at which i had deposited the child at the asylum had set off for paris and had reclaimed it   96.43202590675419
the former had no doubt finished his questions for a moment later he said good night and carelessly followed the same path taken by the first cavalier   101.98353040601052
so by way of getting out of the scrape i said ask morcerf   76.88173993612014
well since there is another finer and younger why you may take the old one   76.94355105085549
and not knowing how this strange apparition could have entered when he had bolted the doors he let fall his bunch of keys and remained motionless and stupefied   152.66262187675858
what i do know is that he is a creature of the cardinal his evil genius   104.70756382604098
where did he lodge   83.2194328527904
and what method of surveillance do you employ   83.05933649946203
advise me what i had better do   154.35615521560905
bartolomeo cavalcanti joyfully replied the italian   68.25891806549251
bertuccio appeared   149.03316850118068
yes said groslow bursting with his usual coarse laugh i know you frenchmen want nothing but cuts and bruises   109.12151431629873
i my lord said the latter i know a man who has rendered great services to a very popular prince and who would make an excellent leader of revolt   104.85732522667807
resumed porthos with a movement of the shoulders full of good fellowship   55.52263602333644
and yet if she were a man she would attempt all this and perhaps might succeed   143.38380161388494
yes sir   115.2926794470894
franz drew his handkerchief from his pocket and presented it to the man who had spoken to him   34.87483301676019
perhaps   101.62135094889695
there are moments when a man grows young again in his children   115.77457042675118
the inspector listened attentively   123.47846322149638
the wretches were dancing   195.14377487173186
villefort and d avrigny exchanged looks   116.1605793174509
he felt assured that the perfect indiscretion of his friend would duly inform him of all that happened   76.2306303267954
put back that weapon d artagnan   138.98000670423102
d artagnan struck the barrels with his hand and having ascertained that he spoke the truth pushed his lantern greatly to the captain s alarm into the interstices between the barrels and finding that there was nothing concealed in them come along he said   184.4104502021346
the gascon gave a last twirl to his mustache a last turn to his hair brushed from habit the brim of his hat with the sleeve of his doublet and went downstairs   1.5290994058989185
when you please monsieur said athos putting himself on guard   188.76021891068578
and have you never tried to understand them   105.82922746004557
yet you speak with calmness of the prospect of your being the wife of another   198.50982386256248
i have uttered it consumed with heat rolling on the stone floor of my prison   148.30993780314725
adieu gentlemen said de comminges   173.888654787555
you have saved my life and i thank you continued dantès   84.55969906164314
one of yours   159.12986613961797
5 where lord wilmore lived   110.4141203283873
he was wounded in his self love he thought that it was in his love   124.85635679118273
what   125.04441789267769
can not i serve you as a waiting maid   58.85593510180371
albert bowed to madame danglars and advanced towards madame de villefort whose lips opened as he approached   96.39087201152985
i have just had the pleasure replied the count   61.21662144460201
three months passed away then six more   137.55566694244243
they then took tea together after which they desired me to leave saying that they needed me no longer   167.35633646399023
italy sinbad the sailor chapter 32   128.04911976977465
it may be seen by these disastrous details that desolation reigned in the community   91.74635724048485
the guards are in the carriage and the officer is upstairs   89.64512468348957
answer then   78.00747627780507
ah continued my father still frowning their idolized emperor treated these madmen as they deserved   89.59231376902581
ah indeed   88.06863054303987
inquired the bandit with the air of a man who having committed an error is anxious to repair it   103.40908594139599
do so then for of all themes which you could choose that will be the most agreeable to her taste   151.59860379828476
well what do you wish me to do   101.03326443019188
but what did m   104.55914041669968
milady began to have doubts of the issue of this terrible duel in which her enemies showed as much perseverance as she did animosity   132.51453499231053
de servieux the king s chamberlain who is in high favor at court   254.3747400141498
not a whisper not a breath was heard in that vast assembly   183.8367595199839
you you   56.5944664168227
you do not know that every day of those fourteen years i renewed the vow of vengeance which i had made the first day   37.33427552984642
i recognize him   107.10824531520312
cucumetto fancied for a moment the young man was about to take her in his arms and fly   219.26644924627993
four   127.57667484316929
and she doubtless would succeed in involving him in the vengeance by which she hoped to destroy the young musketeer   98.99592822984226
is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express himself so favorably of me   62.484576414393246
i sleep no longer monsieur   137.74036287955113
athos was meditating   72.19381234883494
provisions began to fail and whenever one of the prince de conti s generals wished to gain more influence he got up a little popular tumult which he put down again and thus for the moment gained a superiority over his colleagues   35.64371751543014
de villefort insignificant or else dictated by venal ambition   43.418175644154005
you disturb you agitate the people who live in the castle   15.013333902372025
all i know relating to him is through busoni and himself   117.18805008079586
indeed said the receiver   173.606412675364
as these secrets may have an influence over your life these secrets must become mine   71.4262909651018
all right   74.82116833893608
said eugénie with sovereign contempt smoothing her gloves out one upon the other   129.39619589313838
replied caderousse   142.49188169542325
you see that i should be a fool to accept your offer   93.90791291289776
every door was opened to him   135.46119484756014
now continued aramis as the ladies did not see the singer come back and as he was found in the rue payenne with a great sword wound through his body it was supposed that i had accommodated him thus   74.0899056068377
it has its own effect upon the most incredulous   114.92995332727662
the comte de la fère   131.7670177634922
villefort looked at monte cristo with extreme amazement   137.5307518853328
what is it   111.74462204132232
that is exactly what i was going to say if your eminence had let me finish my sentence   73.9465593883265
the blood rose to her head and her little foot worked with impatience beneath her robe   84.18420611907294
let him come   59.045467249127114
i will show the gentlemen the door   216.35546899497874
it is a casket of wood bound with iron thought he   63.534582833899634
oh   181.5161779201132
but what brings you here   69.59861179379078
the old man again signified that it was a notary he desired   146.6266740785816
keep near me said the latter   120.91407586665062
this child was the only heir to lord de winter if lord de winter did not marry   63.916625791402126

decidedly athos you were born to be a general and the cardinal who fancies himself a great soldier is nothing beside you   144.60713905927665
that pale face and flaming glance appeared to villefort like a frightful apparition   28.444762586110173

said d artagnan   67.30691356038986
i have what is still better   26.950318349462506
peppino who cared little for being recognized now that he was in his own territories struck a light and lit a torch   101.77223166095835

the doctors anxious for my lungs had prescribed the air of naples   48.45773593816699
but gentlemen in all this said d artagnan we do not think of the queen   52.91746608949788
all paris was in expectation   152.34608841663933
then a rattling in his throat was heard and he lay down to die   79.20699333768587
d artagnan was radiant with joy and pride   123.91278835089216
if d artagnan forgets his host or appears to forget him under the pretense of not knowing where he has been carried we will not forget him and we know where he is   195.16031601107608

and has the unfortunate man wife or children   203.6666544637849
then monsieur de beaufort who was so familiar with the interior of the palais royal though he did not know the relations existing between the queen and the cardinal pictured to himself in his prison all that dramatic excitement which would ensue when the rumor should run from the minister s cabinet to the chamber of anne of austria monsieur de beaufort has escaped   93.55847884093038
a desert would not have been amiss said porthos   76.98480490814178
a council was called on the same evening but nothing transpired of what had been decided on   54.03540667310123
nothing nothing replied the priest   170.26515617642252
i have accustomed myself to regard you as my son well then to save my son i will sacrifice my life nay even my fortune   162.22392596153713
a tent was erected for them near that of the marshal   89.46249686527494
but thanks to the current of the stream and a fair wind his vessel passed so quickly that he had little more than a glimpse of her   101.49314739841478
on the contrary what can you mean   151.5157061631277
now sir said albert if you think my apology sufficient pray give me your hand   72.86180402665534
so saying he pulled out his own handkerchief likewise a very elegant handkerchief and of fine cambric though cambric was dear at the period but a handkerchief without embroidery and without arms only ornamented with a single cipher that of its proprietor   74.40814966315882

i did indeed   75.61693847511117
for the last year my faithful highlanders have fought for honor alone   242.78683258512058

eh pardieu   195.38117977946774

in the bastile one talks politics only with soldiers and jailers and you have not an idea my lord how little is known of what is going on by people of that sort   142.2986183791492
tell me mouston said porthos are my arms in good condition   164.06047896367775
this threatening answer unluckily for the court produced quite a different effect to that which was intended   109.14355116809112
in truth that italian puppet does not deserve the services of an honest man   62.51681040439668
danglars opened his enormous eyes on hearing this gigantic joke   152.639508320135
but your host behaves very well toward you as it appears my dear porthos said d artagnan directing the sick man s attention to the full stewpans and the empty bottles   144.74825158395163
degenerate world   207.11562891633778
in fact bazin curious to know what the mendicant could want with his master kept pace with him as well as he could and arrived almost at the same time he did   140.46064058731844
you have only to remain in paris for about a fortnight telling the world you are abandoned and relating the details of this desertion to your best friends who will soon spread the report   158.12878071901946
his conversation was a matter of fact without a single romance   63.96264769803364
oh very easily   198.40982605765052
you have obtained what you wish and we know all we desire to know   122.01249362686215
she is already late   118.28029294419922
news in prison is a fruit so rare that i trust monsieur de comminges you will excuse my impatience the more eager since you have given us to understand that the news is good   204.98105991102
ah he is one who fears neither god nor satan they say and would at any time run fifty leagues out of his course to do a poor devil a service   67.65563359853408
it is of that prisoner that i wish to speak to your grace replied felton   70.66208995737327
these were hours of recreation for me as i never saw anything in the dismal cavern but the gloomy countenances of the slaves and selim s fiery lance   135.19707146994682

besides mother remark how vivid his eye how raven black his hair and his brow though so pale is free from wrinkles he is not only vigorous but also young   84.84906006684861

once more danglars bit his lips   39.35686931920715
in short if i go will you go too   68.44317684707501
the person to whom you were conducted yesterday   12.018943191106516
do not question me said the prisoner   108.1303037652252
mercédès started   88.12500286218983
but not being able to stifle her she smiled upon her   94.64675447575772
i divined that you would become mine count replied morrel   108.60014464469258
porthos without reply retreated a second step   109.19155954851676
d artagnan was therefore served with miraculous celerity   108.885289932269
i am always prepared to go only as you know i never do go and perhaps shall go this time as little as before   216.31676839833477
i am seeking the count of monte cristo said the young man   48.71556337425325
the two gentlemen were exasperated   15.889775165823778
yes   37.270141092798724
what is he waiting for   170.52676526010873

go pray sir one word more my lord   146.79506783409806
at this moment and as villefort had arrived at the corner of the rue des conseils a man who seemed to have been waiting for him approached   83.72144382932764
incorruptible   5.140456601702198
this insolent boy chastises others cried he   39.467651056587414
m   66.60375793905551
asked beauchamp of château renaud   80.0810436081994
silence and fatigue together overcame d artagnan and sleep overtook him also   69.05337857562054
science loves eccentricities leaps and bounds trials of strength fancies if i may be allowed so to term them   172.79753744111227
this i do not comprehend   29.68169479821067
that is according to the sense you attach to the question sir   142.62947709356595
it is they who on the contrary overcome fate   146.49171526413244
in a turn of the hand she muffled him up in a flowered robe a large hood and a cloak   69.18688269280094
every evening he shuts himself in there   127.64156393475032
we are mad with hunger and thirst   189.7256105590347
but that which astonished him most was that the cardinal so deeply interested in preventing this young man from setting his foot in england had not succeeded in arresting him on the road   68.59752361885556
more than two thousand persons had assisted as at a spectacle in this fortunate but wild undertaking of the four friends an undertaking of which they were far from suspecting the real motive   78.27961993607212
the carriage pursued its way still going at a great pace till it dashed into paris and disappeared   248.78189778777931
is it not   187.62394500598015
do you absolutely think that the palais royal is the abode of gayety   154.50640460076858
all his limbs have become completely paralysed he has lost his voice also and we ourselves find much trouble in endeavoring to catch some fragments of his meaning   33.365223145566176
aramis alighted and clapped his hands three times   243.1352773113496
the parliament   152.94545584652744
really   114.05431574694587

capital   99.96241875755827
grimaud made a sign which meant that he didn t see what that had to do with him   154.70755779194994
see they are here   41.752009656136806
is it known why   118.66952762300006
the others are on the mantle piece of your excellency s bedroom   146.08584725614986
mazarin perceiving by the paleness and agitation of the messenger that he had something of importance to say made a sign that d artagnan and porthos should give place   146.4412155013195
each word that fell from his companion s lips seemed fraught with the mysteries of science as worthy of digging out as the gold and diamonds in the mines of guzerat and golconda which he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his earliest youth   17.823993504082722
athos my friend   82.95368443161388
but the travelers were firm and he was obliged to do as they wished   135.56407665839598
you have wounded me to the heart   220.66293500864612
but that ought to be visible   84.30826332402142
look at that large clumsy bed hung with such gloomy blood colored drapery   107.46573964120066
la carconte went to a cupboard and returned with an old leathern pocket book and a bag   61.063557253444465
bonacieux took place   71.8054249659481
m   34.68971415238023
therefore sir if you will agree henceforward we are friends until death   104.28670320932923
that night the adventure at auteuil was talked of everywhere   122.71747527114182
as porthos had foreseen the cavalcade produced a good effect   95.72746126980674
oh no sir she answered   172.89414137558438
the sergeant drew near to planchet   165.1851130751263
the poor child will be obliged to talk to you in italian which will give you but a very false idea of her powers of conversation   131.71247548967128
the duke however overcame all difficulties with a word his majesty s order   30.48165278322527
what the devil are you doing   127.52084896844016
one day it was the morning of the day my story begins the king louis xiv   98.67404259652719
at this moment and as though the utterance of villefort s wish had sufficed to effect its accomplishment a servant entered the room and whispered a few words in his ear   151.66945040213312
and the count de guiche follow urban and planchet   121.98714022141121
cried the stranger to his servant without checking the speed of his horse   81.06171046617334
dantès was alone in darkness and in silence cold as the shadows that he felt breathe on his burning forehead   293.43068822077646
i will say then monsieur quite short   77.96040900078748
now grimaud you come here climb up to the window again and tell us if mordaunt is alone and whether he is preparing to go out or go to bed   122.91304703198415
she extended her hands to him with a smile   170.6536042035035
i have therefore chosen this drawing room where you see smiling and happy in their magnificent frames your portrait mine my mother s and all sorts of rural landscapes and touching pastorals   142.69816165941353
i mistake my father intends giving a ball   54.949733620430926
and the young man went to the gangway   66.86685013771688
two eggs and some fruit composed my repast   83.6993635797782
it is a syllogism   157.87033327400485
she has ordered relays of horses   129.5329406616062
tréville was one of these latter   84.60933440546
said faria showing to the young man a slender stick about six inches long and much resembling the size of the handle of a fine painting brush to the end of which was tied by a piece of thread one of those cartilages of which the abbé had before spoken to dantès   46.52987404437029
i told him you were gone out and after some dispute he believed me and gave me this letter which he had brought with him already sealed   209.83973885829906
monsieur is a gascon   105.4055762871239
he gazed doubtfully wistfully on danglars and then caution supplanted generosity   178.30372089348725
no no my dear edmond my boy my son   229.22375245524597
you must set out for boulogne   6.485834643425136
we are alone sir said buckingham   64.33975755926039
ah   171.0028151095981
no   71.51825628557305
peppino turning around shouted a fowl for his excellency   78.6766999940788
i have proposed to you to marry not for your sake for indeed i did not think of you in the least at the moment you admire candor and will now be satisfied i hope   105.61281372611558
what do you think of the story chalais s esquire relates   62.077719143360284
no said porthos i expected some gentlemen of the neighborhood who have just sent me word they could not come   178.13780576674662
it was indeed mousqueton mousqueton as fat as a pig rolling about with rude health puffed out with good living who recognizing d artagnan and acting very differently from the hypocrite bazin slipped off his horse and approached the officer with his hat off so that the homage of the assembled crowd was turned toward this new sun which eclipsed the former luminary   106.74409218051406
he then began to ascend the path   99.64504718403643
de château renaud one of the best riders in france and m   27.18054169746837
thus we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition   83.6761748378515
you are then angry with us   95.03533718154222
oh pray do for heaven s sake tell us all about is he a vampire or a resuscitated corpse or what   197.48802727945207
albert poured himself out a glass of lacryma christi which he sipped at intervals muttering some unintelligible words   141.3630109994921
were the late cardinal richelieu alive he would tell you a certain story of the bastion saint gervais which we four with our four lackeys and twelve dead men held out against a whole army   70.09899609792814
the catalan watched him until caderousse almost overcome by this fresh assault on his senses rested or rather dropped his glass upon the table   189.70610765251627
what will happen then   72.48475920138014
help   117.38193906702261
the house was ready and the sloop which had arrived a week before lay at anchor in a small creek with her crew of six men who had observed all the requisite formalities and were ready again to put to sea   205.1066615820715
in an instant a space three feet long by two feet broad was cleared and dantès could see an oaken coffer bound with cut steel   107.02713405936191
well since the best motives are liable to misconstruction the queen saw in your refusal nothing but a refusal a distinct refusal she had also much to complain of you during the lifetime of the late cardinal   118.36075861849878
alarmed by the cries and gestures of the boatmen my horse sprang into the water   186.3021083571935
he inquired   130.974572161108
i am the friend of the great cardinal   81.07033921955383
i will obey your orders my lord   133.47180545663346
he will let you into the rooms in his tower said the curate   49.595210821142885
i will follow you   30.357332283487594
you must accomplish loyally the commission with which i deign to charge you and on that condition i pardon everything i forget everything   162.5069864082861
die   145.50455994780435
i do not think that is the case   56.44093041602906
another flash illuminated all around them   231.3370637612335
the young man bowed   164.10412000439098
20135m from the imperfect means franz had of judging he could only come to one conclusion that the person whom he was thus watching certainly belonged to no inferior station of life   111.69344442420474
so sick that he is dying and he wants to confess to the coadjutor who they say has power to remit great sins   122.75291116646582

the bourbons left him quietly enough at the catalans but napoleon returned a special levy was made and fernand was compelled to join   112.62305875972689
as the town clock of newcastle struck one the sleeper awoke and with all the gestures of a man rousing himself out of deep sleep he looked attentively about him   174.49968933689127
i am in your opinion a lara a manfred a lord ruthven   16.588709603828903
d artagnan took upon himself that more than difficult task   117.25046327429344
so remain a fisherman and contented with my friendship as i can not give you more   79.22129674983756
franz remarked while he gave these details that albert seemed to have something to ask of him but that he was unwilling to ask it   117.00497132601643
and he did not see raoul   97.94221296988074
and who found this father for you   47.23103849634438
let us save them half of their journey   36.18735964611358
pardon   118.65197257415674
in the name of heaven   44.2882526890706
the other of mature age seemed to have the former one under her charge and was cold dry and yellow the true type of a duenna or a devotee   144.0807918378271
now who was that someone   184.05627286199453

what the devil are you doing here count   110.88024634391827
true said monte cristo   105.25230828605218
at all events said milady seriously he has deceived me and from the moment he deceived me he merited death   116.24478425435883
i quit the world   131.20822494137744
he stammered edward   89.10864909259375
because like machiavelli i desired to alter the political face of italy and instead of allowing it to be split up into a quantity of petty principalities each held by some weak or tyrannical ruler i sought to form one large compact and powerful empire   132.59165432814288
i will come at once to the point   146.9047873540743
anthony a lovely face is exhibited which we would fain follow but from which we are separated by troops of fiends   10.460722300383765
moreover he is but a child said aramis   243.4801428899569
you will receive two hundred pistoles   78.23742412684143
he let go the rope and fell upon his feet without receiving any injury   262.6966218999073
not at all not at all replied d artagnan   105.06275132967787
your note of this morning has completely bewildered me   54.49132177347537
murmured the woman from her seat on the stairs mind what you are saying   66.53234573218685
the son of marie michon   113.49126443838131
at the end of some seconds two sharp taps were heard inside   194.44492721637695
a rondeau   170.8761503658706
i think i know what you want replied athos   70.32418663889361
but the gentle voice which usually has such power over me fails to convince me today   116.45596431847461
there go two miscreants   181.9836688537111
bring them here   101.94760300606828
yes   161.30335807287088
well they say that monsieur de beaufort is going to escape from vincennes if he has not done so already   64.58170883921213
the answer was so little like the one mercédès desired that she turned away to give vent to a sigh which sounded more like a groan   115.43797287986095
how long they did so nobody knows   173.329584914517
parbleu   293.3880822329209
asked the duke   149.81869994570985
monte cristo did not see this second manifestation of physical exhaustion   45.84759852974254
indeed almost before the door opened the scene changed   65.38741145802555
what are they   45.68804408067186
asked the latter are you going to be ill just now   110.79029773197982
stay where you are   76.153357497529
sulpice or from the rue du vieux colombier to the luxembourg   150.27302369434548
he wouldn t listen put his foot on the spur to get down the spur broke he fell with a broken leg and instead of keeping quiet took to crying out like a gallows bird   92.27243507432905
asked athos   162.71098539135826
asked maximilian   112.91785630625716
they are men who do nothing for nothing   130.94382296497517
you do not understand continued the inspector   56.9415426310827
i shall soon return said the banker to monte cristo   161.04732763620862
caderousse stammered out something while he wiped away the sweat that started to his brow   138.92022842436802
certes these fellows will all either be imprisoned or hanged thought the terrified d artagnan and i no doubt with them   161.20013039909517
the agitation of caderousse became extreme and large drops of perspiration rolled from his heated brow   304.28218063833094
he gallantly offered the right hand seat to beppo and sat by him   214.69274106089
the mendicant shook his head   10.899673669385038
what will it signify if one two or three more are added   109.17488719659787
do not disturb yourself on my account i beseech you   158.48835496236893
why do you ask me that   166.02982986028104
what do you say   169.32667517071735
chapter lxxxix   219.24211011939977
and you asked porthos haven t you still in your service your old lackey that good that brave that intelligent what then is his name   146.2963035089789
that s true said d artagnan then first thinking of the costume he found himself in that s true   129.12924245228095
20157m chapter 35   185.07215430929202
de tréville unwilling that it should be thought that he had influenced the wounded man requested m   208.29538280194237
it is a large sum of money but it is not a fortune   143.3359602718124
night came and with it the preparation for departure and these preparations served to conceal dantès agitation   146.32048792515587
cried milady looking at lord de winter with eyes almost starting from their sockets   33.794949392023085
when the procession reached the palace loud cries of long live their majesties   115.65832653280764
in this way do you see   80.70169528533904
think of my mother   151.25339912803432
but we are bound to say to the credit of our hero that the bad opinion entertained by m   34.90735868767996
monsieur laporte go to them and again recommend silence   47.72224326004047
then walking towards morrel he took his hand   111.7860732155816
the one that is most in use just at this time   166.5214686028899
is it then to mademoiselle valentine de villefort that you leave these 900 000 francs   139.03778287006187
and you include me in the expression everyone many thanks   57.05621223849388
indeed   61.37793980265665
chapter lxx   164.32943851831868
but who then was this man   88.44305975468137
it is a fire   29.453136905209476
allow me to give grimaud some indispensable orders   90.71838848491336
i drew my knife from my pocket again opened it and made ready to strike   132.2791897019288
upon his return to haydée he found her still very pale   16.83569577990238
wait a moment said the banker stopping the young man   149.36074720658388
women weep for the dead   142.61054409688828
it has cost me much trouble to find you but i had resolved on giving them into your hands and if i had to recommence my search it would occupy all the few remaining years of my life   211.11066264792913
cried he springing up is it really you   210.81643926325847
at half past ten an hour after the event   131.47340648928926
the other day it was barrois   53.09452633162969
he passed through several apartments of an elegance of which even the greatest nobles of france had not even an idea and arrived at length in a bedchamber which was at once a miracle of taste and of richness   95.10771201113096
who is this monsieur oliver cromwell   265.82491934312213
yes   179.1443164178287
there s no court now   74.4273260424315
the young man continued to advance following the sailors who chose a firm footing   62.67930391673978
the count had indeed just arrived but he was in his bath and had forbidden that anyone should be admitted   8.51340128220589
madame my friend du vallon is rich and has therefore nothing in the way of fortune to desire   180.88441464658928
and i must take care of it for him since i only lend him my name   3.0026331207273387
0081m you see said danglars addressing caderousse the turn things have taken   66.85255154028735
and above all mademoiselle danglars   268.2725516360558
do not allow it to escape   89.80629450409245
and you go into that house   74.96187848927985
and if you deceive us well it will be the worse for you   114.04539856320208
tell him that certain parties are grateful for the warning he has given   126.72880580881927
ah   122.93685711375944
has the law a memory for all those soft recollections you endeavor to recall   118.32590767122873
but pursued danglars with one of his sinister smiles an order for unlimited credit calls for something like caution on the part of the banker to whom that order is given   78.12082185263566
it is strange but neither do i recollect meeting with you observed valentine raising her beautiful eyes to the count   93.62128389967948
the duke fights against us   103.29216617305269
there was a brief pause during which louis xviii   195.05545785315832
let us hear what it is first   116.55252543163171
the young girl was very pensive but seeing luigi so cheerful she on her part assumed a smiling air which was natural to her when she was not excited or in a passion   7.468223114237546
tis indeed they   210.34632707401306
said debray advancing towards the back staircase   91.36874813803908
shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows and hid from the garden and court these two apartments the only rooms into which as they were on the ground floor the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate   198.70740508673316
at any rate murmured he if it be so much the better for i have made a rare acquisition   72.29838866626483
yes   13.543065824988616
but on the contrary and it is i who say it see enemies in all directions   154.02069141662554
charles leaning on a table was gazing at a medallion of his wife and daughter   135.19439239392418
fernand kneeling by her side took her hand and covered it with kisses that mercédès did not even feel   104.99930711911324
mouston replied porthos much affected should we ever see my castle of pierrefonds again you shall have as your own and for your descendants the vineyard that surrounds the farm   224.3376019736404
dantès perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father responded by a look of grateful pleasure   103.61421587995494
no   169.39602368684345
doubtless doubtless said morrel   68.58067598831144
they arrived in about an hour at the cemetery   61.000838440348545
ah   147.87667309398503
and even if it should fall into the hands of the cardinal we shall not be compromised   97.06385637459933
this celebrated woman fully understood the art of being dull with dignity   36.19601707160032
two hours afterwards madame danglars received a most flattering epistle from the count in which he entreated her to receive back her favorite dappled grays protesting that he could not endure the idea of making his entry into the parisian world of fashion with the knowledge that his splendid equipage had been obtained at the price of a lovely woman s regrets   18.05776559324326
franz stopped   54.48531647035852
he determined to cultivate the good will of the youth raoul and either whilst fencing with him or when out shooting to extract from his simplicity some information which would connect the athos of old times with the athos of the present   95.42325599443328
chapter lxxviii   29.262655391629863
it is the voice of of my husband   109.84874049318351
and d artagnan coughed   157.43686123821604
he could already see the intendant s beaming smile change to a contortion of grief   136.46355460275367
every criminal i condemn seems to me living evidence that i am not a hideous exception to the rest   19.405984181895832
he knows you better by your actions than your name   153.22777670051565
aramis went off at once begging athos not to remain alone within reach of d artagnan and porthos   96.49493338014065
yes said monte cristo   68.17688399546557
and will you direct us   118.84954880777556
let s be merciful to every sinner   137.50286027719807
when we went up to the enemy it was slowly   33.27817528591676
said d artagnan   156.42035938245274
the marriage feast chapter 6   137.89209715067489
if on the contrary he send me his ring it will be a sign that the emperor pardons him and i am to extinguish the match and leave the magazine untouched   29.25668932536442
the air he inhaled was no longer pure but thick and mephitic he was in prison   121.38241282755673
the countess made no reply   144.52791881656344
do not let that disturb you i have enough for two   156.6636123217813
said monte cristo   171.12406441990157
i am ready to obey your eminence   206.81926316150313
well valentine resumed maximilian i can only say again that you are right   116.30096921937611
her pretty face arrested my attention   45.437854856264636
meanwhile mousqueton continued on his way and crossing the pont neuf still driving the two sorry animals before him he reached the rue aux ours   115.93309933974012
cried grimaud whose face was covered with sweat at the bare idea of the evil results such a revelation might cause   60.38698219995711
i will accompany you   171.31759142735268
it is in my arms and shoulders answered porthos with gratified naivete   97.8822494554016
yes miserable wretch   253.96721603645224
as little sensitive as was the heart of d artagnan he was touched by this mute sorrow   55.38235885364706
go   55.65027689829888
besides added he lowering his voice and looking with a suppliant air at the cardinal let us give them apparent security   230.84487519628618
that little compliment could not fail to move d artagnan   206.6030913018282
he saw her get into her carriage and heard her order the coachman to drive to st   76.03016943749054
it seems as if i were listening to the story of a dream   174.2040954598798
the marshal thought this barrier not so well fortified as the others and determined to break through it   116.33535488515932
and matches   137.13725353519698
ah that is a different thing   96.19738590715046
on two occasions her fortune has failed her on two occasions she has found herself discovered and betrayed   71.75787026383375
the valet announced the vicomte albert de morcerf   159.7203859369474
the mistress of that fellow d artagnan   191.63433444004596
any alternate format must include the full project gutenberg™ license as specified in paragraph 1   191.67124720241165
i had often seen my noble patron annotating ancient volumes and eagerly searching amongst dusty family manuscripts   161.5292161795114
ho friend   92.56157658595535
his confidential valet appeared   133.5103493016087
have you provided yourself with money   146.58025786530013
nevertheless sir you see i have answered your first appeal although certainly the conversation must be much more painful for me than for you   108.697931390704
leave the box sir   152.20713759103023
i fancied it was so   224.92837659743435
no   117.63064657803734
athos who was of as high birth as the emperor and who inherits one estate which gives him the title of comte what is he to do with all those dignities the comte de la fere comte de bragelonne   38.570722485579154
be quiet porthos said d artagnan we are observed   123.07339031775386
the three friends uttered a cry of surprise   18.582509485778004
bonacieux entered   186.7756837506327
from an englishman called lord wilmore who takes the name of sinbad the sailor   169.74168773656226
every eye was turned towards the young man who spite of the agitation he could not but feel advanced with dignity and said in a firm voice i am he   168.08376796470984
and you have reason for she is much to be pitied   104.30256780474858
with more of mildness than severity   136.17726662132569
athos examined it and became very pale   51.868376572910094
grimaud bowed in thanks   59.92632177215459
he has about him a little of that foreign manner by which french persons recognize at first sight the italian or german nobleman   89.07274919884568
inquired valentine uneasily   151.34204789274855
i will go down   120.68137288524028
handsome certainly replied albert but not to my taste which i confess inclines to something softer gentler and more feminine   159.74068815619717
well suppose instead of joining this monsieur mordaunt we were to go and join our friends   119.04914898465512
well said the doctor after a moment s silence i will wait   184.9081498053724
oh the train is well laid   38.361411640540624
de tréville who had appreciated him at the first glance and who bore him a real affection never ceased recommending him to the king   118.4411926749542
delaunay   98.81115651636398
he is quite right returned beauchamp   169.11618988838768
ah ah   99.1738272234532
i had gone on the quay to match a piece of mulberry cloth when i met friend danglars   88.20707817088915
but it will be dark in the cellar   184.1917672560941
i only thought that a pretty mule makes sometimes as good an appearance as a horse and it seemed to me that by getting a pretty mule for mousqueton well agreed for a pretty mule said porthos   182.157181070174
so that at the end of two or three days they have in their power almost all the habitués of the establishment   115.78917720567995
she arose came to the table ate but little and drank only water   160.6056488504433
nevertheless they were still in a state of uncertainty   81.44370467559756
but you will not do so i hope   174.4942136606559
and he placed the bonds in his pocket book   17.986524588431777
well then said d artagnan gaily let us sell the diamond and say no more about it   215.8690553486005
impossible   145.6307811738893
richelieu still continued thinking rolling and unrolling the paper in his hands   120.86263899945361
and whither am i to go   48.39331278723249
e   126.91487465393303
the southern districts were ill watched in particular in consequence of the disturbances that were perpetually breaking out in avignon nîmes or uzès   43.84388979429879
we need no witnesses   91.42788574042177
why they induced general quesnel to go there and general quesnel who quitted his own house at nine o clock in the evening was found the next day in the seine   128.5815893590295
gracious heaven we are hesitating   123.96400033558163
day was now advanced   196.32900050006953
well then said the baroness if slave she be she has all the air and manner of a princess   127.85013561763363
the only thing that astonished d artagnan was that his friends had never thought of this   111.69596148319684
and faithful to the promise he had made he rushed out of the apartment   121.78984264716789
the old man remained motionless   96.4924009902683
20081m oh they are simple enough replied the host   75.45549726366582
pardieu   76.75844798741062
bonacieux with a half smile which was not exempt from a tinge of impatience   82.75865693004218
i never fancied men of his dark ponderous appearance singing with a voice like a woman s   37.321909794055614
my reason   173.32266486467225
my mother gave it him and as she did so looked whiter than the marble against which she leaned   168.70920080678866
and now gentlemen that s well continued the cardinal   93.94250672308121
he must be apprehended   144.5427786125181
20311m he came into the room went to the cupboard took out the bag and pocket book and both began for the third time to count their gold and bank notes   58.9111745575299
i will take a turn in the garden   49.13464097963701
honoré turned into the rue des bons enfants and stopped before a low door   103.9590954382802
andrea had not spoken without cause of the pretty rooms looking out upon the court of the bell hotel which with its triple galleries like those of a theatre with the jessamine and clematis twining round the light columns forms one of the prettiest entrances to an inn that you can imagine   50.96650569878288
but although her voice sweet full and sonorous vibrated as harmoniously and as affectingly as ever the door remained shut   198.9545960193379
i   130.08750148272674
and spurring on he plunged into the labyrinth of streets which led to his hotel situated near the marais for having for so long a time lived near the place royale lord de winter naturally returned to lodge near his ancient dwelling   13.444419421585408
i became weary of ranging fields and scaling walls and seriously alarmed at the idea suggested by you that if caught hovering about here your father would very likely have me sent to prison as a thief   96.83843567441767
and rising also he went off at a quick pace   94.77174593475056
seeing you constantly surrounded by musketeers of a very superb appearance and knowing that these musketeers belong to monsieur de tréville and were consequently enemies of the cardinal i thought that you and your friends while rendering justice to your poor queen would be pleased to play his eminence an ill turn   41.32261242800034
go   74.58960531306107

d artagnan offered his friend a part of his share which he should return when convenient   96.33420056097842
de boville s countenance yet he made an effort at self control and said sir i ought to tell you that in all probability you will not realize six per cent of this sum   99.20077737431075
and dantès required but a short trial of his beautiful craft to acknowledge that the genoese had not without reason attained their high reputation in the art of shipbuilding   103.67918960005295
oh aramis   149.74230077563598
the police   113.95462840600867
danglars make a speech at the chamber of deputies and at his wife s this evening i shall hear the tragedy of a peer of france   111.38658524391292
the magistrate trembled convulsively   119.51457708259355
but however near it may be replied d artagnan i can not go thither in this guise   71.56094871834205
speak on said aramis   31.167235484491584
20035m here is said the englishman taking a quantity of papers from his pocket an assignment of 200 000 francs to our house by m   42.01030081318527
for my part i shall go unarmed   152.34515011540245
and the two young girls whom everyone might have thought plunged in grief the one on her own account the other from interest in her friend burst out laughing as they cleared away every visible trace of the disorder which had naturally accompanied the preparations for their escape   195.74946466366458
but you tell me he is no more and therefore can have nothing to do with hatred or revenge so let all such feeling be buried with him   111.21021273114239
he took the money which athos offered to him and after turning and turning it over and over in his hands suddenly cried out that it was bad and that he would have him and his companions arrested as forgers   62.71468247201409
de monte cristo digging underneath these trees found neither skeleton nor chest because neither of them was there   205.67082202473486
perhaps god will pardon you but i never   125.69303137263388
it was politics which brought noirtier and m   63.277717222901195
she is not faithless   102.67080205292308
ah maximilian i experienced at that moment such remorse for my intention that throwing myself at his feet i exclaimed forgive me pray forgive me my dear grandfather   75.9316770834618
and i have such fear that it should fly away from me like a dream that i pant to make a reality of it   145.4447626269304
but at length d artagnan dropped his sword which was broken in two pieces by the blow of a stick   117.62976318877425
the salon was filled with the works of modern artists   85.5661046861053
if on the contrary resumed mazarin you accept your liberty why you my lord might take it away from us in less than five minutes afterward   83.89293092572223
why did you give him six pistoles   220.02354298926878
i do signified the old man   43.97839576165843
look there said maximilian laughing   47.08557511462804
do you remember sir that duel with the englishman in the inclosure des carmes   143.64178375972216
the tumult continued to increase and seemed to surround the palais royal entirely   58.30177141331382
bah said debray   106.77572068484623
he recollected that there was a small furnished house to let in the rue des saints pères where his mother would find a humble but decent lodging and thither he intended conducting the countess   94.95961688901377
i know it is a weakness said caderousse but it overpowers me   205.59983739975144
my lord my lord you invoke in your defense things which accuse you more strongly   115.71090049957886
and as the invitation was for september 1646 i couldn t accept it   172.11822661497968
then falling into a reverie she added however with an expression of joy ungrateful woman that i am for twenty years i have forgotten this man whom i ought to have made a marechal of france   266.0382800170676
hitherto i have repulsed them   25.131243848840555
as to lord de winter he descended the stairs rapidly and went straight to the port   114.70549209809937
because you think i am drunk   80.81709114830596
and you are afraid i shall be unhappy   101.72780032420675
you particularly wish it   121.8326137026785
yes   99.76398393022308
i won t be their dupe i will answer for it   204.07309362583436
for they thought the visit would not be limited to the one room and that at the same time they would obtain a view of the rest of the building of which monte cristo had created a palace   51.3082703896887
to have seen them both sitting at table together under an arbor at père pamphile s the evening before the day fixed for my wedding   131.0986605917472

below these lines were written in a strange hand the following in italian se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani alla sette il conte alberto avrà cessato di vivere   109.22587676027092
yours your own property   160.26898435969463
my mistress wishes much to be present at the trial   156.00633671233203
he saw valentine and his eye brightened   89.76769604813138
and you really mean to say   111.88672189770627
i believe that his only crime is to have at the same time the good fortune and the misfortune to be your husband   168.04216958078013
if she had not yet taken any repose he at least was already up   112.83818411467252
perhaps he may   234.29060993995859
it will be a stage similar to those we traveled from blois to paris   120.04572349126757
because while you were talking with him i watched you without listening to you   129.6255067692934
i used to learn all these feat by heart yonder down at pierrefonds and i have done all that he did except breaking a cord by the corrugation of my temples   156.70328354931684
the officer entered   1.3478735967593423
d artagnan and athos laughed aloud   130.62834943754453
everything points to the conclusion sire said the minister of police that death was not the result of suicide as we first believed but of assassination   89.75055874267093
asked mousqueton   148.01889539593228
how so   207.75474848787724
yes   103.86758925018681
oh   144.1739173611034
athos smiled when he saw their bare swords   149.60679564912448
high heads expose themselves from afar and the cardinal is longsighted   211.32556729091203
do you know who this pretended duchess is   129.74806191189896
then he added with a smile yet more terrible than his anger it is true then   290.454708363137
d avrigny reflected a moment   197.77571576349135
let us pretend not to notice that he is watching us   66.08907920546287
fly friends fly   170.18444037564706
taste that fowl and those fish   214.28734145361108
leave all to me   76.24001396795828
muster up all your courage then for never have you required it more   29.93974394252578
i have heard of these things every day during the last eight years and i can not understand them yet   26.642060449669174
bartholomew in 1572   117.49626061462727
at his right hand was placed the superior of the jesuits and on his left the curate of montdidier   94.02306255193056
then with a sigh poor haydée   143.9320056432916
just so   122.88921652584484
just so   165.9864473362683
but i have now ample cause to admit that your enthusiastic description of this wonderful man fell far short of his merits   52.34908916784157
de villefort monte cristo had paid his visit to the count of morcerf who in order to lose no time in responding to m   40.64794470060312
he is not so much of a devil as he appears   200.46744792146887
give him the despatch raoul   166.16319956045868
and now what are we to do and where do you wish me to conduct you   88.87787351196346
and in an open cabinet a collection of german pipes of chibouques with their amber mouth pieces ornamented with coral and of narghiles with their long tubes of morocco awaiting the caprice or the sympathy of the smokers   197.23096295739657
nor did a tear fall from his eyes after it was over   146.01691178621718
come and pass the night with me   108.0208543877323
as thou seest planchet said aramis whilst athos smiled on seeing what important rank was held in the city militia by the former comrade of mousqueton bazin and grimaud   74.26662139490954
the two interlocutors thus separated taking opposite directions at full gallop   131.61868698537884
come come said comminges who since d artagnan on the day of broussel s arrest had saved him from the hands of the parisians had entertained a real affection for him don t be unhappy   81.51806729970477
i leave you bearing a remembrance of you a remembrance of esteem which i hope will not be disagreeable to you when you know me better   147.22744016852658
i am bored   146.9406903575779
let us adjure him in the name of the god before whom he must perhaps appear to speak the truth   208.61947419130325
in prison sire   71.43576953826027
milady saw by the contraction of his countenance that the trigger was about to be pulled   102.3568764812354
bernouin seeing that his master did not return and hearing the stroke of midnight had made an examination of the orangery   151.86891843800421
felton was indeed behind the door and had not lost one word of this scene   138.65716387453278
say at once you disapprove of my proposal   16.01590026550747
what s the knot for   131.11840417982097
so preferring death to capture i accomplished the most astonishing deeds and which more than once showed me that the too great care we take of our bodies is the only obstacle to the success of those projects which require rapid decision and vigorous and determined execution   193.26414015703915
it must be so and i will not endeavor to prevent it   112.01245424285693
and the giant took up these two articles and without any apparent effort produced in them the metamorphoses suggested by his companion   179.79300345135434
the englishman and his companion are still here   182.9880712745022
noirtier i resolved to try one last means and for three months i have been giving him brucine   159.15644683748803
others filling the coach houses where the equipages encased and numbered appeared to have been installed for the last fifty years   87.73763802465034
yes his father replied the abbé   66.6545099193047
ah ah murmured he is dantès then a member of some carbonari society that his protector thus employs the collective form   82.44749286957787
useless   163.03310534730412
a garrison life is fatal even to the most aristocratic organization   103.78458803904022
and he mounted on the bench to try and get a sight of her   80.9325849545062
infamous task   175.75954134409042
well replied mazarin and am i not almost a king king indeed of france   42.20894288547855
at first sight nothing denoted the cardinal   103.7976104275448
chapter xvii   91.61980432411377
he returned to mousqueton but the steward had sold the last wisp   85.03594876997431
but monsieur de tréville is a skilled physiognomist who knows men at first sight   183.29413803449384
retreated if at all as a point of strategy and not from cowardice   127.70451623554996
soon the water rushes out of the scupper holes like a whale spouting the vessel gives a last groan spins round and round and disappears forming a vast whirlpool in the ocean and then all is over so that in five minutes nothing but the eye of god can see the vessel where she lies at the bottom of the sea   117.46051051897999
when the soldier saluted charles athos s heart bounded for joy   180.13186691119094
and when the trial is ended there will be no delay in putting the sentence into execution continued d artagnan   127.84459351760441
affairs of importance which you shall know later   123.79915728224107
florentin his valet thinks he is going to do the same   149.01194785094566
if you were to die i should die too   171.2861070314852
a burst of laughter from the auditors did not in the least disconcert the speaker who continued yes gentlemen   36.662204220827746
milady sprang out of bed   147.23424660416137
20335m i have the honor i presume of addressing m   105.13600080489516
caderousse s knife dark lantern bunch of keys and clothing excepting the waistcoat which could not be found were deposited at the registry   165.38675244151844
wife wife   171.4418811871024
he felt the blow and discharged a terrible look at d artagnan who responded by the most amiable expression that ever graced a human countenance   185.51399994618373
you are difficult to please viscount   189.43967760649576
it was a large cabinet close and stifling with the walls furnished with arms offensive and defensive and in which there was already a fire although it was scarcely the end of the month of september   126.25875039698235
and i said the marshal what am i to do   184.64740555070193
he is merely my father said albert m   106.30753783068758
he now determined not to begin the game with d artagnan till he knew completely all his adversary s cards   111.16695929188688
demand anything you want and i will hasten to have you furnished with it   230.92201299593125
i know the full importance of the statement i have just made and the disposition of the man to whom i have made it   229.69185347460296
ah replied he sighing that is not very surprising   223.0969175812035
they had understood each other without speaking   154.27944574496385
you are right madame said the king and i am ready to retire to my room when you have kissed me   184.21656109023837
tell him that our conversation at the inn of the red dovecot was overheard by these four men   60.22837308124201
undoubtedly   65.1085915820787
in the street of saint thomas du louvre they stopped at the barrier distinguished by the name of quinze vingts   37.98404881968462
all my sausages are gnawed   144.57769174452605
ah   126.2901533980843
but since you tell me to whom it is addressed tis useless to wait till then   68.03592179562384
such as is my supper it is yours to share if you will   62.73471034235753
20041m that was not enough for those latitudes said the englishman   69.81582558972829
to eat do you hear   132.14321503492192
in short what shall i say to you felton   160.59720044544542
and as they were really gentlemen they pronounced the host in the wrong   110.24998290542024
and when they hunt for him there he reappears suddenly at albano tivoli or la riccia   213.08986720188773
this last reason appeared convincing   25.31456958359118
no but reasonably hideous   123.17756180182315
it is a fine name to inscribe on my ledgers and my cashier was quite proud of it when i explained to him who the cavalcanti were   39.539616699101074
was the cry in every direction   145.9647401628632
how is it sir that you are acquainted with this man   68.88287449220854
but it must have vexed m   89.64090073435524
d épinay will be frightened at this pecuniary loss   83.51235797958532
i thank you equally for the service you have rendered me in being my seconds   218.85093134115726
who talks of dying   87.87316592406285
and now gentlemen said planchet who had not heard what they were saying what do you intend to do   137.73533085610018
twenty witnesses added he could attest the fact   153.07286967647028
you are strong among the strong mordaunt he said   110.46832004470431
a wax light placed on the mantle piece threw some of its pale rays without and a shadow was seen for one moment on the balcony   274.84507471037625
anne of austria was informed of it and concealed her uneasiness from every one   168.76062120340106
a retractation is always a serious thing you know   186.36769097095254
but this secret is not mine and i can not reveal it in this manner   124.98480435490511
the family had all retired to rest but villefort who alone remained up and worked till five o clock in the morning reviewing the last interrogatories made the night before by the examining magistrates compiling the depositions of the witnesses and putting the finishing stroke to the deed of accusation which was one of the most energetic and best conceived of any he had yet delivered   146.52904601518557
replied the duke   133.8978120137303
he had his foot upon it that is all   88.76717127563981
like myself he laid an emphasis on these words an ancient musketeer of the company of tréville   100.61616479670877
now sir said monte cristo addressing andrea make your confession   145.76460151949118
because after nightfall you are not safe fifty yards from the gates   125.96458568216968
and this morning she frightened me so that i thought her mad   166.60177097548953
i always said that d artagnan had the longest head of the four said athos who having uttered his opinion to which d artagnan replied with a bow immediately resumed his accustomed silence   77.74961722256185
asked he   118.25593138012141
why do you mingle a recollection of him with the affairs of today   153.3972026278783
i shall have nothing to fear but robbers   148.94098835243602
what do i see down there by the wall in the direction of the catalans   48.59575661466066
no madame replied d artagnan   191.18322021157547
i know it well   125.7381906504458
you will not touch the garden either   85.82141324129228
replied the englishman   186.95958485705998
and i too   124.44072641673772
on arriving at the king s private antechamber m   99.09517931708885
my only fear is the chance of dantès being released   235.68795897627305
porthos began to hope that the thing would take place at the present sitting and in that same locality   153.22302301665852
you have some   167.30052021485625
continued milady   63.59167436434018
but richelieu never came in this manner said the pertinacious boy   71.51378013420032
he has orders to do so   84.24221487140957
he sent for me to day   217.54880330356605
and edward who heard this great personage talked of for two whole days made all possible haste to come to him not from obedience to his mother or out of any feeling of gratitude to the count but from sheer curiosity and that some chance remark might give him the opportunity for making one of the impertinent speeches which made his mother say oh that naughty child   183.5179178826071
italian cigars are horrible   87.11626361206517
the abbess assigned her a chamber and had breakfast served   129.99749082428235
for you might learn it from others and upon a false account believe us to be in fault   127.92237353845363
but as there were all kinds of people about who were in a state of stupefaction at the unexpected arrival of the court he whispered in his friend s ear   122.94254816817559
but continued m   133.1412029926943
alas stammered villefort i do not lose a single word   118.91471042514966
but who was the man who brought him from lucca   121.07080732990157
i ask but one said the king   104.77924697285312
luigi vampa   5.120809646002556
the next moment d artagnan was on his way to notre dame   76.42686219556273
grimaud drew near and kissed it respectfully   181.14110660408815
ah   6.960289082457848
said buckingham   103.98726202936875
and your excellencies will do well not to think of that any longer   107.04634414600125
you will see replied monte cristo that they will be as different as possible in the hands of ali   136.13053677928875
i am alone said the abbé and i will again have pity on you and will let you escape at the risk of the fresh miseries my weakness may lead to if you tell me the truth   100.48907778602559
napoleon is the mahomet of the west and is worshipped by his commonplace but ambitious followers not only as a leader and lawgiver but also as the personification of equality   125.35210041018858
the window let at an exorbitant price which the count had doubtless wished to conceal from his guests was on the second floor of the great palace situated between the via del babuino and the monte pincio   162.634726757019
