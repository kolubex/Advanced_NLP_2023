however accept what i propose to you as an initiation into parisian life a life of politeness visiting and introductions   120.25223078148365
i will do my best said the innkeeper of the pont du gard shutting up his knife   106.04731826721877
monsieur has returned then   94.50981705392127
however his remark did not make madame de villefort even smile so much was every mind engaged and so solemn was the situation   70.13194716048991
but you were just speaking on a very interesting topic beauchamp   122.6427521411181
i knew nothing of this engagement of this love yet i her father forgive you for i see that your grief is real and deep   81.69002626581047
upon my word you did well to come back   92.1308026619092
oh good lord cried porthos what precautions for the study of theology   122.42182694464599
but will the person who shall accompany you afterward be a man or a woman   135.13873179874705
and you have succeeded exclaimed d avrigny   65.2458146132989
he recognized the place where he had awaked by the bed of heather that was there   116.2769605010447
lieutenant in the king s musketeers   120.19041015096587
for i saw god s justice placed in the hands of benedetto and should have thought it sacrilege to oppose the designs of providence   63.80765400462758
you can dispute together and that will pass away the time   32.16321606368834
they look like shipwrecked sailors who have not eaten for six weeks   156.35503033607463
he arose rushed out of the room and to the stairs exclaiming energetically julie julie emmanuel emmanuel   123.54884666315219
and what are they   95.5850403721251
at what time you please sir replied franz   190.81766859784835
but at length the two englishmen felt ashamed to draw back and the angrier one descended the five or six steps which led to the cellar and gave a kick against the door enough to split a wall   108.09659027688434
50245m the path was wide but dark   119.32735061049165
then suddenly bursting into laughter ah   94.79952426901542
under her apparent emotions her icy coolness never abandoned her   164.11945035071716
and the young man   125.74714695435287
edmond found some solace in these ideas   49.36266635025336
and he set his mind actively to work   113.37786655850486
at the corner of the street they met the count s steward who was awaiting his master   73.46881507820657
last evening   146.79278265264398
in these caves   93.05819677806537
he urged the horse again into a trot   67.96237956053898
morrel fell back in his chair his strength was failing him   132.6015028888582
but you do not know this man   133.71209292354254
but he had so long ceased to have any intercourse with the world that he looked upon himself as dead   113.91584210193992
i wished from curiosity to take these that i might be able to say that without any advice or preparation the house of danglars had paid me five millions without a minute s delay   129.52703583328343
but you will leave the city on your right   124.659860597261
he has i repeat the longest head of the four and for my part i declare that i will obey him   164.8783359197186
michael   108.09575113500179
a ball at this season   104.94017299008789
d artagnan my dear m   140.5466009048768
and yours   162.9505674996698
and he broke from the priests struggling and raving like a wild beast and striving desperately to break the cords that bound his hands   72.50808291769745
but it was his servant who this time put the letter in the post   85.50059002411489
five minutes afterwards the doors of the drawing room were thrown open and bertuccio appearing said with a violent effort the dinner waits   66.874964829171
but he who was addressed stood there stupefied bewildered stunned   109.88151531908622
30251m then you do not speculate   221.93450693770808
some of the men moved toward them   80.58487735331892
the casket passed around the table but it was more to examine the admirable emerald than to see the pills that it passed from hand to hand   118.34372700612006
porthos tried and passed the upper portion of his body through   234.373794116424
come along said caderousse   89.65685352813423
madame said the president may reference be made to the count of monte cristo who is now i believe in paris   218.1049183362138
i do not know the man who deserves being regretted during the whole life of another man   98.03312518084526
do these things concern me   142.81452451415487
so the invalid disappeared soon afterward and went into his sleeping room   110.07737852324777
yes if you really wish it said d artagnan and even with great pleasure i confess   125.46825518179809
messrs   66.41088062241221
i answered in greece   98.4040832762787
in the baroness s box i believe   91.83580113553779
but of what then does the equipment of your company consist monsieur porthos   163.0827570660969
what are you going to tell me   142.85654365908738
i am listening said la ramee leaning back in his armchair and raising his glass of madeira to his lips and winking his eye that he might see the sun through the rich liquid that he was about to taste   181.91822165779365
i bitterly reproach myself i assure you   58.98853294186137
i shall expect you then in half an hour baron and valentine will be ready   194.36540229250045
he was waiting for a woman continued tréville   46.958639072983985
how far is mazingarbe   46.14974407721543
he cried throwing down his knife   116.48867624047337
monseigneur will be with him in an hour   154.1665683036234
his guards taking him by the arms and coat collar forced him to rise and dragged him towards the steps that lead to the gate of the fortress while the police officer carrying a musket with fixed bayonet followed behind   125.71218617435738
albert placed the fresh bouquet in his button hole but he kept the faded one in his hand   66.4666488317666
he knows them then   99.70678235126041
at the end of a quarter of an hour a faltering footstep was heard and villefort appeared at the door of the apartment where d avrigny and morrel had been staying one absorbed in meditation the other in grief   151.4941279310416
de villefort talking to m   115.69292343523001
you knew him returned the inspector with a smile   138.24023815363375
i acknowledge i would have given anything to find it out   141.56148743133016
he thought it would be better to transact business with his old acquaintance so he sent for peppino   48.35473694587748
but then he had the woman he loved still remaining   141.73293542358343
for the first time an emotion of terror reminded her that she was a woman   60.335610479420566
yes i remember now your mentioning to me at perugia something of this sort   171.97258447170947
again repeated villefort   131.74964253667707
dantès followed him   144.04040948915838
said athos madame in the name of heaven whose empty glass is this   121.04781868016482
yes said d artagnan till she comes out   121.46808561635171
my name has been mentioned to you the comte de la fere   202.72640361977494
well what do you wish me to do for you   71.73978857344098
everything was in the same state   63.562330446638384
returned monte cristo that is a prejudice on your part m   97.3337653555809
sir my father is a man of great foresight and prudence   136.55429332280417
this separation which was no more than an unpleasant circumstance would have certainly become a cause of serious uneasiness if he had been able to guess by what unknown dangers he was surrounded   133.72233838281258
well i ll see i ll try to contrive some way said andrea   164.8706737636055
i have heard porthos speak of her that s all   183.79742025400813
but the comte de la fere had spoken and he had no thought but to obey   121.99747282483935
monsieur boisrenard   103.50850308076492
30323m what are you drinking dear grandmamma   139.07701081154323
it is as if they guessed what you wanted by your manner of ringing and made a point of keeping everything you can possibly desire in constant readiness   131.02497341630857
the ground is soaking wet   106.16643103856632
left alone the cardinal seated himself again and wrote a letter which he secured with his special seal   93.92928816926874
i mean because he wants petting   128.90412194984015
and he looked smilingly at aramis who looked at him with an expression of surprise   109.5029954732966
and then having no subject left for contemplation he shut his eyes and fell asleep   201.0447434641125
he had formed his resolution   179.0319082125141
unless i die i shall always be what i am and therefore it is that i utter the things you have never heard even from the mouths of kings for kings have need and other persons have fear of you   114.69772277319481
athos fell into a profound reverie and answered nothing   183.10392723682892
the major recovered his self possession   95.74063378935759
yes continued morrel death had entered that house twice within one month   121.86676019517681
d artagnan turned toward the musketeers and made a sign imperceptible to the crowd but very easily understood by that chosen regiment the flower of the army   46.89867617846632
and as they reached him he found himself in a condition to meet his engagements when the end of july came   176.1519891248011
did not the messenger say your father s safety depended upon it   37.11259584788738
it is said that we must not trust to the face   131.51711018039325
the curate rejoined planchet who was waiting for him on the stairs   133.01705752629357
was i a major   117.97558931792547
you are then going to a hotel that will be very dull for you   79.49001258551107
of what else should i speak   157.28384420974703
whispered mme   99.7230925301357
and monte cristo with an expression of majesty and sublimity advanced with arms folded toward the young man who involuntarily overcome by the commanding manner of this man recoiled a step   160.50291885524328
the palace of whitehall was guarded by three regiments of cavalry and by the fierce anxiety of cromwell who came and went or sent his generals or his agents continually   83.18183788425326
said caderousse crossing himself   101.95429620146477
in that quality i say what i please and at this moment it pleases me to say that you weary me   127.47955434555705
anne drew up as she always did when anything touched her pride   57.34848273001443
i monseigneur   68.23305474116475
and nothing more   75.65733180822387
and if he is not captured or killed he will endeavor to pass over into france to recruit soldiers and to refurnish himself with arms and money   159.24106474701958
what do you fear   158.9468625722708
the council of the musketeers chapter xlviii   128.65230233073748
and tell the confectioner that i will promise him my custom if he excels this time in his pies not only now but when i leave my prison   123.3236860564702
you are mistaken planchet replied d artagnan   118.92806780875122
as usual   89.2613383077351
you know i am waiting said monte cristo smiling   82.68443704527309
oh yes we sailors are like freemasons and recognize each other by signs   170.99490744685065
but at the street gate porthos was talking with the soldier on guard   18.692325739136393
d artagnan approached her with his usual gallantry   129.8432677428697
and added he with a smile she will take her own   97.95373995225813
i hoped your house would have been some other one than this   142.69530394566473
the president frowned imperceptibly   98.04755009456152
do me that honor my queen and i will find a messenger   147.68861689171652
oh yes yes i thank you with all my heart said valentine   149.41176922063585
demanded villefort   155.6033778841607
you will excuse this poor fellow madame he said as he preceded the baroness but his orders are precise and m   111.74836593825866
i forgot and he gave some orders in a low voice to one of the horsemen   113.31037555750308
said albert who still could not prevent an almost imperceptible cloud passing across his brow   83.15739893168919
but i am grateful i swear to you   48.02390273045643
since i became an abbé i dream of nothing but battles   99.00201786803589
crushed and impoverished by taxation imposed by mazarin whose avarice impelled him to grind them down to the very dust the people as the advocate general talon described it had nothing left to them except their souls   99.71658968988591
poor thing said villefort pressing her hand it was too severe for your strength for you were twice overwhelmed and yet well   100.39519450976503
it was you who rode off at the moment i had that unfortunate difference with the gentleman you speak of   102.92777295187238
said danglars laughing   70.98810435895759
now as at the moment in which d artagnan fixed his eyes upon the gentleman in the violet doublet the gentleman made one of his most knowing and profound remarks respecting the béarnese pony his two auditors laughed even louder than before and he himself though contrary to his custom allowed a pale smile if i may be allowed to use such an expression to stray over his countenance   117.90496546557708
and the king had reached in his jealousy of buckingham the point of not being jealous of anyone else   75.74130034084698
mazarin who was sitting at a table folding up papers as if he had only been a secretary of state looked up   61.36776569539594
the steamer soon disappeared and in an hour afterwards as the count had said was scarcely distinguishable in the horizon amidst the fogs of the night   187.64497661671967
i have told you that without being able to regain the complete exercise of my faculties i retained the sense of my danger   84.23846830404565
why replied he i think it just possible dantès may have been detected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as contraband   90.53583166449621
the two friends repaired to athos s and he faithful to his vow of not going out took upon him to order dinner to be brought to them   165.78721749990171
0103m it is a conspiracy then   115.62845998953941
ah that is just what i can not tell you   213.3126652785834
it was with him she agreed and not with me   165.84595729068164
danglars felt his own not to be very well supplied just then and gradually the man appeared less ugly the bread less black and the cheese more fresh while those dreadful vulgar onions recalled to his mind certain sauces and side dishes which his cook prepared in a very superior manner whenever he said monsieur deniseau let me have a nice little fricassee today   64.65939012124147
true i had forgotten that   105.8020663835673
and the mystifier appears to me to have the air of being a certain young gascon of my acquaintance   174.0372085195511
no doubt said aramis but it is far from here to the enemy   17.947484233851085
the coadjutor went to him and held out his hand   169.84932989742998
he venture himself amongst us to be hung   172.09792129377777
but all this will come to an end tréville will come to an end   195.0325904312674
the branches of the great trees in the garden of the count s house stood out boldly against the azure canopy of heaven which was studded with golden stars but where the last fleeting clouds of a vanishing storm yet lingered   139.39241456253643
and you have returned have you not   11.415120081538248
but with regard to myself who am traveling quietly with my own servant i have not the same reasons as you have to conceal my name   125.28761722810151
and what is your choice   137.34847562711252
the cardinal made an approving gesture and retraced his route with the same precautions he had used in coming   76.01011846962626
the tenth of your income that would be fine work   111.46175970189744
who has   38.58298841107687
whilst this scene was going on d artagnan remained with open mouth and a confused gaze   127.21504483065061
besides the letter from mr   114.77707017976712
people laugh outright they weep for joy here   149.8177142186672
my friend monsieur du vallon is of a very melancholy disposition so much so that one can scarcely get three words out of him all day   183.0137026854635
and what i have suffered said the young girl you shall never know my lord   134.22944614030186
seven o clock   106.5221315390724
i have seen him sleep with a sword suspended over his head   89.387617422134
but i cried morrel groaning with sorrow i love her   112.3387405013356
poor valentine   145.24698601911862
are you not married   124.38652396768182
ah that is true   122.4004869393789
my child is there   155.93091964041113
she moved forward   103.95305630191362
it has been in the family a very long while returned monte cristo a sort of treasure expressly forbidden to be touched for a certain period of years during which the accumulated interest has doubled the capital   93.38793305879358
andrea cavalcanti may appear to those who look at men s faces and figures as a very good specimen of his kind   120.7144923509735
no more theses no more glosses upon the fingers or upon benedictions hey   65.1159580219635
i am murdered   68.59231172835754
d artagnan arose   102.06983738832949
a paleness ran like a cloud over his dark skin but disappeared immediately   94.39003108407634
he was just taking one up and looking for the point to aim at on a little iron plate which served him as a target when his study door opened and baptistin entered   128.3305380998355
i do wish to ask your advice said madame danglars with anxious expectation   58.647771033957326
has monsieur bonacieux sent anything to you for his wife or for any other person   53.45828299765376
he will amass wealth he will injure the king s revenue and pay to himself the pensions which richelieu paid to others   108.42468540137126
the two prisoners a year after louis xviii   67.73409779477947
yes yes resumed de guiche   171.0665950387988
consider monsieur the thing is absolutely impossible   75.71991199361196
there is nothing to do now but fold the letter as i am doing and write upon it to the king s attorney and that s all settled   148.1039389747805
in fifteen days at most rochefort would be back   74.89772961063949
and the cardinal made him a sign with his hand to which bonacieux replied by bowing to the ground   76.8627040442951
you think then that you can help me more efficaciously than your brothers   87.53216873999399
stop what   219.310357062334
and i advise you not to take 25 000 francs for the profits of the voyage   122.40033053213334
then said mercédès i will lead the way   120.60538019150978
a case of cerebral congestion nothing more   1.7021731901213855
you great people always lose something by scandal notwithstanding your millions   153.04832811767207
let them come on   52.07030954991328
you mistake i understand you perfectly   105.18532418522057
and now said athos while they bring the wine tell me d artagnan what has become of the others come   117.97043284127336
why it is indeed a true royal jewel which is worth a thousand pistoles if it is worth a denier   89.14201295448592
but i like mine as well   75.38029087117357
some of your words are to me quite empty of meaning   166.46787879222836
everyone has not black slaves a princely retinue an arsenal of weapons that would do credit to an arabian fortress horses that cost six thousand francs apiece and greek mistresses   156.0920875792129
the prince de marsillac my old friend will recommend our young friend to madame de longueville who will give him a letter to her brother the prince who loves her too tenderly not to do what she wishes immediately   81.5018873411629
you will do as much as that will you   93.36906517105801
fernand s mind was made up   108.28624306799438
julie emmanuel and some of the servants ran up in alarm on hearing the cries of maximilian   102.60684059345749
but his opponent did not allow his guard to be broken   45.742990840861765
well then you wish to know if i am of mazarin s party   115.38839599414516
one of us went to him and invited him to the rue saint jacques where he would find some friends   96.03951655613332
felton said he   149.77632223908367
he despised flatterers but he appreciated enthusiasts   98.16546697758254
athos fixed upon a certain cahusac a favorite of the cardinal s   209.92725399622208
when he saw the formidable and chosen body with which louis xiii   96.4424823228888
it was a strange thing and one which made d artagnan tremble from the sole of his foot to the roots of his hair to find that this soft light this calm lamp enlightened a scene of fearful disorder   3.8452254628609097
we are going in order to win it to remain an hour in the bastion   130.32670130604484
mazarin returned pale and evidently thoughtful   168.19632486781947
he begged for another week which was granted to him   117.63570312501723
the attendant was at the door holding the cardinal s horse by the bridle   91.66986289041598
the nearest frontier is sixty leagues distant   114.2271359829862
well then why do you wish me to give up seeing such a man   163.02598093954248
and although it is generally with her husband s money that she procures herself this indulgence the gratitude for it seldom reverts to him   60.664363076348394
true i was a tailor till the trade fell off   67.74299744826706
the city grocer had ornamented the chambers with two hundred flambeaux of white wax a piece of luxury unheard of at that period   163.89556780698126
he must place his sister in one of these and we shall be in peace   54.51805599003871
chapter 73   92.19367206691453
at the last large door in the street   26.901721633467574
muttered porthos shaking his head never should i have thought this of him   77.21572275920983
we might be off during the time   134.06344384353037
the article having been read during the painful hush that followed a universal shudder pervaded the assembly and immediately the closest attention was given to the orator as he resumed his remarks   96.75433418500496
found himself opposite his house in the champs élysées   154.38119678042767
d artagnan followed but less nimbly showing plainly that this mode of ascent was not one to which he was accustomed   76.43220367293577
in a blue frock coat buttoned up close decorated with the legion of honor   87.51092089170571
why everything is relative answered the abbé   108.08789747234927
oh sir she said   160.51026732511335
morrel all the forms were got over   48.75560436385862
but d artagnan who had no longer a motive for staying so near the enemy abridged the testimonials of his gratitude   187.28144153094934
what these happy persons took for reality was but a dream   111.86403385922209
he held in his hand a tankard full of a dark substance and approaching the gleam of light shed by the lamp he uttered this single monosyllable oh   130.40886274294704
god has not cursed me then i cried since he permits me to save the life of a human creature in exchange for the life i have taken away   164.19813376076627
is he pleased with you   174.27043390835226
very well to morrow sir   33.777335366918635
why buy what one can take   21.90010608372937
danglars opened his bewildered eyes   114.94811336046128
besides i know what travelling is   63.1661047277327
did not you sentimentally inform me with that pretty mouth of yours so cruel to me today that you came to england solely for the pleasure of seeing me at your ease an enjoyment of which you told me you so sensibly felt the deprivation that you had risked everything for it seasickness tempest captivity   150.90455724808106
the executioner walked behind them and lord de winter d artagnan porthos and aramis walked behind the executioner   117.20488444597846
the name of edmond s betrothed was mercédès   123.6571337612738
athos played and that as a rule unfortunately   182.4122744332078
the prisoners are escaping   99.48479329033349
but this year continued the horticulturist i ll take care it shall not happen even if i should be forced to sit by the whole night to watch when the strawberries are ripe   95.10989279626112
the french way of living is utterly unknown to me and up to the present time i have followed the eastern customs which are entirely in contrast to the parisian   90.5218167914189
at the corner of the quai they encountered bazin who was running breathlessly   60.64441214630926
d artagnan began by making his most splendid toilet then returned to athos s and according to custom related everything to him   2.658729937014826
and maximilian morrel left the room with the baron de château renaud leaving monte cristo alone with morcerf   6.267429032685968
monte cristo closed his eyes and seemed again to experience all the sensations he had felt when the coarse canvas yet moist with the cold dews of death had touched his face   162.87230251709127
ah cowards   150.25149713384758
winter said the king do you believe in the fidelity of yours   8.902483010070284
then d artagnan trod on his foot and porthos began to understand that this was merely acting   164.43911616899345
no to the cardinal   9.09052411725132
and my father who you know is a strong minded man himself appeared deeply impressed   96.91051032277193
but the precaution was too late d artagnan had already recognized mme   87.74835439801993
the queen was ignorant where the mercer s young wife was but had promised to have her sought for   26.764026559114967
i may acknowledge this to a daughter whom i know to be philosophical enough to understand my indifference and not to impute it to me as a crime   133.028309960699
then only d artagnan remembered the languishing glances of kitty her constantly meeting him in the antechamber the corridor or on the stairs those touches of the hand every time she met him and her deep sighs   136.69224312591317
if those who remain of the troop persist in coming to the assault we will allow the besiegers to get as far as the ditch and then we will push down upon their heads that strip of wall which keeps its perpendicular by a miracle   84.99806770065544
i have no enmity against m   111.68157386870766
alas no monsieur replied the count   50.691091795573556
thou again   85.99325208966575
climb up said he to dantès   115.44652692388004
athos will set out two hours after by that of amiens   201.90375203426896
then she is dead   195.76961158494942
and as the man approached d artagnan in order to have more freedom for his actions leaned half out of the door   65.1445263183852
friquet   176.16644220797116
without giving himself time to reconsider his decision and indeed that he might not allow his thoughts to be distracted from his desperate resolution he bent over the appalling shroud opened it with the knife which faria had made drew the corpse from the sack and bore it along the tunnel to his own chamber laid it on his couch tied around its head the rag he wore at night around his own covered it with his counterpane once again kissed the ice cold brow and tried vainly to close the resisting eyes which glared horribly turned the head towards the wall so that the jailer might when he brought the evening meal believe that he was asleep as was his frequent custom   156.45948733425013
no but he has a very comfortable one all the same so they say   103.63296365528718
morrel said he do not forget what you have just seen   146.63260067557394
his firm sonorous and unexpected voice made everyone start   32.33890679215176
possessed with but one idea he cleared the last four steps with a bound and rushed into the kitchen where he saw the decanter about three parts empty still standing on the waiter where it had been left   97.56323687172905
alas yes murmured de winter   148.1959073507761
i mean that one word from you has enlightened me more than twenty years of slow experience   215.6070566663221
in the meantime follow debray s example and take a glass of sherry and a biscuit   62.62542127696567
this amused him sometimes a little and made him endure the siege with patience   100.05269008312355
monsieur olivain a lackey ought never to disobey said d artagnan sternly   111.08120425321103
what do you hope   131.08582868891904
i must have been mad to allow myself to be carried away so says she gazing into the glass which reflects back to her eyes the burning glance by which she appears to interrogate herself   120.1674929757306
they soon tired of the sport   130.05678907265386
here is one he said   125.92772531414043
oh he conceals them too little for you not to divine them   199.71053211923345
and the queen believes well what does the queen believe   89.72250034746975
in that case let us go said the shipmaster   90.40936487367733
he was to be back on the sixteenth day by eight o clock in the evening   41.77024838046022
cried raoul for it was in fact he who feeling himself pressed and almost crushed by a gigantic citizen pricked him with the point of his sword and sent him howling back   65.75532690298462
gaetano was not mistaken   107.59951182275837
he asked of franz   101.11832868372599
yes replied she trying to recover her self possession   113.06396439520839
be prudent   125.14016924846615
lions of roman crowns and which he will find on raising the twentieth ro   148.84505701460705
said d artagnan who had no doubt the accusation came from milady a woman branded by the justice of the country   120.82701066625148
monsieur returned maximilian raising the glass cover and respectfully kissing the silken purse this has touched the hand of a man who saved my father from suicide us from ruin and our name from shame and disgrace a man by whose matchless benevolence we poor children doomed to want and wretchedness can at present hear everyone envying our happy lot   94.83306134548918
oh said morrel i know not indeed if i may reveal this secret to mortal ears but fatality impels me necessity constrains me count morrel hesitated   178.57294713135525
an individual husband of any country is a pretty fair specimen of the whole race   120.54211017852124
you are too just and reasonable a man monsieur   122.78116616286208
asked harrison of d artagnan   176.72727759869122
i see no objection to that   137.23826807050537
certainly it was not the cardinal   178.30675276563153
he has punished you   113.54411902749138
more reason then when he spoke to you for sending him about his business   173.85844703451025
9 money and sanctity each in a moiety   85.60410322888653
so then he no more knew where aramis was than where athos and porthos were and the affair was becoming a matter of great perplexity when he fancied he heard a pane of glass break in his room window   99.8429822942067
and how dressed   144.3299403548981
he ought to aid you in your search   87.32649034311
the count s features displayed an expression of the most intense curiosity   179.08815580827164
and how have i broken that treaty your excellency   98.48145764096803
i say that he is ill informed   144.8280079063207
i love you i   203.8655838480453
he lifted up the drapery over the entrance to edward s room and his eye reaching as far as madame de villefort s apartment he beheld her extended lifeless on the floor   126.90531507908254
morrel made another step back staggering breathless crushed   119.64431178883247
he cried out and staggered against the wall like a drunken man then he hurried to the opening that led from the abbé s cell to his own and said i must be alone to think over all this   99.35031674927725
but his own private affairs had made no great progress either in love or fortune   73.28201113184474
this noise acted upon her joy like the storm which awakens the sleeper in the midst of a happy dream   115.69918705075916
yes my lord my mother replied the young man advancing into the room until he was face to face with lord de winter and crossing his arms   172.6570787901611
yes nothing more true   80.97120447509016
i was going out sir   115.10491900832477
if so depend on it you will be happy   114.82426852072149
valentine who understood sooner than anyone her grandfather s answer and who had often seen two scars upon his right arm drew back a few steps   134.31073012198894
cried monte cristo starting to his feet and seizing the two hands which morrel was raising towards heaven   159.81171943381727
instead of being knocked on the head as you would be if once they caught hold of you he is simply sentenced to be guillotined by which means too the amusements of the day are diversified and there is a spectacle to please every spectator   98.26096262580035
it was time for the jailer was coming   52.595994262354715
the young man s implacable eyes interrogated villefort who on his side glanced from noirtier to d avrigny   130.76654612523475
shall i see you   105.1173305372531
and that is the only reply you make   38.61734387495402
she reached her hand quickly to her bosom drew out a paper and held it toward athos   181.58660111274844
at ten o clock milady began to appear restless   111.94969459796366
this is an officer s cross   165.96994813448205
i know that such viands pass with difficulty through convent gratings   131.5863949240895
and how do you make your twelve thousand francs   154.1028291681086
no country can say it saw my birth   154.52239844366582
the citizens always took up arms readily against thieves wolves or scoundrels often against nobles or huguenots sometimes against the king but never against the cardinal or spain   135.00930349608436
misfortune is needed to bring to light the treasures of the human intellect   100.1578100812379
and the cardinal s spies brought bad news from every direction which greatly agitated the minister but was calmly received by the queen   177.4462873842645
and repeat often and loudly so that all may know it that the misfortunes of france are caused by mazarin her lover and her destroyer   119.18686094669415
madame du vallon was of doubtful gentility   142.6895998936493
only the king who was bored as always but perhaps a little more so in camp than elsewhere resolved to go incognito and spend the festival of st   117.75931720543737
the inspector asked if they had anything else to ask for   110.9699335882588
i must confess to you count said danglars that i have hitherto imagined myself acquainted with the degree of all the great fortunes of europe and still wealth such as yours has been wholly unknown to me   106.67171145882504
planchet watched the flight of flies   62.288258067605554
do you understand master benedetto   87.63238527072704
said maximilian in consternation   130.6725914758852
if she had committed two crimes i would say here m   80.25140343870761
in his impatience he arrived before the beginning of the performance   211.66191529658172
to your health   29.08291582559444
morrel who had himself assured him of his intention to dine at la réserve   119.26199328170456
she was told that he had left the castle an hour before on horseback   98.18711077261973
at all events it is best that he should follow us to athos s   125.30633476429158
when this was pressed to effect the opening of the cupboard of which the lock was difficult the person was pricked by this small point and died next day   38.940077692278734
here at least said athos pointing to the bastion they will not come and disturb us   71.07400191837496
i do not wish to be taken by surprise added the king   95.15629333621371
if you die i will die with you   83.25970465362093
and it was remarked that like the king she looked dull and even weary   86.75326133710354
as to you good sir you wear too magnificent a baldric to be strong on that head   248.72704590573028
i was wrong then no i said what you say there is a crisis at hand   79.0343635986381
buckingham saw by the expression of the young man s face what was passing in his mind and he smiled   94.37626156956898
the friends at ease with regard to the future did honor to the repast the remains of which were abandoned to mousqueton bazin planchet and grimaud   127.98972846788206
take care   34.69559315115855
wait your reverence there is a letter   105.89316706979284
and he folded her in his arms   140.54628256693152
a thousand thanks said the count your invitation is most gracious and i regret exceedingly that it is not in my power to accept it   35.33783006359411
he rings   75.62597692627492
he would have preferred an obstinate resistance on the part of the cardinal to this sudden yielding   125.73284393570044
and with all this how unassuming he is   87.52059948841665
he laid every action of his life before the almighty proposed tasks to accomplish and at the end of every prayer introduced the entreaty oftener addressed to man than to god forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us   119.80636167155018
when their hands touched he felt as though he should swoon   96.02766000802765
an illustrious person awaits you   62.61118339800293
indeed said louise i admire you and i could almost say respect you   157.41809865638868
the horses were also refreshed   109.99978122398988
no one has brought a letter monsieur replied planchet   39.86320568765717
call for me at eight o clock or shall i wait supper for you at seven   52.49913437765929
milady s robe was not the less stained with blood in a second   122.83998168724018
porthos as we have seen had a character exactly opposite to that of athos   61.80177947057011
then he approached a little piece of furniture made of rosewood which he had noticed at a previous visit   114.99044899071022
because all gentlemen are brothers because you are a gentleman because the kings of all countries are the first among gentlemen because the blind populace ungrateful and brutal always takes pleasure in pulling down what is above them   121.75664777207245
i gratify my wishes by two means my will and my money   155.3239773938931
fernand pale and trembling drew back like a traveller at the sight of a serpent and fell into a chair beside him   140.87964658874267
this jealous anger of milady was his revenge   59.497557154925694
forty thousand cried la carconte   110.08358635751324
i hope to see monsieur de chatillon whom i ve hated for a long time there   82.60357689897398
he was shown in directly   139.35028809635344
i am cold i am hungry   123.41027197613577
ah monsieur said mousqueton then you have come here only to awaken our regrets   104.79292969145602
good evening maximilian   63.92331568061537
oh i am sure of that   145.90178449857638
but that is not quite what i mean to ask you aramis replied athos   34.88563431452893
but don t touch me   150.48157585594433
but i can t be severe with him he is really so bright   0.901074823024075
now they begin to look concerned   117.10306466034635
remember madame if our god forbids falsehood he much more severely condemns suicide   130.68320648682501
was that all he said   78.94131806588571
i will even ask the count to keep it for my sake   98.39084249747812
whose will has been thwarted and spirits broken from the age of ten years beneath the iron rod so sternly held over me   238.72689171715837
well said he when franz had concluded what do you find to object to in all you have related   50.796506547121155
oh that is very simple   188.41146995944462
no replied he with an air of triumph which would have puzzled the most clever diviner   127.07583594955659
albert wrote to request me to come to the opera doubtless that i might be a witness to the insult he meant to offer you   133.55696853943266
consequently i have covered it with the veil of respect and hid it in the innermost recesses of my soul   56.28165142850582
and you say that one of your friends lives in that house   96.40094224255652
drums were beating in the streets and in the port   94.45803601322893
porthos unbuttoned his sleeve raised his shirt and looked complacently on his strong arm as large as the leg of any ordinary man   18.36667156057598
only grazed a little replied d artagnan   49.31813122919527
that will do very well said aramis   84.26491803804734
here excellency said peppino offering him a little blunt knife and a boxwood fork   142.47415535442434
and then his mind was made up when the jailer moved his bed and stooped to examine the opening he would kill him with his water jug   126.265931501795
do you aramis order the servants   101.66793827689906
but aramis after having blushed two or three times up to the whites of his eyes at the gross pleasantry of porthos begged his friends not to revert to the subject again declaring that if a single word more was said to him about it he would never again implore his cousins to interfere in such affairs   108.36523889065636
at midnight   102.73408945238967
we can find out his   150.02686535678146
having gained his room he raised his hand to his face and observing that his fingers were covered with the monarch s blood fell down insensible   80.96110436183338
yes that is true reverend sir   117.5907849185568
never answered de guiche   54.28556794410352
if he troubles me too much i will crush him the insect   99.16892576546692
you re in the wrong there   107.68373874534207
on a day of the carnival he had taken a notion to provide an unusual entertainment for that good town of which he was the life and soul   152.9640807781872
tis a long time since i saw thee   20.759240204012983
is this carriage for us   64.68681735708284
the same period was given to his creditors and the manner in which he intended spending their money   35.259400398444185
are you my friend   130.05869798069463
ah count i shall forget it   69.93086073307784
let us alight   159.16639477638682
ah my poor friend   118.83694191628024
this very night   92.9070662299161
now give me the cardinal up here   123.71508139021414
at the moment she entered the curtain of a small gallery which to that time had been closed was drawn and the pale face of the cardinal appeared he being dressed as a spanish cavalier   110.70315754322706
my poor brother was ignorant of this sentence   106.75212790885581
it is more than we need   106.06056759568749
it was very boldly written if disguised   84.8009351810013
said the procurator s wife slowly and sadly   38.91859864561491
but let us first settle the question as to its being the interest of anyone to hinder you from being captain of the pharaon   121.92457349759948
it was not difficult to understand that he had gained the crown of his ambition and that the silver mounted wand he brandished was in his eyes as honorable a distinction as the marshal s baton which condé threw or did not throw into the enemy s line of battle at fribourg   160.0731929170944
through the opening an arm was passed to find the fastening then a second   143.2862731751535
noirtier raised his eyes to heaven   134.82551092709525
you held her hand you were feeling her pulse and the second fit came on before you had turned towards me   118.65146021196844
madame danglars had often heard of the terror to which the magistrate alluded but without the evidence of her own eyesight she could never have believed that the sentiment had been carried so far   208.63827407363627
i can hold out no longer for i fear i shall be wanting in strength at the moment when i shall be forced to undergo the struggle and confess my faith   214.31665331902025
and your services well directed instead of leading you to ill might be very advantageous to you   65.34175350226333
maximilian crossed the canal and entered the rue meslay by the boulevards   121.16917142751377
well then said athos what are your schemes   117.57080352418888
de villefort who took her arm and led her into the drawing room   32.86004655506001
that is the reason which has induced you to leave via reggio where you have lived since the death of your wife   167.31907623490235
this new cargo was destined for the coast of the duchy of lucca and consisted almost entirely of havana cigars sherry and malaga wines   68.52138704275123
she will not rest contented beaten   179.29145156413904
he means replied the man upon his return that he got in that way   127.12016805549699
he related the manner in which he had become acquainted with valentine and how he had loved her and that valentine in her solitude and her misfortune had accepted the offer of his devotion   107.40597297360729
and have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor like that of dried orange peel   85.82150180332845
de tréville accompanied by the four young fellows directed his course toward the louvre   85.43914060180074
one thing alone frightened her   117.13971241708866
what is that madame   100.6399583101551
we have seen in what state of mind he listened to the murmurs from below which even reached him in his seclusion and to the guns the firing of which resounded through that room   154.14766663899965
and should you wish to see me again you must seek me at cairo bagdad or ispahan   149.33293211928344
and who said albert with a forced smile is to marry mademoiselle danglars instead of me which grieves me cruelly   58.35123236960252
when the shot was fired   75.87303867521416
suddenly the daylight began to fade away   70.35920852999932
and no steel traps   108.23912106056997
but might he not by this means destroy hopes far more important than the short lived satisfaction of his own curiosity   104.11342989791228
gondy dressed himself as an officer put on a felt cap with a red feather hung on a long sword buckled spurs to his boots wrapped himself in an ample cloak and followed the curate   64.55913056697246
certainly but you make me out better than i am dear count   99.64390640785874
but i feared to disturb you by presenting myself earlier at your apartments   156.4331036134122
the young man turned quickly round for this attack could not have come from the bastion which was hidden by the angle of the trench   74.70257812027108
must i tell you replied the duke on what i most reckon and what i determine to try first   118.5976997613814
have you anything to do with it   98.90739990121563
he has told you rightly   147.17666169614552
what is done is done   74.31488092036466
how will you prove continued the jesuit without allowing him time to speak that we ought to regret the world when we offer ourselves to god   134.1974411116417
that is a large sum   78.91878643938122
emmanuel and his wife conversed with natural astonishment in their little apartment in the rue meslay upon the three successive sudden and most unexpected catastrophes of morcerf danglars and villefort   108.46124657671191
d avrigny i should kill myself   93.01387408755961
his prediction was nearly fulfilled but in a very different way from that which de bassompierre supposed   151.54920138348885
bonacieux then became a mousetrap   106.22003289144376
thou hast become a horse stealer   59.925946017257175
ruined   32.90000576233459
faith it is franz and debray   68.14091513673571
valentine went to the door and called barrois   75.1965310251267
oh the good father the brave father the very honest father   66.03533429013345
well be it so let us not dispute about words   91.77848763592853
behind him blacker than the sea blacker than the sky rose phantom like the vast stone structure whose projecting crags seemed like arms extended to seize their prey and on the highest rock was a torch lighting two figures   127.43610016066792
the king s friend you understand   112.97025211339707
is there anything new in the wind   104.64273138488241
you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project gutenberg™ license when you share it without charge with others   81.79061883887624
at this moment the door opened and in walked the coadjutor   50.670133708027834
the king attacked in a manner so direct did not know what to answer   137.2911450926631
for if you have discovered nothing at least you have had the good sense to persevere in your suspicions   6.771563586129346
my english horse which has just disappeared amid a cloud of dust has furnished me with a living image of the fragility of the things of the earth   98.47964927223937
carried off   249.30922148225937
yes said porthos but there are the equipments   117.29739847400194
you are not convinced yet   123.16646177913377
but that does not affect the son   125.9575512516428
there is the half pistole   125.21731572000422
and the prince was pleased with you   91.55615652836889
there is your money the same sum as that you have received already   76.606647480761
it rests between his conscience and his god   139.987817087048
a man bringing a letter from oliver cromwell   149.80128348516695
as an interpreter of the law do honor to your profession by sacrificing your selfish interests to it   151.22103714476387
coquenard was served first then porthos   124.87070189419595
nor i nor i chorused the sailors   47.66484782407015
you are wrong   117.82896353253987
then just as i am arriving at the climax you defeat your own end and seek to make an ordinary man of me   171.72301936563878
do not breathe a word nor make the least sign to me or porthos said d artagnan to athos and aramis that you recognize this man for milady is not dead   137.77994483361056
i will run then till my legs no longer serve till my heart bursts in my bosom but i will arrive before they do   171.9722092509006
on arriving at the louvre lord de winter entered first   150.2034582820942
cried d artagnan driven to extremities biting his moustache   186.52883356565633
ah my time is not valuable replied the man with a melancholy smile   86.37136359455803
your feet too said grimaud   27.41425924186187
my weapons   111.62256294229762
a keeper   108.62965311585518
monsieur returned the inspector providence has changed this gigantic plan you advocate so warmly   93.48133147175784
and he rendered very important services to your father   142.49733895858665
upon this i went and complained to the governor who replied that i only had what i deserved and that it would teach me to insult honorable gentlemen who took up their abode in my house   106.96215422712096
but you need not fear   113.22386636625656
anne followed him with her eyes and as he withdrew at every step he took a disdainful smile was seen playing then gradually burst upon her lips   166.9927973155162
have you something to tell me   116.85908592138928
it was he who introduced himself to us   102.19321769654566
so they tell me monseigneur   138.16529138986527
at these words every sword was drawn and glittered in the air like lightning   106.96035184441301
this appeared to be a favorable opportunity to repair his intrusion   156.36357780644093
well dantès you do not thank me   89.59068139153332
de tréville opened and pointed the way to porthos and aramis who bore their comrade in their arms   146.08460329180406
but i do not know if it is feeling or the wind that makes me weep   71.76132152200653
but when at last the regiment separated penetrated the heart of the city and placed itself at the extremity of the rue saint christophe near the rue cocatrix in which broussel lived then friquet remembered that he had not had breakfast   107.19468180068378
as for you although we doctors can not divest our patients of nerves i fancy you have no further need of me than to recommend you not to allow your imagination to take too wide a field   153.3514088839538
wanted a discussion from which some light or other might break convinced as he was that the cardinal had some afterthought and was preparing for him one of those terrible surprises which his eminence was so skillful in getting up   127.2648723791573
meanwhile come along with us   129.5125540567054
but in a word what are you going to do   178.5181193135163
by turning to the left therefore he would find it   145.472293213865
replied milady   108.49512611556176
i have been told since that the garrison of the castle of yanina fatigued with long service here haydée cast a significant glance at monte cristo whose eyes had been riveted on her countenance during the whole course of her narrative   163.82935767026694
d artagnan frowned at him   68.5321396759498
bertuccio bowed respectfully and turned away sighing heavily   156.3831148988369
five thousand francs per month   138.78800174102878
my lord understands that there can be no supper unless he is allowed to be present   100.87159984536169
at length the escort passed through paris on the twenty third in the night   140.11735291199193
then turning round he perceived fernand who had fallen pale and trembling into his chair while caderousse stammered out the words of a drinking song   198.5819146255851
besides i know not why but he seemed to dislike seeing me   126.62985269374876
de monte cristo knows everybody   109.00379633338336
charmingly as you see   102.69034581749649
it ran as follows you know that i was a good mother since it was for my son s sake i became criminal   180.9214247835035
but are there not a thousand tortures by which a man may be made to suffer without society taking the least cognizance of them or offering him even the insufficient means of vengeance of which we have just spoken   147.36044637770286
but you are not the king my son and can never be so while they are alive   131.26143286767163
that means balls dinners and lawn parties without end in all of which i trust the count will remember us as he may depend upon it we shall him in our own humble entertainments   94.81131864574664
each examined the other with great attention while exchanging the customary compliments   81.77131465590949
in the shadow of a tent the former was awaiting him   107.47076424227672
what would you have proposed maximilian had you found me willing to accede   116.32739918029871
alas he exclaimed how can i restore the happiness i have taken away from these poor innocent creatures   184.5800393402537
monsieur is i am sure an honest man   46.391615511459605
the queen s famous diamond answered d artagnan with a sigh   66.58038369685038
it is because you have had faith   137.18837916708478
his nose though large was well proportioned   126.42607973152208
not crush that accursed race   124.20899883303169
the carriage went on and left the two men facing each other   130.01002632021905
and i sign my orders said mazarin taking a piece of paper and writing some lines   69.06286090388576
i dare say it is a pretty one   67.40225646600874
open it instantly sir monk   133.8689092571182
monte cristo watched and saw him approach the valet who drew a small sealed parcel from his pocket containing a newspaper and a letter   16.43612639475039
yes frankly and loyally replied the cardinal in the same tone   131.52661640751228
and has he found consolation   112.67187894401981
come in here monsieur chevalier said she   79.5961257021595
now gentlemen said he conduct me where you will   59.397303462167905
on perceiving him beauchamp stopped   143.2560422885481
i say there for as i did not consider my house safe enough or lawyers sufficiently discreet and as landed property carries evidence with it and moreover since you have no right to possess anything independent of your husband i have kept this sum now your whole fortune in a chest concealed under that closet and for greater security i myself concealed it there   166.33353734206338
silence d artagnan   24.887977478688512
when you arrive at the first step of the church of san giacomo be sure to fasten a knot of rose colored ribbons to the shoulder of your harlequin costume in order that you may be recognized   145.88814405404318
i have frequently seen shadows pass close to me approach and disappear   181.2392111563315
chapter 60   164.7326346004781
at the end of this time they had reached the thickest part of the forest   90.30726998833954
alas yes said milady   54.58364112917931
at midnight the two travelers were at dammartin but it was then too late to make inquiries the host of the cygne de la croix had gone to bed   71.31622308769202
the coadjutor has promised   116.53837048175832
this is what had happened   60.37952844285555
mercédès turned her eyes with an ineffable look towards heaven   100.64272154447556
but very likely i am on the road to it   77.96276741992796
faster faster   63.22060267205777
do you wish it known that you are interested about him monsieur le comte   16.182361440170823
how do you wish to occupy yourself during tea time   173.218500701366
this track soon disappeared   92.2384245425108
a bed my lord replied d artagnan   175.97002119837555
ten thousand devils   105.11246556672839
he calls me his dear monsieur said the mercer to himself   103.14743168852651
and yet milady at the same time detested and despised this weak fanatic   143.3060536480397
charles listened with marked attention passing over the insults noting the grievances and when hatred overflowed all bounds and the accuser turned executioner beforehand replying with a smile of lofty scorn   113.51481209713862
said porthos drawing himself up proudly   180.65278189512605
i have the misfortune also to admire his poetry exceedingly   46.71229541101374
it appeared light and well constructed   159.75510294655754
capital answered the mendicant   97.61316792927732
indeed you are adorable like that   136.1462002244868
we leave paris tomorrow   105.21025277287785
d artagnan now saw that affairs were growing worse and he beat the guard s march upon the door   162.856274379125
d artagnan pressed raoul s hand   180.25316024883028
besides the pleasure there is always remorse from the indulgence of our passions and after all what have you men to fear from all this   124.7241521813511
his soldiers formed a legion of devil may care fellows perfectly undisciplined toward all but himself   110.95440254811021
you are very fortunate my friend   115.32026979878233
he may be very famous at rome but i can assure you he is quite unknown at paris   107.66811817945073
yet on his arrival morrel did not utter a complaint or say one harsh word   69.56950525786766
planchet two hours before had asked his master for some dinner and he had answered him with the proverb he who sleeps dines   195.4080941761988
here was the officer d artagnan was seeking   168.27599493969007
oh replied caderousse did he know so little of his lovely betrothed   129.17218313653834
d artagnan shook his head and set off at full speed   77.97111613015466
on their way he confiscated the two magnificent beasts which were being sent to us and substituted these horrible animals   116.82200176727662
leave me then to act and have no fears for the result   71.26447670786126
but for my part before he could reach the good prelate i would kill vitry at once   95.90550455119447
but after a moment s silence he continued the president went up the steps after pushing his sword into his cane   34.38186272633554
the game was played in an inclosure called the little court of the chateau a place quite deserted except when monsieur de beaufort was playing   115.09582511443936
to the seine with the officer   27.71507952607682
and the government patiently awaits the day when it comes to say with a sneaking air that the track is lost   108.42918668991946
good all right said a voice almost lost in the distance   67.21825840793898
you may believe me if you will   126.97917944877715
it was exquisite sir   163.74540351505982
myriads of hoarse cries forming one vast uproar were heard mingled with guns firing   162.93746288497766
porthos whilst i get up watch the cardinal   87.70974073880349
the decorations of the boudoir had then been left entirely to madame danglars and lucien debray   100.249339099037
he tore the dress of the countess to pieces   81.90707634482317
at the hotel of said porthos   71.99872505174928
in that case my brave lieutenant let us leave milady to find out something else and go to supper   67.89258049326574
she howled as the hurricane howled   107.84519870219081
if all the prisoners followed your example the government would be ruined   163.67712096961674
he was right said luigi   84.50118789825824
now go down said the abbé folding his arms   39.75790221259622
albert instantly rose to meet him but franz remained in a manner spellbound on his chair   129.74633520159267
oh my beautiful sovereign a hundred times thanks   45.29908397690869
i beg pardon interrupted beauchamp   64.42364334714364
barrois asked mademoiselle valentine   208.0596979301601
truly my daughter replied he with a smile you are all you boast of being excepting one thing   109.39583209133977
cried de winter   53.297667449653225
at ten o clock the vessel cast anchor in the harbor of dover and at half past ten d artagnan placed his foot on english land crying here i am at last   101.67181374802807
from that lucky moment scarron led a happy life spending both income and principal   71.78715691673125
you and i will always consult upon our verdicts   142.6697190753601
and when will the dance begin   61.49628173114743
i know that is the coin in which you were paid for your poems   93.99478243506243
the story will be very long excellency   112.8344127464573
well then let us talk about it since you desire it replied aramis patiently   79.89368859228054
dead animosities   100.61022295598156
asked milady seizing both his hands and endeavoring to read with her eyes to the bottom of his heart   56.966014632669726
on a table in the next room were lighted candles cards two dice boxes and dice   117.92542797781083
i have an infernal spirit   178.90534775703412
debray reseated himself   60.68185493225416
in paris   175.68420305788894
it was cowardly i confess but it was not criminal   85.8317270578608
d artagnan ate in silence revolving in his mind the most audacious plans   131.27173287236837
and as at that moment all was silence in the old castle as nothing was heard but the eternal murmur of the waves that immense breaking of the ocean with her pure harmonious and powerful voice she began the first couplet of the psalm then in great favor with the puritans thou leavest thy servants lord to see if they be strong   68.38688525466695
that charming young woman with her is her daughter   92.90848795243707
my friend said he slowly i wish as the son of an ancient friend for i consider this story of the lost letter perfectly true i wish i say in order to repair the coldness you may have remarked in my reception of you to discover to you the secrets of our policy   175.96060065722102
you know that the english laws are inexorable on the abuse of marriage   148.6028910930736
de chevalier dessessart to admit d artagnan as a cadet in his company of guards   57.92955362875031
the other the physician   47.54803521174806
said he good advice advice of a friend   135.3612363256664
still there but i only speak of him in order that i may introduce the name of another man   138.6073206461274
i swear to you princess that if your reputation did not depend on precautions and if my life alone were jeopardized yes yes   114.35775624952551
if we had you my friends   96.5921156049482
chapter l   60.52364268055567
there was a moment of silence   143.5822895223468
heigho   119.26195536806475
they were assembled in council at the residence of athos which always indicated an event of some gravity   107.16766133219244
sir said villefort striving to struggle against this triple force and his own emotion sir you are deceived   68.88267585921454
oh heavens exclaimed monte cristo can my suspicions be correct   145.43077640624026
cried athos whose vision was still rather obscured by the uncertain shades and demi tints of daybreak   106.24933602342293
another might reply to your eminence that he had his pardon in his pocket   111.29333311590591
ah this marriage will never take place said beauchamp   121.29813490825771
yes and without violence said louise   144.0971420567225
things passed as on the night before   152.19572476155932
and through this corridor mazarin passed whenever he wished to visit anne of austria   84.34951838154174
taste of this   77.5965342776247
in the kitchen   115.84235136880356
saddled   114.89295842102003
at this moment the door opened and the young henrietta appeared   177.35032744872262
d artagnan walking and soliloquizing had arrived within a few steps of the hôtel d arguillon and in front of that hôtel perceived aramis chatting gaily with three gentlemen   133.8537260758518
what has passed between us concerns ourselves alone my lord replied d artagnan   98.95060167913843
cried a young voice that made athos start   185.38928490828465
do we breakfast or dine   119.54752836148056
the insult at the banker s door beauchamp stopped morcerf   120.94787597839178
i come to see you replied milady without knowing how much she aggravated by this reply the suspicions to which d artagnan s letter had given birth in the mind of her brother in law and only desiring to gain the good will of her auditor by a falsehood   101.23753971014467
then leaping down from his bed he went to the window and pulling aside the curtain tried to distinguish the figures outside but in vain   122.57785713191487
and prince cavalcanti sang with mademoiselle eugénie yesterday   142.21011702698326
to join the army under the prince count   193.66185121363412
for you know more than we do   110.61535735696322
anne it may be easily imagined how the relationship between aramis and a seamstress who called the queen her sister amused the young men   82.29244667518334
the number thirteen was always fatal to me   140.7893514429661
the ball struck the animal full in front   67.33997980589373
de winter remembered the monster that milady had been   66.68737980157064
for if my lord should be overtaken and caught there s every chance of his being brought back to prison whereas if i am caught the least that can befall me is to be hung   122.38893888362185
scarcely had they reached by the rue de la mule the iron gate of the place royale when they perceived three cavaliers d artagnan porthos and planchet the two former wrapped up in their military cloaks under which their swords were hidden and planchet his musket by his side   91.18877212545597
dantès drew back and gazed on the abbé with a sensation almost amounting to terror   95.36344801879812
tenacem propositi virum   112.61399008852479
but it is understood that what i offer you i offer him at the same time   52.56958842940799
monseigneur i feared i had incurred disgrace with your eminence   88.11933549808994
they then determined to depart   128.4900639763031
let us visit this one first added he   147.97539549238093
monsieur morrel   105.77714549642042
i learn this desire or rather i suspect that you feel it   133.1356450668078
in the meantime as we have said mazarin was in his closet putting his affairs in order   117.66741165733812
pardon pardon my officer and i will tell you all   91.28811958047352
my death will be much more eloquent than my life and the silence of the corpse will convince you much better than the words of the prisoner   130.78325726689758
stop but it is very strange oh my god my head swims   174.7506477850426
when the valet de chambre came in just now he told me of his arrival   100.55846025349425
for albert is brave resumed morrel   204.75163804754393
the young man recognized at the same instant the voices of his father and the chevalier d herblay   111.31348618312688
i have the honor to inform your majesty continued m   52.922664880325314
and he caused himself to be announced to the minister   178.65776219104544
i mean mercédès that you are thus harsh and cruel with me because you are expecting someone who is thus attired   157.49733961373627
this was quite out of the question especially to a man like andrea perfectly conversant with criminal matters   165.8390289389534
on what was d artagnan thinking that he strayed thus from his path gazing at the stars of heaven and sometimes sighing sometimes smiling   174.7955198260624
i know you well now said the executioner   155.96930623363852
said d artagnan whom anger began to take by the hair as minerva takes achilles in the iliad   66.82801228710281
our conditions said no revenge you will please to recollect   99.14451749807802
her voice prejudices her hearers in her favor   51.78668076798427
as he said this d artagnan gave a glance at parry who was standing in front of the king to show him that the news was meant for him   144.29380244031975
another rascal like himself perhaps his accomplice   112.19880376425628
you foolish fellow   130.1575564834483
the cry proceeded from the grotto   103.66000070334877
i have a great mind to return it   86.23707772914975
do you know him aramis   196.36102803505014
is he too a bragelonne   227.3963280423149
at this moment there was a tremendous clap of thunder accompanied by a flash of lightning so vivid that it quite eclipsed the light of the lamp   109.25672896924878
and i of speaking to baron danglars chevalier of the legion of honor and member of the chamber of deputies   65.54355886545252
at six leagues from marseilles after having eaten some of the lozenges he is accustomed to take he fell into such a deep sleep that it appeared to me unnatural   47.90253411977531
yes continued the young man   84.50673781377992
oh my dear d artagnan resumed aramis giving to his voice a slight tone of bitterness trust me   96.72676241074461
but bear in mind that should there fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the government you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence with rigorous punishment as it is known you belong to a suspected family   128.93506111133559
it is not natural for letters to enter people s houses in this manner   140.32959873892125
and i foresee plainly that if we don t kill each other i shall hereafter have much pleasure in your conversation   169.78844726703284
then turning towards monte cristo count said he in the name of all that is dear to you i entreat you not to kill albert   116.77888497549706
which was as we have related that his sword had been in his first conflict broken in two and which he had entirely forgotten   106.16370300558822
go out   85.23938130080285
but if he made allusion to me it was because he is ignorant of the relation in which i stand to you   173.59153996878234
but you say you have watched   152.11014868863373
such as the son of a noble house would have   90.08162171690549
but i still trust you will not esteem me the less for it and that is my object beyond all others   35.12721971201748
well for my part i shall go to bed said d artagnan   173.5377824874147
in england the post was well served   96.61902258364624
a plain and simple beggar as i have said my lord who asks for alms as he gives holy water   135.24965107665614
d artagnan looked at kitty for the second time   99.77135446197609
monte cristo bowed and left the house   107.68425227861069
i know too well the wisdom of the queen and that of her advisers to suppose that they will leave the capital long in trouble that may lead to a revolution   0.5339174080729805
the boat indeed seemed to be animated with almost human intelligence so promptly did it obey the slightest touch   122.31652914294379
besides mother why should you make up your mind that i am to be killed   67.26077326863894
and our hopes are thus far the only recompense we have for labors in comparison with which those of hercules were pygmean   166.66953298547568
i will warn them   230.03215414608337
in that case exclaimed athos let us not lose an instant but set off   107.03032798755207
on his side buckingham in pretending to maintain the honor of england was moved by interests exactly like those of the cardinal   121.94316262007351
but lose no time   139.55082969080718
go and rest   124.49767268715753
mordaunt bowed with a smile of triumphant ferocity   166.12563505769995
monte cristo although uninhabited yet serves occasionally as a refuge for the smugglers and pirates who come from corsica sardinia and africa and if it becomes known that we have been there we shall have to perform quarantine for six days on our return to leghorn   119.3135237257075
and by my troth i shall always remember those three nights with a certain pleasure   192.54911883980026
you may depend upon it he will repay you by some ill turn   97.9119239014961
perfectly true   144.04840006765681
his feeble eyes endeavored to distinguish objects and behind the bandit he saw a man enveloped in a cloak half lost in the shadow of a stone column   53.23047830943149
tomorrow you will be no more to me than a shadow or rather even you will no longer exist   169.4824776717153
had morrel even any suspicions so much kindness would have dispelled them   139.05444837490427
badly kept i own but still you must not calumniate it for that   66.54382641136866
an hour of terror elapsed for every spot they passed showed that they were on the road back   167.45495028066753
ah monsieur said planchet i will succeed or i will consent to be cut in quarters   165.09868916960815
he attributed it i believe to a political cause   73.82108832552169
my lord replied haydée i never will leave you for i am sure i could not exist without you   93.9207138039281
are you aware that the mob have even suggested throwing up barricades in the rue saint denis and the rue saint antoine   116.06439051350209
bertuccio and go first   104.70054146740867
linen and wine are both being warmed   162.31455144164346
cried both young men   101.42450578751749
at this instant a shudder passes over me as i reflect that possibly i am now standing on the very grave in which lies m   33.21247069263032
men of loyalty are scarce   191.32349648853048
chapter 115   122.83684845560384
thus dressed she scarcely appeared thirty five years of age   59.38346574060425
and the two young girls began to heap into a trunk all the things they thought they should require   40.929942491663
and taking the paper she tore it in four pieces and threw it into the middle of the room   93.5083308603711
yes my lord and i feel the whole responsibility of such a charge   116.82340028727089
some spy of the cardinal said de winter to him aside   104.69129446483606
and the musketeer with his usual coolness reseated himself before the remains of the breakfast   147.33997291900909
they are worth about fifty thousand pounds   147.96845742984902
let the irons be heated said the doctor   97.99549805615118
of madame de chevreuse   160.0464055532623
this evening   125.15255175045291
come your excellency the count added turning to franz here is luigi vampa who will himself express to you his deep regret at the mistake he has committed   183.95877797339458
all at once he uttered a terrible cry   110.10882809257535
ah my dear replied d artagnan upon that very horse i came to paris   164.63241720769128
when the operation was concluded and edmond felt that his chin was completely smooth and his hair reduced to its usual length he asked for a looking glass   77.70797315244806
julie hesitated   129.83991002838914
morrel understood it   132.09021740889403
and their captain see   94.06380491141317
police affairs   187.25485200438942
oh how happy you must be in not having either wife or children   82.6164932231411
yes madame replied villefort it is not only projected but arranged   43.428983413564254
to make madame in the name of the king and without prejudice to the respect which i have the honor to owe to your majesty a close examination into all your papers   68.98902723639428
and where is the messenger   101.32922545653015
i can my lord said raoul   118.61535668821877
40254m it is probable said albert   194.11831365801243
d artagnan recognized the cardinal   33.4696816039892
d artagnan will not have let slip an opportunity of drinking a glass of this liqueur and at the same time leaving some trace of himself   78.44884425744056
come beauchamp said château renaud i will bet anything you do not believe a word of all you have been telling us   158.90472081293126
he is not dead then   175.97831502686572
she had still four days before her   63.67944239988735
is there a convent at noisy   64.09287135172382
well my dear parry said he what is the matter and what can affect you in this manner   64.66372487511185
but said d artagnan it is the queen s diamond   200.48832914889232
oh i am guilty then   12.19489054070688
franz m   95.22936567451293
he continued to follow the path to the glade   55.85870177440127
the first available cardinal s hat seems to belong already to his noble brow   140.50554802481201
then he placed at the bottom of the valise belonging to the young man a small bag of louis called olivain the lackey who had followed him from blois and made him pack the valise under his own eyes watchful to see that everything should be put in which might be useful to a young man entering on his first campaign   69.12598605862834
how he stares at him the insolent dog   44.434956246652064
once taken they will be pressed   169.14356859790718
gondy had not walked a hundred steps ere he perceived the strange change which had been made in the streets of paris   114.82332722481829
poor madame du vallon   182.91771275968802
in a fortnight or three weeks time that is to say as fast as i can get there   127.07505089254339
for no one knew that edmond had given you this diamond and you might have kept it   116.07384733867089
but of course it is a secret and i am not so indiscreet as to ask it of you   67.71086757068997
for a long time a gun had been the young man s greatest ambition   67.46644446693338
le blanc was not a fast animal but he kept up an easy steady pace   71.04026723035014
you aramis why the devil did you ask me for a uniform when you would have been so much better in a cassock   186.40315537125747
at drake s or aaron s one pays twenty five lire for common days and thirty or thirty five lire a day more for sundays and feast days   95.07847630175323
if you refuse this right you may kill me but i shall not fight   74.8399129212976
as to you that is not my concern and i shall sup either with or without your permission   80.56639934380553
i shall give him a good dinner he will confide his son to my care i will promise to watch over him i shall let him follow in whatever path his folly may lead him and then i shall have done my part   44.629045699234666
and that mysterious staircase the passage through which not to disturb their sleep the doctor and nurse pass or even the father carrying the sleeping child   129.05308709671633
said the landlord   80.05721376229677
himself and the two young men represented the body of the army whilst olivain with his rifle upon his knee and his eyes upon the watch protected the rear   114.41745932129554
he led us to the park wall which we climbed over without accident and then we fell in with grimaud   182.17069916731145
and then falling upon the chair nearest the door she burst into a paroxysm of sobs   92.23852299994854
must i leave alone   166.8629911740216
for the next week you will not find a single tailor who would consent to sew six buttons on a waistcoat if you paid him a crown a piece for each button   74.37737770506922
since you interest yourself in my affairs i think it is now my turn to ask you some questions   97.21732576022467
do you think it possible to rouse that as well as provence   91.11913948004091
sebastian where i found a highly educated brigand chief perusing cæsar s commentaries and who deigned to leave off reading to inform me that unless the next morning before six o clock four thousand piastres were paid into his account at his banker s at a quarter past six i should have ceased to exist   130.76174121670059
this brother was my only friend   93.97184300924646
though all bowed before her as etiquette required she had now but a single arm on which she could lean   93.52344563168874
on the first floor   71.3861544098383
well and you said i offended the good god said la carconte with a horrid smile   40.85001204668585
non capisco do not understand was the reply   69.71403337707288
he immediately signalled it   79.22921295280736
it was not whether danglars or monte cristo was more or less guilty   30.291155608127937
i saw a white figure and as if to prevent my discrediting the testimony of only one of my senses i heard my glass removed the same which is there now on the table   113.07592846610588
one thought seemed incessantly to harass and distract his mind   88.53975969562673
i have warned you   121.77650561199584
none whatever   103.86429926829547
and remember moreover that it is often he who comes off victorious from the strife absolved of all crime in the eyes of the world   204.79977583393244
he was drawing in this circle geometrical lines and seemed as much absorbed in his problem as archimedes was when the soldier of marcellus slew him   98.19169173933261
at me   134.78330313941018
it is precisely to avoid that necessity that your father was sent for from lucca   58.33468171632151
now in my turn let me give you my instructions   67.4298948284342
and on what will you sleep   74.08823330669057
do you say so now mercédès   80.45407113930591
the truth is i m very sorry that i did not strangle him as you advised me said porthos   126.58663247871763
really villefort you surprise me   170.02525121113197
make inquiries albert but do not be angry without reason   117.79756165910253
dost thou know noisy well   117.72357945059319
she has a fruitful imagination and the second act of the comedy will not delay its steps after the first   113.4375756496219
it has so chanced that i met with a spaniard in my peregrinations who had seen many countries and among them the new world   74.49980933463688
appeared walking fast   24.23578778135642
but after all these arrangements he does not come himself said château renaud   128.0479781453259
and it is not yours   116.79834089522215
oh my lord said she why are you writing thus at such an hour   31.573343324861867
don t let it out at the hotel rambouillet   131.7658911938905
d artagnan finding a lantern on the deck took it up and with a pistol in his hand he said to the captain in english come being with the classic english oath the only english words he knew and so saying he descended to the lower deck   197.41426070767446
aramis returned laughing one hat on his head and the other in his hand   141.83833675999713
accordingly d artagnan on awaking found his breakfast waiting for him   93.64428059176498
gentlemen said he you have heard the comte de morcerf s defence   140.44222338883017
but shall i likewise return worthy of your love   97.08725471300991
he took with him several of his subordinates and amongst them dantès jailer   86.05895553093663
i am doing what is right   70.16581422055182
de tréville entered bringing a sealed packet   69.2607482261457
close by here monsieur replied the notary a little beyond passy   48.477760154080784
it was precisely similar to his sister s apartments except that for the breakfast parlor he had a billiard room where he received his friends   43.276235500097414
and yet in spite of the incertainty which the vapor of three or four bottles of burgundy carries with it to the brain d artagnan when awaking on the following morning had all the words of athos as present to his memory as if they then fell from his mouth they had been so impressed upon his mind   128.69186943723116
at that time it was believed that the separation of the musketeers and the guards would be but momentary the king holding his parliament that very day and proposing to set out the day after   122.72947739618162
but no one on board saw him and the vessel stood on another tack   82.88073607206692
he unfolded the paper presented it to the sergeant with one hand and with the other took a pistol from his holsters and cocked it   62.53916603187207
how do you know he had a packet to leave at porto ferrajo   58.283741939527026
a man with gray hair had thrown himself from the boat into the river and was swimming vigorously toward the person who was drowning   175.95432942393944
to answer you would be to acknowledge you as my judges and i only acknowledge you as my executioners   175.98436044732918
and advancing alone towards the sentry he said a few words to him in a low tone   56.336007571296314
he is not curious thought d artagnan   146.78861278106817
the particular characteristic of this was that more songs were made than cannons fired during its continuance   58.19389019434465
exclaimed the queen with a burst of gratitude   80.34159303559086
come come choose your part replied jussac   79.89426788858128
at this moment an officer with a pleasant face opened a door continued to exchange some words with a person in the next chamber and then came up to the prisoner   104.33825413227213
jesus   150.4971413594943
the soubrette said for your master   110.67058508750948
d artagnan d artagnan   179.00319277391526
as to the gentleman he resumed his place at the window and surveyed the crowd with a certain impatience evidently annoyed by their remaining undispersed   84.88391633603293
humann section of the indirect contributions corridor a   134.55798310544498
not only was he the elder but he had been presented to the prince by his father   117.60587060182479
no for that very resemblance affrights me   96.41082563358187
i married   98.96496660235233
the past that obscurity on the past   136.000955372064
but how pale you are   68.16985366158492
de wardes must take his departure still in obscurity   60.95095553153525
when once more alone gondy sent to summon all the curates with whom he had any connection to his house   205.33951700589796
27 guilbert de pixérécourt french dramatist 1773 1844   79.13375093534248
i am commissioned to seize your person sir said comminges in the same tone and with the same politeness   137.55420981633011
soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight at the entrance of the cave formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight which had found their way into this gloomy retreat   123.01783678038458
then that will make only 4 998 louis more said peppino with the same indifference   132.43138317343104
i swear it before heaven   126.87654575066323
all these women had been or were beautiful   103.56032387555759
is it by permission that he remains there   108.26661932477882
now let us return to your particular world   146.4637125138625
on tuesday all those who through want of money time or enthusiasm have not been to see the carnival before mingle in the gayety and contribute to the noise and excitement   79.5249067716727
these can not be for us said athos   94.76041495790957
it is not usual i say for such privileged and wealthy beings to waste their time in speculations on the state of society in philosophical reveries intended at best to console those whom fate has disinherited from the goods of this world   67.71690668124987
but you will save a husband to his wife a father to his children   167.64908069408062
in the examination which precedes ordination a thesis is always a requisite   76.70411527523393
one could have thought that he was undergoing the agonies preceding death   39.82341896437745
athos aramis and d artagnan surrounded bicarat and required him to surrender   84.95126004011743
but let us embark   80.03171393397477
madame de longueville was persuaded   96.53003110810417
as bertuccio with a respectful bow was moving away the count called him back   158.62642185730698
monte cristo gently laid his hand on the young girl s arm drew the velvet coverlet close to her throat and said with a paternal smile my child believe in my devotion to you as you believe in the goodness of providence and the love of maximilian   159.813314982014
the thoughts of your heart are fully understood by mine   99.78659600983214
it is the privilege of youth to believe and hope but old men see death more clearly   61.050010576347674
the slave of the count of monte cristo   110.55111905478729
it was d artagnan who was waiting for him   149.00650156286463
for on approaching nearer instead of one extended figure the young men discovered two   186.37218879931226
that s a daring rascal whispered the count   145.46158012366107
if they do not bring life we will give them death   115.13595779816609
well you will surrender the harnesses   112.79215991919352
richelieu who passed his life in warding off blows which were forever aimed at him   56.846516649024665
caderousse looked at him with amazement   129.0837835287264
true sir   132.1557938877975
to do justice to them who had condemned me they kept their word   70.82773262294992
i am at your orders   94.933202321522
i will get access to her without her suspecting me and when i catch my beauty i will strangle her   113.71097455896334
at this moment the bell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain for the second act   183.27568358068493
but there as he was alighting from his horse at the gate of the jolly miller without anyone host waiter or hostler coming to hold his stirrup or take his horse d artagnan spied though an open window on the ground floor a gentleman well made and of good carriage although of rather a stern countenance talking with two persons who appeared to listen to him with respect   107.75877539779735
i went to your house and they told me you were out but that they expected you home at ten o clock to breakfast   66.24967849074896
so allow me to salute your majesty and to tell you who i am and for what i am come   98.7478109524875
he placed the casket on the table   51.248826537928146
you have only to wait here till i release you   83.66810178354669
it is as i tell you   57.54830593452524
she then tried to seize the sword with her hands   100.81397825497486
said albert enraged beyond measure at beauchamp s last remark   123.32941601258
de la trémouille to interrogate him himself   51.45559986428112
i examined the thicket with my dark lantern   123.45681753178262
what do you think of all this   22.438979970844684
you asked the name of that young lady   111.10701698875529
and you would be pleased to have instead of this terrace of twenty feet an enclosure of two acres   78.55939002498548
they breakfasted in haste and at six o clock had already gone ten miles   138.24138562352306
the life of the four young men had become fraternal   67.97571516862995
the rest of the troop took to flight   124.00985028529368
you can sign it   123.13608831280351
exclaimed villefort in an agitated tone   117.37213946568039
he is waiting till your majesty is ready   140.4647233022687
good day penelon returned morrel who could not refrain from smiling through his tears where is the captain   115.07021979332868
i was a very insignificant person   123.20956365383101
nothing at all said groslow   173.20557827163339
who informed you this was the master i propose to you   142.79768515821425
oh ay   178.5100143576693
that s true said m   92.86398795969943
you understand now that if he were to get rid of the animal before the time named he would not only lose his bet but people would say he was afraid   116.51961993107982
thither mazarin went in his turn and found the two friends walking up and down   109.78055551730453
on perceiving athos aramis advanced toward him took him by the hand and presented him to scarron   156.74876834788336
oh this time returned aramis i haven t seen her   106.02022602295057
you are going already   115.77552262105182
if any harm come of it it should fall on the guilty person   169.2773603772669
i know them from having heard one of their friends monsieur d artagnan say a great deal about them   95.10495656271341
her name her name   197.10892371870528
before leaving the scaffold aramis had approached the opening where athos was concealed to tell him that he was about to make an attempt to gain another interview with the king   77.8612423881168
each one asked what strange influence had brought them to this house and yet astonished even uneasy though they were they still felt that they would not like to be absent   173.24955256389342
your kind attention in providing for the safety of the baroness by disposing of the horses does not seem to have made the least impression on her   97.14394535682675
i see you no longer i am dying help me   153.26697584015562
i will take him to his cell   63.48611798922173
yes my grandfather gave two thousand crowns for it as he once told me   145.12593869495814
but otherwise he has so little time to pass in paris and consequently to spare to us that we must entreat him to give us every instant he can call his own previous to his departure   142.52337051144016
cried porthos who had a great inclination to vent his ill humor on somebody   156.21502960186322
are you sir the chief of the people who brought me here   129.66150315392315
besides you must have something on the panels of your carriage to escape being searched by the custom house officers   142.01129636527938
so that for the sake of his master he puts us all under his feet and as he thinks we might refuse what he asked for he takes all he wants without asking at all   121.72308407484552
asked porthos warmly   79.56979831568759
your d artagnan   113.02824168411081
cucumetto placed his sentinels for the night and the bandits wrapped themselves in their cloaks and lay down before the fire   138.9937370384963
we are gentlemen   139.61942030683213
but this is a frightful abuse of power   70.9242248002783
but i do know his father lost sight of him for more than ten years   63.722763432846335
not another step he said or you are a dead man   142.08609350046333
are you sure said the queen doubtfully that you have not been forestalled   104.31034909402318
she spoke french with an elegance and a purity that left no doubt on that head   205.82625865116574
pardieu resumed the latter twisting his mustache look at me as long as you like my little gentleman   120.13212961176473
he even went so far as to show us the way out   79.44737612000225
if god were just you know how many would be punished who now escape   198.86170339856267
he left four days ago said d artagnan   42.329972733840776
thank god the queen is still of an age to give one   167.8501153585434
instead of that louise do you understand   127.66642637632125
but said porthos i think i have an idea in my turn   147.80292176274915
inquired château renaud   79.54010227435504
i am no acquaintance of m   84.22263423367266
i was accused of complicity and was condemned to remain in his place till he should be again a prisoner   127.99548354725589
buckingham looked at the young man haughtily   136.28710184913174
ah is that you d artagnan and you athos   54.84108264290082
father that woman was a monster   52.883635905654955
the term for which edmond had engaged to serve on board la jeune amélie having expired dantès took leave of the captain who at first tried all his powers of persuasion to induce him to remain as one of the crew but having been told the history of the legacy he ceased to importune him further   91.41375334977567
it is indeed a favor young man replied m   95.96465787436078
it is true that my patrimony will go to endow charitable institutions and my father will have deprived me of my lawful inheritance without any reason for doing so but i shall have the satisfaction of knowing that i have acted like a man of sense and feeling   186.00201966103853
true monsieur said mousqueton   82.99156081607397
the gate once closed and debray and the baroness alone in the court he asked what was the matter with you hermine   74.94902635458533
i m no thief but an honest citizen well off in the world with a house of my own   75.21984400898842
oh no monsieur   121.81992916938255
that s what his adversary met with   103.84868390296157
but said danglars there is still a sum of one hundred thousand francs   138.7110041410575
and without waiting for her reply he threw himself into the arms of the helvetian who received him with great coldness   95.17987425691862
thou hast prospered and grown stout   130.94221948253846
consequently the odd names of their adversaries were for them not only a matter of surprise but of annoyance   92.61238934961672
why was not m   109.92001059516822
but said danglars whose weak mind was at first quite overwhelmed with the weight of this pitiless logic marking evident premeditation and force of will what is your reason for this refusal eugénie   123.54883062805585
no excellency returned bertuccio   113.58808475868314
what shall i say to them by way of inducement to serve your eminence   109.06257230842216
however i shall have no occasion to work for the little sum of money buried by you and which i found in the place you mentioned will be sufficient to maintain me   154.2748100986728
for pity s sake said the executioner extending his arms   58.12629108780337
in hôtels that do not flourish everything is in confusion and the traveler is a victim to the embarrassments of his host   130.3318829846221
i thought it was for something else   141.3576721339315
yes to morrow   128.83898331101528
at the end of a quarter of an hour m   159.64563871850788
there is your jussac thrust paid for   124.95959419210251
it followed that d artagnan who was as yet purely and simply in the guards found himself for the time at least separated from his good friends athos porthos and aramis   133.2475303071129
said morrel as he went away may your new master love you as i loved you and be more fortunate than i have been   141.4654142356484
taste this cutlet my dear d artagnan   50.82546324693615
you can suppose porthos that what i have to say relates to most important matters   173.61373992541337
in this case however although the occasion of the entertainment was similar the company was strikingly dissimilar   98.5510274535543
comminges was near the queen who was questioning him upon the details of his expedition and every one was listening to his account when d artagnan and porthos were perceived at the door behind the cardinal   145.13087675651556
he questioned her with his eyes but the firm and steady gaze of the young girl controlled his look   92.94171462906561
i confess i had my fears in the state in which politics then were and i held my tongue   96.89274487785175
hold your tongue and take it   56.41901108676149
yes replied madame de villefort   117.42981828869537
this will teach you said d artagnan to treat the guests god sends you in a more courteous fashion   68.97837330949535
he had refrained from talking of the treasure which had brought upon the abbé the accusation of madness   141.39674398916844
political judgments are generally vain formalities for the same passions which give rise to the accusation ordain to the condemnation   139.04232194482253
you are right my love   119.1329918293468
i wish for nothing more   127.4145594846319
indeed returned the count motioning the two young men to sit down   118.57573505194084
certainly as he had himself owned the reputed son of major cavalcanti was a wilful fellow   84.65652198276847
but methinks i need wine   97.40185569875311
i beg you to understand sir i will go no farther unless you tell me whither you are taking me   98.05507813817034
de morcerf affect me   93.5827034390964
read it yourself and monte cristo passed a paper to albert   112.1076467788346
said the jailer   134.11970660198966
i have also sent for the procureur   103.6068217189721
will we not pay for our liberty with a single promise of silence   133.51416963629956
so that he is quite elated about it   91.14185406574127
i will answer for the success of a project which will reflect so much honor on m   69.35766243389742
that he had under his cloak a large white robe dotted with black tears death s heads and crossbones for in case of a surprise he was to pass for the phantom of the white lady who as all the world knows appears at the louvre every time any great event is impending   87.47206286770479
i will assist your memory madame continued the count   126.48686798209033
i am always curious to see the downfall of your honor s enemies and he was not among the least of them   73.24322700942159
i inquired immediately on my return to paris   149.09160870560325
i understand said the child with that jeering smile which marks especially the gamin de paris   98.80145911547525
it is i who no longer understand you madame said felton   72.64356870053436
then he passed into the dressing room which he examined   109.28633287975494
this short interval was sufficient to determine d artagnan on the part he was to take   120.9060580818205
it was caesar s commentaries which la ramee had lent him contrary to the orders of the governor   148.7808005450073
have you not read in my eyes that there is nothing but devotion and sympathy in my heart   147.46581665734834
ideas do not become extinct sire   100.07917215410211
one paragraph spoke of the return of bonaparte and promised another letter and further details on the arrival of the pharaon belonging to the shipbuilder morrel of marseilles whose captain was entirely devoted to the emperor   127.3825471696764
dantès made no reply   150.96483065849208
he then recollected that he had not eaten or drunk for four and twenty hours   87.56168656940395
what day do you fix   38.01661418133173
if you happen to have any debtors make them pay you or any creditors don t pay them   64.4286569885344
andrea had scarcely opened his eyes when his predominating idea presented itself and whispered in his ear that he had slept too long   153.96982691142293
if you heard the cry of mad dog   96.45796916757782
this was divided into three compartments one which was covered by the floor of that room in which athos porthos and aramis were to pass the night   117.7802419468115
fine counsel indeed   117.13781845519233
thomson french are perfectly solvent replied danglars with an almost mocking smile   114.96643726376051
yes madame said monte cristo   150.26652842160718
here s a sword and a dress said porthos   94.18548885876113
and as there could be no doubt but that the queen was leaving paris full of terrible projects of vengeance every one had warned parents and friends of what was about to transpire   73.48777422916137
withdraw young man cried jussac who doubtless by his gestures and the expression of his countenance had guessed d artagnan s design   164.39129890484318
oh plenty   191.11695550831996
porthos remained silent and motionless   67.81940522390573
he wore an air of melancholy dignity which dantès thanks to the imitative powers bestowed on him by nature easily acquired as well as that outward polish and politeness he had before been wanting in and which is seldom possessed except by those who have been placed in constant intercourse with persons of high birth and breeding   17.10724872436417
one evening as i was looking over the wall i saw a young and handsome woman who was walking alone in that garden which was not overlooked by any windows and i guessed that she was awaiting m   108.22432042781384
and don t forget said d artagnan to bring up four bottles of the same sort for the two english gentlemen   90.27858467772532
it is not he   111.99667376493349
the mercer had said that he was rich   75.94562597957628
oh then you were glad to hear that m   102.13958749335616
oh he laughed and in that singular manner so peculiar to himself half malicious half ferocious   77.03321644382035

the voice which indicated the real presence of a being in the room alarmed her so much that she feared to utter a syllable   125.1363610431844
the host fearful of consequences with the help of his servants carried the wounded man into the kitchen where some trifling attentions were bestowed upon him   147.44825636624736
very true said d artagnan fixing his eyes in spite of himself on the queen s diamond which mazarin wore on his finger   147.07781991780934
yes efficacious grace has touched you as that gentleman said just now   71.72886885435682

the count again refused   84.1711345965712
through what medium   93.84291283146217

yes said madame de villefort the door was towards the road before and on the day of my miraculous escape you brought me into the house from the road i remember   192.99825648558505
cried mercédès stretching out her arms to him from the balcony   95.71878546809289
she gradually approached the invalid and said then doubtless dear m   70.33328005467001
this was d artagnan s mount   73.50060516975242
monsieur d artagnan is not rich and has need of his position as lieutenant to enable him to live   106.30474175168186
but you have broken all the bottles   76.76572360150297
that two hours after the messenger has set out all the capuchins all the police all the black caps of the cardinal will know your letter by heart and you and your clever person will be arrested   189.75246723498805
was he in the wars   190.12788633173557
de la trémouille approached him and made him inhale some salts which recalled him to life   79.3130794821701
humph murmured athos it is certainly she   74.30547637580861
marie michon who made the most charming cavalier in the world pushed open the door put her head in and asked for hospitality   61.673652876650735
a negro   121.22523444669733
aramis said athos are you jesting   147.35400563217587

it was mousqueton   104.99552402601479
must i use any password to procure a horse   98.75121744222102
hardly had the police officer observed comminges at the end of the rue cocatrix when he said one word to the coachman who at once put his vehicle into motion and drove up before broussel s door   119.617684610621
why what good would it do   107.14998071879141
your thesis   135.35870399475738
the cardinal interrupted mazarin was a great politician and therein shone his vast superiority over me   40.85619865302735
they halted for a minute during which he strove to collect his thoughts   161.263452767996
all their countenances were melancholy and gloomy even the mild countenance of aramis   118.66819457032794
ideology chapter 49   59.14918763982628
as for me i will give my last sou for it   123.65248884832849
diavolaccio seeing himself thus favored by fortune burst into a loud laugh   86.15380961640764
it appears to me that this cavalier has made you very angry   87.30855460799674
how hot you look my good barrois said valentine   76.00205355305549
i shall look like some retired baker   73.84313595088632
order my lord he said   129.30558075428064
friends my lord   78.5538540758036

give me your horse porthos   104.06643629151235
cried the host in the most pitiable voice imaginable   158.10088069328364
but to this hireling valentine only appeared to sleep   80.48784819821279
scendi   112.656261023397
what does scandal signify to me   168.63262968068733
i confess i am accustomed to priests of a very different appearance   19.42058647434476
have you seen him   107.4979268158764
ready money is needful for the present time and we must learn how to make sacrifices   115.6451837029754
if i remember rightly it had another entrance and the courtyard was paved and empty   46.44089919193817
this fresh allusion to byron5 drew a smile to franz s countenance   116.33237071982714
albert followed him with the count   149.40588255646438
besides the name of the comtesse de winter which she had heard the abbess pronounce was wholly unknown to her and she was even ignorant that a woman had had so great and so fatal a share in the misfortune of her life   56.10977109959852
then the cardinal added a propos sire do not forget to tell her majesty the evening before the fête that you should like to see how her diamond studs become her   119.18267730345954
but this simplicity was according to the will of its master who positively ordered nothing to be altered outside   84.58492748857078
i had however as you see brought you the money in bright coin   147.34018944988472
inquired the englishman   122.59459215517435
ten minutes afterwards the surgeon and the procureur arrived the one accompanied by the porter the other by ali and were received by the abbé busoni who was praying by the side of the corpse   134.38351737299408
or solitary confinement   87.1700026501804
ali observed his master as the nubian entered the chamber you have frequently explained to me how more than commonly skilful you are in throwing the lasso have you not   74.67113297302727
good thought gondy she is going to yield   31.6055048921463
in the midst of all the strange events which had crowded one on the other an indefinable sentiment of dread had taken possession of valentine s mind   103.87936410141396
i don t conceal this from you   131.09961374239177
everything that your eminence may please to command me was the reply   127.70383530898516
who and what is this man   99.42125850436173
there was courage   73.55618021252931
de blacas had duly forwarded the brevet   150.92307266194035
but he wrote the name of buckingham on a piece of paper and everyone pointed out to him the way to the duke s hôtel   133.99698217830775
yes the wager   97.84105131411023
now by way of having a resting place during his excursions avoiding the wretched cookery which has been trying its best to poison me during the last four months while you have manfully resisted its effects for as many years and obtaining a bed on which it is possible to slumber monte cristo has furnished for himself a temporary abode where you first found him   81.16149265388864
d artagnan ran out and returned directly after   142.58211709527455
well i reply that you shall be served to the height of your wishes and that we shall see each other every day   104.32609706001139
noirtier s apartment and that of madame de saint méran and barrois never entered my mother in law s room   34.41628202228061
he went and resumed his post beginning to be rather uneasy at this silence and this solitude   92.67083696695833
the major passed his hand across his brow   142.87413963447452
asked tréville quietly   94.84287569463048
what would you   154.76075287304246
you are pale   132.72758544875393
these were pistols of an especial pattern which monte cristo had had made for target practice in his own room   121.67322343048012
you were among the first who tasted any of my dishes and i think you relished them tolerably   170.05129801506783
inquired the notary   126.80320824840989
you have no sister no son no father   129.95581411262145
you are going to see something curious added the gascon   124.65890809297042
villefort immediately rose from table and quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business   27.728284159801035
it was to that obedience i owe her portrait   137.13117039374433
exclaimed caderousse who by a last effort of intellect had followed the reading of the letter and instinctively comprehended all the misery which such a denunciation must entail   61.627800654016255
it was there wilmore had first met him and fought against him   109.70626441940908
0059m when one thinks said caderousse letting his hand drop on the paper there is here wherewithal to kill a man more sure than if we waited at the corner of a wood to assassinate him   38.37688241523729
monsieur d arminges who was at the door perceived his hesitation   100.35140058355316
go then take what guards you find here and pursue him   199.50152906506904
the count made a sign to albert and they bowed to the ladies and took their leave albert perfectly indifferent to mademoiselle danglars contempt monte cristo reiterating his advice to madame danglars on the prudence a banker s wife should exercise in providing for the future   122.9700805061446
a table was between him and d artagnan   139.4190347333398
go to him with this letter and make him your model in order that you may do as he has done   60.04612571382953
but without even giving himself the trouble to enter into any discussion with me he took one of his pistols laid it on his table day and night and said that at the first word that should be spoken to him about removing either within the house or out of it he would blow out the brains of the person who should be so imprudent as to meddle with a matter which only concerned himself   123.5083641543297
two men how do you mean   132.71511161886247
and one day after dinner he went to bed calling out that he had pains in his stomach and that mazarin had poisoned him   190.97944971580307
and immediately put spur to horse which set off along the rue saint honore with the speed of the whirlwind   76.82285625351275
but tell me said beauchamp what is life   108.76342275333424
a great tumult arose in the midst of which even the noise of thunder could not have been heard   73.6925062700405
it was a chestnut that the king had ridden for three years and of which he was very fond   148.234224792859
he led the enterprise   54.50344598826118
you know i hate moralizing except when it is done by athos   132.22929553280298
why did you deprive yourself of the merit of doing so at once   160.03512173502827
now then said cucumetto advancing towards the other bandits are you coming   129.7831990753733
there is but one   80.52126670019646
edmond gazed very earnestly at the mass of rocks which gave out all the variety of twilight colors from the brightest pink to the deepest blue   87.80622052407635
i do not know whether i ought to tell you what i suspect   95.00991270959395
dead   62.70584523360499
cried d artagnan quite stunned by the relation of this horrible adventure   50.85360295240738
when the landlady made her appearance she expressed much astonishment at seeing planchet   180.0410827381583
i was delighted to see you again and forgot for the moment that all happiness is fleeting   103.69682282253741
replied mordaunt in a tone of deep despair my penitence is sincere   135.0752033316017
they were parting to meet again when it pleased god and if it pleased god   121.35680489135203
and they both set forward as fast as they could toward the country house of the worthy functionary   55.41674086719498
said the incredulous soldier   149.00432092995993
germain presented itself to the mind of the presumptuous gascon   230.8558125749808
i shall complain to m   172.48300932582944
it was left on board   62.19497245869362
so for the last time steer to monte cristo   189.025661093653
i will i swear to you   120.58259492784089
then you will see   64.50095241853914
come along   92.2993580034659
de tréville on turning round found himself alone with the young man   123.11349221622058
i would die willingly for the king but supposing i happened to be killed on account of mazarin as your nephew came near being to day there could be nothing in paradise however well placed i might be there that could console me for it   141.33055124480427
he crept from his hole and stood hidden by the black drapery beneath the scaffold   167.13131370382757
it was evident that he was musing over this answer which did not seem very clear   85.09310117059239
the count looked around him   106.32204892824075
in short up to this period nothing had been wanting to tréville but opportunity   143.31279607651845
we must let them leave the village and ride after us on the northern road and when they have passed we will take the opposite direction   103.9675372719111
cried olivain   157.7474800832806
you extricated us from a great dilemma and we were on the point of inventing a very fantastic vehicle when your friendly invitation reached us   175.18708297351014
but just stretch out your hand   195.7089386044355
you will speak in italian said he   155.05972459119081
but no voice broke the stillness of the chamber and the door was opened only by villefort s valet who came to tell him that the travelling carriage was in readiness   84.44607646893971
pretty figures we shall cut on ponies while aramis and porthos caracole on their steeds   102.85763005935985
on entering the room noirtier s eyes met those of the abbé and no doubt he read some particular expression in them for he remained in the room   64.1298937635579
i do not see morrel   64.64942629061461
an hour afterward rochefort set out at a grand gallop   118.22866233372302
i am ready to speak my lord   61.05834121394074
you are tempting me you make me doubt the goodness of providence it is impossible it can not be   70.30248152962567
d artagnan inquired of everyone he met with went down to the ferry came up again by the rue de seine and the red cross   67.81549926356931
don t be in haste to celebrate a victory porthos interposed d artagnan   76.13654607630164
my father looked at his watch and paced up and down with a countenance expressive of the greatest anguish   181.70788358648898
he profited by this distraction to slip away among the crowd without even thanking the worthy priests who accompanied him   114.19190610934527
we shall find him extended on some lawn whence he will look at us with a languid eye and peradventure will not recognize us   169.4221063131074
so my dear bazin   52.688253019910356
yes said athos magnificent   89.48696127889876
pardon me and then tell me how i can risk my life to serve your grace   171.30359045672014
he is most likely at my hôtel   160.74815468423347
de villefort he said will you conduct the baroness danglars   118.23155555246768
that is it my son   100.34767739424763
notwithstanding all his inquiries respecting mme   163.74820424155905
said d artagnan wishing to have the air in the eyes of the citizen of being posted as to court affairs   106.6225688202442
father father in heaven s name exclaimed the young man what are these weapons for   89.44831968092844
a silence of death reigned in the cabin as in the pavilion   133.63182206670535
she has spoken to them   184.25308519937502
and the young girl jumped into the britzka which was admirably arranged for sleeping in without scarcely touching the step   35.621189943863385
cried dantès joyfully   40.43238963284632
in the first place that unfortunately your husband is a simpleton and a fool   134.03880545892855
the count frowned apparently in gloomy hesitation   40.5984201098216
middling   1.2108342056042858
athos asked of him in english   183.45209800053914
you are prudent which is still better   108.52542849724463
we expect it   26.19689599153999
my servants are examining the bodies   65.29978876040636
we have our clothes some more splendid than others this is our credit   87.41415005274186
you succeeded and then god snatched it from you and brought you to justice   114.31170615134249
your husband then is at last dead   182.6023161755159
demanded andrea   115.63361108588217
but allow me to say there is great danger in what you undertake   81.85738640325819
why don t we go in with them   131.65661982051313
i must return to my post   134.79866619174277
my intention was to enter him as a clerk in some ship and without letting him know anything of my plan to convey him some morning on board   63.33876884125471
monte cristo took albert into his study and pointing to a seat placed another for himself   89.49335394336278
after having lost my own horse nine against ten see how near i formed an idea of staking yours   98.11240222119896
danglars said edmond smiling i will say to you as mercédès said just now to caderousse do not give me a title which does not belong to me   202.26448447204046
if you deprive me of that take away my life also   88.09333567221124
but what do you advise then   150.6341703113823
because we want to know said de guiche haughtily   175.21483241819575
though you should awake and be ignorant where you are still do not fear   70.130743279586
then the count brought the taper to the window that it might be seen in the champs élysées that a man was getting out of the window while another held a light   95.01913823955495
exclaimed a general burst of voices   77.41316133789653
they had found the grasp of porthos pretty powerful and that it was no joke to fight against it   188.74325894064486
then i can well understand your indignation my dear albert   81.76299523554701
i shall do the same   154.48458679451264
but athos continued to march majestically whatever remarks his companions made   95.54071241636267
but it is not everything to be hungry one must find something to eat unless we browse on the grass like our horses ah   114.56592049472725
bonacieux where art thou   93.41025367171208
mother exclaimed albert just as madame danglars was descending the stairs let us reckon our riches if you please   101.11640996710426
never have i seen you look so young so beautiful   96.69930462022647
the sound of heavy steps was heard above his head   88.1067050014185
nevertheless bonacieux manifested real joy and advanced toward his wife with open arms   12.240635916868953
he wished to hasten their steps   102.7889278372375
you knew we were there and yet wished to kill your friend the chevalier   165.40688872367804
yes but your excellency will permit us to take all due precautions   136.17407619739265
de guise had who so nearly became king of france and whose cousin was emperor of germany   54.40393342226865
we are forbidden to shed your blood   89.78831316863042
and yet the two young people had never declared their affection   135.3598450373852
his parents are unknown   102.16755609655559
and the procureur again becoming a man lifted up his eyes and groaned   177.80298995223768
besides he did not wear a sword and the others treated him with small consideration   95.84559224129768
for you alone   80.38133050205357
it is sublime   162.06640934871237
one funeral is generally very much like another in this magnificent metropolis   137.6676951891087
then only she pretended to hear the sound of felton s steps and rising quick as thought she blushed as if ashamed of being surprised on her knees   169.7546594758595
don t allow anybody except one person to enter here   149.85582730942335
the lower one flew into pieces   138.90750305329124
for upon my honor you will kill me with your indifference   150.0296070881513
let me see with regard to porthos i received a letter from him too   164.26616220188845
tis an unfortunate year for kings said the mother   172.71545455662442
i am at home to nobody said milady   72.76490887588872
we have before stated that all the servants had fled   71.54257507869416
bonacieux to take twenty steps ahead and then followed them ready to execute the instructions of the noble and elegant minister of charles i   107.84116882085902
if i only were a a baron don t you mean   150.55974098975355
do you wish for anything   78.73954595610803
this was followed by rather an awkward silence   37.59953054047793
you see someone pays me a visit   109.7952128557622
i begin to think so particularly if you have not forgotten a certain signal   118.24230480408063
and here is danglars who is a wide awake clever deep fellow who will prove to you that you are wrong   67.74872018657913
if it belongs to monsieur porthos i wish him joy   97.71114601787284
are you quite impervious to good advice   169.52874689993425
there was the evidence of the senses and ten thousand persons who came to corroborate the testimony   173.25757162043035
albert stood pale and motionless to hear what his mother would decide after she had finished reading this letter   140.3875735697325
you see said she when the lackey had gone out everything is ready   51.15772920177563
and you grimaud he said to his companion who had just come in after his round with d artagnan are you thirsty   151.48098372107347
i will be the avenger   69.69816959923929
that you are to be at no   3.6466780999694066
he couldn t understand visits of ceremony made under arms   107.01798642149095
i rely much on external impressions   102.82357981006395
she felt that a powerful and implacable hand seized her by the hair and dragged her away as irrevocably as fatality drags humanity   115.51660619307083
every one madame   110.74794816299278
thanks my brave lover   2.026383862822968
let us try and overtake this gentleman said raoul to olivain   176.49194244974956
in fact said athos this delay is not natural   152.23336321644152
de villefort so that no one could reach the sick room excepting through that of madame de villefort and little edward   128.5465188974685
a very respectable lady said aramis   88.74506314984427
i shall still continue to preserve the same respect toward m   159.42327004325554
come gentlemen said he they are beating the tattoo   124.61937460659516
at this moment a shot was fired and a ball passed through the hat of comminges and broke the arm of one of the guards   7.933766059661011
andrea cavalcanti a murderer a galley slave escaped a convict   156.66569983429613
the king turned upon his heel without reply and almost at the same instant the captain of the guards m   31.622510018051273
cried the cardinal i thought you were a gascon my friend   162.6308939064773
comminges knocked at the door at the same moment and friquet was waiting behind comminges until the door should be opened   132.5982474733302
madeleine was the daughter of m   57.9931155973695
when i am in the pulpit if by chance a pretty woman looks at me i look at her again if she smiles i smile too   73.93722834428576
and be my witness that i have done all that human power could do   161.88700336962472
and he thought that this was the moment for expressing the desire which he was not going to have made until the evening before the fête   75.60156011793225
there he found everything arranged in due order the accusation examination morrel s petition m   29.384654640948952
i am going to scold you   194.76068563964958
the people were shouting and running about with torches   88.77162282005203
i had the money with me   70.24656335253795
anne trembling with anger and scarlet with humiliation left the room shutting the door violently after her   109.3513259738198
that is you wish me to lay aside my ministerial functions to quit france and be an exile   119.12813941218451
we shall soon succeed in sending him to join his boon companions   105.99026806214923
he was in india with zaccone   74.24573637766986
the morcerfs are depending on this union   169.38135695629296
but morrel albert is your friend   86.52220254086934
we shall be safer there than in the doorway   95.83606432171955
the captain of the cardinal s guards   127.73669074958649
that s where we are   46.62171050710083
bonacieux and a convent was not impregnable   155.78313663314782
the more reason said mazarin   118.53925101967243
the villefort vault formed a square of white stones about twenty feet high   73.17401331724648
how soon can he be here   45.432327505054204
well what have i learned since   205.06260501646682
dear mother interposed renée you know very well it was agreed that all these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside   60.4959830851962
he calls that a language   135.34197682834017
there is now a truce and a conference   59.377305927608425
the witnesses thought he was dead but his adversary who knew he had not struck him offered him the assistance of his hand to rise   140.51683097637357
monsieur de chavigny the governor of vincennes waited upon the duke to request that he would amuse himself in some other way or that at all events if he drew likenesses he would not put mottoes underneath them   98.59041872551386
i shall strangle you both if you don t get out said porthos at last seizing mousqueton by the throat   73.25219401020118
ah said madame de villefort why did he not take wine   55.586314806732574
and since when have you become afraid of a quarrel   135.3858841559922
au revoir not farewell   143.54657412823266
perhaps you would prefer being alone   109.41865880179635
and in virtue of that compact put to flight the police who had arrested your wife and has placed her beyond reach   100.93948824002605
lemonade was a very bad thing for him   84.7732258932665
remain here fasten the door inside and open it to nobody unless you hear three taps like this   145.3737126290228
he has opened an account with my house for his son   104.10975328348798
i will not admit that word returned the young man   123.78551495913842
rochefort knew well the tones of that soft voice in which sounded sometimes a sort of gentle lisp like the hissing of young vipers   175.00785550998557
well sir exclaimed mazarin what s the matter   118.80694496725616
the comte de la fere will not do you the honor of fighting with you   100.93759581783327
well then i will content myself with arresting you   116.30015675699676
villefort violently unbuttoned his greatcoat which seemed to strangle him and passing his livid hand across his forehead entered his study   44.78328510988713
everything degenerates   147.90503072837936
you have told me yourself madame that i have been drawn into a snare   106.54837069107884
valentine poured the orangeade into a glass and gave it to her grandmother with a certain degree of dread for it was the same glass she fancied that had been touched by the spectre   55.11043748382454
no for i think he never liked me since the day when i was silly enough after a little quarrel we had to propose to him to stop for ten minutes at the island of monte cristo to settle the dispute a proposition which i was wrong to suggest and he quite right to refuse   206.51099028002673
don t be uneasy on that score replied villefort   37.237463434895574
i am stricken by fate   141.51149292549957
the street of saint honore when the cardinal and his party passed through it was crowded by an assemblage who standing in groups discussed the edicts of that memorable day   55.76307578893742
the poor girl made no reply but her lover could plainly hear her sobs and tears   139.90827119899348
monsieur i told you that i considered it best to avoid all explanation   53.90493682414399
how old was she   136.61429689621548
after casting a rapid glance around him in order to assure himself that he was unobserved he entered by the small gate and carefully closing and securing it after him proceeded with a hurried step towards the barrier   117.88703463929644
i must try and persuade m   114.54558745978154
dead bodies are not kept a year   168.34345916479882
it is here   82.85309059270799
this point of union was noirtier and it was he who had just sent for morrel with the request that the latter would lose no time in coming to him a command which morrel obeyed to the letter to the great discomfiture of barrois   104.93391357905254
as for villefort instead of sending to paris he carefully preserved the petition that so fearfully compromised dantès in the hopes of an event that seemed not unlikely that is a second restoration   116.57166967052815
speak now the queen herself releases you from your promise   41.49208403081741
milady gave him her hand to kiss   114.63889372019075
do you wish me for instance to give information to the procureur   51.46268558508757
scarcely had they entered when she motioned to franz to assume the seat of honor   234.5097743878426
and when napoleon returned to france he after the manner of mediocre minds termed the coincidence a decree of providence   143.9474765487406
i still had a loaded pistol and you were in full fight sword in hand   128.9507882006415
edmond listened intently   113.6017281175952
on hearing these words the shortest of the other three men seemed more attentive than ever to what was going on wrapping his cloak around him more carefully than before   86.60337448883955
but as you are satisfied of my love you must in your turn satisfy me of yours   74.21055107417982
valentine and morrel were exchanging their adieux in the presence of noirtier when a ring was heard at the door bell   129.13912836193433
if they fire we will ride after the carriage and exterminate those who may be in it   69.56857541389675
you know me well enough to be quite sure that i have never thought of your fortune   89.80137670535579
i hear you gentlemen of the guards have been in the trenches tonight and that you did not get much the best of the rochellais   164.00856446299392
but unless i am much mistaken there will be a storm in that quarter   82.63016959311368
and here are the other five hundred replied milady placing her hand upon the bag of gold   81.03808270994023
the donjon of vincennes was considered very unhealthy and madame de rambouillet had said that the room in which the marechal ornano and the grand prior de vendome had died was worth its weight in arsenic a bon mot which had great success   120.70441744664875
we need no proofs   118.27834309930564
at the same time the fever which for an instant abandoned her returned to give luster to her eyes color to her cheeks and vermillion to her lips   131.85043289336676
and by the lifting of a finger all these were busied in my service   139.89936193789137
de morcerf he whom i wrote from rome an account of the services you rendered me and to whom i announced your promised visit and i may say that both the count and countess anxiously desire to thank you in person   75.19462644994186
and he read the paragraph for the third time laying a stress on each word as he proceeded   119.59817963818362
then you know what i have suffered said mme   37.778931982401446
for whom are you looking my fine fellow   114.1800900051347
and you have come here with that purpose   183.5180664302694
you think then this fire indicates the presence of unpleasant neighbors   199.11747352592099
said monte cristo and i have forgotten my smelling bottle   59.846245159236766
it is my intention so to do   162.60400573719897
oh mon dieu it is a matter of the greatest urgency to find them out said the queen since you think these worthy gentlemen might be so useful to the king   172.5791269976136
oh that depends upon circumstances   141.57613370169946
pray let that napkin be sent to me   154.03485913347222
they will not dare to refuse me then   153.51083650884505
your advice then is to sell the diamond replied aramis   50.56564128476941
he is a subtle conscienceless italian who though he very likely dreams of crime dares not commit it   123.42999753228334
you acknowledge of course that you owe this sum to him   32.380147848014474
is this the decanter you spoke of   45.210034789617836
it was not to meet me that he came for he was ignorant of my journey   67.95240422840385
no replied athos with a singular smile   101.83314794301698
wait patiently then   142.77722912489924
confidence and love made him a giant   150.62631657461466
for mine was broken at the first parry   169.90177094006341
thinking that i might wish to settle in france he left me at his departure together with the papers establishing my identity a letter promising if he approved of my choice 150 000 livres per annum from the day i was married   169.51808763136157
why exclaimed dantès with astonishment do you possess any   114.35537526763382
zounds i thought as much when the wretch kept moving around the room   119.57016509714838
no god forbid said the cardinal   54.21797511718247
she was seated   114.11207170250776
and you did not show any favor it was your duty   135.78671589562717
but swear that you will not strike me as i go down   135.63722147230692
la chesnaye said the king let someone go instantly and find monsieur de la trémouille   102.77166379405733
bravo said d artagnan in a whisper to porthos   92.94416662636759
i do not accuse them sire   8.503794801560275
anne of austria started   51.715213506199305
i was at the louvre on the day when he scattered his pearls   212.76450499616539
aramis suffering at once in body and mind had at length fixed his eyes and his thoughts upon religion and he had considered as a warning from heaven the double accident which had happened to him   113.74642959376729
fernand was a spaniard and being sent to spain to ascertain the feeling of his fellow countrymen found danglars there got on very intimate terms with him won over the support of the royalists at the capital and in the provinces received promises and made pledges on his own part guided his regiment by paths known to himself alone through the mountain gorges which were held by the royalists and in fact rendered such services in this brief campaign that after the taking of trocadero he was made colonel and received the title of count and the cross of an officer of the legion of honor   149.2208578550058
asked athos quietly   115.6391412495075
the brigadier had a moment s hope   110.97233066278075
i beg you will remove your bandage   129.5875650157259
undoubtedly said villefort moderating the tones of his voice a marriage once concerted and then broken off throws a sort of discredit on a young lady   135.20253158919562
but to return to what we were saying   109.78008742638914
then there was the ring with the lion s head which cæsar wore when he wanted to greet his friends with a clasp of the hand   139.1356113469809
he had passed and re passed his island of monte cristo twenty times but not once had he found an opportunity of landing there   90.94373445611708
this young man was alarmed by the appearance of every new face for every new face might be that of a new creditor come in anxiety to question the head of the house   92.54701058340542
this late arrival had attracted much suspicion and the young man being no other than andrea the commissary and gendarme who was a brigadier directed their steps towards his room   174.5696600463615
morrel extended his hand   103.9335170327667
the man in the mantle advanced towards me but as he drew near i saw that he had a weapon in his hand   139.59497649021023
you are not mistaken   189.19793790587835
grimaud leaped down   86.34542875775763
i answer for his consent   108.56498854936657
however if you provide access to or distribute copies of a project gutenberg™ work in a format other than plain vanilla ascii or other format used in the official version posted on the official project gutenberg™ website www   114.99359755167387
ali drew himself up proudly and then returned a sign in the affirmative   107.14286378301802
noirtier burning with impatience and terror was in despair at his utter inability to help his old domestic whom he regarded more in the light of a friend than a servant   156.01086433013543
that was the principal thing   114.91010818368714
different in your fate from us you will have a king without a minister whom you may serve love respect   100.35760292002377
milady smiled with a strange smile   67.31542389088929
two months said he   147.89753983256918
he soon arranged a prompt and certain manner of traveling by sending relays of horses to chantilly so that he might be in paris in five or six hours   103.72213521875707
it will then be said of me that i died for the king   76.29771921518548
you stand upon his property   14.530978609106896
his excellency does not receive visitors today   79.46949656470119
take care madame said the young man coolly you will kill yourself in jumping   126.89518478267999
because he is in love   200.7532251443207
30023m m   29.795045970927177
ah monsieur interrupted aramis permit me to observe to you that you have not acted in this affair as a gallant man ought   138.24767907401358
perhaps he had come to tell captain gaumard of his good luck and to offer him employment from his new master   163.75024832548536
my dear said she as she took the pen is it not vexatious   74.40759242065499
always ready   49.120450374838065
but i swear to you that this crime shall be her last   114.37468928347941
because mercédès is a very fine girl and fine girls never lack followers   107.64008401079609
i am an officer of fortune nothing else   104.18659353621338
cried the king drawing up his horse with a sudden jerk which threw it on its haunches and seizing the bridle of athos s horse   173.59971974786097
as to the rest of the blade the master had slyly put that on one side to make himself a larding pin   109.64753549351194
to have you as long as possible near me to hear your eloquent speech which embellishes my mind strengthens my soul and makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things if i should ever be free so fills my whole existence that the despair to which i was just on the point of yielding when i knew you has no longer any hold over me   57.04337394407342
i have come to speak to you of a very serious matter   30.56491520145137
in fact of the twenty rose trees which formed the parterre not one bore the mark of the slug nor were there evidences anywhere of the clustering aphis which is so destructive to plants growing in a damp soil   147.11139834366105
do you wish to see anything more sir   117.8472037126309
i have but one portmanteau   144.75554715384652
i believe you madame to be a great and powerful queen and that it will be unworthy of your power and greatness if you do not recompense the arms which will bring back his eminence to saint germain   108.01928030953493
is it that excellent m   36.21774287518353
must i go too   38.98507573534107
sir said de guiche to his tutor we will precede you and you can rejoin us on the road to cambrin   60.12182128075649
at this moment the tumult was heard nearer   118.26754844060117
said the deputy shuddering in spite of himself   172.08333382959853
but contrary to all expectation when the 31st of august came the house opened as usual and cocles appeared behind the grating of the counter examined all bills presented with the usual scrutiny and from first to last paid all with the usual precision   145.41257545651314
but it seemed that the history which the inspector had related interested him greatly for after having perused the first documents he turned over the leaves until he reached the deposition respecting edmond dantès   135.42325454249848
the chancellor himself would be puzzled how to write such a letter and yet the chancellor draws up an official report very readily   118.0907137188718
chapter 9   115.87846640364509
they read to noirtier the formal copy of a will in order to give him an idea of the terms in which such documents are generally couched   162.64649245599762
the men i have put to flight will return reinforced   149.99183793548877
said the queen blinded by her obstinacy   215.34797183998649
it was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since the house was built so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt   113.24280970727798
s confidential valet who never left the door entered in reply to the call   160.65265801902171
exclaimed d artagnan impelled by one of those irresistible impulses which showed the nobility of his nature the native brightness of his character   152.03904602709395
that puts a different face on the matter   171.15932712048925
and i will get you the torch you ask for   113.28557224903464
but he did not know that matters had reached such a point   138.6160155001164
take it take it   194.00672441168183
and he jumped off his horse   86.60197627100032
he is right said porthos   112.36937153836145
forward planchet forward   113.21352571182634
take care of yourself and act so that we may from time to time hear you spoken of   74.9128297800939
to place my lackey at your disposal   198.55402050972558
the castle of bragelonne   78.20844702104698
i should adore you as my patron saint   74.07562174816077
allow me then if you please to answer in different order or i will not do so at all   114.42185763143378
willingly said d artagnan   206.5095526322567
he wore a large brown mantle one fold of which thrown over his left shoulder served likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance while the upper part was completely hidden by his broad brimmed hat   170.2586532977914
you are most welcome monsieur said the count of morcerf saluting monte cristo with a smile and monsieur has rendered our house in preserving its only heir a service which insures him our eternal gratitude   95.84497486439305
now   138.4369436273713
you were rich when i married you but little respected   147.21300943627784
asked mordaunt   112.53653557476859
ah stay   88.74833973731012
as true as i am a christian stammered caderousse you will make me die of fright   113.71653957206412
as he however had no other hat he picked up this as he ran and arrived at his quarters very pale and quite out of breath   119.71977788502838
villefort hastily quitted the apartment but reflecting that the sight of the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to throw the whole city into confusion he resumed his ordinary pace   88.90064881153063
for naturally enough it must have pained him to hear the emperor he so devotedly loved and served spoken of in that depreciating manner   86.95574059607571
morrel unhappy   94.85189027916202
you refuse   157.86614671195312
at this injunction from his superior felton obeyed   89.8025542769698
said madame de chevreuse trying to read in athos s eyes   139.62765644038203
the cardinal will pay you a hundred pistoles   164.441651875949
during this time the empire made its last conscription and every man in france capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the emperor   59.05665391020478
now we must have badly painted the character of our adventure seeker or our readers must have already perceived that d artagnan was not an ordinary man   126.55018853381381
and i may profit by monsieur s happiness and go to bed   171.0737217306338
then he dragged himself cautiously to the top of a rock from which he had a full view of the sea and thence he saw the tartan complete her preparations for sailing weigh anchor and balancing herself as gracefully as a water fowl ere it takes to the wing set sail   121.87585878523564
but her words and look seemed to inflict the direst torture on him for his lips became ghastly pale and even beneath the dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen retreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the heart   161.00455458202447
he is enjoying a ride with madame de guemenee   69.76475676074134
and the frenchmen how did they behave   98.11637530891102
these words struck d artagnan like a thunderbolt   68.44426296189343
he will wear on his doublet twelve diamond studs   64.05775959600373
but when he reached the door he paused and then said at what o clock does your excellency wish the carriage and horses to be ready   120.29300377811552
oh your excellency it was not yours then   64.58057994782246
mordaunt went away with the captain   181.38465971689664
the queen was in a morning gown but it became her still   69.06245228000168
which of my friends my lord   127.92848738958195
milady was all attention   98.04719830009917
sulpice and st   116.81176947206663
if you had let me sleep on i should have finished my galop and have been grateful to you all my life   46.02997342118606
of what country is he a native   143.52783187473923
before all who are here   152.2520952929161
hastily raising myself on one arm i looked around but all was dark   172.37368590617456
said athos offering his hand to d artagnan   156.24410143893965
it was impossible that his best friend if indeed he had any friend left could recognize him   59.63172257447815
now here we are obliged to own that andrea ought to have felt remorse but that he did not   180.50293711764317
porthos seized his opportunity caught the next soldier by his neck gagged him and pushed him like a mummy through the bars into the room and entered after him   72.11597069843336
yes said cromwell   42.577298893078535
certainly if milady s strength had been equal to her hatred mme   118.46421640551488
you speak to me before my servant   173.96887326835082
but the lightning will not strike until there is a hand to guide it   110.11337379008356
the young girl did not speak   36.74098573709179
morrel understood that the old man attached great importance to an oath   85.71812592257223
athos glanced around at his friends with a melancholy smile   73.52212297832043
he did not wait long for in five minutes the queen entered in full gala costume   170.93739478986814
duhallier s men and half of m   168.28824916238628
asked the driver   78.96686437588751
danglars it is i   124.84796071310228
yes the written order said porthos who now began to comprehend what d artagnan was aiming at we ask only for that   135.35228154279434
a most gracious welcome and unusual smile were bestowed on m   143.62564532962972
then our gascon extending his arms drew to him the heads of his three friends till they almost touched one another   149.85577838147884
with such things   115.55501881771919
without any inquiry without any formality   109.76500617533748
he is preparing a way for your majesty to escape   102.16468312870872
oh no poor dear man   51.95233983413087
sir monk said he whether he is now or has been an executioner this unfortunate being is none the less a man   106.59395297979779
but i shall be always happy and proud sire to sacrifice myself to the harmony which i desire to see reign between you and the queen of france   134.04354770631048
what is become of her   58.84865795415419
the other cavaliers were only twenty steps from them   85.32874417074001
besides these a casket of magnificent goldwork with the same arms as the sword and the portrait formed a middle ornament to the mantelpiece and assorted badly with the rest of the furniture   148.8574382958385
i have it a sailor who was about to marry a young catalan girl   98.94772304584825
danglars informed you of the ceremony   136.45422185409174
it is easy to suppose that morrel s agitation would not escape the count s penetrating eye   109.35286050524878
never mind said milady writing the name on half a sheet of paper   186.63376729338665
he had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been and was now to find out what the man had become   107.45829187617053
the count of monte cristo   196.96286117540012
no sing it please   89.63758132471727
under what circumstances did we meet   106.36542949129239
that makes seventy   25.12708400440563
a burst of laughter was the answer but finished with a groan   57.509495298476786
understand sir i do not in the least suspect your veracity   138.32189456339069
the englishman with the coolness of his nation addressed him in terms nearly similar to those with which he had accosted the mayor of marseilles   219.16295008142234
athos made a sign to the vicomte de bragelonne to remain where he was   174.9678561171387
monsieur you insult the majesty of justice   68.8629868591367
the count from the moment of first entering the drawing room had not once lost sight of the expression of the young man s countenance   151.4901706155154
you knew i should be killed on leaving this house and did not warn me   120.36723083770467
it is mine in return for my having myself saved him from death   38.16372350355873
ah baron baron said albert you are not listening what barbarism in a megalomaniac like you   56.020373797220806
your lordship must have observed that he could not continue his journey   101.88736207838956
you have an opportunity now count   62.49073373205102
what orders   87.727889150309
colonel harrison is one of our friends   130.8279967273438
but pray call emmanuel   54.28509590507194
they went over a tolerably large ground floor   89.65114449869647
interposed edward and i pulled three such beautiful feathers out of his tail   176.10069196088503
dantès drew a plan of the island for faria and faria gave dantès advice as to the means he should employ to recover the treasure   126.10631405460485
underneath a lamp in an inn anywhere they ask are you one of the fronde   154.77716477837325
he made a great start and looked at me   183.43790219917793
besides he feared that by resisting longer he should appear selfish in the eyes of athos   158.29487292543345
good bye said château renaud in his turn keeping his little cane in his left hand and saluting with his right   144.36444070125197
the former executioner of bethune who has just been brought in here assassinated by spaniards and who is now being confessed by an augustine friar   113.27897472876995
in an instant thanks to the lamp my chamber was once more lighted   177.84989990296828
his eminence expects me in half an hour   94.41536039780539
he murmured proudly and turning his eyes to the benches where they had appeared for a moment   28.65159467040432
why you killed him   1.962837002004889
but why are you thus agitated   210.96680838945986
i offered you tyburn said lord de winter   108.8803185280832
you do not believe me m   223.64083560327407
oh heavens exclaimed valentine who was supporting the head of morrel on her shoulder do you not see how pale she is   51.32193735128653
he felt as if each stroke of the hammer fell upon his heart   154.57720948877403
but don carlos   93.57057904522478
perhaps you mean to disobey me   120.68483529348104
he is leaving them   154.1863384658078
the public astonishment had reached its height   73.38026780405377
pay him booby   115.18550881183769
but they have corresponded   7.608451019095767
cried the queen whose anxiety grew greater every moment   98.95954400102345
40219m you know mother m   51.55627799720102
porthos at the sound of that voice started like a man awakened from a sleep of a hundred years   39.04410473041645
has your resolution changed valentine   101.15905607754382
he is which makes me believe that it is only an excuse of m   89.04951800182572
come come said d artagnan more reason why we should start on our journey   66.47481625761519
27 rue du helder   173.4641838122792
be so good as to mention this name to his eminence and to bring me word whether he will receive me yes or no   133.95808969920316
the servants standing in the doorway not daring to approach nearer were looking at noirtier s old servant who had heard the noise from his master s room and run there also remaining behind the others   200.00873751350989
tomorrow you shall be free   167.49588829193732
the inflexible arm and steadfast heart had given place to a trembling hand and a body shaken by excitement   38.77458078442014
but you stopped at the idea i hope   176.7074654364029
these were the first tears the man of blood had ever wept   96.33062330172842
40241m he was finishing the last line when a cry behind him made him start and the pen fell from his hand   208.15521133916047
not here he said   94.60481953614547
we receive them and for greater security we stand out to sea   96.0872797605396
20245m why should he doubt it   124.1561062307669
felton took the bag and threw it to the foot of the wall   223.03338746751953
what can he want with me   154.6762079421188
yes madame said d artagnan   96.76047148786125
thanks to what aramis had told him d artagnan who knew already that porthos called himself du vallon was now aware that he styled himself from his estate de bracieux   40.24059390909194
madame morrel sat down by her husband and took one of his hands in hers julie still lay with her head on his shoulder emmanuel stood in the centre of the chamber and seemed to form the link between morrel s family and the sailors at the door   72.98417111338816
we are at your eminence s orders   97.6103050383385
murmured the comte de la fere   155.54928352555174
as it drew near he recognized it as the boat he had given to jacopo   169.44905798970282
dantès took some louis from his pocket and gave them to the man who had twice unconsciously pitied him   112.59510878948757
the sight of the masked man gave rise to a prolonged sensation   139.9309775110353
the jeweller began eating his supper and the woman who was ordinarily so querulous and indifferent to all who approached her was suddenly transformed into the most smiling and attentive hostess   116.94934576160126
d artagnan who for an hour past had been gnawing his nails with impatience was beginning to attack the quick   168.48707283142926
oh yes very well   92.18949643904523
you were writing   114.76314643213593
and athos ran back to the bastion mounted the platform and bore off the flag   167.95494619513113
i believe everything said athos biting his lips till the blood sprang to avoid sighing   105.75462661363397
he ran up the steps entered the church and addressing a verger who was sweeping the chapel asked him if he knew monsieur bazin   127.56477650883772
the face of the young woman was entirely unknown to her   77.48591732385475
you must have much reason to complain of him   118.80997271615468
how imprudent said château renaud to come on horseback to fight a duel with pistols after all the instructions i had given him   90.43034242978081
as for the old man his chest heaved with his panting respiration   93.18448647291578
joannes   143.06235285347287
yes that is the penalty of being a living puzzle   109.12510442619947
at that period a te deum was a grand affair   123.74434220644343
she stopped in the doorway listened for a moment to the flickering of the lamp the only sound in that deserted room and then advanced to the table to see if valentine s glass were empty   157.4945143608117
cocles had detected an overbalance of fourteen sous in his cash and the same evening he had brought them to m   8.070254400653113
athos went down to pay the reckoning while d artagnan and planchet stood at the street door   146.18401396092582
for my part observed aramis i can not say the same as you do porthos   176.89470901587845
but let us not yield to gloomy apprehensions said the young man   213.65858715047983
tell me where   108.48063165725277
yes i do or may the devil take me   153.37063582410823
don t question me i beg of you but lend me a horse   33.007900656155286
de morcerf who has given proof today of rare chivalric generosity   103.77637187806337
but if the charges brought against this bonapartist hero prove correct why then you really must give me leave to order his head to be cut off   94.56335725164199
• you provide in accordance with paragraph 1   77.0150768695363
monseigneur is too good said la ramee flattered by the compliment   7.29421461392279
said d artagnan and that comes very ill from you who have never loved   73.87297548668113
there are such in the world and god will doubtless reward them in heaven for their resignation on earth but those who mean to contend must not lose one precious moment but must return immediately the blow which fortune strikes   116.30503510649388
it is possible said morcerf   68.44207961290095
they can gain battles   177.05380298742125
maximilian morrel an excellent friend i have acquired in your absence and whose name you will hear me mention every time i make any allusion to affection wit or amiability   45.10515260196311
she is in prison   158.06194839108935
you hear comminges   193.8104616934386
oh it is not that   178.71637722690645
this chase was however advantageous to him in one sense for in proportion as the perspiration broke from his forehead his heart began to cool   114.7339351081329
my head is not only swimming but burning   5.862629516071891
no sir replied planchet   81.41928809049597
is not a day divided into twenty four hours each hour into sixty minutes and every minute sub divided into sixty seconds   39.70013056156424
it appears to me however that the seal denotes that it deserves to be opened   68.27433868954964
he divined the truth seized the glass broke it across the face of him who presented it and rushed towards the spot whence the cry came   98.36897935626823
we shall have our revenge   142.9009278047279
we might start at five o clock and be in time but the delay may cause your friend to pass an uneasy night and therefore we had better go with all speed to extricate him from the hands of the infidels   162.62942610322412
d artagnan crossed the quays went out by the gate of la conférence and followed the road much more beautiful then than it is now which leads to st   74.68407232964924
or take care morrel lest i call you ungrateful   73.4426870491319
it was just five o clock in the morning when a slight noise like a stifled sigh reached his ear   140.34038575165087
put it into my portfolio   114.03995880440563
every reproach his friend uttered struck deeply in his heart   174.85424155319052
de wardes can not boast of anything   85.217392748163
it was worn by my father a loyal gentleman   149.49963619992292
she was young you say   126.55338054177018
and the very reason why the women of this fine country where sounds the si as dante writes put so little restraint on their words and actions is because they live so much in public and have really nothing to conceal   106.1817523474196
i tell you i am going to die do you understand   146.31771179615703
what my good fellow   117.685787860231
in the year 1811 i was transferred to piedmont in france   55.27190447177499
nothing of all this escaped grimaud but la ramee looked on with the curiosity of a father who thinks that he may perhaps get a cheap idea concerning a new toy for his children   169.55051275873745
what do you think of her   162.00585781582697
you are young   50.60621745121545
at length i saw the lamp rise softly and disappear in the depths of the ceiling   124.73865901383525
in all probability therefore the transteverin was no other than the bandit luigi vampa himself and the man shrouded in the mantle the same he had known as sinbad the sailor but who no doubt was still pursuing his philanthropic expedition in rome as he had already done at porto vecchio and tunis   158.70578345848605
help reverend sir help   109.94820463622074
there is a sort of consolation at the contemplation of the yawning abyss at the bottom of which lie darkness and obscurity   192.60357572829358
said charles that is a severe chastisement for a very trifling fault   50.32366708252827
after you however said cromwell   161.5020413050995
at one bound he was upon the duke   81.03753055328298
let us return to that subject   62.15671499629298
he thought he must have made an error in his calculations if he now found cause to blame himself   68.71644308661095
but the queen not the less deserves all my anger   12.10600048078301
d artagnan started awakened himself and as he awoke stood up exactly like a soldier under arms   152.61884580300628
then you would employ for me your arm which has already acquired so much renown   90.27657660645585
now gentlemen said athos when he had ascertained there were five chambers free in the hôtel let everyone retire to his own apartment   101.92014933592601
thrones are at this time shaken and it is to little purpose for devoted hearts to serve the interests of princes   82.54204202060932
as soon as they arrived at the spot where groslow stood they stopped as if guessing that he was the man they wanted   89.3403927455962
monsieur said albert with affectionate courtesy the count of château renaud knew how much pleasure this introduction would give me   105.02848592470578
i do not mean to say you will lose but nevertheless mind you hold to the terms of the agreement   96.43175392655937
the queen had two letters ready one written by herself the other by her daughter the princess henrietta   117.86025577196095
he should have been   163.4142234595734
a conjugal scene chapter xlvi   90.96517001016387
one of them preceded the rest by double the length of his horse   96.29046592223082
we haven t known him so long   103.38853990618387
he is a friend of mine   3.041987157598797
in the entire political world of which you are one of the leaders   124.66602403970967

then seated on a chair she looked at the manly countenance of monte cristo on which grief and hatred still impressed a threatening expression   87.31348102883666
the man took the bag from the hands of the coadjutor who heard the sound of his fingers counting and handling the gold pieces   60.94013573625911
then turning to monte cristo said m   148.7717419999181
to the letter but at the same time remember we must continue to play our respective parts   130.07680886944723
and for the second time haydée stopped overcome by such violent emotion that the perspiration stood upon her pale brow and her stifled voice seemed hardly able to find utterance so parched and dry were her throat and lips   159.3038157902917
said scarron he may die now   93.79059407630854
but why did it not kill my father   153.52188605640828
and what said your cavalier to you   141.42667408466355
did you really think me capable of that   44.845823412830384
he was in fact in the unhappy position of the victim marked for sacrifice   115.11910541376523
be not alarmed at what i say   70.87230799451912
he had at once declared for a military life and had in consequence studied hard passed brilliantly through the polytechnic school and left it as sub lieutenant of the 53rd of the line   148.26288347046122
now the cabbage had not the slightest appearance of disease in the world and the rabbit had not the smallest distrust   74.3730650312413
the fair woman on whose account i gave you advice which naturally you took care not to adopt   98.34846749716833
valentine   110.8040205767634
ah very well that s an explanation   142.10990511326384
thanks gentlemen thanks   78.48399443384693
besides he is unarmed   237.01270884259583
thousands of insects escaped from the aperture dantès had previously formed and a huge snake like the guardian demon of the treasure rolled himself along in darkening coils and disappeared   177.51691441771607
i was seeking the gentleman to whom this horse belongs an officer brave and handsome as a youthful caesar   173.61140819729815
monte cristo looked inquiringly at his guests   111.56255695011103
there are five of them said athos half aloud and we are but three   77.03220817994756
he called himself vampa   99.75509347596007
at the corner of the cimetiere saint jean d artagnan upset a man   120.89352882810938
when once i know the hour i will hasten to this spot you can easily get over this fence with my assistance a carriage will await us at the gate in which you will accompany me to my sister s   27.461178727720892
the petition finished villefort read it aloud   135.86268905971303
for five hundred thousand   138.59162901386784
finally he is anxious to see if you have been fortunate enough to escape the bad moral influence to which you have been exposed and which is infinitely more to be dreaded than any physical suffering   123.75023771455238
grimaud s first intention had been to return to paris but he remembered the anxiety which his prolonged absence might occasion raoul and reflecting that there were now only two miles between the vicomte and himself and a quarter of an hour s riding would unite them and that the going returning and explanation would not occupy an hour he put spurs to his horse and a few minutes after had reached the only inn of mazingarbe   150.74237685767167
of course replied danglars   30.510035409739416
said the doctor   80.1656324625595
i do not know you said the executioner   138.6103115344694
instructions have been given   116.47959891846206
let him decide and we will execute   139.63528321491165
in fact said aramis there is no time lost and we made our journey quickly   183.17621330298428
she took it or rather just touched it with her little hand and they together descended the steps lined with rhododendrons and camellias   82.10923190243463
yes pray accursed woman   96.27341727835292
among some unimportant papers he found the following letter that which he had sought at the risk of his life since you have lost sight of that woman and she is now in safety in the convent which you should never have allowed her to reach try at least not to miss the man   107.3739182850759
is it not a halt in death s anteroom   72.19616222063654
the brand disappeared   154.46142201177767
you have known him for some time then   88.78612638541532
as a proof remember the date of the day on which i had you bidden to come to me and seek in your memory for what happened to you that very night   27.085740560692656
they fell into the line of carriages   60.92185683065435
well monsieur you understand that uneasiness makes us do many things   150.97798829686116
when a carriage is chosen it ought to be strong   151.8463718088632
to morrow morning   193.6025988156195
the next morning he left that inn as he had left the hôtel des princes without being noticed walked down the faubourg saint antoine along the boulevard to rue ménilmontant and stopping at the door of the third house on the left looked for someone of whom to make inquiry in the porter s absence   115.88286269981667
besides and rochefort drew a deep breath as he spoke i am going into the country to make a tour   107.92796041452392
de villefort a second time raised his head looked at benedetto as if he had been gazing at the head of medusa and became livid   93.6124504893652
then he went out   181.80887928244735
and as a custom existed among the inhabitants of that part of france where caderousse lived of styling every person by some particular and distinctive appellation her husband had bestowed on her the name of la carconte in place of her sweet and euphonious name of madeleine which in all probability his rude gutteral language would not have enabled him to pronounce   130.38281654856286
but i was at my own house you understand so there was nothing to be done but to send for the cards which i did   143.98705881370765
morrel uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of his son of whose arrival he was ignorant   142.9449215312269
but they tell me that the noise of thunder is the voice of god   174.3118521762493
murmured the queen whose teeth chattered with fright   92.34488533328408
i have courage enough for any danger i can foresee for every misfortune which i understand   111.87697286880983
yes it was so my lord it was so in the left side and with a knife   104.50904608751044
d avrigny turned round and uttered a very feeble yes but morrel disengaging his hand rushed to the bed and after having pressed the cold lips of valentine with his own hurriedly left uttering a long deep groan of despair and anguish   98.30820254927869
the duke glanced at the clock   109.59616731458074
but the man who has abducted her do you know him   113.10814749363864
then turning to monte cristo he said but will you undertake to speak to the father   124.55600826995399
do they refuse   133.91887944863518
resounded through the city   44.079782562275625
and after asking bernouin who stood at the door whether anything had occurred during his absence and being answered in the negative he desired that he might be left alone   150.3181120634677
the queen appeared cheerful and happy which seemed to astonish the persons who surrounded her and who were accustomed to see her almost always sad and full of care   188.08140531120733
availing himself of a handle that projected from a half fallen door he tied the animal safely and having drawn a red cotton handkerchief from his pocket wiped away the perspiration that streamed from his brow then advancing to the door struck thrice with the end of his iron shod stick   78.35857918843902
it seemed as though one immense blast of the wind had extinguished everyone   201.01364851014097
and these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to those of the faithful are they   101.8387234202117
the worthy major raised his eyes to heaven and sighed   27.658250706118963
willingly if you wish it   206.37092207922055
they were stopped and questioned at the gate by which they sought to enter the city but athos replied in excellent english that they had been sent forward by colonel harrison to announce to his colleague monsieur bridge the approach of the king   90.30100733057336
has either of them confided anything to you by word of mouth   32.426663726180266
open sir she said and look for yourself   86.87551697514547
he made a sign with his head went into the anteroom and seated himself   27.049652802753613
the general looked around him with slight uneasiness   108.77417657382139
wait a moment   112.51031794909306
the fire crackled and the smoke ascended like the dull vapor from a volcano   107.26940300597656
good luck to you   134.4963778287736
no it does not concern me   114.42401941663559
the travelers were therefore obliged to stay at the hotel until the next day   157.76574354315792
when the game was over the duke laughing at la ramee for his bad play offered these men two louis d or to go and drink his health with their four other comrades   163.77715589230314
milady made one step forward and then drew back as if she had seen a serpent   131.46347866609085
if i were to invite you and the count and countess of morcerf to this dinner i should give it the appearance of being a matrimonial meeting or at least madame de morcerf would look upon the affair in that light especially if baron danglars did me the honor to bring his daughter   146.2340070490197
monsieur i have eaten and drunk respectfully the crown you gave me this morning so that i have not a sou left in case i should be cold   77.77956782326376
and if it were mercédès poor and lone as you are you suit me as well as the daughter of the first shipowner or the richest banker of marseilles   55.925252019287356
the contract was to have been signed three days since   61.737012965231415
de tréville who was returning from st   5.610626123182399
she listened attentively holding her breath till she was nearly suffocated   58.69332433240165
well then wretches cried danglars i will defy your infamous calculations i would rather die at once   164.7276275411175
besides you have no need of anyone to introduce you with your name and your fortune and your talent monte cristo bowed with a somewhat ironical smile you can present yourself everywhere and be well received   93.83577583318005
ah he is a confectioner in the rue des lombards   46.82644530858718
that was still the situation of affairs up to the early days of february   167.35213913566088
my name would have secured me the paternal estate you have deprived me of it   130.729216027337
a little   49.66908644538108
such news was decisive   154.10299921377285
he could not understand how albert s fiery nature of which he had seen so much among the roman bandits had suddenly stooped to this humiliation   87.06244192461392
one might have fancied that some giant had cleaved them with blows from a hatchet   135.8402345860079
what then is this monsieur scarron who thus puts all paris in commotion   166.61075999093472
gaston desired that he should be shown into the room wherein he was to sleep without in the least concerning himself as to where his wife and daughter were to repose   160.98025693892555
the three friends hastened on but in a short time were obliged to slacken the pace   110.8253841305051
that i may tell you my projects for you to go and betray them to my persecutor   128.09607710605383
i see thee cast expressive glances at the remains of my supper   108.73206754285059
de saint méran and the dangerous illness of his widow would cast a gloom over the meeting which she would regret should be shared by the count whom she wished every happiness   131.80866356570564
listen to this dilemma god is god and the world is the devil   86.53781603749218
as to the other he knows me he fears me and knows what he has to expect of me if ever i escape from his hands   104.07330621979148
but here is the letter   126.29542495524922
well then madame said de winter the king wishes you to try and discover the dispositions of the king and queen toward him   49.11747808172131
he was piqued at the tone which morcerf had just assumed   110.80828728423053
villefort looked disdainfully at morrel and replied coldly you are aware monsieur that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in private life and the best seaman in the merchant service and yet be politically speaking a great criminal   100.68911546634793
the evening of the betrothal villefort had as we have said hastened back to madame de saint méran s in the place du grand cours and on entering the house found that the guests whom he had left at table were taking coffee in the salon   62.29226096121606
valentine i have always regarded our love in the light of something sacred   128.82958116560224
it is absurd said debray   64.65258102347036
he marched between athos and porthos pressing them tenderly   97.06400155348223
and if anything should happen mme   78.72679220134782
why in this way if coysel says loud enough for the cardinal to hear him on such or such a day such a prisoner will escape tis plain that the cardinal will take measures of precaution and that the prisoner will not escape   87.20122665474915
murmured winter his eyes glazed and he allowed his sword to fall to his side   192.41883555650523
supposing there were to be doubts raised as to the validity of your marriage or the legitimacy of your child   50.58168593267336
twenty five minutes past nine   100.54091422516684
let us see what porthos has found for supper   83.43272241069899
how without incommding himself athos procures his equipment chapter xxxix   114.73702925206622
maximilian replied morrel looking fixedly at his son you are a man and a man of honor   128.9269041277765
i wish after such a scene to be alone   123.25473937731127
too long a wait too long   76.43542063723373
my friend   33.53184820398559
it was a melancholy sight that of these six men traveling in silence each plunged in his own thoughts sad as despair gloomy as chastisement   42.916678293712465
kill the fellow and rejoin us as soon as you can   148.5857251875325
franz complimented albert who looked at himself in the glass with an unequivocal smile of satisfaction   167.64838146537159
and the third in spite of being my rival entertained a very sincere affection for me   123.64572075566963
franz only succeeded in killing a few partridges and like every unsuccessful sportsman he returned to the boat very much out of temper   44.98027430848491
even on the night of the prince s return some citizens bolder than the rest such as the sheriffs captains and the quartermaster went from house to house among their friends saying why do we not take the king and place him in the hotel de ville   86.21689069648384
as he said these words the count of morcerf pointed to a chair while he seated himself in another opposite the window   185.5572070620099
two windows only of the pavilion faced the street   72.78467681543813
only imagine me a captain at twenty with a hundred louis pay and a share in the profits   110.09691718492778
d artagnan my friend you are brave you are prudent you have excellent qualities   76.63102357378648
but hear me continued she   140.31143012662838
interrupted monte cristo   138.90426125377869
to lose a year two years three years is to talk of an eternity   150.4784919818039
bernouin was waiting there impatient for news of his master   175.24963844190893
if you ask me for a day count i know what to anticipate   103.86136899576393
and he wrote to d artagnan to hasten his return   169.76262753359154
at this signal four soldiers of the seraskier kourchid suddenly appeared and selim fell pierced by five blows   120.58634947542457
she traversed her chamber with the excitement of a furious maniac or of a tigress shut up in an iron cage   191.682473860473
do i know   139.51467776906455
i ask your pardon for him cardinal said the queen   35.005596247117495
d artagnan had appointed six o clock in the morning for his lackey and wherever he might be he was right   75.84124988983132
have you studied our scotch troops and have you confidence in them   5.099530024063611
these three rooms were a salon a boudoir and a bedroom   100.96243565701448
he had heard the proverb which mordaunt had given in french   78.14536064342451
albert hesitated a moment   197.3035575548078
that is indispensable   89.18822416333224
to the end of the world my lord   134.5722271795021
milady received this look like a resigned victim   106.17925996066077
a boar s ham with jelly a quarter of a kid with tartar sauce a glorious turbot and a gigantic lobster   85.97748079980977
if it was valentine alone he would speak as she passed   198.54648745929606
at last after renewed hesitation dantès entered the second grotto   142.63607982212633
doubtless said buckingham and rather twice than once   116.92649904176263
but i could find nothing   5.204905926860391
médéah was standing at the rack eating his hay   47.140784715005964
said he timidly   120.86897538410555
oh this is what i feared   165.46510675096638
i will be with you directly   42.52951887004606
but you shall not kill me today   171.05093196622178
there were besides other particulars he was desirous of ascertaining and those were of a nature he alone could investigate in a manner satisfactory to himself   69.50227580388565
the count watched him   133.49450556741743
my information dates from the day on which i was arrested returned the abbé faria   123.9704905273438
at last we have something definite said athos   74.20650264257524
but the latter made so polite and friendly a salutation that his tenant felt obliged not only to stop but to enter into conversation with him   109.46744147262497
describe him in order that if we meet him by chance like jean sbogar or lara we may recognize him   97.95292106582464
i shall be fearfully preoccupied with my outfit   104.02245972298302
i have just discovered how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that eat his peaches   88.1395845791702
send for him   71.61443532295294
and you have a letter   145.51509385213754
it was indeed a flight which my father was trying to effect   48.179806876026916
but what will be reported of the sudden death of the poor old servant   82.63207110287999
a glance at the walls of his salon proved to franz and albert that he was a connoisseur of pictures   97.54074536892725
inquired athos   174.16524234008867
and you are very virtuous are you not planchet   41.8994142792627
and you have not been tempted by the hopes of reputation yourself   30.920906871956944
i am taken   102.81140357770967
you were going to complete the fatal project you cherish in your mind   209.538760634012
bonacieux had disappeared without his being able to discover what had become of her   78.59042267176994
i had no doubt he would return the following night   104.13538922325773
it does not bring him a bajocco   136.09124844290983
at the denunciating sound the monks would be rendered aware that temptation was besieging a brother and all the community would go to prayers   126.40264470341828
the citizens are amusing themselves in the meantime   90.01259653299014
she was mad with passion   40.59437188216518
she suited me in every respect and i would have married her   23.863099090585266
the gate opened a carriage rolled down the avenue and stopped at the steps   145.0583866390257
do not seek to know how i discovered it   94.86142270471703
caderousse sighed   32.69852976285567
then turning to monte cristo i hope you will permit me to leave you for a few minutes continued she   115.87018959147457
at six o clock lord de winter came in   29.134918854521857
besides it is rendering a service to one s country to denounce these wretched criminals who are unworthy of the honor bestowed on them   118.80712714569313
but whence does he derive the title of count   23.750292641680048
upon what subject   132.72117296269656
there are at least few that i have not seen said the count coldly   170.92556381022143
these steps drew near to his dungeon the door was thrown open and the guards appeared   92.43888247826732
ah murmured athos kissing her hand had i only sooner known that marie michon was so charming a creature   103.7267967831745
they have perhaps some motive to serve in hastening the ruin of a rival firm   122.59224765133014
a little nervous perhaps but upon the whole he appeared tolerable   149.0425020741758
you confirmed my opinion   23.329879039174457
as for albert and franz they essayed not to escape from their ciceronian tyrants   116.11449826194969
and he darted on beside his friend who had already begun a fresh pursuit   88.57964163488853
it is your love which makes you look upon everything in that light   121.7956612545761
he had only to step over the corpse enter the boudoir take the child in his arms and flee far far away   168.96027755881144
d artagnan and his friends are detained at the siege of la rochelle   100.55031236147343
but the moment he extended his hand to search for it the wounded man who had not dropped his sword plunged the point into d artagnan s breast crying one for you   128.30996005260144
oh be assured said mordaunt looking at them with an expression he vainly endeavoured to soften my soldiers will guard them and guard them well i promise you   43.583607052202936
even his misadventures are of use   119.88288028963022
it was that of a number of men steadily approaching   193.8885587912985
why in the first place i heard it from madame danglars who by the by is dying to see you in her box or to have you seen there by others   82.5559120057274
his whiskers cut off noirtier gave another turn to his hair   151.73299692985574
monte cristo put his head out of the window exchanged a few words with him in a low tone and the steward disappeared   110.2311225043981
and now my young friend for you will permit me i hope to give you that name said lord de winter on this very evening if agreeable to you i will present you to my sister milady clarik for i am desirous that she should take you into her good graces   25.158562136097245
then the insurrection in greece broke out and he had served in the grecian ranks   87.99233912495576
the comte de toiras retired into the citadel st   112.56890727548826
right   205.68042604266515
that is the very truth cried the mercer   116.22630013778902
the president s sword which was simply as he had said one he carried in his cane was five inches shorter than the general s and had no guard   130.124881194249
she has been punished monseigneur   118.11360956095741
who enjoyed the reputation of being the most severe the most upright the most rigid magistrate on the bench   116.42724026248963
and now you are assembled gentlemen said d artagnan permit me to offer you my apologies   69.29044248575501
i must look upon the past in a false light   125.68812275499675
it had long been an object of ambition for porthos   136.83998106380898
when he thought the matter over he could by no means account for this generous conduct on the part of thomson french towards him   127.35159924764733
every one stood up   67.00768560789713
i have given you the choice between america and tyburn replied lord de winter   126.49110294198054
it is too much for us two   203.7954722191332
it was thus with milady   141.4739031740455
but this favor which you bestow upon me i do not merit   79.97186748363097
for three months i struggled with death   149.64427459748927
oh you are a man of god sir cried caderousse   111.24507431239036
she took it and looked attentively on the count   99.48669417492115
but he could not resist his love of sport and set out after dinner   108.68969503489996
cried bazin a poem sell so dear as that   112.50392395167782
yet the king will be at the head of the army on mazarin s side   117.65640675959449
four marble steps led down to the water s edge and below them was a boat floating on the tide   147.33106247551822
it is her majesty s   154.70950733674147
attend to it then at once   123.95243215012182
this morning you rose at five o clock   120.59692945150798
nothing warranted me to answer him otherwise   203.05827209318687
you rochefort   89.79048782422176
she will live and may yet be happy since her child in whom all her love is centred will be with her   158.5562740810017
empty your pockets   85.260988668896
take as large an escort as you like   76.87300192053452
but all this indistinctly as through a mist   100.5074901364446
her eyes were more brilliant than ever and her hands which were generally white like mother of pearl now more resembled wax to which time was adding a yellowish hue   172.29404540931355
ask the vicomte de morcerf   165.05683372422476
his head supported by a long and flexible neck issued from his large black robe balancing itself with a motion very much like that of the tortoise thrusting his head out of his shell   137.4424740229107
well well said the jeweller you seem my good friends to have had some fears respecting the accuracy of your money by counting it over so carefully directly i was gone   61.29475398071911
will you permit me then to recall another to you   138.14047131140583
now it is that i regret d artagnan   80.31132123601674
to fontainebleau replied eugénie with an almost masculine voice   167.97377379919507
i will help you   73.85978072776788
exclaimed the queen who remarked this movement and his paleness   127.3507994525012
if i were obliged to fight against you i think i should allow myself to be pierced through and through for i never loved any one but you in the wide world   143.26134105617803
ah to be sure   27.613633335584225
danglars did not even look at her though she did her best to faint   56.42913271201848
and he acknowledges fifteen or twenty millions said andrea with a look sparkling with joy   47.739208657758724
well i am charged with the commission of endeavoring to induce the comte de morcerf to make some definite arrangement with the baron   107.49002194999099
what is there i would not do to evince my earnest gratitude   158.33382328163472
what can you mean   138.63326190853377
many might take for their device the epithet strong which formed the second part of his motto but very few gentlemen could lay claim to the faithful which constituted the first   142.93420492136823
inform the queen   123.8746130600311
if he was the friend of d artagnan he was the enemy of the cardinal   80.89775792505884
the law   154.3527260662652
a certain d artagnan a béarnese gentleman who left paris in company with three of his friends with the intention of going to london   54.66874251973929
death is always death that is forgetfulness repose exclusion from life and therefore from grief   94.86025714973812
murmured d avrigny the most selfish of all animals the most personal of all creatures who believes the earth turns the sun shines and death strikes for him alone an ant cursing god from the top of a blade of grass   198.6187613463454
ah if you speak in that way said athos you will break my heart and the tears will flow from my eyes as the wine flowed from the cask   116.3131602774839
screamed milady   132.3309505842265
at this moment madame de villefort approached   108.68244102050146
milady held out her arms   156.27984463779518
now then go said the marquis   40.298917214159445
the young king looked at the officer with his large formed eye and repeated monsieur d artagnan   129.73729110366588
if my unknown be as amiable as she is beautiful said albert i shall fix myself at rome for six weeks at least   163.74743477384126
but i think you have still a good number of falcons sparrow hawks and tiercels   127.17121037856606
the epistle is laconic said d artagnan   142.21172816051427
the palace of justice would not be burned down for everybody monseigneur   98.68923329060834
there is the beginning of an adventure   185.97339732045862
milady at these words which recalled frightful remembrances hung down her head with a suppressed groan   130.27803245488084
since it is opened i will take advantage of it to enter your room   134.98316967224105
the devil i am   134.51660750529564
milady rushed to the door and opened it   143.6172100751684
do you know that he holds terrestrial beings under his control   150.71324331098052
and as there was no species of violence or pillage it did not commit the poor people on the frontier quitted their isolated dwellings and fled for refuge into the strong cities which held out a shelter to them   92.61613700953922
doubtless albert was about to discuss seriously his right to the academic chair when they were informed that dinner was ready   107.85445327072932
ma foi i haven t consulted my daughter   97.90943565016512
peter and represents the three divine powers   113.81265042806264
he cried passing the bottle to porthos we are saved the bark is supplied with provisions   82.88455153020803
in a few moments notwithstanding their wet clothes the icy blast that blew and the previous scene of terror these hardy adventurers with their iron frames inured to every hardship threw themselves down intending to profit by the advice of athos who sat at the helm pensively wakeful guiding the little bark the way it was to go his eyes fixed on the heavens as if he sought to verify not only the road to france but the benign aspect of protecting providence   53.217670992281214
there are no horses   128.2678126316261
it appears that i had made a mistake monsieur that i had arrested the wrong person and that he whom i ought to have arrested had escaped   175.14960574161015
come said madame danglars leave music and compliments and let us go and take tea   133.1864450782911
yes i know that you charged by the side of mordaunt   107.65831359649638
my uncle answered mordaunt   150.11863311329998
noirtier seemed to be calmed by these words and turned his eyes with indifference to the other side   177.93934397071132
a third time at monsieur de tréville s where it surprised us all   57.44301000068542
as for her husband he was a strapping fellow of forty or five and forty who had more than once in time of danger given ample proof of his presence of mind and courage   53.08138289438803
oh but this time perhaps she will follow your advice   136.6867659309926
the fact is that you have inspired not only the pontifical government but also the neighboring states with such extreme fear that they are glad of all opportunity of making an example   152.1691799553512
which is the young man   188.52979880577993
and now continued he with one of his most charming smiles having finished talking to the father in law i must address myself to the banker   139.87059055833686
and even they who had begun to open negotiations interrupted them being resolved to await the succor so pompously announced   96.43552955657182
a noise was heard in the hall   152.25145040528122
and a quarter of an hour after having made this assertion he found her hanging on the arm of aramis   115.13156243981513
my master had appetite enough three days ago but what can one do   140.53736236036377
the voice of the king was tremulous with anger   89.18465841282445
patrick discreetly kept in the background   56.82624826491323
sire said the queen i can send for them to the louvre where they are and thus your majesty s wishes will be complied with   154.1173668758624
de tréville employed this powerful weapon for the king in the first place and the friends of the king and then for himself and his own friends   150.69103949709603
what the devil shall we do now gentlemen   37.522337130303896
it seems the fellow had been caught wandering nearer to the harem of the bey of tunis than etiquette permits to one of his color and he was condemned by the bey to have his tongue cut out and his hand and head cut off   104.21253335730148
an enormous one   43.37258786388092
do you then believe in god   74.54724274226868
how can you exist thus without anyone to attach you to life   136.91133449423546
athos shook his head   184.91289753412968
he gave me his hand and called me his friend   158.86326046892015
come near to us from time to time as if to speak   136.61150641579397
henceforth valentine you will never again be separated on earth since he has rushed into death to find you   99.87118707415016
i noticed them for their remarkable beauty   53.0620544176142
said d artagnan in great anxiety   141.01411837308424
i told you true replied he coldly   105.20700169474642
no matter whose voice had spoken we should have heard him with the smile of doubt or the anguish of incredulity and yet how many times has your father blessed life while embracing you how often have i myself ah exclaimed morrel interrupting the count you had only lost your liberty my father had only lost his fortune but i have lost valentine   62.57116097826854
you will force the last drop of blood from your veins   139.5786030442481
because instead of expecting two hundred wretched francs you expect five or six thousand perhaps ten perhaps even twelve for you take care not to let anyone know the utmost   92.95216566438317
i came here only to meet de chatillon   118.53800669947007
it was the last yearning for life contending with the resolution of despair   177.89086268832142
meanwhile we shall reach london with the king   102.28049416456443
you say very true responded debray   83.40379213144452
besides had he not begged of morcerf not to mention his father s name before haydée   116.56947713511134
bonacieux sorrowfully   95.63718052387159
sir said planchet in a mournful tone do you abandon me thus to my fate   155.06607006733614
he smiled on perceiving that he was a child hardly fifteen years old   142.77808230516214
he added that he did not know either m   70.30916043570919
there can be no longer any doubt but that it is himself said he   157.4510024651899
sire cromwell has arrived this night at newcastle   132.7183493644847
that s impossible said the gentleman   66.9536463413196
in this way we shall not be separated for an instant   168.01706531070118
yes said he at length it is so   59.73316293449162
and sighing deeply he began to turn the hoop of his ring outside again   83.3485600106948
to whom was this letter addressed   92.73335960440417
i have seen so many remarkable things in him that if you would have me really say what i think i shall reply that i really do look upon him as one of byron s heroes whom misery has marked with a fatal brand   123.42621305562757
then all became clear and manifest to me and i reproached myself with what had happened as though i myself had done the guilty deed   77.2056749645409
really that is a good idea   132.4325892368032
he knew nothing   141.32956126097207
madame is searching for you everywhere   87.28976831856873
i have three who would be honored by joining in the sport with me   113.49556774259514
milady was about to cry out immediately but she reflected that such precipitation would not be very gracious toward d artagnan   89.10306418307599
you are not busoni   68.86724055700407
the door opened and bazin entered   79.01509604200518
monsieur my majordomo will there be a pie   125.97328714624828
muttered the four friends exchanging glances   164.559620693263
no friends left my lord   106.22610276316414
if he could have made any use of me he would have taken me with him   108.04539837026032
do you leave us thus so suddenly without any preparations for your journey without even a passport   132.03628669452672
and for whom for some grisette some chambermaid with whom i have trifled in some garrison   149.0709333402909
and what will that signify to me   141.97321851531674
are you sure that the other is dead   211.6152341580038
that such is my pleasure and that i answer for my will to no man   93.0142029367376
but entirely on account of her precautions the boatman had paid more attention to her and discovered that she was young and pretty   85.02763333828895
vitray said he you will go with all speed to london   124.91253820614027
that will be the simplest plan   91.44062705922414
and these men are in france my lord   90.5783193691621
worn out at length he fell asleep at daybreak and did not awake till late   65.90846451791887
faria since their first acquaintance had been on all points so rational and logical so wonderfully sagacious in fact that he could not understand how so much wisdom on all points could be allied with madness   97.16643189831466
shall we take our valets   120.9332557524876
he saw me this morning for the first time and has already forgotten he has seen me   54.65594099571433
it is unnecessary for you to bind yourself by any vow said he   176.51300974777047
if the serpent be dead why not its brood   107.85187085105868
his majesty will then take refuge in holland where i hear his highness the prince of wales now is   61.61942105768217
fernand more happy but not more at his ease for i saw at this time he was in constant dread of edmond s return fernand was very anxious to get his wife away and to depart himself   157.4134198480169
as i entered nîmes i literally waded in blood   102.51997729434473
he added putting his lantern on one of the casks   83.52650600913962
good bye for the present replied the count walking upon tiptoe towards the library door and smiling with an expression so sad and paternal that the young girl s heart was filled with gratitude   134.21611775021557
your pardon my officer said athos   125.44694481278458
and that executioner you saw that executioner who you say told you everything that executioner if he told you everything told you that he leaped with joy in avenging on her his brother s shame and suicide   32.71192625496438
caderousse s plans alarmed andrea still more than his ideas   175.406535953606
that is quite true said barrois   156.21386778060784
i will follow you then sir   124.46797490077597
before tomorrow   133.93825570503833
pray signor pastrini asked franz is not some execution appointed to take place today   153.49526390921622
but at these words so natural in themselves your father is indeed here and is seeking you young andrea started and exclaimed my father   142.3385407481896
we shall discover the cause of her sudden death and we shall say dear villefort if this thing has been caused by negligence watch over your servants   59.711172372285255
for his father s death he was in some manner prepared   175.74531395935279
we must return to paris   99.36839484887443
it is enough to have killed the mother said athos hoarsely   103.54295570033759
0335m there you see wife said the former this splendid diamond might all be ours if we chose   92.25243549891081
one of the agents appointed to secure the safety of paris   59.19130504128053
our breakfast is a philanthropic one and we shall have at table at least i hope so two benefactors of humanity   134.6221982827293
all those fighting citizens went out to battle and they have been massacred   83.50408009041236
and the rich caparison is that mine too   122.54232164395796
the jewel is worth at least fifty thousand francs   187.24520917637335
oh it concerns you very closely my uncle i am sure and you will soon be of my opinion added he with a smile which sent a shudder through the veins of him he thus addressed   115.63636234160714
the tutor cried halt   70.4833177812077
he opened his mouth to reply but with a haughty gesture the cardinal dismissed him   162.9639499551655
devoted to it   158.5121721644358
then i should become simply no   100.48438978221773
but i tell you a million   32.2351275470148
upon my honor said rochefort it takes you my dear countess to perform such miracles   133.70436945737353
why the fair is on at beaucaire there are always jewellers from paris there and i will show it to them   154.79669983963012
at la réserve the day before the betrothal feast   51.84658068845326
no replied the abbé it was not of such a size as that   50.0788949265967
now my dear host while your young man was insensible you did not fail i am quite sure to ascertain what that pocket contained   121.24720012155002
where has the favorite gone   113.24015791096225
if he says true said the captain doubtingly   119.80855117062646
but madame has not conciliated that little woman he was so fond of   60.464273439742165
it is extraordinary   94.12963700439448
and with a deep sigh he again sank into the reverie that had been interrupted by mordaunt   13.451075986171674
my recovery lasted six months   98.02796162756744
while working night and day i sometimes lose all recollection of the past and then i experience the same sort of happiness i can imagine the dead feel   83.48009179516882
the bishop affected to speak in a loud voice before every one of their previous interview   63.78216400491507
oh i saw the snare and i answered you would be quite in despair on your return   34.130838279686046
notwithstanding his youth master andrea was a very skilful and intelligent boy   102.54696786738418
all took their places or rather the ladies formed a circle while the gentlemen more indifferent to the restraints of what boileau calls the style énergique commented on the feverish agitation of andrea on m   109.3955724215908
on his return home albert expressed his wish to franz debray and morrel to see them at the opera that evening   153.54132989958055
yes here we are said porthos   191.52108331956734
yes i recognize the voice which speaks to me in my dreams   112.31960636399963
d artagnan resumed immediately the attitude of distrust that was habitual with him   45.12530577251944
besides d artagnan from her own admission knew milady culpable of treachery in matters more important and could entertain no respect for her   137.57728146454613
three of them stopped after an hour s gallop and one fell down   127.17005088073265
a detachment of carbineers fifteen abreast galloped up the corso in order to clear it for the barberi   156.83206071399061
they brought him into this room and placed sentinels at the doors and windows   52.783036460089264
listen replied felton in a low voice   179.01821136511558

he was very nearly at the end of his humoristic tether but one despairing effort saved him   41.70427602139861
the very same day the occupants of the apartments on the fifth floor of the house now become the property of dantès were duly informed by the notary who had arranged the necessary transfer of deeds etc   137.1013486687179
yes i was thinking whether we ought to come armed or not   86.05852964912566

this was albert s favorite lounging place   197.369815868089
now he continued withdraw a little and let me say my prayer i beseech you   53.638911956363515
the youths spurred on   108.98790900211
he went out chiefly to avoid this dangerous enemy and returned as late as possible in the evening   133.10012962059366
at ten o clock in the evening it is well known the streets in provincial towns are very little frequented   100.13835699669323
ah you are right monsieur said d artagnan   111.08643984401097
franz did not disturb him whilst he absorbed his favorite sweetmeat but when he had finished he inquired what then is this precious stuff   160.07241998403282
he instantly rose and cast the remainder of the bouquets into the carriage   178.27867114270484

a passage of st   134.12418011066706
well let s say no more about it   92.157254054671
d artagnan only required one reason to be satisfied   75.68642775359072

with me   110.24476877969684
exclaimed the executioner you use that word which sounds ever in my ears assassinated   161.01893951393276
and yet perhaps there still remains some hope   117.1394946792104
upon the side next the ground were scratched the following words eight of the light dragoons are pursuing us   157.68855669148718
yes and i say to you if you are really strong really superior really pious or impenetrable which you were right in saying amounts to the same thing then be proud sir for that is the characteristic of predominance   55.16662546894515
now my work is accomplished my mission is terminated now thou canst neither afford me pain nor pleasure   70.37036742027404
the man retired but not before examining the supposed juxon with an attention which did not escape the king   146.15111017779714
exactly so said d artagnan   93.63810132275142
and have you succeeded   27.17018508143407
noirtier may be right   143.20647916474465
so the duke had more than enough to think about   89.43377544659766
well my dear aramis you may enjoy that pleasure for one of those three horses is yours   78.65406578067083

bonacieux so much happiness is not in store for me   89.57756443777804
asked the lady   61.50157720082835
still i must own i am sorry to be obliged to give up the cart and the group of reapers it would have produced such an effect   70.8280073640299
perhaps some day they will want to make you king instead of the prince of wales or the duke of york your elder brothers   89.7754350636576
there again   111.02283778815345

at the age of five years   115.11153778712905
the sound of voices diminished by degrees in the adjoining chamber   91.51095013745315
mordaunt rapidly sprang back a step   79.77125755952774

dantès laid the different things he had been looking at on the table and stood with his head drooping on his breast as though overwhelmed by the perseverance and strength of faria s mind   127.59656010471569
the wall was built of rough stones among which to give strength to the structure blocks of hewn stone were at intervals imbedded   117.045222531752
maximilian leaped at one bound into his crop of lucern which he began to pull up in the most ruthless way under the pretext of being occupied in weeding it   79.90774637344123
all is paid   114.44448671479913

as he spoke and in the very direction he indicated a groan expressive of bitter grief was heard and a woman was seen waving her hand to a passenger on board the vessel about to sail   74.03520297786727
he cried this is no moment for compliments   160.251776866703
at this moment the clock of la samaritaine struck six   77.37220643523223
at least you don t speak well of him   165.4170875001034
i tore up several of my shirts and ripped out the seams in the sheets of my bed during my three years imprisonment at fenestrelle   51.383803517198906
it would be a pleasure worthy of a prince to travel upon such horses   88.69433299350202
if you absolutely insist   134.47432743019002
there were but three hôtels in this part of the street   88.60390563495825
my ideas are never so clear as when i have had plenty of wine   24.40041409199401

i am completely ignorant   101.21522961331677
moreover its port was the last in the kingdom of france open to the english and by closing it against england our eternal enemy the cardinal completed the work of joan of arc and the duc de guise   86.63236393803457
you have promised to save me from her anger   102.85857155249052
felton approached her and said lord de winter who is a catholic like yourself madame thinking that the deprivation of the rites and ceremonies of your church might be painful to you has consented that you should read every day the ordinary of your mass   34.375071493468155
i do not say that i did know it and i do not say that i did not know it   16.147552582639335
with your belt my lord   127.80594772784585
another to our holy father the pope who had it set in his tiara opposite to one nearly as large though not so fine given by the emperor napoleon to his predecessor pius vii   91.26008893139834
come i shall engage your passage   161.85363684425553
you are not so always   86.18304025004261
let us speak frankly continued louvieres and act in a straightforward manner   75.4907273266423
and i am sure that he came for quite another purpose monsieur cardinal   84.91068865200997
that is easily done said aramis   120.829071004582
14 greek militiamen in the war for independence   131.63710159244062
besides we are men   82.42908444056927
excuse me said the banker but you will tire yourself baroness by such late hours and m   167.448677874226
thank you d artagnan said comminges showing half of his body through the window of the broken vehicle thanks my young friend   134.3877402578773
at this instant the squadron that ought to have protected charles s retreat was advancing to meet the english regiments   178.76185261752346
although a christian may god forgive me i have always sought to revenge my illustrious father   120.85078977534818
i had it from aramis replied the musketeer   76.72683876439798
unhappy girl unhappy girl   94.95650306220817
and yet that is the most simple thing in the world my dear sister   146.98009142539115
as the day advanced the tumult became greater   95.92085267205616
in the first place i have never succeeded by that means   158.13307697867853
that s true said athos after a moment s silence that s true   95.59524203610452
that letter you have received and which you believe to be from madame de chevreuse well   47.21246680834031
well what does your instinct tell you now   154.21764832845122
dantès instantly turned to meet him   143.8658108650737
at length after occupying about an hour in these preparations he opened the door of the room in which the vicomte slept and entered   25.407172603331034
well then will you do as much for me in paris as franz did for you in rome   129.6117560382836
and if your eminence were to offer to make me at this moment governor of the castle of vincennes i should refuse it   140.62951811280294
40032m sir said franz i regret much that such a question has been raised in the presence of mademoiselle valentine   114.36164692512635
d artagnan returned   57.573648682496014
these are but indifferent marbles in this antechamber said monte cristo   43.03619084174311
if she flies kill her   112.6056935120039
in proof of which i may remark that while my family remained among the staunchest adherents of the exiled princes your father lost no time in joining the new government   97.05942207724563
sire interposed the minister of police i came a moment ago to give your majesty fresh information which i had obtained on this head when your majesty s attention was attracted by the terrible event that has occurred in the gulf and now these facts will cease to interest your majesty   131.67674985509362
yes yes continued he twill be the same as it was in england   182.14406664798702
attend to yourself   138.25249701805308
here they are   74.92884667782101
morrel as on his return to the port for the purpose of gleaning fresh tidings of dantès from m   171.5485185529627
villefort met them at the door of his study   113.81386186318989
that is not worth while said aramis you can have one of mine   147.29557467231342
moreover he was a viscount a recently created one certainly but in the present day it is not necessary to go as far back as noah in tracing a descent and a genealogical tree is equally estimated whether dated from 1399 or merely 1815   68.98816970310537
speak as fully as you please sir said the king who began to give way to the emotion which had showed itself in blacas s face and affected villefort s voice   105.11356548449034
can porthos have negotiated for it with the duc de longueville   101.96285047755762
when the chancellor had opened and shut twenty times the drawers of the secretaries it became necessary whatever hesitation he might experience it became necessary i say to come to the conclusion of the affair   191.46384540465897
at midnight the sentinel gave the alarm and in an instant all were on the alert   87.2015983888947
porthos alone made no reply   116.98195469725084
each step he trod oppressed his heart with fresh emotion   185.95562909467682
hallo dantès   106.31092065978852
d artagnan turned to porthos   37.21801667215685
shall you be happy if i do what you wish   69.86326814370433
as to remitting a letter with safety to her majesty said aramis coloring i will take that upon myself   25.016820685995256
bonacieux alone   119.14006267693478
no you were not for it was in reality a little boy   117.65516510849064
now it is time that the malady should be over said she   165.76385906050365
but the wine said d artagnan who furnishes the wine   134.8191680699552
he opened his eyes upon utter darkness   99.80111694616986
for they were now as athos had said all four once more united and of single mind   115.26115307124695
at the end of this time he gave up his search and gaetano smiled   149.58264292941016
relate what has passed during the night since these gentlemen desire to know it   99.60934003846398
a door opened through which the attendant and the baron disappeared   50.83766784950214
this demanded new effort but nothing compared to the first   36.454155316210844
ah sighed caderousse a man can not always feel happy because he is about to be married   107.72437922957985
but added he seriously you understand it is on the king s service   134.26967020435552
i shall therefore overlook your frivolous remarks   74.9693850576308
i am as i trust you do not doubt your devoted du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds   91.2051777965345
will you permit me to inquire said madame de villefort as she arose to take her leave whether you usually reside here   189.55136485780963
take my clerk to the bank and you will see him leave it with an order on the treasury for the same sum   199.07755900409575
bazin set out the next day for tours and was allowed eight days for performing his commission   74.6786504891551
all eyes were fixed upon this man whose words were listened to with anxious attention   103.44370074901606
give him alms bazin and bid him pray for a poor sinner   78.3409123011943
you are saying to yourself fifteen days twenty days   135.21589262716037
the count and franz ascended seven or eight steps after the chief who drew back a bolt and opened a door   104.19861690855252
the peasants were in great commotion   77.65380860709499
what signal   132.0744858503612
now said monte cristo turning towards morrel i may depend upon you may i not   228.93244432648567
threw into a drawer of his secretaire which he left open all the pocket money he had about him and with it the thousand fancy jewels from his vases and his jewel boxes   111.41571163641433
all day dantès walked up and down his cell   153.72198540676033
downstairs in the decanter   104.3411766887239
d artagnan left m   177.05211763626446
you hold the bit too tight and so make his mouth hard so that you will not be able to make him manoeuvre quickly   90.3314683533528
madame de villefort wishes to remind you sir he said that eleven o clock has just struck and that the trial commences at twelve   69.36972765061714
only think of the poor old man s being so pleased to think that you who were a perfect stranger to him had been made an officer of the legion of honor   153.7887942248542
but to be in the midst of persons elevated by myself to places of honor who ought to watch over me more carefully than over themselves for my fortune is theirs before me they were nothing after me they will be nothing and perish miserably from incapacity ineptitude   73.55518261509101
true monsieur le comte replied d artagnan who felt that by degrees athos was resuming that great influence which aristocracy had over him   123.66370756247466
the young man prepared for this scene by the state of his own feelings which were mournful and by the majesty of the cathedral which he had passed through descended in a slow and solemn manner and stood with head uncovered before these mortal spoils of the last king who was not to be placed by the side of his forefathers until his successor should take his place there   78.6823760924571
you can imagine so since i have not even brought my carriage out yet   92.32526818021785
well my lord before i became a confectioner i myself was three years sergeant in the piedmontese regiment and before i became sergeant i was for eighteen months the servant of monsieur d artagnan   9.511779367519068
if your eminence is disguised it will be almost easy   241.47823795769142
have you ever seen a snake rise up on your path   48.84151266650711
everyone exists   94.62793886010515
if you would but accept my offers   87.88773773187145
then she threw herself upon her knees and began to pray   141.52283524647243
the cardinal would reply with the sarcastic calmness of the skeptic strong at once by power and genius you should not have allowed yourself to be taken   31.18378786237703
cried la ramee give me your gibbet my lord   154.36248560043754
her looks her eyes her smile were all for morrel   103.54404811604397
neffer replied the swiss enchanted that a man like athos could envy him anything   64.26157073601459
but pardon me here are the health officers and the customs inspectors coming alongside   73.09092234184932
that he has given the diamond to us only   189.48454285762358
he answered the appeal of his friend by an affirmative nod of the head   123.61510575179909
and he assured them that they would be perfectly satisfied   126.82786177124483
we need hardly say that many of those who gave him this epithet repeated it because they had heard it and did not even know what it meant   146.53714947569705
then with his hands covered with dirt his hair darkened by means of a leaden comb his complexion embrowned with a preparation for which one of his old comrades had given him the recipe he intended by following the wooded districts to reach the nearest frontier walking by night and sleeping in the day in the forests and quarries and only entering inhabited regions to buy a loaf from time to time   134.62489897476144
come if you will only put this scheme into execution and be steady nothing could be better   166.45628683776857
and turning to her grandfather she repeated wa we wi the old man stopped her at the last syllable   157.97518978162407
i wish you may with all my heart if that will amuse you   138.8290609717125
la carconte still kept her eyes fixed on her husband but as he made no sign of changing his position she extended her hard bony hand and touched him on the forehead   163.84289484015858
and why day after to morrow   134.3871985585183
let us first withdraw from this house   192.13109692310843
but the thing itself is at m   40.26467992045876
the moon lighted the group   85.4128383463381
give the horses some hay   132.1420323312081
it may be useful to you one of these days whether you remain here or return to the east   222.60083945779053
when i see you merely you look like a reasonable being   63.8327352619587
now said felton we are safe   194.526732564734
well like all paris i shall be there too said the count   69.28757374101062
the comte de la fere can not be far off only the doors are locked   73.26575983286098
d artagnan looked at his friends as if to say well what did i tell you   134.85843277829426
tis a matter of conscience with them as with us   86.56628649066485
a million   98.60743290609496
he picked up the paper and recognizing his wife s writing ran his eyes rapidly over its contents   65.88271982252365
bravo bravo said franz   61.268731660802985
on the eve of departure i carry my egotism so far as to say do not forget me my kind friends for probably you will never see me again   161.635232654936
you see said the young man with an air of sorrowful resignation to faria that god deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for what you call my devotion to you   88.93301401517463
i am not much of a hand at figures so that i live almost from hand to mouth   63.7325275953449
but i wanted first to see if thou wert grown proud   182.79227635210339
god s justice   130.74562442626672
the contract answered dantès laughingly it didn t take long to fix that   146.51300660044853
the thing was discussed for a long time but finally decided in his favor   71.5700473364171
for a very serious matter which bids fair to make work for the executioner   127.4099533519971
shells   26.952671500786337
then infusing all the humility he possessed into his eyes and voice he addressed the inspector and sought to inspire him with pity   41.51912555489834
chapter 72   66.71214558841562
and when we have been alarmed we see nothing but trouble   88.42850195925456
perhaps all blood demands some expiation   119.52250591710326
dantès had carefully noted the general appearance of the shore and instead of landing at the usual place he dropped anchor in the little creek   88.74969552089053
only he is not quite sure about the women for they did not come in until after he had taken hashish so that what he took for women might have been simply a row of statues   172.39572077376002
what are you thinking of this evening   72.0756976444965
indeed maximilian did you hear that   57.118020592111435
sir replied he if you came to me with the idea of demanding satisfaction you should have gone at once to the point and not have entertained me with the idle conversation to which i have been patiently listening for the last half hour   81.06493677094336
tis settled replied d artagnan   113.06550664019939
now then let us breakfast   52.89947364847304
that s well madame   196.15475817717441
he approached and soon recognized the coachman   112.03501582770271
we shall ascertain who and what he is he comes   76.24166418875274
since then monsieur de beaufort has become an enemy of the state   132.76249556461056
all the crowd gave way before morrel   87.69557994046785
i speak to you when i can catch you   117.97221543178199
they were both aroused at seven o clock by the entrance of an unliveried servant who brought a letter for d artagnan   130.4817643179679
the king pointed this out   95.21331047559738
but by degrees watch chains necklaces parti colored scarves embroidered bodices velvet vests elegantly worked stockings striped gaiters and silver buckles for the shoes all disappeared   140.87589087782382
the two friends departed aramis to return to paris athos to take measures preparatory to an interview with the queen   181.87130537392352
asked peppino of his friend   150.27330562791855
at the top of the stairs upon the most conspicuous door of the corridor was traced in black ink a gigantic number 1   104.56925979666974
so suddenly   174.9931201125807
although they gained you much reputation they were surpassed by others   117.7281459546499
oh no he was afraid to encounter him face to face   125.50180113842416
de saint méran oh doctor   75.49538851458637
but a letter which madame bonacieux has received from madame the constable and which she has had the imprudence to show me leads me to believe that these four men on the contrary are on the road hither to take her away   89.67779285369693
he neither supplicated nor exclaimed   115.76609816447927
it is very simple mousqueton had said   139.4184947571182
you still leave me the love which i have always enjoyed   167.09034660671387
these two men were the executioner s assistants   130.2292664749072
and athos threw fifteen paces from him an empty bottle from which he had poured the last drop into his glass   70.39735509936841
i have told you of her attempts to propitiate m   60.86606259273035
i will begin again then order to conduct to the person named charlotte backson branded by the justice of the kingdom of france but liberated after chastisement   187.45618807598905
no indeed replied monte cristo with a smile i do not arrogate to myself the right of so doing   85.82114500611448
planchet was armed with his musketoon and a pistol   163.64382279761668
the horses bounded beneath the whip   77.23074845686276
he has six millions worth   90.74512312274848
for as you very well know bois tracy is an intimate friend of mine and i can not allow the property of his wife to be sported as a trophy   146.44087600935467
again the wounded man opened his eyes and looked in astonishment at these strangers who appeared to pity him   71.99510408669346
god forbid that the queen should suffer the least inconvenience or uneasiness on my account   112.44850345842958
no be not anxious   99.76336783182684
nobody serves me for nothing   119.63065979252421
cried the guards and they drew back respectfully to let the two friends pass   85.56126993025848
tis some travellers who are visiting the colosseum by torchlight   63.66617006968716
la ramee sent away the guards desiring them to drink to the duke s health and as soon as they were gone shut all the doors put the keys in his pocket and showed the table to the prince with an air that signified whenever my lord pleases   97.50261765309817
franz was not sufficiently egotistical to stop albert in the middle of an adventure that promised to prove so agreeable to his curiosity and so flattering to his vanity   174.23916918680078
i will prevent you   122.9030683761805
said the lady glancing inquiringly at lucien m   54.3112532551212
noirtier raised his eyes it was the sign agreed on between him and valentine when he wanted anything   138.17093983143442
improve yourself   62.30041148857355
was that my soul if i may say so waked in my sleeping body   106.80681160100896
these words were an allusion to the sentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much confidence an hour before   172.72463657361857
yes said porthos that is a duchess of my acquaintance whom i have great trouble to meet on account of the jealousy of her husband and who sent me word that she should come today to this poor church buried in this vile quarter solely for the sake of seeing me   160.78810588568368
all the same i should like to do him that service what do you say to it   133.12025058330843
i have uttered it when frozen with cold crouched on the straw in my dungeon   89.83976321418535
in any case sir you will allow replied madame danglars that even if the fault were alone mine i last night received a severe punishment for it   110.67372413046094
he immediately called d artagnan   66.5450785465833
had you commissioned me   108.41207927866674
you see said raoul we have done wisely   134.26377106014772
then calling to the crew he said let go   114.23522602233605
there is the port he murmured   75.26930575569787
which they deserve do they not   72.55399564071985
having in a few words thanked the district doctor he turned to d avrigny and said and now the priest   57.93441559536395
wild eyes the iris of which contracts or dilates at pleasure said debray   126.10026563305765
the idea of asking how i hear the news he said   100.19537787819192
this must be one of your friends   139.41313291309353
but when after they had all got in it came to his turn there was great danger that in putting his huge leg over the edge of the boat he would upset the little vessel   139.61548403174538
i have one the seal of which i am not to break till i reach london   140.81171418586166
see what confidence i have in you   150.05164229132328
la renaudot warms his sheets   75.17144307348478
i will not dishonor you since that would be dishonor to myself   158.0708803812238
he said taking up his hat which he placed on the red handkerchief tied round his head we will soon find out   96.50163544371092
thus the terrible secret which beauchamp had so generously destroyed appeared again like an armed phantom   194.12938630114638
but you my dear d artagnan what has happened to you   158.02099556748112
from valentine the young man looked towards noirtier   127.98244056792444
duke said the queen blushing never speak of that evening   124.98136905910847
your logic is most powerful valentine but say what you will i can never renounce the sentiment which has instinctively taken possession of my mind   92.44816177503729
the chemist who came here with me   126.14194607172193

my faith monsieur   152.62655264980043
you surprise me   61.889107596718
oh no sir said madame danglars   116.24868947179479
mousqueton cried d artagnan let us be off   192.47863251379192
then the prince said take notice that in all probability he will be disguised as a cavalier   97.85212772188035
at the gate of the cemetery morrel made an excuse to wait   97.2633517077095
villefort hung his head d avrigny approached nearer and noirtier said yes with his eyes   97.16709720808765
adieu monsieur de rochefort he said   140.07357170704265
her eyes raised towards heaven were watching a silvery cloud gliding over the azure its form that of a shadow mounting towards heaven   154.35802840547342
ah he ll come round thought d artagnan   125.93669188334673

not more than five or six hundred thousand francs said lord wilmore   97.21369980451044
one of them passed around to the right of the carriage the other to the left   85.1207384893011
he was an athletic gigantic bandit with large eyes thick lips and a flat nose   36.14371002028217
you do then obey someone   164.80478366212702
de winter smiled sorrowfully and shook his head   124.30198283095805
and monsieur leaves me here alone   82.58495986811705
then internally if renée could see me i hope she would be satisfied and would no longer call me a decapitator   65.55986652662995
there are no tears in my eyes nor is there fever in my veins yet i see you suffer you maximilian whom i love as my own son   160.0354712585582
no cried d artagnan no steel   126.00537219313127
and in spite of his efforts to prevent it the eyes of edmond were suffused in tears as he reflected that on that spot the old man had breathed his last vainly calling for his son   129.57502830612304
the queen uttered a piercing cry at finding herself surprised for in her trouble she did not at first recognize the young woman who had been given to her by laporte   151.9901043619155
milady who had arisen threw herself quickly into the armchair her head thrown back her beautiful hair unbound and disheveled her bosom half bare beneath her crumpled lace one hand on her heart and the other hanging down   99.50516397721802
and i wish to know what has become of our young man   187.62959073267703

but where did you get all these details   120.27880986811037
and besides we have a prisoner said athos pointing to raoul   180.89028300448535
but we will send to the villers coterets and noyon roads and search the forest when we shall catch him no doubt   20.136376030107016
if we had only been looking for porthos porthos would have stationed himself in one of the finest hotels and we could easily have traced him   17.880534529226168
i can not cry   119.05290008205665
oh for pity s sake said she you will live will you not   144.76267049946117
major cavalcanti is already one perhaps   143.15931240530458
d artagnan then returned home in thoughtful mood finding a somewhat lively pleasure in carrying mazarin s bag of money and thinking of that fine diamond which he had once called his own and which he had seen on the minister s finger that night   119.3044747381085
the frenchman threw her a bouquet   101.43351449974313
this parallel disturbed his usual politeness the philosophy he witnessed appalled him he muttered a few words of general civility and ran downstairs   60.2013044807453
you must be aware at all events that it is impossible for me to understand motives before they are explained to me   102.17761600352367
and the two men embraced each other after the fashion of actors on the stage   149.76972550665337
the two sentinels at the door still had their swords unsheathed but they were leaning on them while they watched the game   131.72675183163224
he to whom you have confided your destiny he from whom death would have separated you calls you to him   77.19385469984269
replied d artagnan and disappeared   147.7770970712171
no sir said the honest servant it was monsieur aramis who posted me here to take care of the horses   117.03826015373113
well in the absence of champagne and chambertin you must content yourselves with that   119.88969228861316
the honor bestowed on me is too great for me to be unmindful of it   94.69536469856045
the marquis de saint méran one of the most zealous and faithful dignitaries of louis xviii   156.78475213611256
it is not for nothing that i am styled louis the just and he signed emery s appointment   65.82211288893848
come monsieur come   79.31874403502526
is it not natural that the madman ignorant of his folly should attempt things beyond his power   108.54978437784997
she wore a beaver hat with blue feathers a surtout of gray pearl velvet fastened with diamond clasps and a petticoat of blue satin embroidered with silver   34.15061643917362
this commissary was a man of very repulsive mien with a pointed nose with yellow and salient cheek bones with eyes small but keen and penetrating and an expression of countenance resembling at once the polecat and the fox   112.79986325077367
enter   92.12447241997398
i was to take your dispatches written or verbal and return by post   63.285534328520015
he was about to marry her when one of the caprices of fate which would almost make us doubt the goodness of providence if that providence did not afterwards reveal itself by proving that all is but a means of conducting to an end one of those caprices deprived him of his mistress of the future of which he had dreamed for in his blindness he forgot he could only read the present and cast him into a dungeon   5.9181379258527755
said the monk   88.14955306384759
the barber gazed in amazement at this man with the long thick and black hair and beard which gave his head the appearance of one of titian s portraits   109.12151271369846
i only said that death alone could check the execution of my plans   77.85996870707822
and the greek princess will she be here   132.78709245929545
the shortest follies are best my dear caderousse   94.4866526472516
for it is not life it is merely existence in prison   128.66762497655498
yes before others replied the doctor   113.86859567861136
my god how agitated you seem   83.5329865501032
cardinalists or frondeurs what matters it   150.919590950324
in that case let there be no more question of what s past and let aramis resume the letter from his cousin where the cardinal interrupted him   197.93034705368964
but the cunning purchaser asked no troublesome questions concerning a bargain by which he gained a round profit of at least eighty per cent   109.20339261132739
alas sir exclaimed barrois a great misfortune has happened   5.751286675716827
and the count desired me to tell you that he should take advantage of this visit to plead for you and for himself   101.84240661300846
why with his father no doubt replied danglars   30.598079896134706
this sediment first took a blue shade then from the color of sapphire it passed to that of opal and from opal to emerald   90.94315965854375
then when we asked them what were their intentions the master replied that he had forty charges to fire and that he and his lackey would fire to the last one before he would allow a single soul of us to set foot in the cellar   84.9157234549177
but what signifies that   194.05166097998398
let me rise and obtain some success this very day   64.00515551685544
he is young it is true but he seems to me a thorough seaman and of full experience   99.24998150692696
he does not wish you to know that it comes from him   93.0826026411232
why what would you have more   174.67287043243306
it was not uncommon for richelieu and louis xiii   110.56216775618095
imponite manus and not manum place the hands not the hand   221.37254232842628
he has escaped by this means exclaimed he   162.38992476956756
you have no idea then morrel   151.4370702705881
yes i know it said the soldier   143.21406485822206
old men are always so selfish in their affection said madame de villefort   103.51518641762664
three poor gentlemen escorted by a prince of the church   89.69909827418772
d artagnan was beside himself with joy   51.748481043012724
the table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope near san pierdarena a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by report   117.66901704487923
morrel had in reality no hope but the return of the pharaon of whose departure he had learnt from a vessel which had weighed anchor at the same time and which had already arrived in harbor   100.59484290106754
at each corner were arranged trophies presenting to view swords of all sorts and on the walls hung four great pictures representing in their ordinary military costume the cardinal de lorraine the cardinal de richelieu the cardinal de la valette and the archbishop of bordeaux   112.10108278121017
i ll tell you answered the countess   62.75759783829217
now he was accustomed to walk with his fowling piece on his shoulder behind the hedges which border the roads and when he saw a catholic coming alone the protestant religion immediately prevailed in his mind   189.31275802579438
vampa then removed the stone and cucumetto came out   184.48475350893793
the count of monte cristo is always an early riser   125.15308309333517
a thousand francs sir   105.45595442343955
his resolution not to sign lasted two days after which he offered a million for some food   36.65497110935162
40116m drink it said the doctor to barrois   113.9679192529894
bazin my friend come here   106.2980569080263

as captain of the musketeers m   85.42417652722793
for i doubt whether her pride will ever allow her to return to france   94.72404281405531
the musketeer touched his cap and went away to execute the orders thus received   105.73884085298616
mercédès although deposed from the exalted position she had occupied lost in the sphere she had now chosen like a person passing from a room splendidly lighted into utter darkness appeared like a queen fallen from her palace to a hovel and who reduced to strict necessity could neither become reconciled to the earthen vessels she was herself forced to place upon the table nor to the humble pallet which had become her bed   60.49824560622219
chapter lx   141.31633674078697
we do ourselves justice madame even in assuming the high position that we have   144.33640355286406
and the old servant departed triumphantly on his mission   92.30976810305897
there is no longer a vehmgericht or free tribunals   173.9697957313042
menaces i do not fear them   108.83451567354851
the noise of boots and spurs resounded on the stairs   187.04787619987013
the porter was in attendance   106.51918320596708
my dear monsieur de rochefort mazarin replied in a tone of raillery you think yourself still a young man   138.93570477521385
cried many persons present   226.9589222689936
still my young scapegrace   207.90121875361447
the woman looked up at these words and with a glance far more expressive than any entreaties could have been pointed to her child who still continued insensible   120.75818396405728
he is extremely prudent and thoughtful   108.96612353370297
abandon my purpose at the moment of its accomplishment   121.27650812747112
athos in his turn smiled also   154.36748368913265
aramis continued my dear cousin his eminence the cardinal whom god preserve for the happiness of france and the confusion of the enemies of the kingdom is on the point of putting an end to the hectic rebellion of la rochelle   43.1123541785328
two stone steps worn away by the friction of many feet led to the door which was made of three planks   145.94303838618174
lucullus dines with lucullus   173.9239444470784
it appears that our journey was a remounting journey then   111.97700849117781
you should not have allowed him to go said the duke to franz   159.94720600655597
he had recognized intelligence in the high forehead courage in the dark eye and bent brow and frankness in the thick lips that showed a set of pearly teeth   182.89468166606568
look yonder   62.83567428742161
the messenger obeyed without the least hesitation but rather with alacrity and mounting the steps at a bound entered the hotel   98.17076915231273
in fact the rochellais had made a sortie during the night and had retaken a bastion of which the royal army had gained possession two days before   86.09235688802703
i own i was seeking them   155.10064027521875
why about ten or eleven o clock   107.77108698947725
a young man who still adheres to my fallen fortunes passes a part of his time in a belvedere at the top of the house in hopes of being the first to announce good news to me   109.59485858326599
fix it this way   30.193759032369897
mazarin bowed   133.51652519301868
the salon in mahogany and the furnishings were of blue velvet   110.02726367011519
this is not the way that i wished to avenge myself said milady replacing the glass upon the table with an infernal smile but my faith   61.47850677398815
the glass cutter had entered and was feeling his way his arms stretched out before him   74.5375757573143
he clenched his fists sweat covered his face his hair like hamlet s stood on end and racked with fury he cried out silence sir   191.34247005584706
he is certain to reach the other   64.18449204078115
27 said the inspector   190.66014201938793
when his son had left him morrel remained an instant standing with his eyes fixed on the door   85.1740234433021
i think these fellows will never come   111.7671407501213
i think a little exertion would do me good   135.6783123510923
it was alas   156.9976710319092
porthos who had lost the fifty pistoles he had won the night before and thirty more besides was very cross and questioned d artagnan with a nudge of the knee as to whether it would not soon be time to change the game   135.4723492752466
the day was passed at saint peter s alone   100.50260497514721
are you not alone   103.4007101230774
but in spite of albert s hope the day passed unmarked by any incident excepting two or three encounters with the carriage full of roman peasants   111.45902980220374
the riot becomes a revolution   127.93994936777241
do not be too hasty m   87.31499426575061
de rothschild   113.5531772308947
the throng was terrific and it was not till after much pushing and some fighting that our friends reached their destination   130.72983060395296
the bottle was brought with a promptness which showed the degree of consideration d artagnan enjoyed in the establishment   126.34513828606663
a few dingy olives and stunted fig trees struggled hard for existence but their withered dusty foliage abundantly proved how unequal was the conflict   180.34366410966584
asked raoul somewhat comforted   89.90373651820721
you have read the letter   138.48242896040955
then one more bold than the rest ventured to pass the door and to advance on tiptoe   82.2944932636533
to think of the parisians soliloquized d artagnan offering only the other day by an edict of the parliament six hundred thousand francs to any man soever who would deliver up the cardinal to them dead or alive if alive in order to hang him   97.30871032883329
in the eyes of everybody it seemed fit for table and preserved its wholesome appearance   131.12122254699693
bring him to see me   135.4339783755042
the face of this young woman was covered with a black velvet mask   86.58871619720709
the keeper spoke for a moment with an official then opened the iron gates and conducted andrea to a room on the first floor   124.22401439810947
had i been as great a friend of jonah as i am of d artagnan i should have followed him even into the inside of the whale itself   99.36564428439286
yes so long as he pays me you ll honor and believe him that s right   181.48207568602783
is the world filled with tigers and crocodiles   146.05059913125552
it is not i who strike m   112.66821002890327
do me the favor to accompany me and i will conduct you to headquarters   94.11269831369917
aramis spoke so as to be heard by everybody   140.8056569528573
it destroyed in favor of the court the struggle commenced with parliament   79.58799268701179
i hope my coming will not put you to any inconvenience   117.58720644819793
to die whilst doing a good deed   75.28358448381229
they are lucky here indeed   52.05644100043857
i ve broken my man s skull cried d artagnan   179.53838267205583
four times fifteen makes sixty six thousand livres said athos   115.41419066629881
ah monseigneur cried d artagnan spare me the weight of your displeasure   178.80231764406102
porthos didn t understand any too clearly   82.66353451992875
and i should therefore never think of including him in any general order   84.01899908698635
oh it will happen you may be sure said d artagnan   130.1498510449774
they are your compatriots   168.1244264699403
morrel in a corner of the carriage allowed his brother in law s gayety to expend itself in words while he felt equal inward joy which however betrayed itself only in his countenance   143.1773151547763
whilst we are alone let us speak of ourselves replied de winter   107.33383682875386
we bring to his widow his sword and cross of honor   93.43251127955077
you speak as if you were already her husband   111.86852071468464
but that abduction had for its object the betrayal of my mistress to draw from me by torture confessions that might compromise the honor and perhaps the life of my august mistress   114.84394302809294
suppose i refuse   176.01980913818227
i do not think that for he has complained of feeling almost suffocated and asked why the venetian blinds were not opened as well as the windows   69.50115907393138
you see felton the drama has gone through all the phases i named   149.4387448485681
well mademoiselle what are you thinking about standing there like a statue   79.72127798116013
everything said olivain to athos has been done according to your directions   159.7706107250336
teresa felt a flush pass over her face   112.78473698221902
call laporte   158.41247816118602
i am lodged like a chartreux   79.3234081003322
do you think the same hand which unintentionally struck barrois has now attacked valentine   101.14044818019948
one of the good blades of his kingdom was accustomed to say that if he had a friend who was about to fight he would advise him to choose as a second himself first and tréville next or even perhaps before himself   103.86914946313657
they heard the street door close then m   139.00137766318488
has the host told you nothing then   54.60663399131749
the day after that you received a visit from cavois resumed the cardinal   88.71004780994699
the usher introduced him and retired without speaking a word   147.51527298393998
and with his lackey he took the road to the governor s country house   53.915421834710784
the promise it was indeed maximilian morrel who had passed a wretched existence since the previous day   57.103948770244976
his proper vocation had always been the sword and he was delighted whenever he could draw it from the scabbard no matter for whom or against whom   132.84578274314015
if he makes any noise stifle him   75.23090030413303
the crime is fragrant   125.5214822757761
i am going to sleep twenty four hours   85.70246491419076
the men and consequently the women are but shadows and love is a sentiment to which you cry fie   54.37533043482829
madame danglars surveyed her husband with a look of withering contempt   161.39403082796744
the door closed   49.14362768405181
you have an order signed by the cardinal   177.46352384411045
with the rapid instinct of selfishness caderousse readily perceived the solidity of this mode of reasoning   28.387745036174394
he visited his own dungeon   194.895978843786
d artagnan remained fixed to the spot astounded and not knowing what to think   145.39943614944718
wretched men   135.59589218352963
and he gave him his hand   130.7772588953216
his features bore no sign of that deep emotion which stops the beating of the heart and blanches the cheek   123.9759841407117
that s true said the guardsman astonished that his name had not produced more effect upon the young man   70.53814008648646
having reached the summit of his vengeance by a long and tortuous path he saw an abyss of doubt yawning before him   122.02745971425024
it has happened and i really can not pretend to lament it   167.35281096604268
and it was here that he received grisier cooks and charles leboucher   89.47864176787711
my wife and my daughter would die of it   151.64481649661994
i am quite sure that on the contrary he will choose everything as i wish   49.99208786868493
he made a last effort to extend his hand but it fell powerless beside him   127.18214786378253
at the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage which instead of stopping this time at the end of the rue férou drove up to the green door   98.70799343598654
who has betrayed me   142.23319223581208
sir resumed the cardinal you are to come with me or rather i am to go with you   55.13952252643194
during the five or six years that he had lived in the strictest intimacy with his companions porthos and aramis they could remember having often seen him smile but had never heard him laugh   125.10211880865346
and the inseparables were constantly to be met with seeking one another from the luxembourg to the place st   2.7669923403438474
when i am happy i wish all the world to be so   82.35633681617773
asked one who appeared to be the leader of the party   207.73256909190064
i assure you replied the old man i did not turn to that source for recreation or support   101.21846860874093
very well then said mazarin   110.91880949004064
that she owed him nothing but a little gratitude for having delivered her from the men in black who wished to carry her off and that she had promised him nothing   127.58406095170422
at length she felt his heart beat a faint breath played upon his lips a slight shudder announcing the return of life passed through the young man s frame   90.11432089441568
but now it was a different thing   82.9332168581746
what fortune   200.89526882263056
what ails our friend   183.10653247383166
mother said the young man you know how gladly i would obey your wish but an urgent and important affair obliges me to leave you for the whole evening   127.03344886154868
aramis blushing in spite of himself took the letter which was in a large coarse hand and not particular for its orthography   130.63934507285893
when i invited him three months ago he was then at rome but since that time who knows where he may have gone   41.98489814114086
she held a book in her hand and her arm was supported by a cushion   105.66428214393885
my lord i am twenty three years of age   112.7390577310109
the night passed in perfect silence   132.8651235041632
exclaimed athos what were you saying just now about growing old   5.695173510290857
his manner became more and more lofty every instant   121.949751033497
i had none but what i made for myself   115.4650217888049
are you going to leave us count   158.46152234103192
and yet as you come from dax or pau from tarbes said d artagnan   104.53952486136004
do you fancy because you have heard monsieur de tréville speak to us a little cavalierly today that other people are to treat us as he speaks to us   154.41074987375274
the cold gains upon me   110.25985125785782
as for that m   136.52082276100796
the heart beat the eyes laughed and they felt that the life they were perhaps going to lose was after all a good thing   127.68888408139944
ah there   125.75971217946744
i presume that she has returned to tours   156.6694956996741
in gastronomy   56.911936809866106
but my dear count said albert we shall abuse your kindness   147.36626906851154
but as he spoke the barrel of a pistol was presented at his breast and these words were pronounced touch it not   106.11259873833703
have we come to any   38.465818495728485
but what do you advise me to do   21.241759435549085
then did you see him edmond   48.91377030293737
was it ever known who this miserable fellow was   49.987908300084854
and he gentlemen was my brother   152.0947276385275
unfortunately there is a proverb which says that red is either altogether good or altogether bad   113.92412699789006
he had formed an acquaintance with all the smugglers on the coast and learned all the masonic signs by which these half pirates recognize each other   120.72590166360561
noirtier saw him seat himself with an appearance of perfect indifference at the same time giving a side look at valentine which made her understand that she also was to remain in the room   85.92175962273426
if after having made me swallow twelve drops instead of ten you see that i do not recover then pour the rest down my throat   85.24578438264788
there you will find hay and straw for them   187.552462753695
this is not his writing   115.26272481936931
40122m have mercy on my child sir murmured villefort   150.76614261979776
the count signified his intention of dining alone and that no one but ali should attend him   155.2525036452823
why do you offer me 4 000 000 for what is worth 5 000 000   137.43337926771434
raoul motioned to the host to approach threw a crown upon the table mounted his horse and posted his letter at senlis   157.19653206978668
d artagnan as he crossed the pont neuf congratulated himself on having found planchet again for at that time an intelligent servant was essential to him   67.90306821429337
de boville formerly an inspector of prisons sends to me from the prefect of police   180.5173858644651
my   176.70527606796287
here my lord here said she keep this in memory of me   117.47784298281444
at this spot milady had come out of the wood and entered the carriage   110.9970192934209
morrel pronounced these words with perfect calmness   141.29202115253992
come said d artagnan who thought that it was now a convenient time to begin his interrogations dost thou know where athos is   93.58017821840399
d avrigny unable to bear the sight of this touching emotion turned away   221.76364956493836
oh sir how good you are   105.73201885638413
let me fight like a woman then   118.2121249429847
as the ransom of a young christian slave of eleven years of age named haydée the acknowledged daughter of the late lord ali tepelini pasha of yanina and of vasiliki his favorite   159.40253908252956
you had dreamed that a ship had entered the harbor at le havre that this ship brought news that a payment we had looked upon as lost was going to be made   104.96733266091204
this door was a mockery to the concierge from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it was free and like that famous portal in the arabian nights opening at the sesame of ali baba it was wont to swing backward at a cabalistic word or a concerted tap from without from the sweetest voices or whitest fingers in the world   181.078226754968
i expect himself   114.13196960377752
no but by browsing the shrubs and trees that grow out of the crevices of the rocks   170.76505078591572
officer   79.99419539986778
i believed you dead   103.10311910798514
do you propose to me to do so d artagnan   35.712984620747335
he consigned his unknown persecutors to the most horrible tortures he could imagine and found them all insufficient because after torture came death and after death if not repose at least the boon of unconsciousness   191.96639658226826
i have heard he had three or four millions   81.43632246350458
but how shall i ascertain   73.50657287334252
julie threw herself into the arms of the count   68.63544387597543
well now your hand young man   192.70054037727107
jussac one of the first swordsmen in the kingdom   86.93862602840552
the captain obeyed   198.09421562737114
god who knows all knows without doubt   149.8822961658762
i am free then sir   73.70958303510804
added caderousse   120.30577447076166
athos wished to restrain him but it was too late   50.71813065442846
oh your majesty exclaimed laporte monsieur d artagnan is right   205.8188752326639
said she closing the window with an expression of countenance full of affection and melancholy   93.3694327960396
yes he said   58.39632064647615
he felt a carpet under his feet a door opened perfumes surrounded him and a brilliant light dazzled his eyes   195.92564290924165
asked the father   118.25128626367167
by heavens   76.23062314677017
adieu valentine repeated morrel   123.57596852293625
ah it s all over   117.13317658416655
is it not the desire of seeing a husband again from whom you have been separated for a week   66.8327906695246
de villefort and valentine at the same time   103.58677949388705
they were attired as peasants of albano velletri civita castellana and sora   153.11678483193555
come finish your cup of coffee said monte cristo   149.261247990355
so edmond had to separate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the guide marks were   158.35026223513913
and from time to time you can call upon me just to tell me how you are getting on and to say whether i can be of further service to you   118.51020112917841
she took the risk upon herself   160.098708434759
and he showed the hole i had made when i broke through   44.30465294395404
however the morning of the appointment the young man had established himself in the small salon downstairs   77.02878060259314
15 on the corner of a mantelpiece in a small room on the fifth floor   74.08156975368048
his eminence entered the chamber which served him as a study and made a sign to rochefort to bring in the young musketeer   80.04053999343009
for peppino   66.01706990176922
de villefort in condemning a culprit to death   54.76737548883923
mazarin thought that some one was going to assassinate him and he drew back pushing his chair on the castors   98.7906937865026
the turnkey closed the door behind them   118.59370052203477
well my friend there is not a moment to lose   142.0064472716317
i simply told them where you were   96.84363883159465
the coadjutor dragged along with his fugitive forces passed near the group formed by athos raoul and aramis   92.25668945784413
but this supposition also disappeared like the first when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his recruit   96.77148048922481
remarked danglars affecting to pity the young man from the bottom of his heart   161.27350044039653
he contemplated with unspeakable delight the large diamond which shone on the major s little finger   99.23387335292217
and then it must be confessed fernand had never been hated he was only not precisely loved   91.32476508034854
we will not answer then   183.8233230018445
i shall need all my strength to struggle with myself and support my grief in secret as you say   231.0150173270171
and at the first glance he recognized their date their country and their origin   110.03772944174531
gentlemen said he if monsieur d artagnan will surrender his sword to me and join his word to yours i shall be satisfied with your promise to convey monsieur d artagnan to the quarters of monseigneur the cardinal   151.13773254569548
these individuals are under arrest   38.558138304292754
should i have obtained the requisite pardon for peppino the two outside windows will be hung with yellow damasks and the centre with white having a large cross in red marked on it   108.9037140258019
there has been no arrest   55.50360940615051
for he was wholly absorbed by the spectacle that the piazza del popolo presented and by the terrible instrument that was in the centre   69.45867863429692
the one seemed to be deprived of reason yet he was meditating   112.21289730782811
she is rich a countess and yet caderousse paused   93.76596945141837
but you will kill yourself by riding on horseback   101.89299933576137
patrick said groslow take this horse to the stables of the nearest inn   144.07919048062882
and gondy bowed as if to leave with the rest   150.11088429396455
what my god   160.60125498778837
and the matter seems serious to you   118.24793059882495
accustomed formerly to ride on horseback or in the carriage to the four corners of europe the monotonous walk around that armchair has killed him his blood has thickened   47.42251913774021
andrea had expressed a wish to be thus addressed   43.01947260330893
or upon my soul i will blow your brains out   103.01094702322618
the grand manner of athos had left its mark on grimaud   90.08851807738398
you know sir said the governor persisting that we are not content in such cases as this with such a simple examination   139.22903253727247
chance is so capricious   170.28029349765433
five or six will inevitably kill and in a way the more terrible inasmuch as poured into a glass of wine it would not in the slightest degree affect its flavor   140.69665716058466
there are few ports that i could not enter or leave with a bandage over my eyes   69.67403474323542
and the moment he had done so began to undress him with the promptitude and dexterity of a man who had learned his business on the field of battle   154.12234048346428
you mean to allude to the recollections perpetually revived by these three gentlemen   161.73792261614875
he seems to have a mania for diamonds said morcerf smiling and i verily believe that like potemkin he keeps his pockets filled for the sake of strewing them along the road as tom thumb did his flint stones   160.00576697553078
besides besides what   101.60717459481245
say it then   113.14569814549226
refer to your papers   224.16946637088424
why three days ago the emperor had not landed   158.849000571104
no no you must first say if you declare yourself for the king of a day who now reigns or for his majesty the emperor   90.47612965235493
a few soldiers commanded by a sergeant drove away idlers from the place where the duke had mounted his horse   115.37286729758101
he is waiting in his carriage at the gate of the garden of the palais royal   76.83293439471484
and what is your reason for advising me to go alone   139.90102003856938
the queen s paleness if possible increased   59.50213490234944
well if so why do you object to my doing so   86.95785334363862
from the manner in which you walked and talked together one would have thought you were two school girls telling your secrets to each other   110.25842960142907
a smile of terrible import passed over the count s lips   107.83864919252618
that s my idea my lord   163.6993529102876
your excellency we must live somehow returned the other smiling impenetrably   145.74229370234494
the same said villefort   38.808165876499615
come come calm yourself my sweet girl   76.88344778249197
eugénie pronounced these words with so firm a tone that the color mounted to valentine s cheeks   117.82552755776933
silence said felton i hear footsteps   131.9703259349581
sir tis this very coating of fat that makes me shiver   126.06708017334765
then all he has got to do is to endeavor to repair it   119.62234684037665
they were the heads of the two soldiers   49.80948678181838
it would be necessary to prove what tribunal had imposed it on me and i could have made a public appeal to all the tribunals of the kingdom   180.09621367874502
remember i have relations who possess more millions than you have deniers   166.81862867067667
listen beauchamp   104.35016210140812
well suppose i go back to the cardinal and ask him for a passport into all the convents one can find even into the nunneries   112.18353580912479
a horse is mortal   168.8517875691981
madame faltered d artagnan tis twenty years ago i have a good memory since i had the honor behind a piece of tapestry in the hotel de ville of kissing one of those lovely hands   83.61858529823067
the young girl perfectly understood the look and so did villefort for his countenance became clouded and he knitted his eyebrows angrily   79.96975560148866
well my lord four men resolved to save her   126.59912828797056
and you visit him   85.3953839097061
teresa was sixteen and vampa seventeen   153.62907477315693
haydée   152.84253203782606
courted by my step mother who regards him as the epitome of human wisdom   200.73990400184206
but it is not a horse for hard work   78.59644400667588
richelieu was a gentleman our equal in birth our superior in position   205.66665404365867
thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid the sailors seated on a rock or undulating in the vessel one of the shadows which had shared his dream with looks and kisses   135.76219470537052
because they are looking for her where she is not to be found   76.3773539472016
this greatness of spirit in a man who was quite destitute struck even porthos   120.77112151798711
lord de winter on quitting d artagnan gave him his sister s address   92.68821895610367
he remained therefore mute and motionless hardly venturing to breathe   130.11701200220477
still what i admire the most i confess is the marvellous promptitude with which your orders are executed   80.25447583162966
well you will follow me to the grave with the rank of captain   81.92519891065557
but he said mouston is not so young as he was my dear fellow   77.14755486710447
one man alone remained in his place gun in hand   41.0626071361538
thus illumined aramis read the following epistle my dear d herblay i learned from d artagnan who has embraced me on the part of the comte de la fere and yourself that you are setting out on a journey which may perhaps last two or three months   113.65391906064443
but do you not fear that this communication may relate to your marriage   100.06981173795737
all at once the king appeared with the cardinal at one of the doors of the hall   138.9214380871263
it is but natural   175.35714595506735
he drank to their good health and the travelers returned his politeness   106.18767136821307
when this terrible chain of ideas presented itself valentine was nearly persuaded to ring the bell and call for help   60.35872201416939
nothing replied milady   91.57240888648141
the devil it does   149.5813767661532
yes we are severed   145.42121963415536
at this instant in the midst of the silver circle illumined by the light of the moon the same whirlpool which had been made by the sinking men was again obvious and first were seen rising above the waves a wisp of hair then a pale face with open eyes yet nevertheless the eyes of death   86.3331356041891
the countess stopped for a moment as if gasping for breath   141.36915316766942
no he replied only hark how he sighs   104.62719721156967
d artagnan continued athos you who but lately were so anxious for such an opportunity for expressing your gratitude to monseigneur here it is   141.87951362445668
the fever had not abated on the contrary her eyes glistened and she appeared to be suffering from violent nervous irritability   166.09483255203054
and how far back into the past do your recollections extend   129.93447577491798
their disappearance at first caused much disquietude   85.34533196631432
with madame danglars   98.3864719458436
i will tell it were it to destroy me   106.89875916154185
in five minutes they gained the land   113.85732825719033
oh he cried in an accent of despair the count has deceived me   184.66761153955105
said he to porthos   102.59238482065169
what does monsieur bracieux care think you whether i am thirsty or not   134.4125694614621
you have an hour   73.24706368072353
i have the note said he to athos and to his friends   124.84388956388575
that is true replied d artagnan   140.6887668018565
the figure put the comb in its pocket   78.90679181350052
for you monsieur said planchet presenting the billet to the young man   87.41372850192346
louis au marais   157.1103000801337
the oval face was lengthened his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked lines which betoken resolution   94.07099357305775
by chemists and persons who have a taste for chemistry said monte cristo carelessly   128.17457813577013
as he finished the host entered with the wine ordered and a ham which fortunately for him had been left out of the cellar   91.87688747379958
he did not even give himself the trouble to dissemble and displayed it with affectation before the queen   13.631829505587916
you judge my intentions wrongly and that is partly because doubtless i explain myself in french   29.37687228327208
the englishman easily found the entries relative to the abbé faria   129.56602406021528
that s all right edmond   166.82847751810863
maximilian morrel do you not grandpapa   98.44210228434284
it was thus that pinelli the famous sculptor had commenced   63.468608959205746
30099m the third act passed off as usual   93.2687647638577
oh hear me to the end   128.54535636319466
i will lieutenant said the soldier   29.3673549515878
the return chapter xxix   104.73309005250081
gentlemen encircle his eminence that you may show him the greater honor   80.6591348768497
i am glad that the occasion has presented itself for saying this to you for i have noticed how cold you are in your bearing towards the count while he on the other hand has always been courtesy itself to us   59.283196742276786
aramis said athos you went to breakfast the day before yesterday at the inn of the parpaillot i believe   137.39452050920966
i overcame every obstacle and reached the goal   97.23840087502737
who could intercept us on such a night as this pitch dark when one does not see more than twenty yards before one   68.91295916298283
the cardinal went up to him and touched his shoulder   136.30951083419802
i have come for nothing else but to tell you so   104.04786980288233
if you had only to deal with four men d artagnan i would allow you to go alone   150.1104793559241
you suppose that i would ever accept the price of your life   87.57545740715913
her first look was at the box where she had seen the count the previous evening so that she perceived franz and albert in the place of the very person concerning whom she had expressed so strange an opinion to franz   162.52380975385506
but the child the child sir   134.29713928400966
you madame de villefort and her son   43.622568201359414
i do not perceive that singing masses has spoiled your voice   115.25396426726708
this could not then be a military ambuscade as the ball was not of the regular caliber   101.90323485695204
valentine was on the point of relating all that had passed but she suddenly remembered that in doing so she must reveal a terrible secret which concerned others as well as her grandfather and she said at some future time i will tell you all about it   130.94549888270583
those who were not killed felt the heat of the flames   121.37287600313043
how are you sir   54.01500113356033
well well said one the madman has gone to look after his treasure   114.05065816949389
and i a plain chicken said aramis   143.52210117415717
yet he entertained a marked preference for this gentleman   151.9840638749088
oh curses woe death to you   83.8793036066943
la ramee some day when he sends for you you must let me put on your clothes   141.89504089724372
the two men in black rose bowed to aramis and d artagnan and advanced toward the door   149.24575927874983
then after a time they disappeared   111.40861231222678
nor was it from caprice we asked the question for there is a wounded and dying man who demands the succor of the church   75.97398348636051
porthos foresaw that if d artagnan was called away he should remain the sole possessor of the bed   149.38910205071736
and monsieur his countenance changed color two or three times   29.79971376401123
well then gentlemen said the queen since it is thus and since you are willing to devote yourselves to the service of a poor princess whom the whole world has abandoned this is what is required to be done for me   81.79250414133669
demanded she of milady   131.0532497160365
have you any cause of complaint against me or monsieur d herblay   54.18660528827691
well marquis said monte cristo you appear to be in no way disappointed in the son whom your good fortune has restored to you   90.34546069290698
oh cried the inspector who can live here   179.14230704652033
the baroness was also surprised and showed her astonishment by a look which would doubtless have had some effect upon her husband if he had not been intently occupied with the paper where he was looking to see the closing stock quotations   121.72243049577595
you will have to find the abbé busoni   45.68021625290437
the earl of essex tis true wore a splendid ring set with diamonds given him by his royal mistress whilst i i have nothing but a simple circlet of gold with a cipher on it and a date   169.2175993465941
monsieur laporte said d artagnan go and announce to the people through the grating that they are going to be satisfied and that in five minutes they shall not only see the king but they shall see him in bed   73.61603597344732
one only is still not in our power and braves us   102.54907498603653
albert looked at his two friends not timidly but in a way that appeared to ask their opinion of what he had just done   141.62892499310752
then they looked at one another   89.65015814709614
will the place royale suit you   67.69541672013978
continued franz   139.5415057184213
which is to recover a lost and adored son   60.934343546475716
said franz   145.5154964102639
pity albert also maximilian   49.37469842143522
then i believe you   77.9387242330161
i had been at the seminary from nine years old   94.77631865092874
i have particular business to settle with this gentleman and i shall and will begin   47.23338055362461
she went straight to the group of which her husband formed the centre   103.84701084825758
a gleam like a flash of lightning illumined the road and with the flash was heard the whistling of balls which were fired wildly in the air   114.24950872934333
fairfax answered a laughing voice the silvery tone of which betrayed it as that of a woman is not such a fool as to be here   159.04584728880323
this somnambulism of drunkenness had something frightful in it   115.87131159642742
exactly your man   85.76962594217119
tell me on which point you desire information and i will tell all i know   76.7973500947675
here i am smiled porthos with his sublime composure   133.64113041334252
there are indeed some things which appear so impossible that the mind does not dwell on them for an instant   105.08261419079076
morrel he said   56.55799562642279
sir said villefort after the first salutations were over you were sent for by m   162.59395768925802
the valet re appeared almost instantly and having shaved his master assisted him to dress entirely in black   137.79837262329383
a shade of anger and vengeance passed across the usually calm brow of this gentleman   44.887797262273736
i know that it is terrible said d artagnan   181.03526297637566
had he it before he was imprisoned   92.84799328268738
at that moment doubtless she was recalling all her crimes to her memory   127.96033336290094
believe me the cord is more certain than the knife   99.0434086183647
so it is agreed and if porthos makes no objection i said porthos i will do whatever you please   84.6153037570236
i live the happiest life possible the real life of a pasha   122.11658114026271
thought d artagnan the man i am warned against by athos   167.38080471351327
but what is to be done   48.309139355352144
but you are unable to oppose them you whose mind is so quick and whose will is so firm are nevertheless as weak and unequal to the contest as i am myself   181.8203181573603
the young sailor gave a look to see that his orders were promptly and accurately obeyed and then turned again to the owner   146.13680498336458
well he said aloud let us resume our conversation later your people may suspect something   72.01503143953495
pass on replied the guard   74.35301004464947
another and wholly uninterested person felt the same unaccountable awe and misgiving   82.69444116770703
but if he had escaped   157.9229691216287
june and july were the terrible months with athos   117.99957021295705
oh selfish man   158.46496950227242
my grandfather and my grandmother the marquis and marquise de saint méran will leave me as much and m   108.49977136990293
is she not free to love whomsoever she will   176.996065052125
beware young man   199.29212013701755
his majesty is certain that a letter has been written by you during the day   34.42353788595814
you are about to swear upon your honor and i upon my word and then it will be pretty evident that one of us will have lied   125.74839052213373
laughingly he said to the councillor restored to his family do you think father that if now i should ask for a company the queen would give it to me   101.0072817131944
château renaud who has lived in russia will tell you the name of one and major cavalcanti who is an italian will tell you the name of the other   90.9738724589218
felton remained in the corridor   77.48931277461023
but when it was necessary to convey the prisoner from one carriage to the other the people catching sight of him whom they called their liberator uttered every imaginable cry and knotted themselves once more around the vehicle   51.906590705628915
you are master but if you take my advice you ll hold your tongue   6.78957948290487
he had again missed his man who had disappeared as if by enchantment   115.46329575389687
each guarded a door and served as a rampart to him on either side   129.75534499479164
then it is for to day   93.16140895442624
about five o clock in the evening the island was distinct and everything on it was plainly perceptible owing to that clearness of the atmosphere peculiar to the light which the rays of the sun cast at its setting   201.06349928733022
and when you are looking forward to be captain it was wrong to annoy the owner   73.80570944505101
but this sudden and factitious joy soon forsook the young man and was succeeded by a still greater grief   187.53358070430545
if anyone wishes to stop us i will show monsieur de tréville s letter and you will show your leaves of absence   114.62732842999188
what will you   129.13192158344154
and i have not seen him   132.3168446890868
she exclaimed throwing herself into the arms of mademoiselle d armilly her eyes sparkling with the same kind of rage which made nero wish that the roman world had but one neck that he might sever it at a single blow   189.1460644269281
julie was at the entrance of the garden where she was attentively watching penelon who entering with zeal into his profession of gardener was very busy grafting some bengal roses   106.90024821820091
well then if like us your excellency lived at leghorn you would hear from time to time that a little merchant vessel or an english yacht that was expected at bastia at porto ferrajo or at civita vecchia has not arrived   126.63939866928786
madame replied the president bowing with profound respect allow me to ask one question   68.34892653129506
she had returned to the catalans and had despairingly cast herself on her couch   138.45445296293101
dantès blushed   111.88519332903994
and he was alone in achieving an enterprise like that   66.85279605010999
the two ladies entered the drawing room with that sort of official stiffness which preludes a formal communication   60.8416512040697
don t forget the signal jesus seigneur   66.8308863395071
no no said he   159.46612552465783
the family is extinct   109.02828425384527
it is said that the doomed wretch in the deserts of america thus feels the approach of the serpent   3.0159663580715943
you insist on my contradicting the article relating to general fernand an article with which i assure you on my word of honor i had nothing whatever to do   157.8828448309981
you have some in the house have you not   100.10512051410393
i will agree to neither one nor the other replied the young soldier   118.41724321871524
he pointed his finger to the lighted window   116.08327380937841
and i know one down there behind the saint nicolas citadel who will not be sorry to hear it   72.33500102148861
valentine was expecting him   89.57113890483717
inquired the man with a strong italian accent   216.5982231619982
first not a syllable to either of our friends of what you have heard   119.1325594147769
if we are to judge by all the vengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans of the king when in their turn they were in power your brother would be today in all probability condemned to death   193.34357226109194
but it will be necessary for your eminence to do what the other day you declared you should have done in our place cry down with mazarin   165.01540273599872
you have purchased it dearly enough   74.46094859463484
good said he as he went away   39.34583570935827
the poor young girl had stolen the sacred vessels from a church   92.23932239334769
i remained in my ignorance and the count of spada in his poverty   75.23734965492557
grimaud hesitated   141.8111222860727
you are right my lord duke answered the officer   61.464638989515045
and if i am wrong still let me cherish these hopes for i have no future to look forward to   55.15213309828592
and the ridicule will fall on me   107.18211641542487
the enemy was marching upon lens with the intention doubtless of securing possession of that town and separating from france the army of france   102.76875152367282
yes madame another service said athos shocked that the queen did not seem to recognize him   129.06206007068218
when the sergeant on entering the room announced that in all probability he was bringing in two mazarinists it appeared to be the unanimous opinion of the officers on guard that they ought not to pass   100.10343927969785
cried d artagnan you will get me turned off   149.84121812723788
though we scarcely expected it our secret remained in our own keeping alone   66.83439668478165
then the news i brought you is of value   24.116625214931304
this then continued aramis was my first opinion   111.73841055231307
exclaimed haydée   110.43081710521801
do not do so reverend sir   96.19419921983203
never fear these people owe us no grudge   100.38134795089798
where did you study heraldry   81.37210899410947
gladly said albert   77.51390519496383
de villefort s door and the coffin removed into it from the post wagon   144.42911709046965
the cardinal repressed another smile   73.11040281911143
many also who were not aware of the circumstances attending his withdrawal from paris were struck with the worthy appearance the gentlemanly bearing and the knowledge of the world displayed by the old patrician who certainly played the nobleman very well so long as he said nothing and made no arithmetical calculations   41.18879206991865
there was something awful in hearing the son read aloud in trembling pallor these details of his father s death which had hitherto been a mystery   56.3687571682636
cried felton i can understand you now   132.9880196163435
yes it is one of milady s bastards   137.8127091066565
d artagnan remember this   93.6420869063121
i will find the means myself   114.12372374842627
unfortunately for him the line of carriages moved on again and while he descended the piazza del popolo the other ascended towards the palazzo di venezia   102.2422182631691
certainly a speedy violent death would be a fine means of deceiving these remorseless enemies who appeared to pursue him with such incomprehensible vengeance   124.57190568911786
his natural construction and physiological formation dantès was confused and silent at this explanation of the thoughts which had unconsciously been working in his mind or rather soul   160.5429077057518
wait an instant my friend and you shall be satisfied   199.9714433220072
it was indeed a glorious time   140.21037809645503
but where is the doctor   121.48195911470987
one of them will weed the parliament in the name of the court and the other in the name of the people   86.49103534814464
pardieu returned franz laughing in token of your ingratitude   98.29646031217723
however i have turned the business over to morcerf so pray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you   104.82447264424303
let us return to the object that brings me here   31.397380976424046
hasty actions are generally bad ones   79.39310045722735
repeated the doctor   104.9909509610481
and so the poor fools believe that the whole thing is as easy as lying   170.35219821827764
perhaps i shall be but at present unfortunately i am not   77.88106208597918
that most sacred in the world said athos   127.02057553788504
here my lords   92.02759874061269
i never like upstarts   162.5983037808618
well for my part i a bloodthirsty ruffian who can go and stand close to a scaffold in order to have a better view of the king s execution i remain   53.93498017001327
selim still holding in his hand the lighted match walked towards the opening in the cavern and aided by the faint light which streamed in through the mouth of the cave picked up the token   116.08236723845164
was it the englishman who carried off 3 000 crowns from here the other day   155.25300927494254
you asked me for five hundred men did you not   45.211344436629616
thought he   161.90903591443166
my jailers and my hangmen   163.72571928853864
i was brought here by night so devil take me if i know where i am   72.54916927768596
caderousse seemed to reflect for a few moments then said no truly it would take up too much time   79.64981817016118
do you understand madame   90.18205028709384
and he raised the medallion to his lips   97.62678894390946
he put out his hand to remove the object   66.10231116276377
to athos to a man double his age   114.56968440338512
sir said valentine at the height of her terror you say you endured tortures when you saw the deadly poison poured into my glass   134.91522090982912
oh father continued the executioner without opening his eyes as if he feared on opening them to see some frightful object it is especially when night comes on and when i have to cross a river that this terror which i have been unable to conquer comes upon me   136.8822840911293
inquired the abbé of caderousse   126.13140977982299
but mercédès did not witness his departure although she was seated at the little window of the room which had been occupied by old dantès   82.09000757397729
he is rich then   61.57900207175626
cried blaisois   60.31703847971177
i suppose you read it in the paper in the account from yanina   76.86169112170546
those studs which the king speaks of you gave them to the duke of buckingham did you not   144.91950642894002
without you   133.74371064334167
i hear said aramis but i understand neither the noise nor the cry of pain   111.67654096691746
the audience m   149.65108411850056
gentlemen return your swords to their scabbards   151.72207204492193
at this moment ali entered   50.7259215712056
and if i refuse to retract you wish to fight do you   134.09744933942022
this island was always had been and still is completely deserted   105.62730737749158
as our house is carried on very regularly and we make out our bills every week at the end of eight days we presented our account   137.41664794033068
come in said a voice which he recognized as that of the mendicant whom he found lying on a kind of truckle bed   97.82706502463888
albert tottered and fell overpowered in a chair   102.48911662370762
on the 20th of august it was known at marseilles that he had left town in the mailcoach and then it was said that the bills would go to protest at the end of the month and that morrel had gone away and left his chief clerk emmanuel and his cashier cocles to meet the creditors   82.51872870816214
the balconies of the two churches at the corner of the via del babuino and the via di ripetta were crammed   40.808569113592725
de villefort had not seen his father since the morning of the death   117.86894628950358
i should like to see you with a brief preparing in your house   73.43775594591179
your father s name so well known in italy and so highly honored   40.07864594906275
let the cardinal take care of going alone to visit the comte de la fere said d artagnan   139.8397261596084
eat heartily   198.7985878721555
and seeing that m   146.500231309992
the hotel de vendome was not less guarded than the hotel de bouillon and presented as warlike an appearance   122.77493519338529
at six in the evening the guests began to come   124.57999854795237
ah my lord tis not easy to make people say what they don t wish to let out   111.21557438964389
dantès had been flung into the sea and was dragged into its depths by a thirty six pound shot tied to his feet   153.60716515883962
and it has staggered everybody   39.21330488818438
my political opinions   102.90363202754807
albert remained silent and wrapped in thought   128.07508099647063
here is the story monseigneur resumed the trembling host   149.0733664975726
he ran towards her   176.01366682178764
in that case commanded comminges silence that old woman   64.80184059725346
are you mad emmanuel   112.47143377899671
you could not have entertained any alarm on the subject because you are perfectly well aware that i have had for a month in my service the very best coachman in paris   93.79675224919069
you well know my lord that there always remains to us a last resource   145.72120063855263
what has become of danglars the instigator and therefore the most guilty   7.540800665985543
but sir supposing that the conference is broken off are you going to try to take charenton   71.62766456727712
the servant soon returned   131.50212158583741
at the hotel de ville   60.23161076681975
i have another name madame i am called athos   119.1548144147749
the chevalier   97.22709241302405
nobody knows you   91.16541168393856
we will cross the tyne reach scotland and you will be saved   31.301957662818197
of ali tepelini   153.35217043015479
exordium repeated the curate for the sake of saying something   70.44864152873646
and if it did not how wretched we should be   94.1418999137916
milady however smiled in observing that she excelled the young woman by far in her high air and aristocratic bearing   199.73175809046077
but as soon as they were gone i found this broken sword blade as i was helping to raise two dead men and five or six wounded ones   175.61967495110835
it was that of la carconte   135.350037416028
and he oh he   115.94279848491627
d épinay and himself and that the marriage of valentine and franz would consequently be broken off   129.84681863262088
by pulling out a bar and pushing down a door   119.53566233573599
the guards were scattered according to the varying excellence of their respective mounts   60.07552630753449
it was the man of meung   156.76422640763064
cried danglars we are not returning to rome   143.3663289187424
since that period of history queens have shed tears like other women   127.70084922321047
four thousand nine hundred and ninety eight louis said peppino   116.83680301505954
the prince read as he hastened on   79.60474430227907
it is so indeed   95.28115466080288
oh we shall have the pleasure of waiting upon you answered la carconte with an eager attention she was not accustomed to manifest even to guests who paid for what they took   138.0106505032982
de salvieux s letter embraced renée kissed the marquise s hand and shaken that of the marquis started for paris along the aix road   101.80480332019609
i must ascertain if your insinuations are just and am going now to inquire of the count of monte cristo   126.37919343046526
he shed the blood of strafford   146.95581104718127
he entered the apartment followed by a man in a mask   136.1407104609469
are we not men accustomed to defend ourselves   136.86518312337225
these three windows were in madame de saint méran s room   114.89083667767298
clemency is a royal virtue   95.09450044960255
the sight of such royal misery exasperated him and his eyes examined every new trace of poverty that presented itself   112.66134736619749
yes the king   151.26839812280883
and if you continue you will be compelled to sleep here because unable to stand on your legs   114.13775203835833
but a prudent gentleman may excuse himself from not waiting on his eminence particularly when he has reason to believe he is not invited to make his compliments   196.48286183246475
is the king wounded   92.59011899909875
bazin quickly covered the table with a damask cloth and arranged upon it so many things gilded perfumed appetizing that d artagnan was quite overcome   93.38195239635718
nothing is so catching as confidence   59.570032282000625
and her glance was turned towards heaven where a mysterious providence disposes all things and out of a fault nay even a vice sometimes produces a blessing   98.13028229147237
d artagnan remained alone in front of the cardinal   126.02655378929498
he is a wise man according to his own showing   86.9643006880186
fire fire   53.24800680923219
from hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of persons and assassinations in the lower   119.2929529679525
one of my dearest friends   133.96852710367745
if there is a third shot said he to himself i am a lost man   78.66667003991168
he had an excuse for not eating any more   130.01401576704131
bonacieux in morning costume standing at his threshold   101.339012844766
listen said the count and deep hatred mounted to his face as the blood would to the face of any other   70.3977639211715
he remained on horseback feeling no inclination to dismount and sat looking at the bars at the buttressed windows and the immense walls he had hitherto only seen from the other side of the moat but by which he had for twenty years been awe struck   168.94566500396377
but you know the more hearts are worth the capture the more difficult they are to be won   104.94806300819256
continued olivain in despair what would the count say if he only saw you now   151.7110586007165
the treasure chapter 19   12.29967418785236
for the sadness generally became more intense toward the fine season of the year   190.57297272935722
but you can sleep when you please monsieur   174.60745102991024
well then assume a cheerful manner as i do   153.11533952654514
a peer of france   167.58252493187467
the grass had grown very thickly there during the summer and when autumn arrived no one had been there to mow it   95.15338380870898
inured as men may be to danger forewarned as they may be of peril they understand by the fluttering of the heart and the shuddering of the frame the enormous difference between a dream and a reality between the project and the execution   91.78266567141802
still they did not show signs of wear and the fine cloth beneath the careful hands of the prisoner soon recovered its gloss in the parts which were still perfect for the wearer tried his best to make it assume the appearance of a new coat   96.64120392227325
come in cried athos   126.11053267558941
now promise me to remember this and expect me the 21st of may at the same hour in the forenoon   102.16776789112033
de saint méran i applied my smelling salts   66.5177710149372
truly this is an indignity   159.5151938434046
my lord if among these forty there had been one good way he would have been out long ago   159.9763623790894
instead of performing your part of this contract as i performed mine you bought me from the scotch cheaply i know and that does honor to the economic talent of your government   11.992147733477992
and he placed ten gold louis in the hand of caderousse   51.66907545327723
besides you are neither of you now your own masters   155.16744590532682
i will answer for him   167.9520349996555
he went gayly up to the sailors who rose as soon as they perceived him   83.98038899834617
to interminable ineffaceable infamy   62.7941378408826
she was pale and fair with long curls falling in profusion over her shoulders had large blue languishing eyes rosy lips and hands of alabaster   160.73458643804793
i can answer only for myself said mazarin   104.60793069938595
cried patrick   33.35233744697675
sir he said i can tell you what is at present unknown to her majesty   57.698147842147684
you will deliver this letter to milady   81.51104160666841
what you scoundrel   112.69574723372791
franz said no more   99.81101200868389
but from this moment until then let us not tempt providence let us not see each other   91.16080745740996
felton has not told him said milady to herself   64.5741030868426
you have spurs   74.98151184935867
exclaimed danglars they have drawn on me for 200 000 francs   150.0808077860351
this was more terrible than the first   165.3526588248044
have you not happy rogue that you are have you not your duchess who can not fail to come to your aid   142.28785602615423
my life has been passed on the high road   176.53571212927602
for myself on the other hand my lord returned the governor when the first rebel should pass the threshold of my postern doors i should be obliged to kill you with my own hand since you were confided peculiarly to my care and as i am obliged to give you up dead or alive   200.25765817484273
it is said that he is married to the queen   106.77515442326899
the queen my sister is no longer queen my child   134.9596440033135
everybody except the person who gave it to me   208.43041293325317
and he sighed deeply   170.96784056955858
grimaud rose and obeyed   63.6532316525319
beware sir replied the president you are no longer in the assembly and have only to do with individuals   146.16621507693924
all eyes were fixed on the door which opened slowly and with a kind of solemnity   95.91844859635435
but since i am neither king nor queen nor minister he is not my enemy and i can not accept your offer   114.36779455244069
to give them the order to charge and run down these miserable rebels   151.2144350906745
then when they had disappeared he said with a smile tis strange that it should be among such men that we find proofs of friendship and devotion   149.28222781132277
the point aimed at by every poniard   148.37818730531188
morcerf smiled   145.93781353666824
still if athos joins us well we shall be three of us to laugh at aramis that little coxcomb with his too good luck   79.93999258777421
on the sixteenth day in particular these signs were so strong in d artagnan and his two friends that they could not remain quiet in one place and wandered about like ghosts on the road by which planchet was expected   70.50403894031999
very good resumed danglars   97.557494617202
ten minutes after we struck our top sails and scudded under bare poles   150.04290182377332
his plan is very simple   17.312944784501767
towards the louvres   61.57583615175202
the count went to the window of the apartment that looked on to the street and whistled in a peculiar manner   139.70040108476104
but the horses were unharnessed and others put in their places without anyone claiming money from the traveller   108.33066804223911
but however distant from the court we may be however remote from the interests of the world we may be placed we have very sad examples of what you have related   67.41479849906995
well one day when no one could drill a mob of citizens who began to march some with the right foot others with the left i succeeded i did in making them all begin with the same foot and i was made lieutenant on the spot   116.44022854722249
yes and i will tell you   93.90256976306878
blond   119.50632801376636
there in the twentieth chapter of the life of pope alexander vi   137.91020093117058
he was attacked with apoplexy and i was called in too late   120.57886461713346
i have lost my appetite and my stomach feels as if it were struggling to get accustomed to something   61.78261759433444
d avrigny himself   73.6256207955154
no one would listen or believe me because everyone thought me mad   123.09095868874941
the stock is in your own hands   47.92067671435238
caderousse looked so closely at it that andrea well knew that he was examining to see if all the edges were perfect   91.85969111522341
i have told you that i believe i know him   57.18773449460163
i won back your harness then your horse then my harness then my horse and then i lost again   129.02689883230255
it must have been a mistake   53.50273676040161
there are words which close a conversation with an iron door   44.77664557689293
of me   36.72554571283618
mordaunt who has brought it and is charged with its execution   96.89482865329315
sometimes   116.32565635946429
the count of monte cristo turned dreadfully pale   86.2450609433903
but without however being able to take his eyes from that ship on board of which he doubtless fancied he could distinguish the white outline of her to whom he had sacrificed his life   129.13188497135852
beauchamp the daring attempt to rob the count was the topic of conversation throughout paris for the next fortnight   147.25965086144234
and a vast number of heroes of that gallant period may be cited who would neither have won their spurs in the first place nor their battles afterward without the purse more or less furnished which their mistress fastened to the saddle bow   27.65809357660916
athos then called olivain   78.96111482860817
one night edmond awoke suddenly believing that he heard someone calling him   129.40742672185243
yes she said and you have still preserved this love in your heart one can only love once and did you ever see her again   166.0016282482497
consequently valentine came up to noirtier on leaving madame de saint méran who in the midst of her grief had at last yielded to fatigue and fallen into a feverish sleep   207.3214151097552
i retained my harness by instinct   94.13890300667069
said he on perceiving aramis   133.8104388548236
but why has he waited till now   89.79372017535177
who was it you were talking with over there   120.16894053677873
while i watched the window he guarded the door   26.663599348176618
and he described to the two nobles the affair exactly as it had passed   127.75736216560531
the brief space had however been sufficient for a man followed by a number of servants to rush from the house before which the accident had occurred and as the coachman opened the door of the carriage to take from it a lady who was convulsively grasping the cushions with one hand while with the other she pressed to her bosom the young boy who had lost consciousness   114.78455056413337
he has been here since yesterday   101.09848000791769
do you know where i am leading you   122.59525631322398
this is how i transact business said danglars   85.82536607628074
aramis easily aroused athos whose sleep was light like that of all persons of a finely organized constitution   52.36669922006845
that was a noble example to follow monsieur   142.7709857729165
i had but one thought and that was that he was observing me   154.90812657411794
imprisonment menaces ill treatment she has suffered everything   137.52440109551776
it was then that he told me two cavaliers of the parisian army were seeking me and named the comte de la fere   149.28683725890386
monsieur does not postpone an interview through prudence   145.12510769329538
that might do if we were dealing with englishmen or germans   81.19995674162195
but do you think we shall find the count at home   156.47442480013248
coquenard wished him all sorts of prosperities   137.69835467006425
immediately and according to custom the ramparts of fort saint jean were covered with spectators   57.590960369090766
bonacieux indeed reflected on what had just been said to him   100.7834123138078
meantime you see that the lackeys saddle the horses   140.1461179216317
let us get down count and examine this rock   84.0007097460329
i saw her at the theatre and heard her one morning when i breakfasted with the count   43.36161249363545
a man who had sworn vengeance against my father and had long watched his opportunity to kill him had introduced himself that night into the garden in which my father buried me   130.30043914758969
we shall have the pleasure another time said the countess   44.18036080997109
now the successor of pere marteau had promised him a pate of pheasant instead of a pate of fowl and chambertin wine instead of macon   90.59705395778727
while at a sign from edmond the rest of the company ranged themselves as they found it most agreeable   115.35500128038764
i heard your voice up to the last moment   145.63935776315643
but wine was wanting the bottle was empty   104.15336201009907
what was that letter you were about to read monsieur aramis and which you so promptly concealed   115.00306621034902
it is well said monte cristo   181.50229543958142
scarcely had he uttered those words when madame morrel entered weeping bitterly   82.31305421960205
and when women of genius wish anything they always succeed in attaining it   38.74457061493237
gentlemen said he in a tone strangely firm for a servant speaking to his masters under such solemn circumstances gentlemen m   106.6527354699495
weigh your words before you speak for my eyes have already become brighter and my heart beats strongly   88.46598117064758
by her husband who was a nobleman of your acquaintance continued d artagnan looking intently at athos   92.89119418766005
they found athos in profound despondency   154.05914240890496
that is all i had to say to you   141.58530046085144
oh make yourself easy on that head said ali smiling   120.567504297965
i am no swordsman   76.61932791151077
he sat down and monte cristo placed himself opposite to him   152.5982167227423
it was a tolerably fine winter s day and a ray of that pale english sun which lights but does not warm came through the bars of her prison   61.36731216101742
there is not much time lost yet   98.34591046162643
chanleu whose fire at one time repulsed the royal regiment thought that the moment was come to pursue it   15.119593921933358
d artagnan to be preparing his exordium   27.060649891595673
again the abbé had been obliged to swallow a draught of water to calm the emotions that threatened to overpower him   144.0932246775091
and do you never use your eyes which must have acquired so much finesse and certainty to divine at a glance the kind of man by whom you are confronted   155.15811769302934
anquetil   116.25045996824025
she is not to leave this chamber understand john continued the baron   97.3495659463927
this can not be monsieur porthos observed planchet replying as it were to his master s thoughts   139.55572197939313
sir replied mordaunt i have ordered the two prisoners we made this morning to be conducted to my lodging   220.97936758886914
and you killed her   151.48431392061832
and as they were loading the last musket grimaud announced that the breakfast was ready   52.53461940259033
it seems nevertheless come gentlemen come   72.22438908568472
here it is said aramis with a little look of diffidence which however was not exempt from a shade of hypocrisy vous qui pleurez un passé plein de charmes et qui trainez des jours infortunés tous vos malheurs se verront terminés quand à dieu seul vous offrirez vos larmes vous qui pleurez   121.07107577052128
you have seen m   125.4211560775164
now in the event of the king s death his successor inherits a crown when the employee dies the supernumerary steps into his shoes and receives his salary of twelve thousand livres   35.771500411065446
you have never heard his name   82.80083244923466
all these rooms which communicated with one another did not inspire porthos favorably   80.34281492028654
shall i give you the change my officer   69.25532587062281
then she added in a low voice and i will think of it again   103.00983178010057
well if you know them you know that they are good and free companions   127.78643333372926
then as if his strength failed him he seemed unable to sustain himself above the water and a wave passed over his head which drowned his voice   112.36053633908347
i have at least two of the three qualities you stand in need of and here i am   71.5049519453234
the blade was red for the blood had become rust   134.96145110443237
de boville your fears are unfortunately but too well founded and you see before you a man in despair   36.984739145754304
and now that we are acquainted superficially at least with the masters and the valets let us pass on to the dwellings occupied by each of them   153.3951603763426
i hope that my frankness at least will make you my friend   68.51922834962198
he lost all together with twenty five pistoles for which he had given his word   72.86103481253329
no said felton   135.97564371440126
athos and porthos dragged me into this to occupy me   138.0420671913582
then almost immediately as if a fresh thought has occurred a smile played upon his lips and he said offering his hand to the mercer rise my friend you are a worthy man   47.88665455364807
all the city was agitated by an extraordinary movement   122.21565708318755
faria had just sufficient strength to restrain him   52.26562698734695
we who have faced fifty foes on the high road can well meet two in the place royale   55.42309359611712
the first day he broke all the doors in with a single push of his shoulder   99.1132475455097
he has a letter of credit on me so i must see him when he requires his money   95.25377791709158
and the duke   119.41846446733337
from this moment i have done with the past and accept nothing from it not even a name because you can understand that your son can not bear the name of a man who ought to blush for it before another   71.41892449206634
there is the other replied the queen   50.24311319862173
a war of partisans unworthy of a king   100.07210468956434
but god forgive me   225.34420479917117
i declare said porthos i shall eat nothing if they do not take it away   159.7455768778831
at last his patience was exhausted   72.64068056346656
will you take it   94.32066437886392
in two seconds the young man had reached his room and burnt caderousse s letter   84.93608853550415
ah my dear m   138.13403855451816
our blow has failed for to night   117.89525759636632
why does the boat go so fast   159.00418209571572
what do you say to it aramis   186.70017699251866
we got separated in the crowd and i could not find him again   23.410344512992722
no no cried the countess   101.9671149369482
but sir are you sure he is as guilty as they say   72.49907423521135
now monsieur porthos once more and this is the last   77.6213998888408
by a rapid movement which the gendarme s practiced eye had perceived dantès sprang forward to precipitate himself into the sea   120.18641767245941
i have pledged my word and shall feel pleasure and happiness in adhering to it   74.31759950390955
if by the cause of the king you mean that of monsieur de mazarin we do not understand each other   97.63130706623726
said he with slight emotion   78.10197522189911
mazarin himself who was well accustomed to the domestic outbreaks of this disturbed household was alarmed   163.05831075746283
the gascons are the scots of france   140.10250457996122
hoarse shouts were heard from the excited mob   194.32261395081628
exclaimed caderousse   125.82962354197599
you ungrateful to marie michon monsieur   78.67316806891134
you forget that beautiful handkerchief with the coat of arms   152.03015926997443
a proof of great humility or great pride said monte cristo   129.20015626619977
what am i to do madame   140.7364732145343
for my father   149.54276423589073
ah said the count watching andrea s countenance i do not demand any confession from you   100.80376569803448
but observe cried d artagnan that there is a woman in the affair a woman carried off a woman who is doubtless threatened tortured perhaps and all because she is faithful to her mistress   156.88567528688154
on leaving monte cristo he walked slowly towards villefort s   144.8119097752246
next after monsieur de condé comes the duke of orleans   108.94420323627881
but delay may ruin our plan sir replied the young man   180.97934433195678
but one person only wrote   94.93424355286706
this is the order he said   172.45557289783602
several persons hurried up to m   69.1359495000051
but what s that to us   115.95278277597515
with a single bound the musketeers were on their feet and saluted with respect   154.75022285303902
if you received the work electronically the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund   116.72660707247009
haydée chapter 78   71.32060205475028
he would only send you another formed of a magnificent sapphire or hollowed out of a gigantic ruby   148.70005180846124
well this route is impossible   90.03120314991449
all at once the horse stumbled against a ridge and then placed its foot on the sand   116.1040781316996
no louise no   40.02266672384471
no but franz has   156.86758225774832
d artagnan that man of iron who seemed to be made of nerve and muscle only had struck him with admiration   86.55666755695925
well my friend fortune is inconstant as the chaplain of the regiment said   124.73209574915538
i believe that i alone of all my countrymen survived that dreadful war   84.1273020088473
count she said bragelonne must be a charming place   52.3241535409511
what fortune has she   44.370277232170324
the agent arose and having bowed to lord wilmore who returned his salutation with the stiff politeness of the english he retired   33.13158205285143
stop and let us talk   113.15001675617059
at this moment hope makes me despise their riches which seem to me contemptible   89.73500377634578
at the end of a week he wrote as well with this pen as with the stylus   67.235295280873
morrel was leaning against one of these mechanically fixing his eyes on the graves   120.39482625928788
we have offered any sum but have failed   80.87589158955782
now i have these proofs albert and i am in your confidence no human power can force me to a duel which your own conscience would reproach you with as criminal but i come to offer you what you can no longer demand of me   7.7820552853208085
you are going to find your servants your horses your carriage and your betrothed   122.52402570931517
what are we to do then to night   139.69980532152658
i will take the five scraps of paper that i now hold as bonds with your signature alone and here is a receipt in full for the six millions between us   48.1766301484416
the unknown would not name anybody and pretended that it was to the duke alone he would make himself known   83.2814860267886
she saw the deepest terror depicted in noirtier s eyes   138.56968731840888
it is for that reason i am delighted to see you continued the abbé although you have disturbed me in a most important calculation which if it succeeded would possibly change newton s system   101.02737233795735
the rue richelieu and the rue villedot were then owing to their vicinity to the ramparts less frequented than any others in that direction for the town was thinly inhabited thereabout   115.53360773723503
porthos followed the lieutenant with that profound confidence he ever had in the wisdom of his friend   66.15647333563285
morrel here is the pharaon without a captain   125.38068493900687
d avrigny cried she in a stifled voice   117.49102065735639
let them think you asleep or perhaps you may be killed before i have the power of helping you   120.87901536701699
well and by my faith said athos it must be acknowledged that this englishman is worthy of being loved   129.6173686324096
cried the king he a boy   139.67485169693578
impossible impossible   71.02112701222323
so that you and valentine who are so attached to each other would not be separated and you would be able to pursue exactly the same course of life which you have hitherto done and thus instead of losing you will be a gainer by the change as it will secure to you two children instead of one to watch over and comfort you   99.86746896086935
how strange continued the king with some asperity   146.98269576870044
ah no joking viscount if you please   127.5583337923702
we were quite alone   155.491461126807
no for he has gone again   98.67385522854103
you destroy everything   145.81145307793423
but when seeing her so lovely and her brother so pious nobody thought of asking whence they came   113.18177715258915
by degrees the wind abated vast gray clouds rolled towards the west and the blue firmament appeared studded with bright stars   172.28614101132547
athos who had not lost a word of the conversation took his two companions by the hand and led them to the other end of the room   118.62339427875527
spada a prudent man and greatly attached to his only nephew a young captain of the highest promise took paper and pen and made his will   139.8298184399962
you will bring him then   159.2349877766771
his body seemed to acquire an airy lightness his perception brightened in a remarkable manner his senses seemed to redouble their power the horizon continued to expand   123.16104573844527
look at aramis now   91.99035034199102
nevertheless rapid as the movement had been d artagnan had had time to get a glimpse of the head of an old man   147.81305287410922
on their part the french on seeing the four friends return at such a step uttered cries of enthusiasm   198.55950555633777
franz again interrupted himself and wiped the cold drops from his brow   107.13956001137856
jacopo seeing him fall had believed him killed and rushing towards him raised him up and then attended to him with all the kindness of a devoted comrade   187.75448533270543
no for i am only embarked in certainties replied danglars with the air of a mountebank sounding his own praises   160.97972762007856
and a bitter laugh escaped the count   155.72944753720387
d artagnan bent down to his horse s neck the young man fired and the ball severed the feathers from the hat   179.67052726607037
the daughter of m   126.26526439187951
the general fell then in a loyal duel and not in ambush as it might have been reported   63.96239967068135
you would have caused him an access of his disease   84.90359805951788
they had left the ile ratonneau where the lighthouse stood on the right and were now opposite the point des catalans   73.78665366854716
what is your errand then with me sir   163.6927558460581
tis a rondeau by monsieur voiture that monsieur l abbé is repeating to me   127.23543110479092
but after two or three hours he encountered an obstacle   62.581680480488146
monsieur le comte monsieur le chevalier if ever i am king sire you have already done us more honor than simple gentlemen could ever aspire to therefore gratitude is on our side   146.6629605990138
decidedly muttered franz this is an arabian nights adventure   91.00862609894682
and so people talked of something else   108.26045116082076
whoever hesitates for a second perhaps allows the bait to escape which during that exact second fortune held out to him   156.9994499843824
because then i have no responsibility   116.12465911232255
said mazarin to himself what a sweet face   84.63692589800165
very ill replied the wounded man   137.29110772740245
coquenard rose and took from a buffet a piece of cheese some preserved quinces and a cake which she had herself made of almonds and honey   52.54438959330201
gervais on which the great cardinal had three fleurs de lis embroidered   136.56554351077247
30 in the avenue des champs élysées   35.717745874571364
i said felton i do not fear him nor will i spare him   162.02057399624033
the guards of the cardinal perceiving his youth and that he did not belong to the corps invited him to retire before they attacked   115.19175470489344
i should want a porter   145.2261256292167
oh cried julie i have not lost all hope of some day kissing that hand as i now kiss the purse which he has touched   111.79992438949185
he was attired as he had been on the previous evening and waved his pocket handkerchief to his guest in token of adieu   44.9755059715019
then he had eaten some without saying a word more   100.90737586302465
albert remarked this expressing his fears lest at the outset the parisian mode of life should displease the traveller in the most essential point   96.89551530060376
so let us speak no more of it   155.2808282650032
she will try to seduce you perhaps she will try to kill you   94.15827147261727
yes yesterday   83.36311317252756
lord bless us   59.87874608008391
you know the calamity that has happened to us do you not   136.30501964626052
provided charles is dead it is the axe not the man we must thank   113.47009255781607
by whom did the queen send you this jewel   93.85169085981485
it was planchet who brought into play profitably the recollections of the regiment of piedmont   221.16061130330493
valentine had not seen him   74.52871038848265
he thought directly of his bag and rushed from the inner room where he was sleeping   202.40637942939605
dantès you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him and you will see it will bring tears into the old soldier s eyes   105.13021145090943
on my side i have two sure men who have been in action with my father   123.99387392632512
it was a pity this scene had not occurred in daylight for it was curious to see this rascal throwing himself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant driver of the tilbury   87.87958424485075
40042m the same deadly silence succeeded these words   43.949895365037804
this noise redoubled when d artagnan with a company of musketeers placed himself at the gates of notre dame to secure the service of the church   11.958903268105416
this made the keeper turn around and he burst into a loud laugh   157.21843979177214
give it to me said the duke   113.39243293155593
you mean to say that he betrays me   174.47990642119095
probably said monte cristo with his imperturbable tranquillity   136.68676096151722
come this way gentlemen   215.65474416488047
he saluted the count with the air of a man who is aware of the rank of his guest   153.6835515475355
the cardinal therefore got up perfumed himself dressed and went to the queen to tell her what had detained him   22.838242262056866
only i am not come to discuss politics but to inquire if you have anything to ask or to complain of   46.434745946772765
my father my father   156.14837460773532
dantès was on the way he desired to follow and was moving towards the end he wished to achieve   92.94176779220479
in a dungeon   100.37456726916233
i know what you mean   83.56997436331899
monsieur grimaud he told us his name although he does not talk much monsieur grimaud then went down to the cellar wounded as he was   56.562791636402146
meanwhile they gave up to mazarin the handsomest room in the chateau   167.53421674855636
how have i deceived you   141.6223729487703
count said emmanuel when they were at the end of the place royale put me down at my door that my wife may not have a single moment of needless anxiety on my account or yours   99.36750760194055
and what will he promise us   145.40133765332266
give grimaud time to clear away the breakfast   109.9225577838777
but however all other feelings may be withered in a woman s nature there is always one bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart and that is the shrine of maternal love   125.47817820844723
ah said he i hear a human voice   122.16674744664388
when you can not do so it is indiscreet   4.97759920673046
and a little bit of a thief   78.69221088178261
they are spanish smugglers said he   71.29753207126232
then he looked anxiously at valentine   69.89275772947474
and of whom you have no more knowledge than i of the abbé busoni   133.63649790127963
not the least noise was to be heard   126.833606986688
do you hear   106.62603462766226
one light alone was visible   124.86376836923344
and when he had discharged his two pistols what a terrible noise he made with his sword   69.07710536711139
full pardon was accorded to those who had aided in his escape   70.0892072196555
morrel i thank you in the name of my father and of mercédès   154.53878978638264
de morcerf s who is deceased   142.91247534188983
he has killed the executioner of bethune in an access of passion but now his fury is assuaged   85.12102928559202
although the young man was brave as we know he was terrified at that wild countenance those terribly dilated pupils those pale cheeks and those bleeding lips   208.13843764025793
oh nothing easier   137.0468494303641
why so planchet   125.23779574535001
review your life albert   190.9787932717469
peeping out from the drapery he could see the rows of halberdiers and musketeers around the scaffold and the first ranks of the populace swaying and groaning like the sea   98.77139328860014
so much do i esteem them that i am going to make the comte de la fere a visit that i may converse with him tete a tete and that we may not be disturbed at our interview you must conduct him as i said before to the pavilion of the orangery   75.13192355338518
you think i shall deprive you of those three millions said danglars   32.77839777261731
but as we have said it was at least a league from the château d if to this island   50.67877817858029
my carriage is at the door madame and i must be in rome in five days   84.34632010466764
what are you eating there porthos   68.58734841819077
because he is the brother of coligny   70.65715030959072
0035m yes here i am said the young man with a promising future and a little money   136.9714757130177
thought the gascon here s a young blade who has already his love affair who doesn t at all agree with athos in his hatred to the fair sex   228.7597609725314
one thought in particular tormented him namely that during his journey hither he had sat so still whereas he might a dozen times have plunged into the sea and thanks to his powers of swimming for which he was famous have gained the shore concealed himself until the arrival of a genoese or spanish vessel escaped to spain or italy where mercédès and his father could have joined him   57.10534827849633
in that case your son would be very unpleasantly situated   72.26257220678463
has mankind treated me as a brother   156.72616917570454
i asked to be excused in case i should not be able to discharge my debt to all three   89.35256688109467
well you the cardinal would have given you letters of nobility   54.350207836081516
then accustomed to passive obedience he jumped down from the terrace ran toward the lane and at the end of twenty paces met d artagnan who having seen all was coming to him   114.75851583995824
no doubt his ideas were arranged in a few minutes for he began reading the letter which caused so much uneasiness in the heart of the baroness and which ran as follows madame and most faithful wife   160.12421308113687
this smile appeared to d artagnan to be of bad augury   158.00989478296628
he was petted tended cured   34.45572689830455
poor fernand has been dismissed continued caderousse   84.9375237732661
chevalier take my hand   133.20833536536742
they were therefore somewhat surprised to meet altogether at the door of the hermitage athos starting out from the pont neuf porthos by the rue de la roule d artagnan by the rue des fosse saint germain l auxerrois and aramis by the rue de bethisy   62.29482616544624
he flew then rather than walked toward the convent of the carmes déchaussés or rather deschaux as it was called at that period a sort of building without a window surrounded by barren fields an accessory to the preaux clercs and which was generally employed as the place for the duels of men who had no time to lose   125.0666358238461
advancing a few steps toward the queen he knelt down   136.94212355638592
from the death of the late king till the young one came of age without reckoning wars and sieges seven times   115.62427430423683
i shall benefit by your advice this very evening   74.81162108066643
at this moment la ramee after the interview we have described with the cardinal entered the room   69.64131582280297
let us not even here speak thus of him   118.30837029212337
said he to him   96.3904512298373
those who have read the memoirs of mme   21.204992233333556
and will it be the first time you have ever been there dantès   128.87591149292567
you owe me nothing but some trifle of 20 000 francs which you have been saved out of your travelling expenses so that there is not much of a score between us   73.54927249631827
no pardieu   118.5177881405011
adieu my charmer   60.850260237226024
if my vote and interest can obtain it for him i will readily give him the one and promise the other   142.1523015563899
and who thus advised you   22.739781548079264
d artagnan signed to them to draw near   127.49706540451426
it is quite frightful but deeply interesting said the young lady motionless with attention   103.46855318510758
oh merciful heavens was i not accessory to his death by my supine insensibility by my contempt for him not remembering or not willing to remember that it was for my sake he had become a traitor and a perjurer   105.21023501818514
i ought to have said the wishes and not the will of the people   147.68735164745456
despite the weight of two bodies the blast of the hurricane shook them in the air   110.56697571338172
i don t think they can be in need of any   131.98964460332758
ah just so said albert   104.82163018700787
this was not however a rope ladder but a ball of silk cord with a narrow board which was to pass between the legs the ball to unwind itself by the weight of the person who sat astride upon the board   134.71853274333654
madame said mazarin your majesty overwhelms me with flattering distinction   175.61353667022345
you say i say that monte cristo is an island in the midst of the mediterranean without inhabitants or garrison the resort of smugglers of all nations and pirates of every flag   180.75338260284008
but said andrea ill temperedly by my faith if it was only to breakfast with you that you disturbed me i wish the devil had taken you   32.489806971367045
athos dwelt in the rue férou within two steps of the luxembourg   51.07804231115631
impossible madame   80.64413530539125
caderousse scarcely yet relying on this promise put his legs out of the window and stood on the ladder   163.51664233641264
at the third hit the gentleman fell like a log   162.4329170353028
but remember at the expiration of that time no delay or subterfuge will justify you in m   78.57715941980794
the man we are seeking   125.49093202232413
asked d artagnan uneasily   104.05396903486536
asked morrel after he had read it   120.86296682044456
but as i maintain that the orders of the king and more particularly the orders of the cardinal should be executed d artagnan could not restrain a smile   162.4826115371825
mousqueton said d artagnan you must render me a service   70.8134146717282
30223m ah yes said monte cristo smiling   113.19494057664036
but some of the horses could no longer sustain this pace   132.44253210232628
i am lord de winter baron sheffield   155.83361688570594
she is not his wife yet as it seems to me   65.88421361746576
and having done so entirely on my own account be it understood i would add that i believe you too gentlemanly to refuse giving him some explanation concerning your connection with yanina   97.51096472878507
and did you convey this answer to your guest   105.40746810819967
you have been asked politely and every question is worth an answer   76.99882400308066
she learned drawing music everything   90.65399106855705
maximilian and emmanuel looked at each other   81.76728173340433
arrived at the angle of a street he pointed to a small house isolated solitary and dismal   160.30211927867063
the three blows were scarcely struck when the inside blind was opened and a light appeared through the panes of the outside shutter   159.86988794006587
of madame d aiguillon   190.10068000310798
well this time athos said d artagnan upon my word you are mad   166.59279720414165
in short his whole appearance produced on the mind the impression of a corpse with living eyes and nothing could be more startling than to observe the expression of anger or joy suddenly lighting up these organs while the rest of the rigid and marble like features were utterly deprived of the power of participation   82.85958249690361
come in come in said albert rising and advancing to meet the young man   136.49999429000826
the indictment the judges took their places in the midst of the most profound silence   101.31347259975954
but there are oubliettes   94.76583553180707
the worn out steps were old acquaintances of his   127.80547483433566
the second act passed away during one continued buzz of voices one deep whisper intimating that some great and universally interesting event had occurred   99.01977124372839
he made a step toward the muskets upon which the other three friends had fixed their eyes like men ill disposed to allow themselves to be taken   124.8780056662295
other footsteps going and coming were now heard and a moment afterwards the noise of rustling canvas reached dantès ears the bed creaked and the heavy footfall of a man who lifts a weight sounded on the floor   101.09255753651723
albert felt the blood mounting to his brow   115.62366587393045
you may understand that the moment has come for me to re enter the bosom of the church   97.68853150385613
inform this dear friend that he may remain within that i shall go and see him immediately   93.54199497932562
evidently he did not understand his meaning   76.93862778719819
if there really has been a crime we will investigate it   152.19869937859733
the best   82.04546616205381
in my opinion a withdrawal from paris is absolutely necessary after the double catastrophe of mademoiselle danglars broken contract and m   57.649311339219985
you do not belong to the human species   191.58601474300306
during the exchange of these two words felton drew back quickly and when lord de winter entered he was several paces from the prisoner   94.34639684207579
he sank into his seat and hastily turning over the packet drew forth the fatal letter at which he glanced with an expression of terror   56.76768317129354
replied lord de winter making a bow half courteous half ironical   113.10938956498268
even to his horse monsieur   58.91325755762177
chapter 54   92.58055794814456
so my dear aramis say no more about it and let us prepare to submit to destiny   160.7202019879449
the gentlemen entered and remained standing but at a motion from the queen they seated themselves   102.80049724976134
then count i admire you said villefort who for the first time in this strange conversation used the aristocratic form to the unknown personage whom until now he had only called monsieur   119.52304350083242
gaetano skirted the light carefully keeping the boat in the shadow   143.21834651745513
am i deceived   216.03009062854608
the duke de guise killed monsieur de coligny in the place royale and nothing was said of it   116.24822149064181
i will summon him hither   96.75851173472155
another will be immediately saddled   8.505272116074067
i shall call you presently   86.6235071912703
the other was a large square epistle resplendent with the terrible arms of his eminence the cardinal duke   136.3203074205442
she had the less motive to resist resistance would make so much noise   72.35953270274928
exclaimed lord leven   131.00995191700142
and i can almost say that with my own ears i have heard the clauses of the treaty debated   58.859869094184006
things take a different name and the vulgar do not follow them that is all   64.37948136088374
if it should even compromise me a little said monsieur de comminges with a smile still make your demand   2.168633108050898
tire to him   97.364846010301
it is frightful to hear such things from such a man as you   148.09681878201587
he said respectfully   126.23696558857245
if no obstacle occurs we will both charge together force the enemy s line and throw ourselves into the tyne which we must cross either by fording or swimming   132.9270247631852
indeed i did   189.53286418851036
think of it sire   133.5999370726011
only a letter all perfumed and of an elegant writing in small characters had come for aramis   203.26334597175827
and yet i may not ask for an explanation madame replied monte cristo bowing   59.70022410305082
and how much did they possess   108.93245338829493
cried danglars grasping him by the arm or i will not answer even for your own safety   129.98590543812625
but if a large fortune produces happiness danglars is happy   88.96632615468167
it is unnecessary to state that in the eyes of the young man valentine did not suffer by the contrast   111.09689829980614
at the first cross street andrea stopped his horse and caderousse leaped out   128.9135074668892
and finally he prayed that this sum might be preserved to him and as he prayed he wept   148.4390119600626
excuse me mr   111.77287508400859
why on making a thrust at my adversary whom i had already hit three times and whom i meant to finish with the fourth i put my foot on a stone slipped and strained my knee   87.71535789280216
then some verses to compose which madame d aiguillon begged of me   114.53455108551118
come come said the old man be comforted my poor child   104.26021132584138
i waited your orders said d artagnan crossing swords   150.69667277155327
what does he want with me   99.93236008073158
he must be a great criminal from what the telegraph says   110.49140452861211
d artagnan lost no time in useless compliments   88.06095846437854
the prince looked at him with unspeakable distrust   127.91183575458652
it would have required the penetration of œdipus or the sphinx to have divined the irony the count concealed beneath these words apparently uttered with the greatest politeness   169.3213970683047
well you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of trousers if you have them   104.92917344491678
well i wait patiently do i not   76.66742908376979
i recollect   114.66808058266501
we must never look for discretion in first love   145.84551338159372
who told you of it   131.6122701370157
at a quarter to ten a valet entered   124.64306281724669
like all the great nobles of that period athos rode and fenced to perfection   47.17806463945941
that is the name of your true executioner   156.80761486904314
scarron turned around toward him and came to meet him in his chair   108.22173264807607
porthos and aramis looked at each other and grew pale   147.05233604597709
de villefort notwithstanding his self control was visibly affected and when monte cristo touched his hand he felt it tremble   127.20642320821618
as to the king he made no demonstration of politeness only stopping before the queen   29.687923253801287
doubtless signor pastrini found this pleasantry compromising for he only answered half the question and then he spoke to franz as the only one likely to listen with attention   119.18798223932981
tell the count replied franz that we will do ourselves the pleasure of calling on him   104.02505171396494
franz was less enthusiastic   208.61180681335287
directly   121.09374579974424
milady remained alone with her eyes fixed upon the door   77.09889484943935
the mask and beard became you very well and as to the axe i do not think it would be out of keeping even at this moment   80.6659411514104
listen said the count   152.68885172011045
it was upon the cardinal that all the responsibility fell for one is not a despotic minister without responsibility   46.67382936929123
he shall be tried said the cardinal   133.61617478291862
we will send my brother s servant back to béthune whom as i told you we can trust   92.3763610058393
his face was hidden under the wide brim of his hat   97.52164593029667
i do not then see why without real necessity i should encumber my life with a perpetual companion   99.0888080694256
franz bowed and left the room   83.47560114421364
the baroness was partially reclining on a sofa eugénie sat near her and cavalcanti was standing   135.4112218096388
yes my lord like yourself   103.3779647488774
if he only remains here a fortnight and pays for what he drinks i shall soon re establish my business   56.54998110549331
cried the bandit throwing himself upon his knees and leaning upon his hand for he began to lose his strength with his blood   30.258682862973686
bonacieux which had reminded him of that which he had dragged from under the feet of aramis   195.16980149788537
call the viscount and take the musket with you   68.65954065678434
and then besides the useless blood   65.83706138907188
bah it is now nearly healed and i am sure it is not that which gives you the most pain   164.5942665042524
i have known that said the queen a long time   131.07367993221618
this time i did not content myself with looking but i took my knife out of my pocket felt that the point was sharp and sprang over the wall   148.01920965592518
i shall have further need of him   72.1518742011383
bonacieux had the sweetest smile in the world   116.88869925535656
at the stern the mysterious stranger was standing up looking towards the shore and holding a spy glass in his hand   67.72494362504096
in the third edmond grasped handfuls of diamonds pearls and rubies which as they fell on one another sounded like hail against glass   72.07237324543392
but i have never been presented   103.22422934931355
this raillery exasperated jussac   136.45653488348654
i am quite bewildered and it is natural that it should be so   127.51927185858253
he had received a ball in his thigh which had broken the bone   131.63674441860857
he was right   146.47490430219432
repeated the young girl   230.53214067544496
still further his confidence in the worthy picard at one time so great diminished day by day   57.70572902955171
exclaimed athos to day love is like war the breastplate is becoming useless   93.88632525919796
and you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom have you not   150.62535298056017
you do not know what he is about in the cellar   140.6216505165505
fencing boxing and single stick   8.343521015347207
i will make verses said he   119.38162811079647
dessessart captain of the guards as well as the others   113.87504806852264
i shall detain you until this evening in the palais de justice   112.94863025843438
what has become of monseigneur athos   134.7923896013779
stronger grew the wonder of dantès who almost fancied he had to do with one gifted with supernatural powers   99.16504850960723
but who are you then   111.23266315651196
as d artagnan had no time to lose on account of the audience of the king which was fixed for midday he cast his eyes around and seeing that the street was empty said to his adversary my faith   136.37485302153001
i have promised you the truth   125.26194069878207
what are you going to do my friend   67.79086762579148
here is a bag containing five hundred pistoles in gold   98.30945369445823
that knife which the fatal prudence of the baron deprived me of because he knows the use i would make of it   132.49068146524664
her beauty and high bearing surprised him and when she inquired what had become of her lover it seemed to him that she was the judge and he the accused   71.18393511486799
good thought the gascon this is a promising beginning   145.55101318475852
i have a favor to ask of you   268.70814397058825
and i madame replied athos am looking with admiration   91.93916515120455
otherwise it may be driven back and you will be trampled to death by the horses   12.252967669657934
but before an engagement ensues we shall move your eminence to another castle belonging to our friend du vallon who has three   78.62071516501564
bazin remained at the window   146.15964396672558
the execution will therefore only be delayed long enough for you to arrange your spiritual and temporal affairs   111.42250539032159
and we have just heard continued albert of a new deed of his and so heroic a one that although i have seen him today for the first time i request you to allow me to introduce him as my friend   150.56972602860378
so many loathsome animals inhabited the prison that their noise did not in general awake him   128.1422276204978
valentine entered at this moment and the formalities were resumed   73.44449378631217
several strokes resounded on the door   63.51081496337924
and mordaunt darted out of the general s tent his heart beating and his eyes sparkling with joy   103.85298676117037
so saying haydée arose and wrapping herself in her burnouse of white cashmere embroidered with pearls and coral she hastily quitted the box at the moment when the curtain was rising upon the fourth act   124.18171458671705
then turning toward the prisoner take away that man he said and keep him carefully in sight   99.08745993266346
the old man appeared to be listening attentively and as affectionately as his infirmities would allow to the abbé busoni who looked cold and calm as usual   75.91941463897035
whom am i to take with me   146.36696249355538
as i was on my way here a vessel was coming into port   186.7919368032497
but i will give you a hundred crowns if the first time you go to marseilles you will seek out a young girl named mercédès at the catalans and give her two lines from me   129.2555565986465
you see i destroy it   134.66596600444396
monte cristo endeavored also to leave but maximilian would have died rather than relax his hold of the handle of the door which he closed upon the count   96.704986699389
he fancied monsieur le coadjuteur had sent them back and without dropping the reins he sprang from his box to open the door   37.31082960439291
all the papers found have been sealed up and placed on your desk   210.36206139160805
the matter is gallant   158.45139002684084
as for the count he had fallen on his chair   103.66228276969122
well your majesty said he you see how far my enemies go   97.3356796818955
but his father a sun pluribus impar left his personal splendor to each of his favorites his individual value to each of his courtiers   249.0452665842506
listen said the abbé extending his hand over the wounded man as if to command him to believe   76.9657246456485
yes they appear to be searching a wounded or dead man   140.2931401358451
i am haydée the daughter of ali tepelini pasha of yanina and of vasiliki his beloved wife   166.53766226488347
i have promised to remain forever with you and now i could not break my promise if i would   172.05927392871718
send one of your men disguised as a penitent friar and i will give it to him   79.9274093046247
they found the carriage where they had left it   153.09545802671454
debray she said   132.27352940291598
ah my lord it is a great happiness that the queen who always wished you well had a fancy to send you here where there s a promenade and a tennis court good air and a good table   88.69180063303655
take the diamond then and sell it   90.51136738960862
villefort and his wife both grew red one from shame the other from anger   156.03884692580843
by a man of from forty to forty five years with black hair a dark complexion and a scar on his left temple   127.76574143441164
happiness or unhappiness is the secret known but to one s self and the walls walls have ears but no tongue   194.5073658624717
your interests are concerned in your so doing   156.34611078605863
danglars say to this outburst on the part of the procureur   67.90892131048042
barrois will open the door for you said valentine addressing morrel   34.32033123848211
do you disapprove of this journey my dear m   109.8942519055007
i am inclined to think so   137.31283026198912
at length the long desired sound was heard and instead of one figure as he had expected he perceived that two were approaching him   110.80518273768037
you have then a repugnance to your profession   72.65864067668494
but take care for i fear that this man is entirely devoted to the cardinal   116.03534875580304
should you meet a doctor you will do me a favor by sending him to me   61.304010606063905
one day as i was setting off on an expedition go said she   97.45271340550266
under any other circumstances he would have reprimanded the soldier for indulging in such pleasantry but his conscience murmured too loud for his mouth to dare speak   107.3039337926973
well shall i send for some breakfast here   86.90094933992587
do you know villefort that you are talking in a most dreadfully revolutionary strain   101.17184052780419
marquise said villefort approaching his future mother in law i request your pardon for thus leaving you   99.84240421249682
but sir remarked the young woman these eastern societies in the midst of which you have passed a portion of your existence are as fantastic as the tales that come from their strange land   44.927880527217425
but the thing is at least half done as you have one out of two votes   56.581186933553425
to that exclamation of porthos s succeeded a groaning low and profound which seemed to come from behind a door   93.87713520548746
three arcades were before them and the middle one was used as a door   131.49509071055846
he has done better than that he has made himself understood   80.38910947207725
the next morning he saw albert pass and repass holding an enormous bouquet which he doubtless meant to make the bearer of his amorous epistle   114.44867479181977
were you then permitted the use of pens ink and paper   6.6336661396653795
imagine the large and splendid corso bordered from one end to the other with lofty palaces with their balconies hung with carpets and their windows with flags   197.07483030760181
but mme   153.1098573242869
you are too bad athos   206.24752172339694
he had but to pass his word for a loan and morrel was saved   178.24131450516222
man of talent   217.46411587255972
i will not appear to parley with rebels   124.00875340999727
one is that of edmond dantès lost to me long long since   139.6914231181834
next day a hundred newspapers relate the fact with the names of the victim and the murderer   131.7744078247334
about seven o clock in the morning they set out   148.73635668229286
after the battle of navarino when the greek government was consolidated he asked of king otho a mining grant for that district which was given him   131.21845496757183
ah mate said caderousse you are getting on better terms with your old landlord   101.24625265691571
besides let me own something to you   88.87644476471937
but it is not so easy to forget monsieur that the very next day after your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend madame de villefort which was endangered by the very animals your generosity restored to me   169.26363504791797
bonacieux would have fled in terror   129.18502308237447
and we mercédès and i should be very sorry if he were absent at such a time   136.54249751909833
said she starting at madame danglars touch as she would have done from an electric shock   83.95696241666036
but how could he find his way in the darkness of the night   143.26709066878493
an envoy of the duke of buckingham named montague was taken and proof was obtained of a league between the german empire spain england and lorraine   96.92041316819729
took instead of his black cravat a colored neckerchief which lay at the top of an open portmanteau   99.15215215317396
leu and followed him instinctively   132.2839473175586
very well madame   128.29409035249427
yes if your majesty releases them   155.12246786114858
i will try to accompany you said aramis though i scarcely feel in a condition to mount on horseback   128.55229519006053
do you refuse   101.16643559940341
dantès rose and looked forward when he saw rise within a hundred yards of him the black and frowning rock on which stands the château d if   70.57919984192785
i send them but like pilate washing my hands   77.59196433388571
i was a witness of the last hours of charles i   109.20031692997556
and yet this letter must be somewhere   91.79835730019752
porthos turned his head to the right and to the left and drew himself up with a movement full of dignity   115.73149459009933
he gives you his word of honor said gondy   106.18098256617388
noirtier gave valentine such a look of tenderness and gratitude that it was comprehended even by the notary himself   98.13956117311166
in after years whether he had forgotten this interchange of presents which ought to have cemented our friendship or whether he did not recollect me he sought to take me but on the contrary it was i who captured him and a dozen of his band   111.57092726902425
but he sank down again immediately   111.18025416686888
but this time again his hopes were disappointed and although he listened with all his ears he heard nothing amid the oaths coarse jokes and abuse which passed between the laborers servants and carters who comprised the honorable society of which he formed a part which could put him upon the least track of her who had been stolen from him   71.34773101924037
the duc de grammont received permission from the prince by a glance and went out   109.90060462840334
resumed athos   85.44067717209023
i own to you that that young man s visit has subdued my appetite and probably will rob me of my sleep   70.3321617550223
he was then a more unhappy son than you morrel for he could not even find his father s grave   90.15543157359954
d artagnan had no time for a prolonged love siege   170.3893448619603
where and when have you seen me trifle with a friend s heart and a king s life   103.18023791455158
he repaired therefore immediately to his hôtel and caused himself to be announced   197.68221199912526
but be assured my dear monsieur d artagnan that if i had obtained them from any other source or if they had been confided to me there exists no confessor more discreet than myself   115.97040158931186
go sir count replied d artagnan carelessly   138.07636633542515
the casket would encumber you   62.30884504941426
every time he passed with a friend before his windows at one of which mousqueton was sure to be placed in full livery porthos raised his head and his hand and said that is my abode   165.9506344830225
wait a little porthos before crying out   80.74587983692342
edmond amazed wonderstruck filled his pockets with the radiant gems and then returned to daylight when he discovered that his prizes had all changed into common pebbles   90.811679008726
villefort to whom marseilles had become filled with remorseful memories sought and obtained the situation of king s procureur at toulouse and a fortnight afterwards he married mademoiselle de saint méran whose father now stood higher at court than ever   171.43328993934472
said de guiche   62.71138305299387
and whoever refused to comply with this ceremony was hooted at spat upon and even beaten   218.4635454289493
planchet went down into the yard and wished to saddle the horses   92.79671339962778
but he had been so often warned to mistrust first impulses that he applied the maxim to the impression forgetting the difference between the two words   151.30554088949978
you will not wait till he asks   80.12994837149523
captivity the fourth day chapter lvi   152.99897384414754
but suppose they come unarmed   42.85400686776221
his tongue was paralyzed in his mouth   117.38323760214361
what have you eaten today   150.13694221234653
cried franz your grandfather says he can indicate the person   124.32898385947048
but she she was very beautiful   140.18052541094275
nothing then preventing my escape by this means i examined the grounds   148.0027472791688
he was an intelligent lad and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people amongst whom with dilating eyes he saw the king s attorney   98.66367683654131
i knew that but i supposed he had returned   104.96539507455914
he was found in your lodging   178.24042107504687
omer they breathed their horses with the bridles passed under their arms for fear of accident and ate a morsel from their hands on the stones of the street after they departed again   61.339874517458476
you face the insinuations of the pelagians and the semi pelagians   141.5470625515289
as he was finishing the sound of a cabriolet entering the yard was heard   132.48855874370142
and how did a leader of smugglers continued franz venture to build a vessel designed for such a purpose at genoa   168.89751791910783
am i then threatened with the omelet of crevecoeur   84.04583568764687
it is late and the governor is asleep   78.57539291975432
and to all these questions poor kitty forced to put on a pleasant face responded in a stifled voice whose dolorous accent her mistress did not however remark solely because happiness is egotistical   52.705173818045324
and how many hours of reflection do you ask   120.26626474976382
your father hates me while your grandfather on the contrary what strange feelings are aroused by politics   130.28987086518154
yes i understand everyone would like capital   146.14112521335693
after which your majesty will i think no longer doubt my zeal in your behalf   87.53378815676098
done   116.01817328337927
are you not going to keep your promise of introducing me to the fair subject of our remarks   117.69317799877379
oh merciful heavens   97.494091302048
the indictment chapter 111   115.11358600707158
i was sent there to intercept a correspondence between chalais and the archduke and even then when i was discovered i was nearly torn to pieces   108.7193327029261
at length he raised his head fixed his eagle look upon that loyal open and intelligent countenance read upon that face furrowed with tears all the sufferings its possessor had endured in the course of a month and reflected for the third or fourth time how much there was in that youth of twenty one years before him and what resources his activity his courage and his shrewdness might offer to a good master   93.58705160931173
i should be too happy to be of any service to her   81.03835637750534
culpable at the most of weakness how cruelly punished by his subjects   116.35067415086873
someone approached the bed and drew back the curtains   131.108546170023
master broussel is being killed   96.8105777190747
ma foi captain replied the sentry i do not know   74.85949511840253
you leaned upon my arm upon this madame   56.92459023692981
monsieur mordaunt dislikes you sufficiently not to refuse you afterward   45.91109823472675
the thirty two horses dispersed over seven stages brought them to their destination in eight hours   87.58767426135027
this will do said he and from this letter which might have ruined me i will make my fortune   106.70820009233226
no to be sure replied d artagnan   96.22125659402582
said the guide and pushing danglars into the cell he closed the door upon him   151.77963465956287
i have been bound by my promises as rigidly as any knight of olden times   158.23620405147
absence severs as well as death and if the walls of a prison were between edmond and mercédès they would be as effectually separated as if he lay under a tombstone   110.48976046959285
in former days i had not only three friends i had thirty   105.90575667455366
bonacieux had sunk into an armchair without the power of moving   110.89997884125732
for a moment he convulsively pressed his head within his hands and during that brief period he became nearly mad with terror   109.35781845142498
leave them said monte cristo   117.9319516333602
cried a shrill voice from the end of the room   67.81771139221235
i have to beg you to reflect twice ere you cause a civil war in the kingdom   139.4003697427603
the next morning however just as he removed his bed from the wall he heard three knocks   97.36921310874281
a few locks of gray mingled with his hair which was still thick and matted while his bronzed features and determined glance well suited an old sailor who had braved the heat of the equator and the storms of the tropics   177.19946118511535
i am acquainted with monsieur de putange   190.68088082616129
we will talk over our travels   149.83475821018018
for all this continued milady i should long ago have revenged myself on him if and i don t know why the cardinal had not requested me to conciliate him   49.3933840754162
asked baptistin   54.75591821837942
read the letters and see if i have lied or spoken the truth   198.85153591093382
if i am caught i risk nothing but being taken back again to prison   120.87568791071688
there was no vessel at anchor outside the harbor   54.04267499483795
oh he would kill me   101.87513746319712
who employed you to assassinate me   171.4489385304006
i have sold even to my last diamond to aid him   149.7841124772897
did you see poor barrois die   79.56716949744063
accepted the money   110.95235294960155
this announcement was received in silence   130.72178329540037
it appears so replied monte cristo   96.92559426665873
felton made no reply took the book with the same appearance of repugnance which he had before manifested and retired pensively   78.90916492093882
no madame said villefort   48.287475340152795
they re entered the boat which had brought them to the louvre and thence proceeded to the halles   89.9929924409472
remember at a later period and at a certain moment if any mischance should happen to you said richelieu significantly that it was i who came to seek you and that i did all in my power to prevent this misfortune befalling you   31.451146286667637
again by the usurper with a letter for the bonapartist club in paris   184.63650014702984
you were in a cloister said the executioner and you left it to ruin my brother   117.76124920531527
and all these one hundred and ninety one were royalists   95.28808744792904
my faith said athos i have nothing to say against a retreat   103.86651076881422
be silent i will write   115.76625819791622
he drew portraits with a piece of coal of the cardinal   174.31526105449672
she saw nothing   40.739400796873085
angelo and i had an immense deal of trouble before i could get a chance to speak to beppo   85.56588409834075
the plot is clever   127.7262092401494
said selim in a voice at once so gentle and yet so proud   81.3215998130196
now i have found you nothing prevents my being as well dressed as anyone knowing as i do the goodness of your heart   142.1824969798161
the count de la fere formerly styled athos   111.5683359974638
i shall expect you returned morrel   116.9360661022308
the latter had surpassed himself   61.647526328268555
it is large and there will be no want of room for you all   93.68327354450633
said fernand lifting up his head and looking at caderousse like a man who looks for someone on whom to vent his anger   130.51955851139812
said valentine maximilian come back i entreat you   126.6838049579624
tis he   34.09085477549148
it appears to me that when about to marry your daughter to a young man it is right to make some inquiries respecting his family   148.65652337847825
well search my friend search   154.3306432836301
a most dangerous conspirator a man we are ordered to keep the most strict watch over as he is daring and resolute   82.49487392860395
the letter   100.316193687367
armed men shouldering muskets watched over the barricades with menacing looks   187.41135364736863
cried the gascon don t threaten   100.21986776829257
and he stretched out his hand to reach the letter   148.07338281276523
de villefort nor valentine could consistently undertake   196.62278543771544
describe him to me then   70.09559826031882
no if it does not lighten   162.41976101497733
on honor   165.39733063255457
in that case replied franz as i shall raise none you may make arrangements when you please   162.98808125001196
i see the other soldier issue from the guardroom and come toward us   102.42744731947965
lord de winter adopted the same tactics as milady thinking that as his sister in law employed them they must be the best   119.93357208418708
he was stopped by athos   101.16625074005037
twice or thrice thrusts were attempted on both sides without effect   155.75890750342006
he is not much amiss according to my ideas of good looks   125.97193773846581
decidedly man is an ungrateful and egotistical animal   42.6916498030902
how would you have me know   204.2640157736003
as to bazin he went and lay down on a truss of straw   213.06653305324886
the count appeared for an instant at his window but when they again passed he had disappeared   107.71058498538041
that is to say i had one   104.33621636860711
bowed down with fatigue she was indeed confined to her bed   166.21892675631085
this time d artagnan was not hasty   121.30575797249494
the meeting chapter 91   175.63368652738566
you are a model for regular people   128.53391750234246
0057m danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his intoxication and turning towards fernand said well you understand there is no need to kill him   104.35344368950777
asked d artagnan hesitatingly   30.68755003282409
tell me the name of that generous friend said the king that i may cherish for him an eternal gratitude whether he succeeds or not   141.6085978148895
but i accomplish the order they have given me by forwarding to you a dozen bottles of my anjou wine with which they are much pleased   187.3915505548262
and yet bars at the windows and outside bolts at the door decided the question in favor of the prison   202.41688091246644
leave me here and go and speak to madame de villefort who is trying to attract your attention   77.69825638701732
as regards the generality of mankind it is   45.997695719766796
sir replied raoul putting the sword to his lips as he received it from the count i owe you everything and yet this sword is the most precious gift you have yet made me   194.4027972557305
and he thrust his hands into his pockets   29.30411281629145
oh the wretched hours i have endured the torture to which i have submitted when i saw the deadly poison poured into your glass and how i trembled lest you should drink it before i could find time to throw it away   41.485590597043085
living you would feel shame at my name   84.10246976747618
then the general advanced and making a violent effort to control his feelings i have a son said he and i ought to think of him finding myself among assassins   134.92695289799033
he took no refreshment   80.34363503164911
but unfortunately a recipe excellent for a man like myself would be very dangerous applied to an army which might not awake when it was needed   114.54892008916563
replied the cardinal   103.81592828286381
he found rita senseless in the arms of cucumetto   71.87112009199672
i approve of the deed but i must pray for the dead   113.17733490734341
unfortunately he was an honorable man   129.82800351900238
him to whom your excellency pays that little annuity   137.52691728054933
you are rich then my dear monsieur bonacieux   86.6717412444389
this diamond does not come from an enemy monsieur replied d artagnan it comes from the queen   85.86333882541406
if the fair peasant wishes to carry matters any further we shall find her or rather she will find us tomorrow   102.2396715368778
he felt something like a secret joy at being forever relieved of this dangerous accomplice   102.9020156017014
is it news to you   92.608826013455
possibly said danglars   164.95803162964208
the street was safer for him   81.70465458825916
the two gentlemen turned away their heads in silence   81.32122589547743
but it seems to me that that which he is just now undergoing is hard enough   89.9866333276664
well sir said the queen what is your opinion of this riot   175.88882108086037
and then the baroness remembered that she had felt no pity for poor mercédès who had been afflicted with as severe a blow through her husband and son   26.07715393266905
well such a woman who would place the knife of jacques clément or of ravaillac in the hands of a fanatic would save france   166.11378727367196
oh let them come in   159.12546163320462
let us decamp first and you will understand afterward   136.4027766430539
at twelve the the oh heavens my poor poor child   77.32359710507421
but the chief president had replied with his habitual coolness without betraying either disturbance or surprise that should the agitators refuse obedience to the king s wishes he would have gallows erected in the public squares and proceed at once to hang the most active among them   113.46356379347108
our word included everything   125.21418356671558
he mentioned this to gaetano who replied that nothing could be more easy than to prepare a supper when they had in their boat bread wine half a dozen partridges and a good fire to roast them by   147.3678247406055
this ball had an acrid and penetrating odor   137.2600472220879
replied mazarin   93.11219229414823
he went direct to the bedford tavern and the host who recognized him was delighted to see him again with such a numerous and promising company   122.23680919473225
i have been so these fourteen years   118.40675477031914
de tréville made his entrance triumphantly into the fort l evêque whence he delivered the musketeer whose peaceful indifference had not for a moment abandoned him   104.55727019937427
it was this that made me start when you said the other day at m   30.64798491585367
depend on my care to see that your youth is not blighted or suffered to pass away in ungenial solitude   37.40415509260896
nobody has a higher opinion of the courage and skill of athos than i have   126.88209743663045
in fact mousqueton had not concealed from his master that he had met d artagnan and aramis and that d artagnan in the yellow horse had recognized the béarnese pony upon which he had come to paris and which he had sold for three crowns   120.92612608679221
at this sound as he was already partially exposed to view he stepped back and concealed himself completely remaining perfectly motionless   161.17743932853503
why did not i tell you she had been stolen from me   87.34770973984189
the morning was beautiful and in this early springtime the birds sang on the trees and the sunbeams shone through the misty glades like curtains of golden gauze   40.38846587833815
de tréville himself returned   187.15309261302562
return emmanuel to your charming wife and present my best compliments to her   153.21365645963945
instead of living the retired baker you might live as a bankrupt using his privileges   73.53756579966117
pray mind what you say for you are touching on the most secret wishes of my heart   140.44564615416516
mercédès uttered these words with such deep anguish with an accent of such intense despair that monte cristo could not restrain a sob   31.332755059190532
but in vain did he rack his imagination   138.95021892546123
no no i would rather die   82.68480600142115
my love said the marquise attend to your doves your lap dogs and embroidery but do not meddle with what you do not understand   132.12901336924472
ah said caderousse i had promised and you are breaking your promise   190.67860035365328
and does my father mean to remain long in paris   47.43328483682177
but resumed she to whom the cardinal addressed this flattering compliment if in spite of all these reasons the duke does not give way and continues to menace france   120.40369055479906
have a care cried porthos to his opponent   80.48688061290898
you see my dear that for picturesque expression and generosity of spirit there is not much to choose between the language of either party   128.61908723970132
thus all may go well all may be for the best   73.37676877770879
mercédès sighed while endeavoring to smile   160.66632261487044
whither would you have me go without friends without money in a part of france with which i am unacquainted and where i have never been before   180.38164570193248
aramis seized the poker and gave the signal to stop   45.77007177627689
morrel was seen carrying with superhuman strength the armchair containing noirtier upstairs   109.75298551369625
and you said athos you forget that you committed a very different kind of imprudence in pronouncing lord de winter s name   153.10955567240475
now i am convinced   77.45366161686584
ma foi i have called three times without once seeing him   87.80940037518371
aramis you certainly are full of wisdom   76.91291979590038
from twelve to two o clock danglars had remained in his study unsealing his dispatches and becoming more and more sad every minute heaping figure upon figure and receiving among other visits one from major cavalcanti who as stiff and exact as ever presented himself precisely at the hour named the night before to terminate his business with the banker   133.78433660160152
none on my word   123.31638444145463
the young woman extended her stiff white hands towards him   84.446701793008
i perfectly well remember perugia sir and the hôtel des postes and the festival of which you speak said madame de villefort but in vain do i tax my memory of whose treachery i am ashamed for i really do not recall to mind that i ever had the pleasure of seeing you before   139.64457913743686
i was not deceived said he   140.1718025029944
athos standing looked at them both with indescribable pleasure   47.77505867804285
but said the baroness i thought you never put the money out to interest   106.62439818549987
but i can not i am starving   122.06621122306507
willingly answered the soldier   94.92590576611407
do these belong to the cardinal   191.3255653429503
prince cavalcanti said the latter   83.54651333388091
in the evening m   92.56465363637136
it was about five o clock   153.77313453156347
and grimaud whom the general distress could not induce to break the silence imposed by his master heaved sighs enough to soften the stones   32.07015885167317
the hapless dantès was doomed   138.4406633964539
he is there   54.25870001170058
in no instance let us say was this worthy gentleman accused of deriving personal advantage from the cooperation of his minions   31.41146018629314
so much the worse said porthos   210.37309997045512
then in order to test the capacity of the testator the first notary said turning towards him when an individual makes his will it is generally in favor or in prejudice of some person   119.88790147215607
what object think you have this expedition to ré and this league with the protestants of la rochelle which i am projecting   123.87175065155701
yes for mazarin has granted what i desire   73.93406851661251
my officer said athos has forgotten to give a piece of very important information to the lady and has sent me back to repair his forgetfulness   22.871141502113474
it is well known how violent the king s prejudices were against the queen and how carefully these prejudices were kept up by the cardinal who in affairs of intrigue mistrusted women infinitely more than men   52.48589930554984
yes hither   97.75395846007511
well two words will refresh your memory   133.44082764773216
she desired me to give them to you   64.34820987766525
when i look at you parisians idlers on the boulevard de gand or the bois de boulogne and think of this man it seems to me we are not of the same race   162.730529374859
it expressed a whole poem of restrained anger proud disdain and generous indignation   115.71075491520368
yes repeated the leader in a whisper god bless his majesty   179.7105975591924
and you will tell him i will publish the report of bois robert and the marquis de beautru upon the interview which the duke had at the residence of madame the constable with the queen on the evening madame the constable gave a masquerade   146.75766549721163
you think you were   121.7580246495638
sir i shall call my people   85.20990789558991
but the royal couriers have been more expeditious than you and here are monsieur de flamarens and monsieur de chatillon who bring me from her majesty the queen anne of austria the very latest intelligence   148.7128398831909
dandré   192.54991576136104
they were waiting at the entrance of the rue sainte catharine and their horses were fastened to the rings of the arcade   196.33988756138655
the envoy presented his letter of introduction which the latter read with english coolness and having finished i understand said he perfectly   54.17929313975106
friend said athos gravely remember that it is the dead alone with whom we are not likely to meet again on this earth   41.63133291518744
a passport for embarkation must be obtained   147.38900137699136
in consequence he took to his heels arrived breathlessly at the councillor s door and knocked violently   117.8714609980831
oh you are young while i am beginning to get old   171.7603194870636
d artagnan felt his horse giving way under him and with his wonderful agility threw himself to one side   170.12393388606046
if they meant to execute him at la grêve it could scarcely be worth while to gag him as they had nearly reached the place of execution   76.48697470598489
in spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly frustrated his hopes dantès did not lose his presence of mind but descended into the passage dragging his unfortunate companion with him   193.50698432772015
the procureur went out after having double locked the door   97.87162530727637
if rage or sorrow ever torture the heart it is when a lover receives under a name which is not his own protestations of love addressed to his happy rival   75.18864936942924
i only supposed it must be seven or eight o clock in the evening for it was in the month of october and it was quite dark   162.77068704624736
he told me that he should henceforth recruit his musketeers from among the guards of monsieur the cardinal   88.18092668454841
aramis drew the letter from his pocket   129.18880143710498
i gave you my reasons   139.9924348665569
he is worse than that he is a devil   160.49476472458713
danglars nodded his head   114.49099193859418
yes replied the old man   82.4524732155146
and he held out to the concierge the notary s order   111.03373369864772
you will permit me to make one remark   98.01299412165538
rochefort you remember him   104.04993055438194
well monseigneur   26.923454419701343
you then served louis xviii   164.9272328064214
was he the man that stabbed you   166.97313010185252
among worldly people manner is contagious   214.69476094274137
and if the cardinal asks for you what answer can we make   28.014951083002117
do you know sir these gentlemen are each of them worth fifteen hundred pounds   82.42947599432807
d artagnan and not to m   152.1670629022051
like athos he had discovered the stains of blood   124.56081720293459
the man in the mask stopped before a low door and drew out a key   145.99635456057183
under the oldest and thickest of these trees reclining on cushions sat my father   157.27148828607028
since mazarin has sent for you it is because he wants you   147.90506201348376
20253m they are my bankers in the capital of the christian world returned the count quietly   31.699170152297626
i have no other master but you   63.97938428139074
a great age you mean monsieur porthos   94.95226044342675
of that which i am ready to feel toward you   99.30448267272857
and this explains how d artagnan had quarters in the rue tiquetonne at the hotel de la chevrette   158.39883497766084
stop cried d artagnan   25.233454105729237
exclaimed the cavalier with a soft voice   126.52340349383385
he exclaimed what has thus disturbed you   46.5343166609256
you have my word said he   96.03004983418737
d artagnan who though wanting in practice had a sound theory redoubled his agility   79.79093679397525
wish your sister good morning master peter   203.5084554990619
a great man in his own country added debray   117.25200876496268
that deposit may be at any moment withdrawn and if i had employed it for another purpose i should bring on me a disgraceful bankruptcy   139.40691092993745
madame de lannoy whom according to your majesty s command i have frequently interrogated told me this morning that the night before last her majesty sat up very late that this morning she wept much and that she was writing all day   177.66053594418491
so you like it you rogue   174.94600933612043
the three listeners looked at one another in alarm   89.40794938227205
all quite correct   79.69320788807903
seven of his eminence s guards placed hors de combat by you four in two days   51.391895020947224
bonacieux could not close his eyes   135.5241672679477
as he had seen milady on board a vessel at the moment he was leaving england he suspected that it was almost without a doubt on account of the diamond studs   90.94554838473479
so that but for this marriage she would have been your heir   69.15857086340964
i understand my game kitty   219.83173503850338
at this moment villefort returned   116.30690561845776
no signed the old man   146.0980407945445
but where shall we go   96.4777083934093
let us dispatch said the duke   176.03063324705676
another method of assassination   100.98963940900953
danglars that you are asking so many questions   19.397795585953787
he turned towards porthos and aramis   126.79503275148359
he asked himself if after having called forth these foul creatures from their dens he should have the power of making them retire again   112.89348214715672
noirtier closed his right eye   121.83114275525716
but dantès can not remain forever in prison and one day or other he will leave it and the day when he comes out woe betide him who was the cause of his incarceration   50.64397056715481
the duvil   88.01102605539457
inquired the young man much alarmed   237.2294732824529
but this encounter sire is quite out of the ordinary conditions of a duel   29.404561314500825
a parliamentary officer clothed in black and with a gravity that augured ill entered bowed to the king and unfolding a parchment read the sentence as is usually done to criminals before their execution   161.4866403821644
i have heard enough from the lips of oliver cromwell to know what to expect   148.14139316827064
that letter is not yet gone   117.20359286240858
30053m i beseech of you maximilian to cease trifling and tell me what you really mean   132.5652073192165
no my lord but he will be answered the guard   108.57795591592507
i prefer remaining honorably in the capital   128.72007204273905
here is your sword   98.77706622937711
morrel s wish also who would fain have conveyed the old man against his consent   175.76453003458687
he grew thin he now grows fat   132.88131066005076
mademoiselle   113.53535695595582
mordaunt and touches me keenly   132.31809364690596
i also said aramis   48.551449686031106
how is it that i have never met you at his house   115.05858082476267
de busigny   137.9786754189753
he compared the writing in the bracket with the writing of the certificate placed beneath morrel s petition and discovered that the note in the bracket was the same writing as the certificate that is to say was in villefort s handwriting   138.68098162444485
you are a great almsgiver said the visitor and although you are said to be rich i will venture to offer you something for your poor people   66.44580927904487
you are in a hurry sir count said d artagnan   144.7325639395327
i shall love you as i loved my father   88.28328960064042
although it is only just beginning did a lovely summer s day ever dawn with greater purity than has marked the commencement of your career   184.94657114034405
gentlemen once more take him to prison and keep him under key as long as possible   145.34155075472876
we shall see   82.35762722481863
accordingly that same evening milady commenced her journey   111.75987724955232
he took up the deadly weapon again his lips parted and his eyes fixed on the clock and then shuddered at the click of the trigger as he cocked the pistol   98.3943817474637
i say that according to all probability i shall not be able to undergo the fatigues of the siege of la rochelle and that it would be far better that you should appoint there either monsieur de condé monsieur de bassopierre or some valiant gentleman whose business is war and not me who am a churchman and who am constantly turned aside for my real vocation to look after matters for which i have no aptitude   132.3482279064694
but at the sight of the young man who detached himself from the wall like a statue walking from its niche and at the noise of the steps which she heard resound behind her mme   74.13580027734686
and at the same instant dantès felt himself flung into the air like a wounded bird falling falling with a rapidity that made his blood curdle   138.8691208738548
the calumniator is not yet punished and he may hope that he will not be   80.1333787487145
why did you not say so at once my dear sir   91.35277658383086
it would be his bedroom they would attack and they must reach it by the back staircase or by the window in the dressing room   130.4127119339655
it seems to me said franz speaking in an undertone to albert that if this person merited the high panegyrics of our landlord he would have conveyed his invitation through another channel and not permitted it to be brought to us in this unceremonious way   121.10080909232055
one thing still puzzles me observed dantès and that is how you managed to do all this by daylight   91.96171166215377
if they are penitent said athos let them follow us   56.17726634295862
and they darted on anew   128.16300831795814
héloïse de villefort   127.08082447124183
but what shall we drink to so as to avoid wounding any susceptibility   63.043971362874245
rothschild   162.1684026736125
they have abducted her monsieur   99.02494258162743
did you come here sir to see the telegraph   94.27757622722476
ah in such a case one supposes sister sister said maximilian coming to the count s aid monsieur is quite right   156.89291534596072
and do you think she is not there   129.97452630723302

if it be to avenge her i am ready to follow you   160.09202763436227
then he would be free to make his researches not perhaps entirely at liberty for he would be doubtless watched by those who accompanied him   30.55183240298257
you promised to obey me implicitly   64.99574099097605
albert stood one moment speechless by the side of his mother s bed   73.37488369778279
besides he has grown fat and perhaps has lost his fitness for active service   86.83820505420124

free   113.87826723038712
it appears that these appointments are all made for eleven o clock thought d artagnan   168.27697229802664
you will conduct us yourself then to that door   139.06727087197817
which is my best cavalry horse   78.30313716107189
it was only known that on the following sunday a te deum would be sung at notre dame in honor of the victory of lens   26.78013605993158
d artagnan is for mazarin he said to himself   126.1946997518951
i was rocked when an infant in the arms of old ocean and on the bosom of the beautiful amphitrite   56.42801933145863
that s your opinion   183.82195838747214
before i die i must not forget that i have my executioners to punish and perhaps too who knows some friends to reward   95.79725126594339
and for fear no doubt that the sight of them might bring his master back to ideas of this world bazin had laid his hands upon sword pistols plumed hat and embroideries and laces of all kinds and sorts   114.04968194583942
good journey to him   103.60624024212956
in the meanwhile how disheartening to see the woman one loves long for those thousands of nothings which constitute a woman s happiness and be unable to give her those thousands of nothings   117.4638299621503
let us go and die with them   142.78969776551787
but on timidly opening his eyes he found himself with his nose fixed between the two shoulders of porthos that is to say exactly upon the baldric   122.67276203025834
monseigneur will be at hand to testify that it was freely given   108.51622388900107
said d artagnan pressing her hand more closely   114.02986715164226
at the first sound of the morning trumpet the friends separated   137.38001682094014
go and take this key with you   22.290981226101877
poor young man said monte cristo in a low voice   118.06423971704095
gone never to return   145.12127263986625
if we were to see you fighting i can assure you that we would make no effort to prevent you   96.31382146156906
but the assailants attacked their foes with such velocity that in a moment they were upon them   146.31051954854567
your horse is tired already he froths at the mouth whilst mine looks as if he had only just left the stable   58.831426327921484
you see you still are king   120.78461472554474
franz was too far off to hear what they said   105.57089226826717
madame danglars who although past the first bloom of youth was still strikingly handsome was now seated at the piano a most elaborate piece of cabinet and inlaid work while lucien debray standing before a small work table was turning over the pages of an album   112.92797171514306
and we became the more intimate from there being many resemblances of character between us   103.21588872103388
i have already had the honor of telling you i was said morrel   139.9321397753067
by the latter i mean your relatives and friends   128.7040402788732
antoine he turned round to look gaily at the bastille   112.93648376137882
he felt a slight disappointment however when he saw that this place was already taken by a compeer named mousqueton and when porthos signified to him that the state of his household though great would not support two servants and that he must enter into the service of d artagnan   194.39052245788827
the carriage which had been stopped for a minute resumed its way passed through the crowd threaded the rue st   172.98990265090748
a procurator s dinner however brilliant had been the part played by porthos in the duel it had not made him forget the dinner of the procurator s wife   94.89782307108499
it is the blood of the unfortunate man whom you left at the inn and who died in my arms   173.94772274024766
pray tell me what you think baron for i feel uneasy i can assure you having some considerable property in their hands   73.86342252002527
monsieur marechal you must indeed have found yourself in wondrous peril to have undertaken so strange a commission   158.45955537828306
the breakfast at m   167.51473079382566
the fifth sharer in edmond s bequest was his own father   125.02187851652347
placed by popular confidence at the head of that movement i can appreciate better than any other its significance and its probable results   94.04883988927233
on the evening of the twenty fifth as they were entering arras and as d artagnan was dismounting at the inn of the golden harrow to drink a glass of wine a horseman came out of the post yard where he had just had a relay started off at a gallop and with a fresh horse took the road to paris   193.7124015950732
you have then seen something   119.12740303183244
and as he had no desire to support a polemic discussion with his friend s valet he simply moved him out of the way with one hand and with the other turned the handle of the door of number five   17.513945016497473
this army is commanded by a butcher or the son of a butcher it matters little colonel harrison   150.94806001346709
and to whom am i indebted for so happy a termination to my late dreadful alarm   140.98022188038553
nothing replied the latter   14.735423117591765
very good very good   144.69441205812683
the domestic bowed respectfully and invited them to enter   112.65282316556228
what i most loved after you mercédès was myself my dignity and that strength which rendered me superior to other men   134.31031592702067
athos smiled and opened the window   30.17015148568423
you must show me the proofs against him   66.29934572108519
he would not take them   149.69628655016004
shall i tell him that he can count on you   152.7148758783714
at nine o clock the president of the club presented himself   137.62246172484964
it seemed as though they were both inspired at the same time with some horrible thought   85.07993067662136
thank you a thousand times   119.03302088468945
planchet much surprised at the inquiry turned back   148.25626493790315
as to athos he went out without any mystery took his horse which was tied with those of his friends to the fastenings of the shutters in four words convinced the attendant of the necessity of a vanguard for their return carefully examined the priming of his pistols drew his sword and took like a forlorn hope the road to the camp   105.30350502888706
a black point floated on the sea   32.869742644270985
i am indeed to be pitied   129.81072367629127
no he still persists in looking upon you as the most incomprehensible and mysterious of beings   100.21136332915384
immediately without any order being given or his place of destination indicated the coachman set off at a rapid pace and plunged into the streets of the city   53.70748643407213
she had many a time felt humiliated by the self sacrifice and disinterestedness shown by the gascon gentleman   137.87928336365772
monsieur de beaufort or another   198.26407147719158
the story has been told by the corsican to some priest who in his turn has repeated it   194.63586321727087
and i hope ere long to introduce you if not to my wife at least to my betrothed mademoiselle eugénie danglars   153.2609610062428
and seeing that sweet pale face those lovely eyes closed that beautiful form motionless and to all appearance lifeless the idea occurred to him for the first time that perhaps she loved him otherwise than as a daughter loves a father   132.33268059744753
still as i have already told you i have an instinctive affection for him the source of which i can not explain to you   55.958178360050425
chapter liii   197.98804316753547
the proposal was too advantageous to be refused the more so as the person for whom the yacht was intended had gone upon a tour through switzerland and was not expected back in less than three weeks or a month by which time the builder reckoned upon being able to complete another   164.17230856861065
to reach england athos lowered his voice all france covered with spies and creatures of the cardinal must be crossed   100.56458146296444
asked an officer who appeared at that moment upon the threshold of the room   49.64004614357657
the only chance for albert s safety then will arise from your emotion   174.51156427295658
yes returned the duke i must confess i sometimes think of it   62.23971177618
50157m my father i will know who my father is said the obstinate youth   154.1038195869076
you see now why i did not care to know your gentleman in the mask   113.70883149075172
exclaimed friquet   111.73002299320783
insisted the count   74.0879059023489
you are convinced now edmond are you not   133.8707401974392
acting by my advice my poor sister had refused to comply with the unreasonable demands of benedetto who was continually tormenting her for money as long as he believed there was a sou left in her possession   109.56926435386896
that is true enough returned caderousse   160.9166516711178
de saint méran had been unwell for some days   87.88029448573651
and mind if the wine is bad we will send him to find better   124.08368071549113
there was a great deal going on that morning and many business like persons at the palais   82.84422937350351
but how is it that you know so much of these matters   95.25722779920696
and i can well understand said the countess shrugging up her beautiful shoulders as though an involuntary shudder passed through her veins that those who have once seen that man will never be likely to forget him   184.36045134433374
these united considerations made albert more lively and anxious to please than he had hitherto been   137.93600472714857
on the morrow he received the last touches of mousqueton s brush for an hour and took his way toward the rue aux ours with the steps of a man who was doubly in favor with fortune   127.46930832174921
for you perceive that i have left off mine and put on yours   72.32968546245637
two hours afterwards he came on deck as the boat was about to double the island of elba   54.06380090274998
this man evidently possesses the power of influencing events both as regards men and things   73.2564296971664
anne of austria richelieu mazarin and the courtiers of the period less faithful than in the history of m   150.37048647398774
but since then everything has changed in and about me   215.32209799149064
athos was for a few moments thoughtful   132.86753096432133
i raised my head quickly and saw mercédès who at once shut the blind   101.11567548050456
now nothing of the kind has happened   67.28406589305744
and all these men who had entered enraged passed from anger to pity and blessed the royal infant in their turn   145.90312761939666
they had had a long ride and were dying with hunger and thirst   143.40539045850184
but this time she had to contend with an unpolished nature concentrated and insensible by force of austerity   175.9443768997911
inquired danglars with an air of indulgence and good nature that made monte cristo smile acquainted as he was with the secrets of the banker s domestic life   142.59758624422338
said the old man he is so much attached to us   90.04815155643986
said d artagnan that matters little   86.70439213291546
the young man in reply took up the chisel bent it into the form of a horseshoe and then as readily straightened it   106.94486222644781
for three days he watered this cabbage with a distillation of arsenic   134.39649385868688
bring here immediately the king s attorney m   95.2584676347676
he may take me to task for some foolish trifle or other he will bring his witnesses or will insult me in some public place and i am expected to kill him for all that   87.43235866881567
bazin scandalized made a sign of the cross with the bottle in his hand   97.05326430895866
from time to time a flash of lightning stretched across the heavens like a fiery serpent lighting up the clouds that rolled on in vast chaotic waves   86.68135174777996
well now what do you say to a cart   75.06893740607279
i speak frankly to you   105.46330698784071
here sir said a voice behind him   130.2633382093425
come and watch by the dead and all the wretched family will be grateful to you   126.48713366683958
but do not ask from me more than sisterly affection for my heart is another s   164.40202225280018
well said caderousse why don t you come   127.48591910693395
behold   110.07999235881053
i see that you participate in a prevalent error said madame danglars   100.16835009175016
it is with madame   228.13092990120367
none can fly from a dungeon who can not walk   79.74009118009428
and that is the very thing that alarms me returned dantès   111.38429637280952
this picturesque attire set him off to great advantage   147.45929033610904
do you preach them   130.7750348365126
i wish i could say as much   149.1649077727268
a little town on the lys   93.59567130038795
no said she withdrawing it gently no my friend touch me not   83.59526157071583
madame de chevreuse evidently went from surprise to astonishment and from astonishment to stupefaction   100.46311526479751
oh said morrel carried away by his friendship you do not know him and i do   106.67372971803918
martin giving half his cloak to a poor man   144.8120360592203
our interview must be kept secret   113.2035339974783
she did not obtain it however and went to visit the old man   191.338795733051
exclaimed dantès in grief stricken tones   78.66135242451793
now for my part i met them in the lobby after the conclusion of the piece   113.64921250238453
étienne soon returned from his errand   149.66847896942227
count to possess valentine would have been a happiness too infinite too ecstatic too complete too divine for this world since it has been denied me   86.44935041019656
you are my sister in religion   150.02361620044942
and i answered you porthos that it was not a good plan   119.27117398406007
and i thank you   184.38317280799734
lord de winter tore his hair   80.86505196671347
i assure you that as long as i live i shall never love anyone else   83.01896684135721
that will do replied the cardinal   112.70559489520227
porthos said d artagnan if you can still speak say a word my dear porthos to this good planchet   139.93324754011968
then if you wish to take my advice said the young man coldly i would recommend you to travel   49.90079509285355
he learned their numbers instead   104.49484924383151
he not only extended his hand to the young man but flew to him with open arms   128.77959906447458
d artagnan said athos this is no joke i trust   116.5426274298943
it was a terrible moment for the young man   102.81731747634852
upon my soul these women would puzzle the very devil to read them aright   24.50783101620995
i had turned up the earth over a surface of more than twenty feet square and a depth of two feet   189.8277973337793
for him the cardinal was only an officer coming to visit a lady   79.44867273080511
he will be forced to do so smiled the spaniard   124.39275232565576
my lord who told you that   182.89653878761214
it is indeed a sum which might be regretted even by a philosopher   144.89916912685345
what else have you done   148.69085915666184
he dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count and the magnificence of his entertainment in the grotto of the thousand and one nights   113.17179559884934
he was convinced that lucien s visit was due to a double feeling of curiosity the larger half of which sentiment emanated from the rue de la chaussée d antin   39.540446365471055
monsieur said the cardinal you have been arrested by my orders   148.51425986216577
if they find us here we are lost   113.6259488198106
cap de diou   137.68484263413671
according to your idea then my brain is turned   121.3146050933491
a cold sweat burst from the brow of milady   166.56221521749086
the first that we have not finished breakfast   179.10694395593436
there was no address on it   5.965186230076142
on the contrary returned gaetano the chief who was told you were a young frenchman invites you to sup with him   186.2086570883378
i will come count i will be sure to come said villefort eagerly   15.152984424825078
yes said the duke smiling and i even believe that i know that other person   135.74624009642838
his eye wandered to a long stout sword on his flank and he instinctively slipped it around within reach of his right hand   53.85145798406271
it would be impossible to describe mousqueton s astonishment when from the threshold of the door he saw the four friends approaching followed by a sergeant with a dozen men   112.64652564096102
as he spoke villefort drew the letter from his pocket and presented it to dantès   83.08250768400514
well then you must give me your word to return immediately to your hotel and make no attempt to follow this man tonight   127.81936783304116
it would indeed be a pity he should   155.5201580363251
50255m what   143.63288343201572
the house may be suspected   107.47315427390187
oh a letter   108.39673915534375
disguised as a coachman   137.79232555292893
said athos very anxiously   151.65144795614563
but she could not suppose that he had dug a countermine so promptly and so boldly   52.10433322708165
want of fortune perhaps   75.51874746950148
perhaps you may know at some future period and in the mean time i request you to excuse my declining to put you in possession of my reasons   187.69117162007194
when he had rung in her ears the five hundred thousand francs promised by the cardinal   145.84322230731067
having told you this begin   86.70569831217887
franz fell powerless on a chair   103.12882470628452
but you know it and will interpret for me   178.20084524021323
oh heavens how strangely he expresses himself count   124.9982816813988
could you put me in communication with your witty and agreeable friend   107.56564074942949
monseigneur replied d artagnan with an embarrassed air   65.49080816825554
women   169.99195908429257
the red duke   123.51048086344619
then all is agreed   141.5735823306014
please god   126.29804117272276
at half past twelve the queen was with her women where   79.34251429119556
but as soon as the road began to be more lonely and dark he drew softly nearer so that when they entered the bois de boulogne he found himself riding quite naturally side by side with his master   82.3116284715947
they are gone to seek a very strict convent in italy or spain   85.40336977581815
ali looked at his master for further instructions   62.70382649703772
all attempts to disperse the groups collected in the streets or silence their exclamations were in vain   70.6088937997275
barrois looked at the old man   123.16685931907949
and do you really repent   117.89651977707905
i do not want books i am satisfied with my food and do not care to walk about   92.0472157307575
what do you desire it to be   169.6625952888839
my dear monsieur de rochefort   166.49120767696553
everything said he to raoul shall be done as you desire   163.326549453993
three persons only could understand this language of the poor paralytic   126.27066531544216
and then my dear marquis he would certainly have done everything for me that i performed for him   115.63994793287438
d artagnan then repeated his name and in an instant recovering all his remembrances of the present and the past m   70.26176992098323
i could have drunk fifty bottles more   127.71593479129815
go to bed or at least lie down in your clothes   161.5971280146404
but continued the porter he would not take them   79.01398274616568
our gascon promised this without risk for he knew all that was meant   121.71936705744604
the young man appeared on the threshold of the minister s closet in one hand holding his hat in the other the letter   122.13580051672857
to the judge to the judge madame   226.91520691113314
my friend you take me for some one else   66.01653064342977
114 frs   96.8773756879496
sir said d artagnan how can you talk like that when you are in the company of gentlemen and have such an excellent sword at your side   82.05949056907343
and both extended their hands as if to seize the king but before they could touch him with the tips of their fingers both had fallen one dead the other stunned   146.65797782048185
she was as well acquainted with it now as a mistress is with that of the lover of her heart   39.592299101541755
what you tell me seems very strange   123.92947524684088
i always suppose anything people please and besides you must concede something to diseased minds   195.96901597581962
and in five minutes we shall have galloped a quarter of a league   83.59012460942807
that will fall in wonderfully well   152.1853487075811
well said comminges suppose one thing   126.35456955932563
determined to put the advice of m   122.29736951330369
nay said danglars it is my fault   35.20144606082469
it inspires me with the idea that m   133.56842690447442
ali is my slave and in saving your life he was but discharging his duty to me   165.51275894408417
cried valentine in astonishment   121.69536283501066
you edmond on the contrary you are still young handsome dignified   123.07313262097797
if he wanted valentine he closed his right eye only and if barrois the left   153.68606605543874
you are not only welcome but welcome back   117.80592787233286
i am ready my son said mercédès   139.21308761726837
the prince will vanquish you as he has always done   156.5449548171267
aramis had killed one of his adversaries but the other pressed him warmly   161.34353206306048
it may be   91.20852210900047
planchet said d artagnan i am going out for all day perhaps   147.32713655839365
exclaimed d artagnan draw up the blinds of his majesty s carriage   65.4267222095645
you will excite your blood and that would produce an appetite it would require a million a day to satisfy   147.66863158369307
dantès reflected as he worked on the shout of joy which with a single word he could evoke from all these men if he gave utterance to the one unchanging thought that pervaded his heart   36.6462263693453
you are still with us i presume   30.1667420011928
the whole world my poor child has abandoned your mother   135.93591597726322
repeated madame de villefort   42.55333715340559
for instance there is apoplexy that lightning stroke which strikes but does not destroy you and yet which brings everything to an end   85.01486269931728
the glance was of sublime eloquence   30.963956710137396
and he likewise recollected that during the past half hour the poor woman had passed close to him without doubt carried away by the same power that had caused her disappearance   135.12543385240804
well i will tell you a secret   129.92031602135842
but grimaud had for twelve or fifteen years preserved habitual silence and a habit of fifteen or twenty years duration becomes second nature   106.01114732316765
it is told that the duc d antin removed in a single night a whole avenue of trees that annoyed louis xiv   119.10219958848096
the insult was terrible and although unknown to the rest of the world i felt it live and fester at the bottom of my heart   93.6828721495577
how is it that we four men who have faced armies without blinking begin to tremble at the mention of a child   51.19532545712464
i made such haste that i am certain of not having been forestalled   150.59158531548493
d artagnan who foreseeing such an event had kept his eye on him sprang toward him caught him in his arms and assisted him to his chamber   114.65450931944773
the table and chair had nothing the pail had once possessed a handle but that had been removed   111.93080690682916
yes count replied villefort in a voice now scarcely human   91.08906659237401
yesterday morning it appears franz declined the honor   88.64281656717277
monsieur said the steward it is fatality i am sure   85.67617229063387
never fear quarrels but seek adventures   77.19767399173497
farewell to all the feelings that expand the heart   125.45792913209618
from yanina   71.72018207674321
tis settled said aramis   57.20806395002518
mousqueton was seasick   34.48457348511802
there is doubtless some mistake easily explained   88.34112612566852
they advanced and athos who was the first to enter gazed a moment in silence on that pale and noble face framed in its long and now untidy matted hair the blue veins showing through the transparent temples his eyes seemingly swollen by tears   121.50780854997684
cried his majesty s guardsman   132.00088898552008
and who is this cavalier henrietta   151.04485128267206
tis here said athos   109.29706702609276
it is important that none of your crew should see me   44.73604557858607
it is probable that if gaetano had related this previous to proposing the expedition franz would have hesitated but now that they had started he thought it would be cowardly to draw back   133.58741022237913
but persisted the queen if such be your advice and you have his interest at heart send him help of men and money for i can do nothing for him   19.714626962752604
rochefort passed at a gallop   170.70617133851397
but where is the captain   73.45817143630188
chapter lxxix   116.5590894183573
nay said she do not smile   179.2067269049361
then noticing that julie was struck with the sound of his voice tell me continued he was he not about my height perhaps a little taller with his chin imprisoned as it were in a high cravat   160.42201649178367
he is accustomed to my ways and i am particular   143.39988637277816
but one day the count broke the stock and had then cast the gun aside   105.75840426881886
during the whole of this conversation valentine had remained silent   187.37233397777482
it is so   76.76096057961827
he s well guarded now   116.19133011241853
his reflections were not very cheerful   119.4817942507055
it was arthur   196.4430484438489
he was thinking by himself and even seriously racking his brain to find a direction for this single force four times multiplied with which he did not doubt as with the lever for which archimedes sought they should succeed in moving the world when someone tapped gently at his door   89.5822877001273
porthos mechanically drew his dagger from the scabbard   123.44933410052208
athos turned around with an effort   198.35601437555852
and yet added he with a coldly menacing expression he annoys me   67.8870943841836
cried d artagnan my letter of recommendation   69.87330875069496
the old man s declaration that valentine was not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the hopes of madame de villefort   58.96000899734348
still then i am a prisoner said milady looking around her and bringing back her eyes with a most gracious smile to the young officer   129.54365847240942
0209m since my imprisonment said faria i have thought over all the most celebrated cases of escape on record   43.8211333366274
for though i don t think his aid worth much one must with one s friends observe all due politeness said d artagnan   129.26909573631096
bertuccio kept his own in his pocket and merely jingled a few pieces of money   75.62711479709299
alas i would say you are welcome had not death opened the way for you into this house   118.99674777780615
peppino followed danglars   71.5572689775752
no of you   124.0532804837141
you are right mr   34.81164815273702
cried planchet so you are back again in paris   139.05920230670537
how can you tell me that   73.0525396067637
the next morning as soon as he awoke danglars asked for the newspapers   155.99718871136633
do you desire it as ardently as you say   129.56788014465852
yes certainly i know that name   82.68746666392839
the rendezvous the place du palais cardinal   112.5848366061615
well said gondy have you kept your word with me   67.42812383424439
you must trust to me   43.40032634231943
and he put his horse into a trot   107.95700453075207
there was to be sure father joseph but his name was never pronounced but with a subdued voice such was the terror inspired by his gray eminence as the cardinal s familiar was called   110.28162344459905
the misfortune is great   144.43770246770617
it is a most suitable alliance you are contracting and mademoiselle danglars is a handsome girl   158.38796539755234
what a disgrace to us   89.38371983114861
now at the risk of your own life you must manage to stop those horses before my door   73.30100032768004
where did i first hear it   160.5446914928084
franz d épinay started with surprise   78.34358322445246
made richelieu smile   144.1706876898668
shall i give you counsel good counsel the counsel of a friend   143.11036408640953
absurd   146.57313154796384
alas continued the stranger doubtless to dispel the slight cloud that covered morcerf s brow we do not act thus in italy   135.49483653804594
simply the fact that the idea never occurred to me answered dantès   42.03739175908534
yes said château renaud these italians are well named and badly dressed   114.6858505727508
i shall go to the louvre and strangle mazarin   147.86809939241064
you re welcome sirs   73.53319510705552
have you so soon changed your mind added morcerf or have you only provoked my request that you may have the pleasure of seeing me humbled   82.98315471346802
more more   76.62390177826902
but you have claimed the aid of a gentleman not the watchfulness of a spy   190.17138670277438
de busigny was the first to come and shake athos by the hand and acknowledge that the wager was lost   147.17028210025813
he might have purchased his life by speaking   151.16181519869792
your excellency is the travelling companion of the viscount   87.52599867481847
it is a poor lame post horse   82.64036452164764
and he drank off half a bottle at a draught and bit great mouthfuls of the bread and meat   201.47829935333675
and so in fact he is said the owner   85.99953113370628
the old man did not answer but looked at his master with wild staring eyes while with his cramped hand he grasped a piece of furniture to enable him to stand upright   185.63493230171827
you think the result of this blow has been to produce an ordinary grief and you would cure it by an ordinary remedy change of scene   71.08320882593011
forty said andrea after a moment s hesitation at the end of which he remembered that he might safely promise   182.7686272821777
madame de villefort gazed upon the face so expressive even in its stillness   58.265709044144195
they would serve for the hanging of those detestable judges who purchased favor at court at the price of the people s misery   64.37143972175565
i must absolutely see it   89.56023912534914
though i should like to have seen porthos on my yellow horse   141.6107521677408
that is exactly my loss   149.20340307167822
milady s secret d artagnan left the hôtel instead of going up at once to kitty s chamber as she endeavored to persuade him to do and that for two reasons the first because by this means he should escape reproaches recriminations and prayers   190.20034874839695
one doesn t hit the bull s eye every time   187.79189824256935
a piece of advice which was received with a contemptuous smile   173.15252583786793
she had tried to assassinate her brother in law   44.0440174530148
yes sdeath   37.56295605118231
that is when i have lighted the match   144.65933488260544
the recent events the solitary and eccentric position of the count his enormous nay almost incredible fortune should have made men cautious and have altogether prevented ladies visiting a house where there was no one of their own sex to receive them   129.7924709620514
i crossed the street and stopped at a post placed at the angle of the wall and by means of which i had once before looked into the garden   63.60019994883675
a horse eats out of a manger in which a glandered horse has eaten   125.60003872460247
or if they do follow it it is for the sake of having someone to blame for having given it   66.51986338540254
so he cherishes no resentment   102.03355353733569
face to face with lord de winter her plan of conduct was more easy   101.49966756090532
in leaving the palais royal he remembered to have observed a similar shadow   69.23964960795298
better still since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing you   120.12042186888551
we shall have occasion i warn you at some future period to speak of that   171.89979504186437
a fine pleasure indeed monsieur   97.04069281317716
immediately eight swords glittered in the rays of the setting sun and the combat began with an animosity very natural between men twice enemies   107.84852815980354
come dear ones said morrel rising from his seat let us go and see and heaven have pity upon us if it be false intelligence   142.20859493771667
i am willing to help rebuild your fortune but i will not be an accomplice in the ruin of others   132.6904263702621
this evening monsieur i am detained in paris by indispensable business   55.74681184561498
just god   118.5024136511836
he sighed and whispered a name and the head bathed in tears and pressed on the velvet cushion of the chair a head like that of a magdalen by correggio was raised and turned towards him   162.44483692108597
is there a secret spring   136.38582063700915
aramis was astonished   145.61744186061014
perhaps i can render you this slight service also   115.20456254666726
the first will be mazzolato the second decapitato   128.4607204753174
you are very fortunate to have lost believe me my dear d artagnan   130.38288455476848
the king has nothing like it   108.22668669888624
inquired mordaunt   45.162825208342525
enough replied the questioner   182.7413256381658
i can see it all before me this moment   150.74891539073852
i was drawn on by a very natural resentment to avenge my mother   139.6403254317928
is it a friend a brother a simple acquaintance or an enemy   160.52648797949203
my arguments lead to nothing   152.16162260356631
he continued so i was going away but he called me back   126.27563995977133
yes said porthos i see him   96.5873746918319
repeated the monk bending over him as if to tear from him the name if he would not utter it   163.73356382484127
that is a settled thing a resolution registered   110.21909635749093
really my dear m   35.445678975922505
asked cavalcanti   138.6699327917591
major bartolomeo cavalcanti eight   83.79656187772039
he will be furious   129.154666392255
i tell you one of them was saying that if coysel predicted that tis as good as true   164.69185456198096
2d february   98.39538132623119
asked the doctor   96.66771020444826
give continued the cardinal your commands to the most respectful of your servants   44.50410236425988
d artagnan in particular had a perpetual buzzing in his ears which porthos explained thus a very great lady has told me that this means that somebody is talking of you somewhere   106.50196683501217
as for me said porthos now that you have reminded me of it athos i have the scene again before me as if i now were there   114.5560215554298
all sir   120.55764679360271
thence he saw the king the queen and monsieur mazarin and heard the mass as well as if he had been on duty   93.23682127379058
i wanted to see the good curé again   170.8446281748257
morcerf who ran towards him with open arms was chilled as he drew near in spite of the friendly smile and simply held out his hand   106.34522781771433
look at my eyes and you will see what no looking glass has ever shown you a frank and honorable countenance   140.19024165815784
asked the king looking at the cardinal who colored with vexation   114.91984452594058
you don t often speak athos but when you do speak it is like st   59.55420640813861
the count put his head out of the window and whistled and the horses appeared to fly   87.1987431528519
you want to know how we came here   206.75429300381376
she knew that at her return from a fruitless journey it would be in vain to tell him of her imprisonment in vain to enlarge upon the sufferings she had undergone   153.71982648382493
the two men remained opposite one another morrel trembling in every limb the stranger gazing at him with an air of profound pity   71.46484026990805
because i imagine you have correspondents in that country   125.57525954486145
perform your duty in camp   43.984203198682025
chapter 13   82.74415790418584
yes sir and i think i have the honor of addressing count andrea cavalcanti   79.00981743870935
the count turned up his sleeves and passed into the little vestibule where the gentlemen were accustomed to wash their hands after shooting   143.68539711020807
i am a man of order sir   177.824403927846
although d artagnan was not of a very sentimental character the mercer s pretty wife had made a real impression upon his heart   124.4219966004516
yes my lord said athos i wish to speak to the king   169.55653314766906
well you will have distractions enough gentlemen be assured said d artagnan   99.93870878860051
aramis said that as these sorts of affairs were mysterious it was better not to fathom them   136.36675263530856
but it was never egotistical for the unfortunate man never alluded to his own sorrows   63.81000959094891
you are going to know me   71.91391750523893
do not speak so loud young man don t speak so loud   97.72972613214081
pray be assured of that   140.72381115762752
spada turned pale as cæsar looked at him with an ironical air which proved that he had anticipated all and that the snare was well spread   91.94998948095271
had i ten yaninas in my family i should only consider myself the more bound to fight ten times   38.31233530446494
he consequently despatched his breakfast and his boat being ready he hastened on board and they were soon under way   46.57319008754092
i owe you some explanations for my conduct and as you are a woman that can perfectly understand me i will give them   74.9779128848915
but lord wilmore did not omit to inform me my dear m   142.95320468364076
the writing of madame de chevreuse   118.03991174093204
cried grimaud unconsciously   131.2622326998933
what could i say   100.84932982193544
the three composing our forlorn hope were deliberating whether they should proceed any further when all at once a circle of smoke enveloped the giant of stone and a dozen balls came whistling around d artagnan and his companions   87.90790754214089
grimaud had tried to waken the stable boys and the stable boys had beaten him   115.6119609276687
what procureur has ever ventured to draw up an accusation against m   75.61590256571098
to the house of one of my friends a sculptor only we enter by the trap through which he lets down his marble   138.21651170983105
you love me you   98.87087599750333
he wills that human vengeance should precede celestial justice   190.28369529025434
then he must be a wonder   74.3793210297174
but raoul   192.25758787450343
monsieur cavalcanti said andrea do you believe in fairy tales   168.91846427526332
let us pass on to private and personal stipulations   173.53223991908663
well provided you replace your pistols in your belt   107.10497233228001
murmured he   102.61998427827838
thinking that porthos will be at last a baron and d artagnan a captain   168.9358281787351
louvieres recognized him and bowed   103.9203752664214
and he jingled his money   114.55908237457287
ask porthos   11.788288539247816
although sinbad pronounced these words with much calmness his eyes gave forth gleams of extraordinary ferocity   137.18812495843798
well do you know why they die so multitudinously at m   71.56608808714536
said athos to the commissary if you have no more need of me send me somewhere   9.30535670219146
i wish to see everything   118.59105158921709
the executioner is still in the cellar where i presume he has had an interview with mine host s bottles   64.81565534877548
the tongue the first day the hand the second and the head the third   124.77534487660218
but said villefort and then suddenly checking himself he was silent   73.59488452832281
screamed nanette   106.6767133781163
no in presence of the scaffold as i am royalty i assure you is a very small affair   173.38680029219012
meanwhile madame if you really suffer said felton a physician shall be sent for   123.8374022939377
has he sent no particular message for me   112.48558110120196
and in the day of my prosperity he who brings me this order and this cross shall be blessed by me and my children   97.192645792478
madame replied d artagnan i threaten simply and solely because i am obliged to do so   135.57564420670872
and kindly add continued he that i am not a simple messenger but an envoy extraordinary   179.74377182681815
i hastened to you continued beauchamp to tell you albert that in this changing age the faults of a father can not revert upon his children   7.033634295924912
you aramis   78.34093932162956
why it is not altogether impossible he might have had for he made me promise several times never to speak of that letter to anyone assuring me he so advised me for my own interest   144.0173765587137
he is awake so keep on the watch as they are gone away   71.06969358953461
stay marechal   109.6419489223978
they will return said d artagnan   36.62898965446858
have i not my talent left   105.27959140367503
what can i do friend   84.04962565927069
this is my counsel our accounts are made up and our bills paid   125.47407847864939
i address you because you know that although i esteem him from my heart i am a little awed by the comte de la fere   118.7473449853251
let go and clue up   62.7778306109414
my affianced husband returned   158.56937080799307
nevertheless d artagnan was desirous of examining the appearance of this impertinent personage who ridiculed him   129.74362123741474
to join the vicomte de bragelonne in flanders your honor   79.56142881058132
edmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend then taking up the knife he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed jaws carefully administered the appointed number of drops and anxiously awaited the result   33.415414672602424
after which he inquired if lieutenant comminges were not the commanding officer at the outpost   198.00251587871134
meanwhile an unexpected scene was passing in the room which had been so carefully locked   139.82522524660743
no upon my honor   69.19572291407104
keep the purse for your lackeys   78.5311960514891
but now be assured his alarm will be the only serious consequence   122.49338017346759
i will give in my resignation as captain of the king s musketeers to take a lieutenancy in the cardinal s guards and if he refuses me morbleu   74.80990887040738
you are a brave fellow   77.78723606777933
you think so do you   149.24262414906735
don t let us disarrange your eminence   158.599462671565
has he anything remarkable about him by which one may recognize him   156.60517996999673
which route must i take   111.7788943260334
teresa gave him one only instead of teresa it was beppo who was on the steps of the church of san giacomo   164.99712355837187
therefore scarcely had the stranger time to pronounce his name before the count was apprised of his arrival   88.25033637897876
consider well what you do in that house   32.216142405616196
this fox of a fellow will be sending us a hundred iron sided beasts who will pick us off like sparrows in this place   150.3213402827912
morrel had better go do you not think so grandpapa   117.43616528924025
let them know on the contrary that their punishment which had been decreed by providence is only delayed by my present determination and although they escape it in this world it awaits them in another and that they are only exchanging time for eternity   144.42502628911026
the brilliant sums the rolling millions which were to be at the command of the two young people and which crowned the display of the wedding presents and the young lady s diamonds which had been made in a room entirely appropriated for that purpose had exercised to the full their delusions over the envious assembly   97.55286555704073
do as you did before only do not wait so long all the springs of life are now exhausted in me and death he continued looking at his paralyzed arm and leg has but half its work to do   170.20079589663644
besides germain was in the interests of the queen   117.48826584329048
the duchess held him back   137.37236051706878
let us fly   102.32956912260796
a black satin stock fresh from the maker s hands gray moustaches a bold eye a major s uniform ornamented with three medals and five crosses in fact the thorough bearing of an old soldier such was the appearance of major bartolomeo cavalcanti that tender father with whom we are already acquainted   93.07966956870976
when she chose   105.25445590355592
aramis pushed his back into his saddle bags and sheathed his sword   121.91657336701513
but i am not the less a giddy fool   106.95718906180808
my lord said athos we admire your devotion to the cause you have espoused in remaining at the head of the army whilst so ill in so much pain   74.3278886321583
i will ask his servant   171.40337925042795
tell me at least the means   126.71205504566885
thought gondy   81.25043469131555
they put the stone back in its place   125.9474531971527
chapter 2   144.80277061892716
d artagnan drew back the bolt with precaution and both light as shadows glided through the interior door into the passage ascended the stairs as quietly as possible and entered d artagnan s chambers   219.40798358433867
milady looked at him for some time with an expression which the young man took for doubt but which however was nothing but observation or rather the wish to fascinate   169.49823913923908
and he gazed half stupefied upon the three persons before him   91.6891894580898
it was the first rendezvous that had been granted him   95.10879669583181
upon a sideboard appeared the colossal pie with the duke s arms on it and seemingly cooked to a turn as far as one could judge by the golden color which illuminated the crust   78.1576064930086
but why do i not   143.14363523548758
do not cast yourself against such a rock   104.33606598494167
but so little it can hardly be called eating   34.086022176378094
milady reseated herself foaming   59.035753583592395
he entered after having twisted his mustache and elongated his imperial which always announced on his part the most triumphant resolutions   9.373305911094207
and so although the movement of the arm the sound of the voice and the agility of the body were wanting the speaking eye sufficed for all   135.03571588484863
this is the matter gentlemen   137.07360544307366
this mournful appeal pierced the darkness   136.56813554865172
monte cristo turned away   87.17508772850738
villefort dropped his head and sighed   75.41571017465654
you can tell him sir answered a voice which was the voice of high command in the battle field that he sent against me the only two men capable of getting the better of four men   173.07163972548875
oh you hear that flamarens   136.67303303843522
take some more wine my dear cavalcanti said the count pouring out for him a second glass of alicante   180.76267194344325
well then so be it   148.3702531573686
besides one requires the excitement of being hateful in the eyes of the accused in order to lash one s self into a state of sufficient vehemence and power   151.57166691417575
he asked in a trembling voice remembering the visits he had been paying to his treasury   111.1741258499063
we will stop at la réserve and we can drink a glass of la malgue whilst we wait for news   90.45293872523536
deuce take it friend if he s one of thy friends thou wilt ruin him in saying so   27.653141431900508
d artagnan was the youngest of all these men   50.862941978937066
bonacieux expected him   139.47608515874288
the man was m   149.47163037738613
it is true they are almost always spent beforehand but no matter we shall still have fifty thousand francs to spend for this purpose   171.84937224732147
but my lord tell me she continued hide nothing from me what is in truth the king s position   183.43788513292657
oh it s nothing nothing   66.37298457468354
and that is that it is not those gentlemen who are in the greatest danger it is ourselves   119.20387715467398
shall you have time   73.74904088141852
money never comes amiss at any time my lord   100.17410355580502
at the end of the second day m   106.83179698591353
they ordered the lackeys not to unsaddle the horses and to hold themselves in readiness to set off again immediately   184.41530011929729
what would you not have accomplished if you had been free   130.67724809540528
that man then was not that man said milady lowering her voice is my brother   137.54054032461724
they halted for the king to dine   59.98681764921242
i only make a remark   42.78257767276135
after cromwell charles ii   150.22631824515264
some ham my boy or we can t drink   108.78570821329932
of myself cried morcerf   1.2558267466588546
the sergeant and his men took possession of the little garden   83.40766809893736
it is getting cold   102.21525037425226
that is very well before one is over forty   139.1556801501328
without passports said planchet   121.81668143362319
the demands in that programme must be granted   104.81826175054277
here is what you are looking for he said   154.70179099287915
you no doubt observed the horses standing a few minutes since at the door   77.25784501894657
well you do not answer cardinal what do you think about it   164.80216225321615
never mind it for i see you once more said the old man   127.1035041372068
i must hurry you so that as she has no mother she may at least have a grandmother to bless her marriage   166.86164883414384
really sir you are delightful and i should like to spend a month at bragelonne   134.94624104799195
and whose are they   120.83240594093607
this note was in a different hand from the rest which showed that it had been added since his confinement   90.34330779636733
40150m you understand me   105.70577651995188
he was going to throw the crawfish out also when grimaud snatched it from his hands   107.46497712895788
when he was alone he opened the door of the corridor and then that of the ante chamber   86.77419029035497
i grasped it in my hand put out the flame as quickly as i could lighted my taper in the fire itself and opened the crumpled paper with inexpressible emotion recognizing when i had done so that these characters had been traced in mysterious and sympathetic ink only appearing when exposed to the fire   69.31565589658913
and then he was older than any of us added d artagnan   55.881826747025386
why simply from the circumstance of my having bought her one day as i was passing through the market at constantinople   94.45593374542926
returning to her own room kitty had thrown the purse into a corner where it lay open disgorging three or four gold pieces on the carpet   127.61265716150155
de villefort pressed his hand upon his brow which at first pale had become red and burning   89.70743368060857
how much in that little bag   99.9243624129251
prince cavalcanti said danglars who persisted in giving the young man that title   169.6430003871556
let us return to my ring or rather to yours   61.8857009806528
come come continued the count i see you are still the same an assassin   102.03142458981046
i have not handled a card or dice box   121.3893072746072
sire said villefort your majesty mistakes   135.81542383440984
the duchess permits you to kiss her hand   120.00565115462685
that is to say excellency replied pastrini who was desirous of keeping up the dignity of the capital of the christian world in the eyes of his guest that there are no carriages to be had from sunday to tuesday evening but from now till sunday you can have fifty if you please   78.03020342968833
he was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber but grated and barred and its appearance therefore did not greatly alarm him   141.5144884036224
i go to the louvre   173.52214151814007
no i shall go incognito count under the name of marie michon   78.60381322790437
it is impossible it can be she said he   154.4685048530286
but she saw no one   108.7572874789313
who was then only prince of wales   115.85066458815699
how do i know   48.750336281130494
without listening the least in the world to the lamentations of m   109.66418486149651
you are always the same athos great and generous   58.61973879885033
adieu master   103.11385664448011
they are ignorant of the consequences of the murder   210.58800808103973
he fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat and he redoubled his exertions increasing rapidly his distance from the château but exhausting his strength   156.26439932791098
you stop at the spot where he received the blow   104.57297107573902
louvieres became very pale and waited impatiently for the officer to explain himself   106.96992854628371
well said madame danglars come and undress me   79.32047806466122
you must mount your horse and proceed to the rue tiquetonne hotel de la chevrette whence you will take my horse and that of monsieur du vallon which you must saddle and equip as if for war and then you will leave paris bringing them with you to cours la reine   144.40860579723085
planchet the most intelligent of the four was to follow that by which the carriage had gone upon which the four friends had fired and which was accompanied as may be remembered by rochefort s servant   88.4976196117374
he finds the cooking detestable replied porthos   99.18890517801205
the servants who fled from the house informed me   124.64778425395062
is it still only an intention your eminence   21.902141870644925
wealth does not necessarily produce happiness   94.54358630257337
you are fernand mondego the french officer who led the troops of my noble father   73.75222749528368
be it so said beauchamp   54.81235235695716
particularly when they have still a full bottle before them added danglars   189.0418631876286
but without doubt that eternal enemy of our souls that lion roaring constantly around us breathed it into my mind   119.44750846470718
no i will never pronounce that sentence which would not be orthodox   113.91004661104868
i am not a banker like m   127.40609254598894
our mission is ended and there is nothing more to detain us now but the good pleasure of the great man to whom we were sent   127.80476192076102
did you hear eternal sleeper   80.07466897571581
but one recovers sir as you perceive replied raoul and we have but had a little bath   84.27730423388363
de tréville s office   129.25073502356636
i recommend you therefore to keep the strictest watch   119.22810798016779
the horse neighed with pleasure at seeing him   77.02940829471166
it signifies to my father the count of morcerf whose christian name is fernand   73.34377331667568
locusta valentine was alone   98.13383179082683
and he mounted his horse   115.98784245858832
their names   142.14165651783884
the streets are full of armed men continued d artagnan   134.0680741036838
with your permission said danglars bowing i will precede you to show you the way   165.95833187278078
albert started on hearing these words   146.51128428505135
madame de lannoy who is devoted to your eminence as you know   103.79209469973136
but no all was hermetically sealed   113.2803239882775
she took successively all the other papers out till the drawer was empty   42.96076519606075
do not detain those gentlemen here count she said   53.93899190099826
you know monsieur d artagnan   117.80554175589228
gentlemen said he leave me alone with patrick and laporte ah is that you de winter   138.00271975027252
my place of abode is no   58.68264519069673
this succor which came to porthos at the moment in which he was attacked in his gastronomic hopes inspired much gratitude in the musketeer toward the procurator s wife   187.8711061844238
but how is it that madame de villefort is not here   166.81266332297253
for from time to time one of those sweet smiles which were habitual to him in moments of good humor illumined the face of d artagnan   126.07393987132261
i met him on the boulevard on my way here said beauchamp   52.93759468085191
sir said anne to mazarin with an accent from which daily habits of dissimulation could not entirely chase the real expression see if we can do something for these gentlemen   184.91906994332322
to morrow evening if you like   182.90416277873683
i see that you understand french   170.12513087006283
you lie said the abbé busoni with a tone of irresistible authority   59.0573610870096
sermons   212.96388061151498
the good george   104.8349347543726
villefort mechanically felt for the handle of the door   155.6114939745164
then turning toward porthos the devil   72.40827492019594
you must have discovered a mine or else become a stockbroker   121.81102634064986
namely to find a man who will not fight   100.24915116728427
what is the meaning of that noise   77.43662142202186
that is not enough madame it is necessary that your friends should be also mine   6.6662135033311785
comminges left the head of the escort and went to the queen s carriage   75.33804829298003
who formed the plan by which we left the establishment of m   147.64667283095196
a woman lay on the ground her head resting on the knees of a man who was seated by her   169.3646441272259
rely on me to procure you the other   107.60233208072614
the next day came and passed the day after a week   167.34964713913587
it was granted and was to take place after her morning s levee at which in accordance with his rights of birth he was entitled to be present   101.00424958730642
and in all probability i should be promoted to the honor of making sport for the children if such innocent beings could be found in an abode devoted like this to suffering and despair   169.1478834149005
if you love me grandpapa try and bring that love to bear upon your actions at this present moment   85.53183649351024
instead of going direct to his study m   131.706069222652
i was in utter darkness   80.06290073578415
when mordaunt arrived opposite the house he saw d artagnan on the threshold and the soldiers lying on the grass here and there with their arms   141.66488298619828
a moment later madame de villefort entered the drawing room with her little edward   202.08594285709344
he is a philanthropist answered the other   162.3039596568601
near blois   50.57207975306277
andrea turned towards them and with an impertinent smile asked have you any message for your father mademoiselle danglars for in all probability i shall return to paris   145.49588480958528
oh yes said de winter for they are the same men   17.49597345533067
you see it is your interest to take my bank notes   112.64002735155454
athos had a noble heart and made therefore but a poor courtier   99.72595787736007
a thousand thanks and now for the letter   121.57921827209847
protected as he is by his high position and firmly established reputation for talent and unswerving integrity no one could oppose him   59.10804046679316
de morcerf s murmured mercédès   56.719962623937704
dead on the scaffold   127.99792156664414
do you recollect in the arbor of the hôtel des postes at perugia seeing a man in a brown cloak whom your stepmother was questioning upon aqua tofana   113.67326964711995
yes yes the mortuary deposition   83.15452465758108
my wife is at durham and may return at any moment   93.26020551155347
extremely well   210.53488046802482
and was the sum a large one   133.01483479982048
my dear fellow be a musketeer or an abbé   121.84435430167902
i don t understand said porthos   82.95820750111147
the event was announced by the cessation of the firing   147.53853072956048
you pledge me for three millions do you not   197.16104024193783
said he holding out his hand to the young man   184.8096665995576
how can he be the son of a great lord   117.31662409756318
there he comes said beauchamp on horseback at full gallop followed by a servant   130.43976828509045
that has cured me of beautiful poetical and loving women said athos after a considerable pause raising his head and forgetting to continue the fiction of the count   142.2731841721962
i had ennui and i amused myself with twisting that rope   9.219837212382856
do you not know their history   142.16911412328454
but you d artagnan what is the matter with you and what has happened to you personally   147.20563452738105
is it about sending me to the bastile   175.2045542269206
yes during the spanish war at perpignan where fernand had left her   133.64114503674222
in france sire at a small port near antibes in the gulf of juan   94.00679332229895
how can you reconcile that with his conduct this morning   111.34989098392565
don t let us drink wine which comes from an unknown source   129.69983282651535
it is strange said aramis   108.56302205229193
but be easy   49.606510266707986
at this moment they heard above all the galloping and neighing of the horses winter s voice crying out sword in hand   170.38885659155255
and athos went out of the parpaillot followed by d artagnan   68.00424451381951
however i scold you instead of him and in his place   153.14000043315653
which makes him your accomplice to all intents and purposes   66.8980625065231
nevertheless when he waited at the dinner given by his master and saw him take out a handful of gold to pay for it he believed his fortune made and returned thanks to heaven for having thrown him into the service of such a crœsus   90.19330717541901
porthos and aramis did the same   30.439220654948002
and wherefore has he not been to see me   183.02056834395472
and you seek admittance into our ranks   215.04516220743284
in about ten minutes d artagnan appeared at the door followed by the inseparable porthos   141.74173289235077
here said he are dogs who bark and bite at the same time they are for the two first who shall have a longing for your diamond friend caderousse   68.11674578416324
it must have been for his hide for certes the carcass is not worth eighteen livres   109.00474082179022
well grimaud my friend have you seen anything   112.23797114013469
or as you know your way go first   57.925797158131104
edmond saw there was no escape and placing the old man on his bed he seated himself on the stool beside him   135.84210466286038
come fanny we will put her to bed   138.52926516703178
upon which franz and albert mounted to their apartments and proceeded to disencumber themselves of their costumes   133.46476182574213
come you understand me   110.51504592289214
he had not been more than ten minutes in the drawing room before he drew danglars aside into the recess of a bow window and after an ingenious preamble related to him all his anxieties and cares since his noble father s departure   118.6005210750467
it was six o clock in the morning the dawn was just breaking and its feeble ray came into the dungeon and paled the ineffectual light of the lamp   223.54532213169335
bad monsieur bad   201.31996888055974
i must do something to distract my thoughts   114.80942826375853
withdraw sir said buckingham or i will call my attendant and have you placed in irons   115.23022463496929
i imagined it must be said morrel   187.76351904266713
de tréville was highly astonished to see his protégé make a sudden spring become crimson with passion and rush from the cabinet crying s blood he shall not escape me this time   197.64333813439052
that fellow is no fool said aramis as he got on his horse   138.86731458952693
the child stretched out his little hand toward that of his father and said i swear to your majesty   143.7554644609769
a second discharge followed the first   154.00807640582218
to prepare her system to resist poison   134.90212632328888
immediately one of the men who were waiting slipped down into the moat tied under grimaud s shoulders the end of a cord and the remaining two who held the other end drew grimaud to them   78.08501634948058
said valentine uneasily   143.351911892967
of old armchairs in which perhaps had sat henry iv   118.10393412676727
he instantly retired from a feeling of respectful delicacy   108.20100525593277
now i may hope that god will forgive me since my crime is expiated   64.81827867460993
those who have once beheld such a spectacle know that there is nothing more solemn more striking than the raging sea rolling with its deafening roar its dark billows beneath the pale light of a wintry moon   49.82512967957595
i know him for a norman and normans are obstinate   217.82790869599802
whoever did it writes well   36.59857044128857
here is the priest s certificate   73.9167608420126
there was a moment s silence during which one could have fancied the hall empty so profound was the stillness   99.85608736551936
he is at work in his library but he expects you sir replied the valet   116.200028289932
and yet she added suppose he should refuse and that the king loses the battle   128.91449560604505
yes monseigneur said porthos it is he   176.09222064795637
on the staircase he met signor pastrini   117.46088822680368
the pompous procession therefore wended its way towards père lachaise from the faubourg saint honoré   65.8353170713726
then he continued your pardon sire he said bowing my zeal carried me away   155.54852515225897
athos took the letter frowning but an idea that he should find something in this letter about d artagnan conquered his unwillingness to read it   62.21783977404025
said the woman   79.02201717124215
do you know observed franz that with such stories you make me think of ali baba s enchanted cavern   115.3542339581258
de villefort resumed the king addressing the young man who motionless and breathless was listening to a conversation on which depended the destiny of a kingdom   137.50590062542327
have you not enjoyed the pleasures of the chase today   87.82790791814702
oh i can t let you go so   114.59094769729221
there is a similarity of feeling at this instant between ourselves and the countess nothing more   56.31163763386202
and he turned to the door just as the valet de chambre announced m   11.80461895813471
take some more of these cigars m   132.84108767685757
his dishonor reflects upon us   56.50944111605968
you are very lucky if you see anything such a night as this said porthos   126.13163146916038
i look around the boat expecting every moment to see that poor wretch holding between his hands the poniard plunged into his heart   120.12745882104755
all sorts of misfortunes   227.09149273134463
no not to you so i am going to tell you where he is   62.70791412041542
and beppo led him outside the walls   267.95629794426856
i am free replied maximilian and rich enough to support you   153.38836393027768
give me my felt hat bernouin   124.83373129227535
people do not go out from it by the door but by the window   58.625729221733195
on my honor they are not poisoned   126.56282299370918
it was three o clock in the afternoon   5.089414879685208
and i replied very well you shall have it   138.86632387397066
said one of the two cavaliers to a servant who was lying in the outer compartment which served as a kind of ante room   108.02735025050397
our duty is fulfilled   150.9606135379995
the dim light the profound silence and the gloomy thoughts inspired by the hour and still more by her own conscience all combined to produce a sensation of fear   140.0768962863384
the mendicant had gone to his old place on the steps of saint eustache and was again distributing holy water with one hand and asking alms with the other   149.40650380559188
are you come to fetch me   104.67361839082926
i wished to cry out but an icy shiver ran through my veins and stifled my voice   165.24711212794145
de villefort kept the promise he had made to madame danglars to endeavor to find out how the count of monte cristo had discovered the history of the house at auteuil   117.16539870002998
i tell you i am madame bonacieux   74.97641957465612
and did you promise the queen resumed d artagnan petulantly to storm the tower of london to kill a hundred thousand soldiers to fight victoriously against the wishes of the nation and the ambition of a man and when that man is cromwell   86.5156855799934
tell the king that if he sleeps badly to night he will sleep better to morrow night   71.10398159837261
and does he suspect said mme   77.47243779946334
because the person who bears it is too highly favored by heaven to be the father of such a wretch as you   7.279163184799913
for i imagine just now that noll cromwell would not be inclined to trifle with us   128.09074518761713
monsieur de beaufort took the pieces out of his mouth and presented them with great formality to monsieur de chavigny saying that for that evening the entertainment was ended but in three months it should be repeated when pistache would have learned a few new tricks   113.69832867391936
but he perceived that the man at the desk wrote or rather corrected lines of unequal length scanning the words on his fingers   120.37766406910028
the countess shuddered   162.4619611008648
in a word mademoiselle danglars would make a charming mistress but a wife diable   112.17595055682229
that will be a difficult matter to arrange besides i shall just be in the way of all the preparations for departure   142.08307756371977
a few words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two officers of the law   64.33350426696902
as for franz he was enchanted at the way in which albert had sustained the national honor in the presence of the bandit   107.92738060670567
could never rid himself this horse was born in the house of your father about thirteen years ago and has remained in it ever since which ought to make you love it   98.1533415770101
this creek was sufficiently wide at its mouth and deep in the centre to admit of the entrance of a small vessel of the lugger class which would be perfectly concealed from observation   117.8251276208828
is it against you or against myself   141.76501834920933
felton took advantage of this moment and plunged the knife into his side up to the handle   59.54826353651851
the steward gave him a gun   82.0665464713998
with an expression of indescribable anguish he threw himself upon the body of the child reopened its eyes felt its pulse and then rushed with him into valentine s room of which he double locked the door   92.08640962088731
the former found guilty of the murder of a venerable and exemplary priest named don césar torlini canon of the church of st   91.25862113211751
she must repent and educate my son the sole survivor with the exception of the indestructible old man of the wreck of my house   98.34445372241532
on the contrary when one aims a blow that is the regulation way to strike   50.03790552563433
you may think my departure strange and foolish said the young man   121.59215167430328
why do you sing thus and with such a voice   112.18580946692862
at every step you encountered dead bodies and bands of murderers who killed plundered and burned   108.12236591576834
well it will be given to someone who has done nothing to deserve it said beauchamp   65.16433105158407
that s a match you are playing with his eminence   111.6998273900179
i have just sent away the sentinel that i might remain here without anybody knowing it in order to speak to you without being overheard   163.30036757175978
cried monte cristo it was m   74.89894801969936
and who is it   150.90039288673267
edmond felt that the moment had arrived summoned up all his courage held his breath and would have been happy if at the same time he could have repressed the throbbing of his veins   76.03801175234916
you know the same thing was done for saint stephen of florence saint george constantinian of parma and even for the order of malta   123.4869423317128
they left their two nags upon the high road and ran toward the quay   66.59242876119708
of the important cities given up by henry iv   193.5770724404257
yes but listen this was not all   133.90742991974318
i thought so madame stammered the young girl   189.5168896663098
at these words she opened the door of the corridor and pushed d artagnan out of the room   94.61965448175245
i heard her with my own ears   189.22114238640597
he was not bound nor had they made any attempt to handcuff him   76.8028644818724
they made him get out walk along the banks of the river and then brought him to teresa and luigi who were waiting for him in the catacombs of st   90.49903409369176
d avrigny and villefort laid him on a couch   14.771946056171771
chatillon made a sign with his hand and aramis was about to dismount when he received a violent shock   140.5540612869196
mousqueton made with a low whistling sound the sign of alarm well known to the lackeys in the days of their youth resumed his place at the table and made a sign to blaisois to follow his example   146.32321912749484
and at the sound of my voice the slaves redoubled their cries and prayers and lamentations   63.77362253097536
is being in love conspiring   100.58418692541369
that is what it is to be rich   109.58942979786565
nay do not press my hand edmond   9.821855402020688
they galloped on for two or three hours as furiously as the cavaliers on the wall   116.24577680683268
although distant as they were from the queen they could not count the studs   184.32108009365658
but my lieutenant said a soldier less stoical than his chief and who had approached milady this woman is not asleep   96.32236669826592
it is my duty to watch over your life madame and i will watch   125.90569606384908
we must explain this visit which although expected by monte cristo is unexpected to our readers   129.08626858315708
as soon as you see him get up stretch out your arm and seize him by the neck   28.328871059097892
then the cardinal put out the waxlight slipped it into his pocket and taking up the lantern now he said for monsieur de la fere   89.55765253332687
it was nearly three days since i had eaten or drunk anything   3.2355525169801496
at midnight they arrived at the gate of a beautiful park   140.46335011756904
really said the major i am quite ashamed of the trouble i am giving you   68.13714941751428
they have sold me they shall give me up and the eternal shame of treble treason shall fall on their heads   27.699596066503645
do not run down m   150.83314011016182
unless the horses have wings to mount the ramparts and come and fetch you   185.69121637915623
i yet feel his warm tears on my face and his were not the only tears shed for many who witnessed our meeting wept also   96.70642338726265
the king and the cardinal are the best of friends   99.7234340249116
the abbé rose from his chair made two turns round the chamber and pressed his trembling hand against his parched throat   107.1255455147606
and she sprang toward gondy whom assuredly at that moment she hated more than broussel with outstretched arms   137.8597557594789
the city carpenters had erected scaffolds upon which the invited ladies were to be placed   36.0014384105874
so much the worse for you my dear host so much the worse   15.961327617690202
where you left me under the scaffold   132.02617372694067
one day when contrary to his custom he had admitted mercédès and the poor girl in spite of her own grief and despair endeavored to console him he said to her be assured my dear daughter he is dead   46.546877718401106
i will embrace your knees   112.56914005960535
no one must disturb us he said   92.79545396083758
asked the young man after a moment s pause   129.99002237461715
you played very willingly with us without knowing our names said athos by the same token that you won our horses   33.01069690112985
the queen smiling made a sign with her head   127.33438923435561
continued she   135.19821331269665
a great misfortune m   62.751903370362854
asked d artagnan jumping on one of them   104.0028139036869
at this spot so pregnant with fond and filial remembrances his heart beat almost to bursting his knees tottered under him a mist floated over his sight and had he not clung for support to one of the trees he would inevitably have fallen to the ground and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing there   94.56422880676413
and if i have sworn to revenge myself it is not on the french captain or the count of morcerf but on the fisherman fernand the husband of mercédès the catalane   113.45059860900813
the next moment the very planks of the scaffold creaked with the weight of an advancing procession and the eager faces of the spectators confirmed what a last hope at the bottom of his heart had prevented him till then believing   164.48621246621764
tell him all about it baron   80.74478988158178
only d artagnan if you have not lost it give me the paper which fell from that man s hat upon which is written the name of the village of ah said d artagnan i comprehend   99.37105176676457
then to conceal the mass of earth and rubbish i dug up i was compelled to break through a staircase and throw the fruits of my labor into the hollow part of it   100.7939383613487
monsieur does not then renounce his excursion for this evening   85.45344951529137
whom do i see yonder   169.0138791440188
i have never been understood and no wonder   133.85623429286875
i am sent for to sign the release of a prisoner   111.22058739439471
then they will return with a fortune of six hundred francs and waste this treasure in some city with the pride of sultans and the insolence of nabobs   86.37388406253135
when it was seen that danglars sold the spanish funds fell directly   139.96030341287693
he left the room and returned in five minutes with a phial   109.33066544402051
but it has neither effaced the stains from your soul nor the brand from your body   195.0792887236508
now i am going to put a question to you and one very much to the purpose too   81.47613197331478
how old are you   188.78782364046344
at the sound of the gold aramis raised his eyes and porthos started   197.22470617728663
are there not crimes for which the impalement of the turks the augers of the persians the stake and the brand of the iroquois indians are inadequate tortures and which are unpunished by society   93.24347774529446
old enough to be ambitious but too young to be corrupt   182.6739952348896
monte cristo smiled significantly   138.0279739603546
30159m yes since you have known me said morrel smiling   41.384081995234396
d artagnan whistled a little air of incredulity   121.08896055567845
at length they reached the tent lit a lamp and while planchet stood at the entrance that the four friends might not be surprised d artagnan with a trembling hand broke the seal and opened the so anxiously expected letter   48.82859632175763
he said he was a friend of yours asked your address and is coming to see you   151.38628171628648
answered m   111.20394080956757
but only relate the fact that he shuddered and stepped back suddenly   100.42582579606241
yes he is to marry mademoiselle de villefort   149.57744637456824
the bishop looked anxiously at the man sobbing in the ingle nook   119.10162390746248
what do you decide on sir   112.97583434066077
i did not ask for it   135.13898228341
he had no other   89.45114135670305
i leave you alone in your struggle with misfortune alone with that strong winged eagle which god sends to bear aloft the elect to his feet   151.96462706775068
i hate him so little that i should be delighted to order masses for the repose of his soul   121.44778860377525
as nine o clock sounded d artagnan was at the place royale   122.69804504110316
why should you meddle with what does not concern you   106.89424903748493
villefort after having received m   98.49293292724823
a boatman who had passed by rogliano and who had several of these animals whose tricks had greatly diverted him had doubtless suggested this idea to him   183.69425408491253
but my lord think of what you re about to do and beware of going too far   118.39405634929409
it is true that she had not perhaps been scrupulously faithful to him but she had remembered him   73.89381627547712
by a fatality that very man bars my way   114.98679461857913
i feel extremely grateful for this mark of friendship   110.33040238331425
as to their majesties they did not return to the louvre till six o clock in the morning   143.0576231686839
a murmur or rather storm of indignation burst from all parts of the assembly   82.6446311096596
it was said athos had met with great crosses in love and that a frightful treachery had forever poisoned the life of this gallant man   103.64066101308846
the bastion saint gervais chapter xlvii   88.76699256290945
i do not know particulars   47.7382391672936
oh i confess it is all the same to me   76.29477251320438
at sight of this pale bleeding man the wife grasped her husband s arm   165.26588880743756
then only when he had heard the step of the horse going away he fell back on a chair saying my god i thank thee that he knows me only   107.18057163955665
i interrupted you at the moment when you were telling me that you were a skilful chemist   121.96779527179571
and as to your husband monsieur bonacieux he is not here because he was yesterday evening conducted to the bastille   99.87551274911449
oh said monte cristo it would be quite superfluous for you to tell me for i already know it   73.82098920176617
you can not live upon your fifteen thousand francs   245.27500387404223
she scarcely resisted   175.55164646387843
i am fearfully exhausted and debilitated by this attack   81.54435859066388
as the moving object drew nearer he would easily have perceived that it consisted of a man and horse between whom the kindest and most amiable understanding appeared to exist   57.12726134604979
when do you wish the carriage to be here   179.6523620801433
as the flood proved once for all   64.25355452108639
a propos inform bazin   26.953866544412207
do you take me for half a woman   131.28327424107022
be kind enough then madame to act more compliantly   122.88173734443623
one slight fault may draw down punishment upon the head spared despite many crimes   73.41949872436673
that god desirous in his mercy to punish but one person has visited this justice on him alone   79.01598484284713
and they both set out for paris   60.648005246701466
said debray to franz   105.65505777793086
and you athos   99.36994670824515
render to him then the last service he can by any possibility ask of you and your work will be all the more meritorious   138.84166854051227
put your two hands together   76.17068723095663
the cardinal turned and said in a loud voice rochefort   76.15860362486376
as the door was closed rochefort cast a glance toward mazarin which was answered by one equally furtive from the minister   87.08004546872542
oh heaven forbid   101.66977120789001
he will consider us as brothers   43.61741166519579
two words from the hand of your majesty and your private seal   138.10568191919157
exclaimed valentine perceiving all these signs of agitation   113.33742421515102
he found him as he had found him six weeks before calm firm and full of that glacial politeness that most insurmountable barrier which separates the well bred from the vulgar man   190.33568257430363
porthos meantime asked d artagnan to give him his instructions how to proceed on his journey   86.25263116979552
is there any need of that   99.23061089929944
obeying the queen athos read aloud the letter which we have already seen in which king charles demanded to know whether the hospitality of france would be accorded him   115.67607035497566
and what have you been doing since yesterday   68.07688864636371
this then is what you call devotion   25.225321102391007
said raoul allow me after thanking you for that poor fellow s life to thank you on my own account   113.14551759781685
a man can easily be put out of the way there then   29.866611879259267
answered raoul you joke about a real misfortune   111.68203530614662
and the disappearance of his money   190.82958549686185
i tell you she loves another   162.7899905565967
and the four friends flew at a gallop along the road to béthune   100.77731172763947
now only am i fully convinced of being the emissary of god   87.79190571748535
oh i never make matches my dear prince it is my settled principle   132.44171473902347
for my part monsieur i am catholic my father faithful to his principles having made my elder brother a huguenot   81.87731993497223
but they will contest the will after your death   88.91338995211046
far beyond the door the heads of those who were not able to enter could be seen all craning to their utmost height to try and see   86.37845018354162
everything that savors of mystery charms them   151.0626906229348
at the sound of the fireworks the carriages instantly broke ranks and retired by the adjacent streets   152.88259185043864
his drawing room under the regenerating influence of a young wife and a daughter by his first marriage scarcely eighteen was still one of the well regulated paris salons where the worship of traditional customs and the observance of rigid etiquette were carefully maintained   118.54772943920612
one of them held my life in his hands and gave it to me   78.17741179074864
cried he clasping his hands   61.02673768022231
oh here are two flints and a piece of burnt linen   98.05200380590365
the friends slid in through this congestion of embarkation and landed in their turn   124.5406562191962
we announce he read in the same tone with which he would have read a newspaper that today the 23rd of february will be executed andrea rondolo guilty of murder on the person of the respected and venerated don césar torlini canon of the church of st   129.73922659252347
grimaud took advantage of that instant to draw from his vest a charming little note with an aristocratic seal and presented it to the duke without a word   127.16526487212316
asked mademoiselle de saint méran with an air of deep interest   77.48204672647596
it is a real bed   107.43603987383824
i am in possession of all my senses sir he said   189.8890046937292
i had quarelled with him some time previously and had even challenged him to fight me   20.764149418524127
it was entirely of marble with antique bas reliefs of priceless value   99.51636902326477
to be my second   121.07287963386324
my trial was to come on at the approaching assizes   115.44637791528986
his air of perfect serenity made mazarin uneasy   119.255637541412
pray forgive me   166.22222191027234
and that she almost wished her father might lose his fortune that she might become an artist like her friend mademoiselle louise d armilly   104.14680465644858
in the meanwhile i am a musketeer   61.330009455147334
really impossible for a minister who has an office agents spies and fifteen hundred thousand francs for secret service money to know what is going on at sixty leagues from the coast of france   122.63190427270195
and now are you satisfied with your betrothal   62.99639322629013
as he said he was ready to go to the end of the world to seek her   78.36342773352331
how delightful to see you again dear friend   113.9955744921486
ay but it is for the first time madame   111.36027237278891
d artagnan pressed it with a respect mixed with gratitude   184.9446212494385
i vow i should consider it a profanation   46.18415462679897
cardinal i must have the queen s papers   112.11602823705996
begin this work to day this instant even and in three days i shall expect the result   169.40847745272634
because i am believed to be dead and have reasons for wishing nobody to know i am living   126.93921748815859
in the rue de seine he met planchet who had stopped before the house of a pastry cook and was contemplating with ecstasy a cake of the most appetizing appearance   159.89133932884914
we fear so and our only regret is to die so far from both of you   205.6525542034869
i am looking for the person who let down the ladder   112.93432948549628
the steward of the duc de grammont   109.8513872962632
d art   136.07834918938977
deuce take em what a popular commotion   173.1421246268893
0159m owing to this change the worthy shipowner became at that moment we will not say all powerful because morrel was a prudent and rather a timid man so much so that many of the most zealous partisans of bonaparte accused him of moderation but sufficiently influential to make a demand in favor of dantès   85.35396190748514
étienne said he see why mademoiselle eugénie has asked me to meet her in the drawing room and why she makes me wait so long   98.84770432697796
then the coronation of the queen of england took place followed by the theft of mademoiselle mars s diamonds   173.66246115029338
his presence therefore was wholly unnoticed save by the occupants of the box in which he had just seated himself   116.70385242078488
very pretty   98.93577388950861
but instead of going to her own room valentine having once gained her liberty entered the gallery and opening a small door at the end of it found herself at once in the garden   168.7232951803408
athos slowly raised his pistol stretched out his arm so that the weapon almost touched milady s forehead and then in a voice the more terrible from having the supreme calmness of a fixed resolution madame said he you will this instant deliver to me the paper the cardinal signed   111.23611064647189
the sound of a light step was heard in the vestibule   95.58225411343753
yes he is making recruits and he will lend them to me   83.58677655452453
god forgive me said the young man for rejoicing at happiness derived from the misery of others but heaven knows i did not seek this good fortune   113.40968578305657
go and fetch lord de winter said felton tired of these eternal complaints   87.00691682660569
sir said d avrigny to villefort call mademoiselle valentine s maid if you please   125.67458647409957
fortunately said d artagnan all this will be only necessary till after tomorrow evening for when once with the army we shall have i hope only men to dread   196.00714651093318
and have you them yet   179.8271520458987
saying these words the transteverin disappeared down the staircase while his companion muffling his features more closely than before in the folds of his mantle passed almost close to franz and descended to the arena by an outward flight of steps   161.28100034386273
d artagnan asked them what they wished and why they had taken that position   92.05725489019186
athos you are becoming mad   120.74241047665195
cæsar gave way before such cogent reasoning and the cardinals were consequently invited to dinner   147.77074928968526
replied mercédès becoming paler than the sheet which covered her   122.17970466472265
i do not see here she said anything but general conditions   188.69210022741203
count i have your word said morrel coldly   187.18604965170428
exclaimed the young couple   56.44798972596981
is it possible that thomson french are not looked upon as safe and solvent bankers   11.761591973626793
speak then without reserve as without hatred   108.51716859668632
perhaps it is some political difference   145.819320705604
the name is not unknown to me   93.80102723587015
he appeared to dread to lower his hands lest their veins should swell and he pinched the tips of his ears from time to time to preserve their delicate pink transparency   64.90811135873804
contrary to custom the door was open and having no occasion to ring he entered   84.50380505368476
but he refused   138.17381285708353
in the evening about nine o clock at the moment he had made up his mind to go to bed he heard steps in his corridor   212.9509648049865
and i   170.3323054895468
i am glad to be reassured on that point   74.18724696473866
but you will find terrible charges   140.68689815469727
around him and in groups according to their fancy lying in their mantles or with their backs against a sort of stone bench which went all round the columbarium were to be seen twenty brigands or more each having his carbine within reach   108.88526271912122
the two friends went toward the shed   141.2727233524549
so to horse and let us knock at their door   160.80987904258106
tony is your master sleeping   90.87873266703582
suddenly the jailer entered   27.415727272940472
will your majesty deign to excuse me   108.13491927157645
you have determined then to abandon her to the common law   97.44992721113485
he was supplied with bread of a finer whiter quality than the usual prison fare and even regaled each sunday with a small quantity of wine   199.9707352936603
not from england madame   47.864073231024676
and such magnificent hair   134.9856577700201
i shall find a way   65.61053535707468
at the extremity of the wood d artagnan perceived the road that had been described to him and at the end of the road he saw the towers of an immense feudal castle   35.33437702588263
but it s all my fault   97.67056729954801
and if you entertain whether from your family your relations or even from your instincts any of these enmities which we see constantly breaking out against the cardinal bid me adieu and let us separate   144.69006822215331
the valet opened the door and villefort heard someone speak his name   189.79823397626654
a man wrapped in a cloak appeared at the door but seeing a stranger he beckoned to his companions and two men who were drinking in the inn went out to speak to him   48.88618480876568
then we merely ask for a carriage and a pair of horses and we see the carnival in the carriage and doubtless the roman people will crown us at the capitol and proclaim us like curtius and horatius cocles the preservers of their country   134.34549876408664
this immediately recalled to d artagnan s mind the handkerchief which he had found at the feet of mme   135.40336976963403
i understand said morrel   142.3161005707997
d artagnan blushed up to the whites of his eyes   60.65169824730123
de tréville had spoken of her to the queen   169.3382246357707
they all four entered the tent   154.8889514051091
that cry was of such importance as to overcome all preoccupation   52.188578537437984
then going to a large cupboard closed with a triple lock he took from it a bag of silver and weighing it twice in his hands before he gave it to d artagnan take this he said with a sigh tis merely for your journey   114.12046530912447
yes replied the young woman   118.4922879414216
haydée was awaiting her visitors in the first room of her apartments which was the drawing room   100.41770159583203
murmured villefort wringing his hands   124.00085017147717
we will each take a thousand livres to be employed as seems good and we will leave a fund of a thousand livres under the guardianship of monsieur abbé here for extraordinary occasions or common wants   59.426321320042234
oh i agree with you   117.02242024351163
another thing not less essential was to warn charles stuart of the attempt to be made so that he might assist his rescuers as much as possible or at least do nothing to thwart their efforts   23.593353983541718
de tréville seized his right hand and pressed it with all his might without perceiving that athos whatever might be his self command allowed a slight murmur of pain to escape him and if possible grew paler than he was before   112.16602228682541
he was very well known to the customs officers of the coast   169.91812157842
might he not have come for the purpose of laying a snare for him   155.59775512099796
asked vampa with uneasiness   59.895843341379766
i am quite aware that my friend wilmore is peculiar but he is sincere and as rich as a gold mine consequently he may indulge his eccentricities without any fear of their ruining him and i have promised to adhere to his instructions   103.24804488908835
we depart from one place and arrive at another that is all   134.81600375700958
if i were not in such haste and if i were not running after someone said d artagnan   139.86565536623965
call charles he added addressing the boy who waited   126.20898895404338
the breaking of his jug was too natural an accident to excite suspicion   135.21957757065042
the four friends appeared to be entire strangers to one another and indifferent to the precautions taken for guarding the king   187.75901986836993
for you have here at least three men who will not betray you   101.54204418757591
the question then was how to change this probability into a certainty   115.16462415713299
you may venture to ask me anything   135.53717385917014
on the contrary he gained great glory and had the honor of being embraced by his highness the prince on the field of battle   79.56879691927058
you don t like him my dear parthenie said scarron   123.43201490010343
good said aramis taking a purse which bazin presented to him   111.57704320307126
they are waiting for the cardinal or rather for bernouin who comes to call them when the cardinal goes out   113.44241470726644
one solitary feeble light was burning in the porter s lodge about forty paces distant from the house as baptistin had said   108.87720457261786
then having blown out the lights the two fugitives looking and listening eagerly with outstretched necks opened the door of a dressing room which led by a side staircase down to the yard eugénie going first and holding with one arm the portmanteau which by the opposite handle mademoiselle d armilly scarcely raised with both hands   111.02783397494059
i foresee in it the aid of powerful princes   181.08755305443805
anyone but a man of exhaustless thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the steward s extraordinary repugnance for the count s projected drive without the walls   63.99222406707764
now go and tell athos and aramis to stand on each side of the door and clap their hands if they catch him   196.96569999316293
is it not some bad affair   117.62525637296949
to conspire against my honor with madame de chevreuse madame de longueville and the condés   68.75576867247929
don t let him escape   83.39458485525272
what do you say to this du vallon   122.09937868732976
you know i always did call you my child   152.3997401740829
these keys were given up to him instantly   56.99133603337697
will said the notary   124.25682333549955
the count almost staggered at these simple words   112.7325294061494
i am the most wretched of men   25.088215077043586
sir said albert rising i will do myself the honor of sending my seconds to you and you will be kind enough to arrange with them the place of meeting and the weapons   178.00530622836743
on that day in fact the four friends arrived punctually at the hour each from his own abode or occupation   134.73471343674078
mousqueton   44.0521975740626
after me it will all be over and people will hunt with gins snares and traps   50.01691496407348
we are lost said d artagnan in the ear of athos   121.17583739383923
i am quite resigned   205.07962746094864
besides who knows whether divided we may not obtain a pardon you from the queen we from mazarin which were we all four together would never be granted   72.22685804951783
his understanding weakened by such events refused to comprehend such incredible unheard of fabulous facts   63.29331195039545
a carriage waited at the door the coachman was on the box and a police officer sat beside him   185.7792109673236
should she forsake mazarin she must join her son and go over to the princes side   150.97140430675316
the curtain rose on the ballet which was one of those excellent specimens of the italian school admirably arranged and put on the stage by henri who has established for himself a great reputation throughout italy for his taste and skill in the choreographic art one of those masterly productions of grace method and elegance in which the whole corps de ballet from the principal dancers to the humblest supernumerary are all engaged on the stage at the same time   117.95466671668945
a man of from thirty five to forty years of age dressed in deep black had just entered accompanied by a young woman dressed after the eastern style   132.01823280688023
asked he of the count with as much indifference as he could assume   166.1826504469451
with your permission monsieur i wish to speak a word with my friend   152.53735263458134
finally as the hour for her interview with the count approached milady had everything about her darkened and ordered kitty to return to her own chamber and introduce de wardes whenever he presented himself   75.39598879990365
this harsh letter coming as it did from a man generally so polite and respectful struck a mortal blow at the pride of villefort   123.49954071250542
the valet instantly brought to his master a regimental hat with a wide brim   108.98719016339167
this corroboration of the lesson he had just received put the finishing stroke to the wonder and stupefaction of m   168.50829659545846
my good edmond answered the abbé be not deceived   174.2680374321482
as soon as he appeared in the count of morcerf s antechamber a footman the same who at rome had brought the count s card to the two young men and announced his visit sprang into the vestibule and when he arrived at the door the illustrious traveller found his carriage awaiting him   165.94050687203602
and that was too much far too much murmured villefort   76.09122084533236
but look   129.45915014005413
50053m the two ladies pressing closely to one another and drawing the bedclothes tightly around them remained silent to this supplicating voice repugnance and fear taking possession of their minds   171.33225984000703
i dragged myself toward the bed to seek the only defense i had left my saving knife   125.99505984815889
his visit was announced to the governor who on hearing that he came from the cardinal went to meet him and received him at the top of the great flight of steps outside the door   191.95561137791785
i was arrested why i know not toward the beginning of the year 1811   140.69621583747332
horse   137.5543492165663
fell into the sea   119.07194082357623
franz looked at albert as though he had not much confidence in the suggestions of his imagination   88.7505954839344
then to justify myself i should say that you gave me the money   130.42789415818035
adieu and think of me   150.56554693228222
you know athos you never spoke much of such matters   61.05367627565364
then addressing d artagnan you know the watchword   136.88014193131315
asked the steward whose roses began to change into lilies   92.5834112482043

one day as i was conveying my wife back to the louvre he was coming out as she was going in and she showed him to me   116.44768831555956
i was so delighted to see her again   63.654790580712834

they were willing and ready to retrace their steps when in crossing the suburb which leads to the gates of the town upon a white wall which was at the corner of a street turning around the rampart athos cast his eyes upon a drawing in black chalk which represented with the awkwardness of a first attempt two cavaliers riding furiously   129.64986594382438
said the duke for your sake i beg of you never come within the reach of my fist   45.07561095205527

here are five hundred pistoles he said   64.29115671649242
this saucepan contained soup for both prisoners for dantès had noticed that it was either quite full or half empty according as the turnkey gave it to him or to his companion first   55.01929238741023
fortunately dantès had learned how to wait   156.35445081319247
he had accompanied his wife to the place of her confinement or else at least to the first relay   59.945843372521786
at last raoul succeeded in drawing his foot from the stirrup and his leg from under the animal and in a second he was on his feet again   150.85107742124933
you put back the boards sweep the floor go out at the door and run as i told you   156.59518216729714
i dare say you know how to navigate should he fail us   115.5334980953177
the host gave them another chamber and served them with fresh eggs and some water which athos went himself to draw at the fountain   73.96490360161278
therefore with the puritans we must go   150.12332537309052
his next act was to purchase a dog from one of his keepers   168.57467928684355
the past is another thing said athos sighing   134.86259830049215
i recognize this hobbema   56.67815052978401
it bleeds seemingly   65.12460172196765
monsieur athos said richelieu receive my thanks for the good guard you have kept   88.40894017415704
my friend my dear maximilian do not make a hasty resolution i entreat you   160.72422872066244

monsieur grimaud   123.52194836872211
meanwhile grimaud still mute as ever drew from the pie the other poniard the rope ladder and the gag   135.44167751352944
understanding he had nothing more to fear from him caderousse began to go down   59.21378544725844
the fact was that andrea at war with society ever since his youth was quite as deep as a gendarme even though he were advanced to the rank of brigadier and quite prepared for the fire he had climbed out on the roof and was crouching down against the chimney pots   104.43825456153657
the prisoners in their expressive language have named it the lions den probably because the captives possess teeth which frequently gnaw the bars and sometimes the keepers also   97.85649680541846
they who love believe easily in love   70.97799066802006
and now monsieur du verger he said shut yourself up with this man until monsieur bernouin returns to open the door   43.43503829362592
but there are some with which on the contrary i am not acquainted   107.02416237312873
it seems to me however said mazarin the safest method   129.92079436730288
you deceive me madame said the novice   52.9432832077098
would god send the same dreams to you as to me if you did not love me   155.11375878389222
but before he had finished m   91.834243820159
i was not sure but i thought it might be so   115.01933038904455
therefore kitty surrendered   93.94867643625828
in three seconds d artagnan had wounded him three times exclaiming at each thrust one for athos one for porthos   149.52922343550176
athos made a step toward milady   97.80873111631504
and do you really flatter yourself that i shall yield to all your caprices and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received into your good graces   117.7878277135514
bazin felt some one pulling his sleeve   112.18504196197199
are you ill mother   130.14780417512708

during the last five or six months that this weakness had been felt the worthy procurator had nearly become the slave of his wife   121.10427475630122
his smile was at once cunning and resolute   120.78592994220718
i remember now   142.9841005131469
an instant after the broken door was removed and the pale face of athos appeared who with a rapid glance took a survey of the surroundings   99.58762575880684
but when poor silly folks like my husband there have been persuaded to tell all they know the promises and assurances of safety are quickly forgotten   145.7518840798606
as things are turning out i foresee that we must give battle to london to the provinces to all england and certainly in the end we can t fail to be beaten   173.43177226897794
and cardinal richelieu having discovered in him great financial aptitude had introduced him with a strong recommendation to louis xiii   107.90878962657658
no no no replied the eye of the paralytic   141.59523950638402
pressing his lips close to the planks he exclaimed don t be alarmed valentine it is i   118.64872169803407
in this ledger was made out an exact balance sheet of his affairs   112.95909947477064

and a groom had gone to lens the nearest village for a doctor   96.49138749667989

these were the beggars of the court of miracles the agents of the giver of holy water in the square of saint eustache preparing barricades for the morrow   134.7595092540219
on the staircase he met the pretty soubrette who brushed gently against him as she passed and then blushing to the eyes asked his pardon for having touched him in a voice so sweet that the pardon was granted instantly   96.83489162140164
your excellency i regret to say that not knowing it was necessary to come provided with these papers i neglected to bring them   208.74062494985714
then tearing himself from this abode of peace and happiness he made a sign to maximilian who followed him passively with the indifference which had been perceptible in him ever since the death of valentine had so stunned him   45.037911026765855
it is because they have had the axe with which criminals are executed brought and placed there on the table   4.666792414366995

such a thing is really out of rule eccentric or stupid   110.39982566234502
as to d artagnan he fought purely and simply on the defensive   135.56775258150347
ah responded the woman with an expression impossible to describe   153.18387965779192

however this time my tranquillity or passiveness as philosophers say proceeded from another source   147.5531969989928
a cartridge box worked with gold and red and green silk   85.10171873782548
de la trémouille s people retreated into the hôtel the doors of which they closed just in time to prevent their enemies from entering with them   120.53294878013416

groslow whom d artagnan s praises had greatly pleased welcomed him with a gracious smile   119.64669396686838

they selected two exactly alike and charged the tailor to sew on each of their hats about twenty yards of ribbon and to procure them two of the long silk sashes of different colors with which the lower orders decorate themselves on fête days   110.1107155036797

oh it is very simple my good fellow   36.733347649033206
all this doubt only gave rise to a more lively desire of arriving at a certainty and he went into his friend s chamber with a fixed determination of renewing the conversation of the preceding evening   97.20825356235531
dantès examined it with intense admiration then looked around to see the instrument with which it had been shaped so correctly into form   128.77898867557514
well said andrea let it be as you wish   152.29365504152946

you speak very suddenly of love monsieur said the young woman shaking her head   102.24776490105832

at this movement mordaunt turned around recognized them and uttered an exclamation of savage delight   70.38584744464788
the tunic soon disappeared under a long cassock as did his hair under a priest s wig   79.28294525744667
but don t let us hinder you mousqueton   158.48034750124663
valentine with her woman s instinct guessed that morrel would be monte cristo s second and from the young man s well known courage and his great affection for the count she feared that he would not content himself with the passive part assigned to him   101.20367361260392
come d artagnan said porthos bid adieu to your sword and go with me to pierrefonds to bracieux or to du vallon   63.16345633322744
the fate replied he smiling of those who buried alaric and were interred with the corpse   60.95831827439195
the king quitted his tent and found his horse ready waiting for him   169.81017486032664
yes replied caderousse little albert   50.64951898163697
who would sometimes take one of his courtiers to a window and say monsieur so and so let us weary ourselves together   188.63234245013103
indeed sire i did not   113.74292299963318
d artagnan explained the sword wound of his companion by a sortie which he improvised   113.29096133174359
here is an order for two hundred pistoles   60.78454449416395
it would have been easier to me merely to have thanked you for preserving my life and not to have uttered a word of all this   41.16026472860531
she ran therefore to debray who after having like the rest of paris witnessed the contract scene and the scandal attending it had retired in haste to his club where he was chatting with some friends upon the events which served as a subject of conversation for three fourths of that city known as the capital of the world   51.006457143491026
your declaration   18.635150476357566

well said the count what are you doing   128.93563601799872
ali approached his master took his hand and kissed it   56.0753229873309
be easy my dear edmond we are near the conclusion   56.579608036541494
the wall of which he spoke was the one in which was fixed the loophole by which light was admitted to the chamber   81.08796186136236
as he stooped down to drink he saw that his hair had become entirely white   160.66880444105132
and three days hence however well the secret might be guarded it would be known i say that we were to fight and our combat would be prevented   66.79611143493747
by her side i am spanish but the family of morcerf is french and i have heard one of the oldest of the south of france   71.03763227221802
then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the colosseum between the count and vampa in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit peppino an engagement which as our readers are aware he most faithfully fulfilled   125.4837530953004
you are not wrong after all and life is sweet   139.34568681826133
pyramus and thisbe chapter 52   175.69863077989942
truly said monte cristo with your post horses going at the rate of two leagues an hour and that absurd law that one traveller shall not pass another without permission so that an invalid or ill tempered traveller may detain those who are well and active it is impossible to move   119.82033317488074
she married the man she loved who remained faithful to us in our fallen fortunes emmanuel herbaut   24.081513166365056
he thought of the fair greek he had seen in the count s box at the argentina and valle theatres   97.05250593500159
recollect what i told you when you asked me to propose you   159.56879190891988
well my man digging found a box or rather the iron work of a box in the midst of which was the skeleton of a newly born infant   130.68914502087762
but promise me if you should not be killed tonight that you will go tomorrow   96.14249487975988
said the officer laughing this is the way you receive an old friend   128.2001043501359
be assured we shall not   167.27965761372576
it is possible   116.69453950525676
he was a catalan   152.95845571950997
good to eat   152.11623333739436
we are not children   134.66216344083352
and yet they were the same murmured monte cristo only now it is broad daylight instead of night   121.75211530479174
but dantès who had his own projects would not agree for a longer time than three months   62.12748775552479
in case i should be killed said de guiche   142.1555195316112
monsieur said he as long as i hold him in this manner he can t cry i ll be bound   55.87035346920866
danglars defended himself with the baseness but at the same time with the assurance of a man who speaks the truth at least in part if not wholly not for conscience sake but through fear   164.67904201423204
the two rooms looked on to the street a fact which signor pastrini commented upon as an inappreciable advantage   103.69926745220741
yes no doubt   124.28673471576383
you have done a little of everything in your life   21.841844935495544
mazarin gazed once more at a countenance full of intelligence the play of which had been nevertheless subdued by age and experience   132.57407545639924
brutes   78.74206134876852
oh unfortunate creature   96.23611934914098
an unlimited dinner for eight   167.38092372920752
i waited at the door   67.18512934180492
all at once she heard a tap at her window and by the help of a flash of lightning she saw the face of a man appear behind the bars   139.66580827644705
certainly and more than once regretted them   220.36037757453212
it was decided that planchet should set out the next day at eight o clock in the morning in order as he had said that he might during the night learn the letter by heart   50.59598653970333
mazarin arose walked some moments thoughtful but not dejected   32.488461830553916
felton let me die   71.84667863935337
and this evening if you please or tomorrow at the latest we will meet   161.96835344665885
how dost thou know   68.28178854770769
let me embrace him i am in a hurry to see him again   108.83428243958815
what is proposed to me would be in fact almost an abdication and an abdication requires reflection   120.62118016876097
scarcely had he turned the corner of the rue de la juiverie when the boy rushed after him like a bloodhound on full scent   135.74549383967906
there now m   114.75086809437042
he is in paris just now   104.58961610038475
that would bring about a discovery which would inevitably lead to our being separated   54.4565630611883
he started on seeing the cavalier with the curate   97.98442972676246
and who is that other person   122.78099064493034
people are found every day in the seine having thrown themselves in or having been drowned from not knowing how to swim   62.836002647204694
but it is not the exterior i care for it is the interior   72.68653020102921
once out at sea let him come   119.53996603761954
and has visited with me that is in   125.7911363875744
oh yes exclaimed raoul fixing his glance on one point in the stream splendidly illumined by the setting sun a horse a rider   57.33341140547837
perhaps it was the christian exhortations of the abbé perhaps his kind charity perhaps his persuasive words which had restored the courage of noirtier for ever since he had conversed with the priest his violent despair had yielded to a calm resignation which surprised all who knew his excessive affection for valentine   112.11295815612165
on this paved yard are to be seen pacing to and fro from morning till night pale careworn and haggard like so many shadows the men whom justice holds beneath the steel she is sharpening   42.36598500148877
there was a third person with them whom i knew perfectly well and who had in all probability made their acquaintance   185.66359441699512
they obeyed   114.3425817638949
blue frock coat buttoned up to the chin   63.39397120700318
de beaufort this wonderful animal not finding here what i ask for seeks it out of doors   74.2662838628631
said my mother   122.02282661629323
the prayers of all good christians are entreated for these unfortunate men that it may please god to awaken them to a sense of their guilt and to grant them a hearty and sincere repentance for their crimes   101.09191839257433
said mazarin with admirable suavity could i but find such men   151.25137965336538
it was seven o clock in the evening when the marshal arrived at the appointed place   32.78838380052166
i can never forgive myself   143.52849103370704
within reach of her hand they placed a small table upon which stood a bottle of orangeade her usual beverage and a glass   103.6622187056233
those men must be poets   54.99817679476434
danglars door just at the same time that villefort s landau after having deposited him and his wife at the faubourg saint honoré stopped to leave the baroness at her own house   116.20305807629724
how very singular cried monte cristo with well feigned astonishment   111.337826185114
while he turned this over in his mind planchet did his best to make up for lost time at table   128.99932047462627
listen continued the abbé   86.2262588946609
i have been waiting for a long time to tell him what i think of him   120.43632690461305
and the two gentlemen were for an instant locked in each other s arms   171.57023145171786
he is going with me   3.565449464443617
dantès had not been deceived he had reached the first of the two islands which was in fact tiboulen   88.89324273994072
i wished to live said athos   179.75998194696254
it may easily be seen he has been accustomed to live well   104.56606358678397
i shall keep it aramis and even though i had no need of it i still should keep it   73.70391484151742
toward paris sir   127.1881218684783
had the unhappy man on whom she lavished her assiduities been previously acquainted with her so sudden an alteration might well have excited suspicion in his mind or at least have greatly astonished him   139.2683657575875
and who has seen this fleur de lis   160.56693723777184
the perfidious deceiver was as may plainly be perceived already sacrificing in intention the poor girl in order to obtain milady willy nilly   124.00884447994974
the journey was performed with that marvellous rapidity which the unlimited power of the count ever commanded   91.8274554441486
your valise is then empty   104.9719741434774
go and see cocles and if my father is there announce this gentleman   162.66107782852674
and as the emperor had created the kingdom of rome for his infant son i presume that he has realized the dream of machiavelli and cæsar borgia which was to make italy a united kingdom   103.80732544129293
we must proceed in an orderly manner   61.55111656195312
50121m no i do not replied monte cristo without even knowing of what or to whom he was speaking so much was he occupied in watching morrel who was holding his breath with emotion   95.9107355857447
he came last clothed in his splendid robes and holding in his hand the carbine which your emperor presented him   145.6574275412388
he went into his sleeping room and fastened the door inside   111.47206034720453
adieu my dear gérard and at your next journey alight at my door   133.84473387961313
at the look of displeasure added to the angry tone in which the count spoke ali turned pale and held down his head   69.50650016063784
why you see plainly enough we are going to the bastion   150.96426077038507
taste some of this ham d artagnan   82.20829488688364
as edmond passed the door on the fourth floor he paused to inquire whether caderousse the tailor still dwelt there   111.77243426549339
but what does this note contain   140.6157652326887
it was a kind of covered wagon painted black and was one of the first to arrive   123.5509538061307
i heard the door open and shut and i remained overwhelmed less i confess it by my grief than by the mortification of not having avenged myself   119.10396857867254
is monsieur your brother   68.73823079735492
the young man heard these words and bent so forward over the rock that one might have supposed he was about to precipitate himself from it   117.20739031149613
ah he has a palace   122.87238000914832
now whenever the king halted the musketeers halted   103.61463145408217
do as you like she said i rely upon you   217.11023412115992
mercédès looked at the count in a way which expressed at the same time her astonishment her admiration and her gratitude   138.4484741665346
thou seest simpleton said d artagnan to his servant that they wished no harm to us   72.2512885772023
valentine looked around her   145.23969452889585
are we not two despairing creatures   197.05962263652225
la ramee drew near to grimaud who spoke to him in a low voice   157.42036724255604
you can easily resume it when you leave paris   121.3787697598311
and it is but just to say that queen elizabeth was not his niece   81.82570174929995
and he appeared to meditate   68.69346502785947
when he compared the public crimes of this minister startling crimes european crimes if so we may say with the private and unknown crimes with which milady had charged him felton found that the more culpable of the two men which formed the character of buckingham was the one of whom the public knew not the life   182.8145716101679
i luckily found a small opening which afforded me a view of the apartment and what was passing within   190.66504879747424
de tréville which informed him that at his request the king had promised that he should enter the company of the musketeers   133.62158685773647
and the queen   26.72019002255398
at the barriere des sergents the procession was obliged to stop   51.42979355828336
inquired pastrini   52.462971641177276
and shall we arrive there   144.5206281753573
answered charles sadly i have but three one of twenty years who has never forgotten me and two of a week s standing whom i shall never forget   107.05383329041564
is it not true   112.41713917140342
the pope heaped attentions upon rospigliosi and spada conferred upon them the insignia of the cardinalate and induced them to arrange their affairs and take up their residence at rome   98.13625173908481
he purposed only to do all that he could to increase the glory of his name   103.05250820931559
and another servant entered   96.32720507188048
before we left villeroy i settled the accounts of the regiment   81.31164295570646
and so he remained silent   150.12593133858928
can this be another vengeance of that woman   182.41269109026337
madame replied monte cristo gravely and gazing earnestly on the two liquid pearls that trickled down julie s cheeks had lord wilmore seen what i now see he would become attached to life for the tears you shed would reconcile him to mankind   76.93357500871105
dantès trained in discipline knew that nothing would be more absurd than to question subordinates who were forbidden to reply   131.9492195548038
there is no knight errant to come and seek a quarrel with me on account of the fair lady i detain a prisoner   200.73728652734064
a woman whom i don t know but who is called milady   88.70265709437459
if he wished to walk through the town his boots seemed too highly polished   145.76971782703924
you will take your place in the coupé to châlons   58.318977823906145
stammered the unhappy woman completely overwhelmed   132.84133168691116
we shall require it   84.54255628221837
i command you not to stir attempt nothing not to let your countenance betray a thought and i will send you tidings   46.440713872090384
besides we will have no words about it   96.57398477327894
he saw mercédès enter the diligence and he also saw albert withdraw   73.40278308514706
are you too proud to accept it young gentleman   55.743597621358845
who told you so   9.152275605961293
he cried in his turn   206.4986610056834
then no more of felton   145.34313005242026
she has taken care for herself at least i hope so for her attention has not been diverted from her projects by watching over me   92.06158742547122
then offer him double that sum   107.37362729546497

there are at this day roman families perishing of hunger though possessed of nearly a million in diamonds and jewels handed down by entail and which they can not touch   114.98267790964807
let no trace of emotion be visible on your countenance bear your grief as the cloud bears within it ruin and death a fatal secret known only when the storm bursts   57.834269281335764
it is then true that the sin of the father shall fall on the children to the third and fourth generation   106.09294612124731
he found him clothed in a magnificent dress covered with splendid embroidery admiring himself before a glass   223.09115501656856
his head fell back and the lower extremities of the body began to stiffen   124.61984777009837
he is also known to the abbé busoni a sicilian priest of high repute in the east where he has done much good   92.20980440547746

spada set out about two o clock to san pierdarena   148.09500323358918
noirtier and the elder d épinay well understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had produced   167.599827964822
then remarked madame de villefort they have again discovered the secret of the famous aqua tofana that they said was lost at perugia   61.51070381448359
but after all it is but a menace   139.90779357271992

whilst this terrible scene was passing at lord de winter s athos seated near his window his elbow on the table and his head supported on his hand was listening intently to raoul s account of the adventures he met with on his journey and the details of the battle   109.216148768432
years of suffering in my opinion count double and i have suffered for twenty years   100.80461106250259
no longer could edmond look into those wide open eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of death   25.607249708690446

i mean that all these cries all these complaints these curses produce nothing but storms and flashes and that is all   116.62620453237184
bertuccio was awaiting this arrival with impatience mingled with uneasiness   88.09942397362578
he found the door of his passage open sprang up the stairs and knocked softly in a manner agreed upon between him and his lackey   82.94608044059264
the host armed himself with a spit and rushed into the chamber occupied by the two friends   219.9979360009104
she seemed to love me so   152.74860332102713
d artagnan stood for an instant mute pensive and motionless   117.98670533679534
with a post chaise and valet de chambre   173.02298730570567
i have been advised of it   66.90658999507912
he only barks he never bites   22.640108499655582
when everything was ready the gallows hung in the middle of the room the loop made and when the duke had cast a glance upon the plate of crawfish in order to select the finest specimen among them he looked around for his piece of glass   66.89342259059308
they all mounted the horses as quickly as possible   71.84307838097374
the windows on the ground floor according to a custom in provincial villages were barred so that they strongly resembled the windows of a prison   112.17240806028332
at the first swallow it appeared to me not to have the same taste as in the morning   139.71265223876904
asked raoul in a soft and coaxing voice   143.87241614740927
he showed the more respect to this queen deprived of every mark of pomp and stripped of followers as he felt some self reproach for his own want of heart and his avarice   27.364432714944044

exclaimed raoul alarmed   126.10083993673885
noirtier had a thousand things to say which he told me three days ago   72.59984034459194
those who took me from my father and who always intended sooner or later to sell me again to my original proprietor as they have now done calculated that in order to make the most of their bargain it would be politic to leave me in possession of all my personal and hereditary worth and even to increase the value if possible   51.81270102643925
milady will then turn you out of doors and you know she is not the woman to limit her vengeance   158.0522917204975
and where does he reside   95.58641933163926
it has arrived at the hôtel des princes rue de richelieu   127.80414914660734
you have today earned the right to make inquiries here   110.68162125301484
but to return to our subject   109.67088796643577
all those who surrounded the vizier or who knew me at his court are either dead or gone away i know not where   151.51080652428396
what was the second   137.18774318262888
i am glad to hear it baron for i must claim the privilege of addressing you after the manner of your servants   103.41038392103245
his hair like his beard which he wore under his chin was thick and curly and in spite of his age but slightly interspersed with a few silvery threads   85.99191937929287
said planchet is it you   131.4536103968616
i madame i   195.8891239560457
at that moment d artagnan opened his eyes   56.884666676871944
the countenance of the person who had addressed her remained so completely in the shade that though franz tried his utmost he could not distinguish a single feature   104.00685367234375
our breakfast comes from my father s kitchen   90.12339518765394
and i assure you   65.37417609723431
faith no thank heaven   40.17936364832515
madame bonacieux presented her cheek to him   69.09117494434484
twenty francs are not to be despised   84.22743698329855
they think of me in their pleasures as i thought of them in my troubles   51.9158309276587
i have descended from a planet called grief   215.49449711589403
and uttering a fearful cry barrois fell back as if he had been struck by lightning   112.28499348242255
from their dress covered with dust and from a certain easy manner by means of which a man accustomed to travel is always recognizable the two friends excited the attention of a few promenaders   98.77673257584121
these apparently simple words pierced morrel to the heart   5.620688644595958
whither should i go   119.75818058104365
i see spots of blood on the ground   111.22124520770916
if you worry me by repeating the same thing i will not bring you any more to eat   69.29484207386764
the will was never wanting   49.349092647478685
all minds were uneasy most were foreboding many of the people used threatening language   84.46085742812069
she was still exceedingly handsome   107.98434930399225
who is that man   117.06690411921436
captivity the first day chapter liii   137.97913247490186
i do not reproach you monsieur said d artagnan   139.3287967019506
i seem to myself as though living a life of bondage yet at the same time am so conscious of my own weakness that i fear to break the restraint in which i am held lest i fall utterly helpless   158.2664764697048
and the corridor   85.71387026352005
from the moment they are suspected by your majesty said tréville the musketeers are guilty   119.15708325005168
cried lord de winter   106.76416809677438
nevertheless as we have said one circumstance reassured her   86.97658860203624
it was then a part he was playing   97.0587520801942
an association in which every one takes his share   102.32699877701222
de monte cristo and m   134.2691361183081
but hold out your glass   152.0543074153037
you might as well go and ride in the forest of bondy   64.158827754972
at these words he retired   116.62876511143637
the young man was too well acquainted with the business of the house not to feel that a great catastrophe hung over the morrel family   96.10109148319444
albert listened with the most profound attention   31.96099204718479
but said the notary you are aware that the law does not allow a son to be entirely deprived of his patrimony   151.94408682692864
he grew pale and red alternately   113.97695118826533
a man of the count s temperament could not long indulge in that melancholy which can exist in common minds but which destroys superior ones   101.44534576537248
the opinion of those who seemed to be best informed was that he was fed and lodged in some royal castle at the expense of his generous eminence   154.06260512541638
this rochefort cried porthos if i were the esquire of poor chalais should pass a minute or two very uncomfortably with me   150.64256250254425
then said villefort more and more amazed and really supposing he was speaking to a mystic or a madman you consider yourself as one of those extraordinary beings whom you have mentioned   131.41694838567685
correcting himself immediately he said excuse me sir   117.68512667077543
amongst us a simpleton possessed by the demon of hate or cupidity who has an enemy to destroy or some near relation to dispose of goes straight to the grocer s or druggist s gives a false name which leads more easily to his detection than his real one and under the pretext that the rats prevent him from sleeping purchases five or six grammes of arsenic if he is really a cunning fellow he goes to five or six different druggists or grocers and thereby becomes only five or six times more easily traced   77.73758952479423
they both live in the rue des ursulines   127.30160223637647
but what is the use of teasing me with going all over that again   101.21430740689773
repeated the abbé   77.33960999959882
i have never before been at paris and it is the first time i have ever even set my foot in france   140.5657325858914
or if she be a woman of any consideration they lock her up for life   157.72694548318128
i am of d artagnan s opinion   69.77536671219265
it is some cowardly assassination said de guiche   94.99725413435219
morrel can you intend it in my house under my very eyes   121.14788207011188
and i was just asking the same question of albert   88.8230400635347
the example of robert bruce will absolve you sire   145.35327722157476
morrel suffered an exclamation of horror and surprise to escape him   43.142567288526465
so it is   157.59061217845385
do you not know that this is a young man whom the count is introducing   121.92222073276965
so much the worse for you since i shall be obliged to kill you   171.83683891243305
he held some papers in his hand   169.0444553093626
were our object money only he said we should be rich directly   112.31418169837627
on reaching the courtyard they heard the noise of a carriage which stopped at the gate   61.53109380511512
how would you like to have it   68.54332615533377
you see i do not conceal myself   198.42881506022314
if she seduced your brother you said she seduced him did you not   141.19484296308443
have you seen my mother   98.66296867196218
forgive me   107.69319617683804
he pressed his hand upon the heart but it no longer beat the child was dead   126.80585527372519
said the king what shall we do   120.55131244135882
the abbé s eyes glistened   103.34905002012232
the jeweller smiled   132.01758491225544
she was beautiful but her beauty was of too marked and decided a character to please a fastidious taste   200.83673011024774
that would be too grand   145.40744159091165
we have always some difficulty in believing such things my pretty dear were it only from self love   162.45681288843795
ah said the doctor is it you   103.68322286043833
as for the numerous servants more numerous that evening than usual for their number was augmented by cooks and butlers from the café de paris venting on their employers their anger at what they termed the insult to which they had been subjected they collected in groups in the hall in the kitchens or in their rooms thinking very little of their duty which was thus naturally interrupted   97.24128198719313
quite contrite and repentant   125.33805109065165
then the vessel resumed its course still escorted by the little cutter which sailed side by side with it menacing it with the mouths of its six cannon   48.289692289333246
the count of monte cristo told you to write to yanina   140.86738078069115
retire valentine said she   34.263653047622114
it is by his courage please observe by his courage alone that a gentleman can make his way nowadays   129.496993571966
for in truth he only drank to combat this sadness which wine however as we have said rendered still darker   126.56885092305279
beauchamp pulled out his watch   61.96690534038011
then the inconvenience became distress   154.023555856896
oh i obtained or rather claimed that   96.57499148935345
the judges were looking for a new outbreak from the benches   44.89682565254439
then masters and servants joined in a fervent cry to the crew of that vessel to hear them and to save   170.8772003845728
you are married then   147.12630482331417
on your knees count   61.86919362415004
on horseback   156.55450535167932
and it chances that at times there are others who have need of me   188.9543581618938
grumbled porthos   180.19344435217334
tell them oh tell them that corpse belongs to me   134.1077213445526
do you think i ever sleep then   142.15586395993338
why what can be the use of mixing a woman up in the affair   106.69061862848504
asked one of the attendants   105.04206209192445
porthos pressed his friend s hand and said to him yes sir all is fair in war stratagem as well as force   96.91138156618621
on your return you can not make a mistake   44.76845097370679
noirtier wishes to see you tonight he said in an undertone   111.03069311474846
what connection can the new world have with the bottles which are on the commode and the wardrobe   80.27655144648298
you go leaving me in all the horror of my situation after increasing it by what you have revealed to me   59.53356625247928
have they spared me   146.35931358551284
his wings were broken and he seemed to sink into a bottomless abyss whence he awoke bathed in perspiration and nearly as much overcome as if he had really fallen   222.32352716667054
we shall both get into trouble   41.17075439200235
well but my poor bazin reflect a little   116.7655971862799
if i thought one of you knew that the young gentleman was the friend of his excellency i would blow his brains out with my own hand   57.97120447912117
because their deeds have brought them good fortune while honest men have been reduced to misery   92.24401048937196
i said all that a man in such a state could say   25.647478403394274
sit down there said villefort giving up his place to morrel and write what i dictate   79.94042549685315
many citizens seeing the women flying toward the high street leaving their children crying at the open doors hastened to don the cuirass and supporting their somewhat uncertain courage with a musket or a partisan directed their steps toward the hostelry of the jolly miller before which was gathered increasing every minute a compact group vociferous and full of curiosity   80.9760235420938
but i must warn you that we have no time to lose   100.78435207857984
you must not be angry with me for that monsieur broussel   102.68041710610316
he held the plate in his hand for an hour at a time and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat of tainted fish of black and mouldy bread   71.17646054620268
you ride on our lackey s horses and have your own gallant steeds led along carefully by hand at short stages   209.7688657760928
yes monsieur yes   107.03441285716823
she has feared or guessed something   159.9579599552012
morcerf s courage had revived when he found himself alive after this horrible blow   79.40355732040817
oh don t worry about me sir mocker said danglars   128.42845747878275
and immediately beauchamp appeared   201.73899092675808
we will flee from paris and go as far as the earth reaches   105.83020837451159
she is not the less guilty monsieur duke   115.02451054428384
oh certainly   144.77146311782556
it is the same thing   229.1769617047143
i forgot that my songs are out of place in this castle   51.011111370672374
answered the abbé man is but man after all and you are about the best specimen of the genus i have ever known   54.08737121713165
we even have as you may have heard introduced a barrel of powder under one of the angles which in blowing up made a very pretty breach   60.15732046217477
my sister sends you this authorization with great pleasure for she is very partial to the little girl to whom she intends to be more serviceable hereafter   180.8042824414344
he returned to his room and after depositing the ring in a casket filled with brilliants of every sort for the cardinal was a connoisseur in precious stones he called to bernouin to undress him regardless of the noises of gun fire that though it was now near midnight continued to resound through paris   95.13658069375164
i remember it said athos   89.39255989894693
franz thought that he came to hear his dinner praised and began accordingly but at the first words he was interrupted   36.62498326477028
the counsels of his friend joined to the cries of his own heart made him determine now his pride was saved and his vengeance satisfied not to see milady again   131.52698435897082
the count said a word in arabic to ali and the horses went on at great speed   156.35359991035523
he had therefore purchased a vault which was quickly occupied by members of his family   10.958848854816125
true i had forgotten it   130.96067233817308
immediately replied d artagnan   134.78095963840573
i am too fond of art to attempt anything of that sort   147.44592269601966
delirium he repeated   39.97389009621806
ever since there were prisoners in it answered comminges   101.77912879052715
coquenard saw him swallowing this wine undiluted and sighed deeply   204.447140127294
and who yet every day rob travellers at the gates of rome   189.89252321657796
here or in the neighborhood   88.54323598921687
i was expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in my absence and to convince me he emptied his purse on the table   112.73821581417752
oh yes i shall certainly die of it   60.32882186683659
there is the comte de la fere madame   123.31285020787841
yes if he be poor and inexperienced not if he be rich and skilful   162.9309641168856
therefore in spite of olivain s remarks he continued to urge his steed more and more and following a pleasant little path leading to a ferry and which he had been assured shortened the journey by the distance of one league he arrived at the summit of a hill and perceived the river flowing before him   199.2564011012193
now to the work i have in hand   153.9844908533006
the opinion of athos was that d artagnan had lost his letter in the skirmish   124.48014722038877
i have heard said blaisois that port is a very good wine   74.50814296341142
then the neighbors heard frightful shrieks   55.45460989170188
his sight was dimmed his legs sank under him and he would have fallen had not florentin supported him   130.6931468507653
he jumped from his horse threw the bridle on his servant s arms and joined them   67.60491507181207
monte cristo shook it coldly according to his invariable practice   118.8101427320489
the unfortunate queen who was constantly threatened with divorce exile and trial even turned pale under her rouge and could not refrain from saying but why this visit sire   171.72076587905687
twenty five pistoles said d artagnan   73.42088941925323
could you not procure us a few of those nice little rabbits and some of those delicious partridges of which you used to make fricassees at the hotel   170.58836767189118
nay further have you never endeavored to recall the time place and circumstances of your former intercourse and failing in this attempt have almost believed that your spirits must have held converse with each other in some state of being anterior to the present and that you are only now occupied in a reminiscence of the past   106.80428652777522
she is at the louvre as you know   122.369741672009
monsieur laporte said d artagnan finish dressing his majesty   125.9387578960336
hallo   158.71463689932392
i see my lord i am to be taken back to the bastile   137.61921830695036
that comes of wearing diamonds my master said athos disdainfully   106.3546477250132
the dead are everywhere said morrel   165.05024582397496
i strode past her and ascended to the sleeping chamber which presented an appearance of the wildest disorder   41.131689364878795
a bolt grated and danglars was a prisoner   137.1558781248685
these horses evidently belonged to the three men who were dressed as cavaliers   167.03129897131197
can you content yourself with the small fortune which we shall possess for the future   201.00410242397086
at the name of general quesnel villefort trembled   144.92959567211318
monte cristo raised his eyes from the paper and bowed   89.95633757612043
yes you saw him the day i had the honor of receiving you   110.58108867033333
mazarin is almost king answered athos   135.88684181998445
he threw aside his magisterial robe not out of deference to etiquette but because it was an unbearable burden a veritable garb of nessus insatiate in torture   83.32349987608174
but there was not depth enough of water for it to touch land   130.33445755449023
it was a gilt table supported on lions claws   85.85295418980215
civil war like a forest flame   93.53474826209825
it would be a happy hit for clowns to make but as it seems to be unworthy of two gentlemen said porthos   30.716154043690892
if i had had the honor of seeing you for the third or fourth time count instead of only for the second said madame de villefort   148.1127750705919
he has five or six rings as testimonials from eastern monarchs of his services   137.6204014571874
furthermore d artagnan went with them leaving porthos at play with groslow   118.99415074453182
you eat at everybody s mess   136.98144243646104
the maid approached planchet whom she took for lubin and holding out a little billet to him said for your master   178.35305409877134
30165m noirtier s look was furious   104.75251332228797
on on   107.80394581905303
milady felt a consolation in seeing nature partake of the disorder of her heart   141.24808538612572
from a distance dantès recognized the rig and handling of la jeune amélie and dragging himself with affected difficulty towards the landing place he met his companions with an assurance that although considerably better than when they quitted him he still suffered acutely from his late accident   51.49133815332379
may i be hanged said danglars glancing at the bandit s dinner through the crevices of the door may i be hanged if i can understand how people can eat such filth   2.4690738606127667
in reality when you have once devoted your life to your enterprises you are no longer the equal of other men or rather other men are no longer your equals and whosoever has taken this resolution feels his strength and resources doubled   69.26646248324053
30213m no   95.59360682832875
juxon turned to those present and begged them to leave him and his assistant alone with the king   144.55848249600547
but he did not blanch   98.2997236859262
worse than that she was faithless and had married one of the persecutors of her betrothed   181.92816235711243
he sprang to the door and shook it violently but it was bolted on the other side   97.85612753734407
he asked of the baroness   121.05277800275225
when he had gained the angle of the street he turned   76.7965978388741
d artagnan vigorously seized his prisoner s hand saying eh   96.58044996182372
comminges glanced at d artagnan with the envious look with which every courtier sees a new favorite spring up   137.99782990588352
but the king where is the king   65.2101567856632
my husband dines with the chancellor replied the young lady   163.53097527258836
however sire if i might advise your majesty will interrogate the person of whom i spoke to you and i will urge your majesty to do him this honor   157.05931559540477
then he drew from his waistcoat pocket the little emerald box raised the golden lid and took from it a pastille about the size of a pea which he placed in her hand   104.49912119603714
halloo major   71.46525525980866
the young man raised the arm which fell back by its own weight perfectly inanimate and helpless   112.42726647274911
franz remained with m   160.82337083615914
it is very fortunate she observed that such substances could only be prepared by chemists   129.90524769541997
sir said madame danglars you can feel for my emotion can you not   175.4699661087238
besides continued he in so changed a tone that no one would have supposed it was the same person speaking besides who says that it will begin again   185.14050189999682
i know a clever person at tours aramis stopped on seeing athos smile   90.36577413630609
porthos and aramis who held their drawn swords in their hands returned them to their scabbards   168.60717188183105
may i have the use of your skiff   151.18729203721034
i really must ask you to excuse me m   64.55392660734537
that is the least honor that i can render to your excellency   53.605640676339
recall le plessis bellievre villequier and d erlac said the prince recall all the troops that are on this side of the lys   62.517063230110445
but with a sailor the last requests of his superior are commands   184.7824213312419
but at all events i have two and if you like i will throw with you for one of them   2.235149360789592
he entered the hotel and ascended the front steps and addressing a footman who waited there in a grand livery asked if the duchess de chevreuse was visible and if she could receive the comte de la fere   78.44244515197835
it is quite true   51.31973096860979
let us act in freedom that we may act well and quickly   79.79481796586069
returned the old man in a hoarse voice   141.10742890138346
we shall meet again in better days   23.883912172850728
said he rising you come in the nick of time gentlemen   158.89524175056306
but internally he was deeply wounded and his self love immensely piqued to think that albert de morcerf the most admired and most sought after of any young person of his day should thus be passed over and merely have his labor for his pains   80.45595280148902
three things were especially urged upon the officers who were to see that the soldiers observed them scrupulously the first that the different corps should so march that cavalry and infantry should be on the same line and that each body should protect its gaps   80.5858489888632
the repast was magnificent   52.212105942696
outwardly and in the eyes of the world i am surrounded by kindness and affection   95.65258537094813
and will you undertake to deliver it   111.99173568326003
does your eminence command that they both be instantly arrested   127.36852247091173
but you ought also to endeavor to perfect yourself in the exercises becoming a gentleman   87.57910979313898
answered porthos   164.2185429667237
you ask what i have against you   109.56427503858048
that was a great honor for d artagnan and for porthos   97.45141360465377
grimaud made a sign to denote that he had done so   106.71848026712675
cried andrea who seemed roused from the torpor in which he had been plunged   132.55149679754706
what matter said monte cristo if he has rendered the state services which merit this distinction   98.94576072544912
what do you mean beauchamp   122.88896580141105
it is twelve and tired of waiting he must have gone on   152.03796913085046
cried the executioner   196.754924538867
two guards received bonacieux in their arms from the officer who supported him   29.074985481983134
go on then   94.67163574530929
i should like to be there at the time you come and i will endeavor to repay you as far as lies in my power for your liberal hospitality displayed to me at monte cristo   105.37114881825849
the man came straight toward him   144.4097655990034
said albert evidently surprised at such a question from his companion   71.78103028401853
but knowing that all was ready for flight i thought you might have made your escape   223.87724350776506
she placed herself before the glass and regarded herself attentively   175.15279748951122
it is a frightful story count said albert terrified at the paleness of haydée s countenance and i reproach myself now for having been so cruel and thoughtless in my request   125.31841325065653
the fowl was tender the wine old the fire clear and sparkling and andrea was surprised to find himself eating with as good an appetite as though nothing had happened   88.17442818589541
now he added rising in the stirrups and looking about him which i wonder is the lightning   179.7129924512426
he feels that every man owes a tribute to his country   139.48127126597788
really one might suppose he was the only nubian they had ever beheld   136.21983023454578
for any other son to have stayed with his mother for four days at tréport it would have been a condescension or a martyrdom while i return more contented more peaceful shall i say more poetic   120.89309296145754
this lady said the count speaking to ali in the arabic language is desirous that her son should thank you for saving both their lives   155.87253477927513
i am in a hurry to begin   70.09362769563634
my mother thought me dead   147.76758538366562
edmond still heard the sound   191.92130374693016
athos extended his arm toward him pointing him out to his companions   124.04057474242697
i called you because you were running like a madman and i was afraid you would throw yourself into the sea said caderousse laughing   70.57733596583175
it is really true said m   94.21663457701689
really count you have a delightful way of setting people at their ease   175.69816812226904
haydée had taken away ali and bertuccio remained with noirtier   119.79234232625413
the patrol was heard passing to double the posts   72.64946721206348
faith sir said raoul smiling although his pallor betrayed the excitement consequent on a first affair you are in a great hurry to pay your debts and have not been long under any obligation to me   133.67499429068715
then if he should forget that visit you would find no inconvenience in reminding him of it   62.99605129530566
i only wish to say two or three words to your master who gave me a commission to execute about a fortnight ago   61.72510054555959
danglars began to look suspiciously at morcerf when someone came and whispered a few words to him   117.40893733017828
i am twenty one years old or rather i shall be in a few days as i was born the night of the 27th of september 1817   138.74536241171597
did you go into these houses with her   130.66198472386293
coldly asked morrel   115.92018817576223
i would have given 10 000 i would have given 20 000   107.70667861071976
let us sit down   161.59247405079918
de la trémouille already prejudiced by his esquire whose relative as we already know bernajoux was replied that it was neither for m   151.37574857251138
but will it not be lost   34.60595597613468
said he what does this mean   123.91994041964684
there are about two hundred in paris and three thousand in france   135.54811934709423
she cast her eyes again over the note to peruse it a second time and saw there was a postscript   95.90806837780593
adieu my friend adieu   123.22907934387472
i say my dear d herblay that it is almost sacrilege to distrust providence when one has such friends and therefore we will divide the pistoles from porthos as we divided the louis sent by d artagnan   110.39199322073038
i have given you proof of that it seems to me   71.39958512290578
so be it   156.523202582003
all the pious ideas that had been so long forgotten returned   87.09061370262827
yes i share your hopes   79.03400459478442
he pushed on toward him but before he could reach it the shadow had disappeared into an alley into which grimaud deemed it scarcely prudent to pursue it   219.66866756814798
it would be just the same today no doubt for since yesterday evening they have had plenty of time to send for a doctor   194.0447626127302
you are too noble not to understand me and you understand me so well that you already yield dear maximilian   99.69512606942736
really sir retorted the count have you attained the eminent situation in which you are without having admitted or even without having met with exceptions   140.7556016807721
and i should have been married in an hour and tomorrow i intended to start for paris had i not been arrested on this charge which you as well as i now see to be unjust   141.3855517033802
a week before he had received in a cradle a beautiful little boy three months old with a purse filled with gold and a note containing these simple words 11 october 1633   140.1339856399998
i have only just left him   160.42582801109637
yes of course mouston   163.52982066377643
you may not acknowledge louis xviii   73.427461762104
his first idea was that this man intended to do him some harm but on the contrary he saw him fall on his knees before him with his hands clasped   54.169605664965275
do you find any dazzling sensation before the eyes   134.29599955282956
it is my fault madame said raoul   77.34716036412631
how monsieur an investigation of my papers mine   115.25658736335423
unfortunately he has disappeared these four or five years and i don t know where he is   95.78193864447466
have you bachelor s apartments there   118.72605705810236
we must see what it is said grimaud   153.84643436165877
a quiet conscience does not occasion such paleness in the cheeks and such fever in the hands of a man   142.6272857890191
from his windows he saw all the visitors who were caught   119.5807595454559
perfectly sure   183.39026759008567
as to the servant he had as we have said been with his master for five and twenty years therefore he knew all his habits and it was seldom that noirtier found it necessary to ask for anything so prompt was he in administering to all the necessities of the invalid   18.15006386000836
set out for naples the hague or st   158.32178284849667
to call for monsieur le coadjuteur   179.4016228509824
the english who require above everything good living in order to be good soldiers only eating salt meat and bad biscuit had many invalids in their camp   114.61422847507734
demanded morrel   15.916294387296972
it ill accords with the expression of your countenance and i am sure it does not spring from your heart   110.38549095380024
i adore her   120.19162916274057
the young woman drew back filled with surprise and terror   14.904977783475417
if we were surprised if it were known that we met thus we should have no further resource   122.17800400759968
de villefort i intend sending him away tomorrow for he eats so enormously to make up for the fast imposed upon him by his terror in that house   112.73702208347336
where will you begin   74.09633270873763
because your palate his not yet been attuned to the sublimity of the substances it flavors   130.15043451005639
see i have not slept said villefort showing his undisturbed bed   94.1544840299707
the eyes of milady darted such flashes that although he was a man and armed before an unarmed woman he felt the chill of fear glide through his whole frame   48.95532667488826
i escape this annoyance by travelling with my own postilion and horses   92.27789000639464
if they send an army out against us we will give battle and the survivor as d artagnan says will carry the letter   193.16680151126945
and in those times when other opportunities for investment were wanting such accumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare   102.52079582466736
it was necessary to reach m   108.9489200848108
at the first glance and by the joy which was painted on his countenance the worthy captain plainly perceived that something new was on foot   84.64481851107367
villefort returned and d avrigny met him in the passage   114.81151978444969
nothing easier   145.49575218978703
de brezé who was all astonishment at finding that this young man had the audacity to enter before the king in such attire   117.46435727633671
then you must not pay us   142.56290635523945
at the same moment mordaunt for it was he leveled his pistol at winter   61.52294455548096
whom would they hang yourself or me   24.85009987057066
well i shall write to the abbé   75.74162801428308
and before we had time to draw our swords two of our party were dead and athos grievously wounded was very little better   92.20398755745073
three or four days to return to paris   147.45149266194633
added athos coolly   99.75660950632536
heaven preserve him   89.15357894826599
what art thou then   9.522566869911927
here i am my friends replied d artagnan   83.72551168916051
it appeared likewise that mme   103.82942719102417
can all this force be summoned on my account   98.22718179450669
does monsieur le comte de la fere live here   116.91496831380528
it is this madame that you should appear to have reflected and publicly acknowledge an error which constitutes the extra strength of a strong government   118.68536369881905
is your time then expired since i find you in a fair way to return there   129.41634524468466
but this time as i yielded to fatigue or as if i had become familiarized with danger i dragged myself toward my bed let my robe fall and lay down   99.56537275817885
grimaud showed his master his forefinger bent   173.12099954251585
certainly these are questions that in your place i should like to have answered   52.521496174317214
certainly i excuse you said monte cristo graciously and pocket them   130.2682721269789
comminges began to laugh   76.84012373379834
monte cristo leaned against a tree and with that scrutinizing glance which was so rarely deceived looked up and down the avenue examined the passers by and carefully looked down the neighboring streets to see that no one was concealed   149.35378142959263
0173m will you see the register at once asked the governor or proceed to the other cell   61.524887890483306
malta   29.68552986480863
at length it pointed to seven   52.920945537860895
whenever your majesty pleases   146.2978130283462
but after all that i have seen during the last two hours i comprehend that such a favor is enormous and tremble lest i should not merit it   115.20496032801051
that was not the appointed hour   188.63593211682627
and where are you going   84.46924378744747
in the court which we have attempted to describe and from which a damp vapor was rising a young man with his hands in his pockets who had excited much curiosity among the inhabitants of the den might be seen walking   57.45098606671107
a brow a little receding as is proper for poets enthusiasts and soldiers was scarcely shaded by short thin hair which like the beard which covered the lower part of his face was of a beautiful deep chestnut color   155.12380495414186
providence is now opposed to them when i most thought it would be propitious   122.79252141364142
what do you wish gentlemen   161.6208568414566
raoul bowed took the letter went hastily down the mountain leaped on his horse and set out at a gallop   126.74035148190224
and i sire said m   103.46970865248849
no human creature beside could hear or see anything that took place within our dwelling   125.37190773197145
is he living   162.9371063399485
what was the aim of that visit   68.64316617311857
in a week remember you will no longer be performing your manoeuvres for practice but on a field of battle   61.26265360432312
you are not thinking of mademoiselle danglars i hope   93.29994414744189
perhaps so replied d artagnan   85.09374492607739
but that father was dead   87.65624598899106
so that political discussions have not altogether been uninteresting to me   95.02091825307922
in the lucern patch chapter 58   104.62185849647274
this fresh impertinence reached the ears of the cardinal and alarmed him greatly   136.94887363724567
i feel if this continues said mme   178.45454939133978
hermine looked at the banker with supreme disdain   138.69887449856614
a sentinel struck the rings of his carbine against his left hand   108.62386161809306
another recollection contributed also to sadden raoul on their arrival at sonores he had perceived hidden behind a screen of poplars a little chateau which so vividly recalled that of la valliere to his mind that he halted for nearly ten minutes to gaze at it and resumed his journey with a sigh too abstracted even to reply to olivain s respectful inquiry about the cause of so much fixed attention   96.10747762688592
adieu athos i am going to raise an army   97.12185452097535
they are looking at us   81.78746174919307
well let it be three weeks then said morcerf   82.94701078776158
there we are sure of obtaining gondolas if we can not have carriages   115.90776893370568
a good journey to ye they cried allowing it to pass   81.95364416296653
to the world and to his servants danglars assumed the character of the good natured man and the indulgent father   81.06119037791203
asked patrick   128.24778967828908
the carriage was put in motion as slowly as a funeral car   123.38298919266595
my papers thank god no my papers are all in capital order because i have none   61.6588432083793
therefore mousqueton alone fell from his horse not because he was severely wounded but not being able to see the wound he judged it to be more serious than it really was   98.79391940930012
i don t like comments   184.97752400243922
but she asked he in an undertone   123.3601680242758
for him those ten minutes were very long   69.77409610851316
ten days passed away thus   79.65862243606426
felton entered milady s apartment   181.26783521487005
i know nothing about it but i have heard say that he s not only an astrologer but a magician   128.6405721116908
and her voice was lost in the great voice of nature which also seemed to groan with despair   53.04096269849839
yes true replied madame de villefort somewhat uneasily i remember now   56.66164277906647
and in such haste was he to warm himself that he went straight to a house set out with all the attributes of a suburban tavern and knocked at the door   102.48457257592737
stay a moment your excellency said peppino rising   130.56395526379424
at nine o clock the contract is to be signed at my father in law s   63.39330533246241
if there had been no bolt it would have been impossible for him to pass through the midst of the garrison who held the catacombs of st   215.58009249628225
describe to me your abduction i pray you   120.79560710654997
ah traitor   121.13967589079444
i will make myself acquainted with his intentions and will submit to them   103.18365522887328
dantès hoped that his neighbor would profit by the silence to address him but he was mistaken   86.07711277536275
i heard the name of rochefort   58.060327164231474
gondy remained firm and the abuse of the day seemed to glide over his head as the sarcasms of the evening before had done   203.7465531351558
but why this question   53.61115248488109
still further in buckingham s lodging which he had been forced to abandon more precipitately than he expected papers were found which confirmed this alliance and which as the cardinal asserts in his memoirs strongly compromised mme   145.34956064404406
this recital was for him the occasion of veritable triumph   122.87432462770826
well one day when she was hunting with her husband continued athos in a low voice and speaking very quickly she fell from her horse and fainted   131.4276293547942
my friend said aramis if you like to ascend i shall be delighted to receive you   50.63770626867415
this time the jailer might not be as silent as usual but speak to dantès and seeing that he received no reply go to the bed and thus discover all   63.955079229973094
21 in molière s comedy le misanthrope   99.52935691440179
only remember one thing a small dose is a remedy a large one is poison   182.34322001344117
when are you coming to the point   133.39028248942668
you are deceived madame said felton blushing   138.9452629493124
you shall have no weapon left in your power   128.78878481242631
did barrois make your lemonade   93.27436783811818
in the centre of this court in the form of a horseshoe were the buildings occupied by mazarin and at each wing the pavilion or smaller building where d artagnan was confined and that level with the orangery where athos was to be   128.07395586080685
why you must have lost your senses   59.37088336417243
resumed porthos   169.5720397112227
but when i went out he followed and quickly came up with me   177.67833182678572
but you will hear about him for la ramee is here and awaits the commands of your eminence   212.90433590167547
you possess the right of pardon   73.13936383795145
it is a woman s voice cried aramis   13.866802460592751
i think on the contrary that it is a charming night replied the countess and those who are here will complain of but one thing that of its too rapid flight   109.28017651717323
desire the french attendants not to weary her with questions but merely to pay their respectful duty and retire   121.90751633633893
i was afraid i had made a mistake in the chamber and that i had found my way into the apartment of some churchman   28.043336528258465
bonacieux was repeating word for word a sentence which he had heard from the comte de rochefort   147.3889235485381
with beauchamp   93.79096749758959
they both looked searchingly at the young man who misunderstood the meaning of that inquisition   136.04547206616212
said cavalcanti who was quite confounded at the metallic sound of these golden words   139.43344038176465
i promised you a letter for the director of the academy   160.51581015932612
involuntarily his languid eyes closed and still through his eyelashes a well known form seemed to move amid the obscurity with which he thought himself enveloped   181.4021937203314
well for my part said athos i found aramis s spanish wine so good that i sent on a hamper of sixty bottles of it in the wagon with the lackeys   251.09670164399694
and he advanced to the window   20.179674990448476
the devil gentlemen   93.64948227571394
one thing i was sorry for   71.11289902919083
mutton every day   120.67838557881902
monsieur the principal of amiens monsieur the curate of montdidier and i are arguing certain theological questions in which we have been much interested   130.78707702413573
to the proof   144.8706934662588
he was still young he was only four or five and twenty he had nearly fifty years to live   70.89157350259279
0137m in the first place and before everything else sir is the news as bad in your opinion as i am asked to believe   133.63404243149478
well then i count on you   141.94804345672532
she is much changed   157.852777879037
excuse me sirs this is not a servant but a friend   120.64075434582388
his eyebrows were arched beneath a brow furrowed with thought   165.1806101474317
and monte cristo made a sign with his hand to the notary which said i have no further need of you   158.30846374524415
to you he was only a foreigner and you were not obliged to love him   95.01648237065123
poor lad   129.5299944671032
asked dantès eagerly   67.87737954663868
ah he exclaimed here is my answer   143.8964808790815
poor kitty became as pale as death   121.06483533498056
these few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his sincerity   6.887009245192289
the eye of the old man alone seemed to say clearly go on   98.015801531722
i am only temporarily a musketeer said aramis humbly   133.07832341901124
ventre saint gris monsieur de tréville as the king my father would have said   89.20829469178513
you are in captain rogers s post are you not   89.16635277580562
but peppino instead of answering threw himself on his knees seized the count s hand and covered it with kisses   52.547630823327275
de tréville as furious at heart as his soldiers but emphasizing his words and plunging them one by one so to say like so many blows of a stiletto into the bosoms of his auditors   159.50327157348448
fernand dashed his on the ground   126.28455013032196
bonacieux had opened his door and seeing the apartment had returned to the man in the cloak whom he had left alone for an instant   113.88756583905248
the treasure i speak of really exists and i offer to sign an agreement with you in which i promise to lead you to the spot where you shall dig   101.6936768556286
would not that dress please you   92.47537306454603
said d artagnan can she have charged you to tell me so   151.72115039604122
this cursed rolling   99.71655378667113
if you will give at each of these relays your address in paris the four horses will follow you thither   117.25572232642878
but no doubt this man brings me the news i expected   157.91673940319885
i will keep twenty to hold in check the mob   167.73852953134028
to this dumb language which was so unintelligible to others she answered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her countenance and in this manner were the conversations sustained between the blooming girl and the helpless invalid whose body could scarcely be called a living one but who nevertheless possessed a fund of knowledge and penetration united with a will as powerful as ever although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying its impulses   45.75706909200075
bicarat and porthos had just made counterhits   76.56198461827944
is it you mordaunt   70.94600142067438
it was a little surprise prepared for me by my steward and cost me well somewhere about 30 000 francs   148.70207376105995
the stranger then perceiving that the matter went beyond raillery drew his sword saluted his adversary and seriously placed himself on guard   153.85326196898035
and this room   168.6389019406286
but i took them for visions raised by my feverish imagination and indeed when you entered i thought i was under the influence of delirium   69.85244728128441
mousqueton instantly assumed a jovial countenance saddled the horses quickly and mounted his own without making faces over it   108.58171393856662
it is doubtless some spy   170.55965151264252
they will be paid if there is no way of getting out of it   61.76999802733578
after whitsuntide it would be another thing   24.634116787954298
host said he could you not contrive to get rid of this frantic boy for me   144.00915421111236
first that at the pace he was going his horse would not carry him ten miles and secondly that he had no money   117.72578617477973
saying these words the cardinal saluted the three friends with an inclination of his head and took the right hand followed by his attendant for that night he himself slept in the camp   9.555937471586546
d épinay even if he took mademoiselle de villefort without any dowry which he will not do would be delighted with the idea of entering a family which could make such sacrifices in order to keep a promise and fulfil a duty   105.50544365711987
the duke went indoors and retired to bed where he spent indeed the greater part of every day as they had taken his books away   88.787675324287
sir said raoul returning the count s pressure of the hand i like you already from my heart   94.31244193544059
why the doctors called his complaint gastro enteritis i believe   115.17731872967886
caderousse smiled bitterly   193.9073302351897
then sell out sell out marquis or you will lose it all   128.02368379994377
you will forgive me sir for your heart is of such a generous nature that you can well understand all that has passed in mine   211.29649888255844
they demanded 6 000 francs   17.505183033258575
monte cristo exchanged a rapid glance with the young girl which was quite unperceived by albert   147.28971440078556
ah monsieur said he after having vainly searched on the mantle piece and the shelves i have not got any candles   133.9956270283438
no said porthos but i should be glad to be informed   127.1744831636554
cried milady with the exultation of a victim who provokes his judge   136.882020586902
he left gorgone on his right and la pianosa on his left and went towards the country of paoli and napoleon   164.58861215715908
in that case said mazarin i think it must please me best to remain   114.95595207884622
for i am firmly persuaded that sooner or later the good will be rewarded and the wicked punished   152.62428509039347
for when we do not owe them money we owe them gratitude   47.313816926353695
the procureur then told his wife to come up   65.2689471154228
oh lucien can i confide in you   206.408539382277
ah he s gone to blois   5.201774813627111
now my lord do not forget if any harm happens to me on your account that i have a wife and four children   110.84511709005393
wait a moment said villefort turning over the leaves of a register   72.97643035456704
by bonaparte or at least by his adherents   197.1066523738454
inquired the baroness   153.97076064440427
however i discovered that i should merely have dropped into a sort of inner court and i therefore renounced the project altogether as too full of risk and danger   62.46446118174964
i have always heard how cheap poultry is in italy   160.60798550381847
well he said all you have told me is perfectly true then and i may believe it in every particular   70.75741286414174
this idea occurred to me and did not leave me   114.48161842772751
i know that a duel between us two would be a serious affair because you are brave and i am brave also   48.694313496754035
the woman one loves is holy   105.56270141560832
all at once at the turning of the road she saw the glitter of laced hats and the waving of feathers   168.83155421910413
why he is surrounded by sultanas like a turk   68.51486382582206
the chief marched at the head   88.86628205082988
i do not wish you to be seen leaving   74.66812407781137
well then said dantès what shall you teach me first   87.04993229384239
it was not i who made that promise cried morcerf   62.20214243217408
then said the abbé we may hope to put our design into execution   82.99121020555428
his look wandered over the vast plain like that of some genius of the night   121.29667636590962
there was but one tavern the post   74.56165391017925
moral wounds have this peculiarity they may be hidden but they never close   198.30328505118018
they could hear the two soldiers shivering with fear as they lay bound in the chamber   109.17538078826338
the count had not uttered one word the whole of this time   117.97986092273511
but that beautiful black hair those magnificent braids which made all the ladies sigh with envy will they go under a man s hat like the one i see down there   113.25341782861662
i am calculating by the way morcerf that indirectly concerns you i am calculating what the house of danglars must have gained by the last rise in haiti bonds   99.04928735720242
just then the door opened and the jailer addressing himself to bertuccio said excuse me sir but the examining magistrate is waiting for the prisoner   113.97211954383879
at ten paces from the hedge he recognized the talkative gascon   43.15300679538588
d avrigny who attends my mother declares he is in despair about it   143.61096647590767
she terminated it by an action which left no doubt as to the nature of this conversation   149.01670108245938
that thanks to my pretended ignorance there is none of your friends from m   134.12163735919034
is our little neighbor worse   230.24599864207423
you received one did you not   55.509977105821214
so added madame de villefort constantly returning to her object the poisons of the borgias the medicis the renées the ruggieris and later probably that of baron de trenck whose story has been so misused by modern drama and romance were objects of art madame and nothing more replied the count   37.49496388361621
then the guilty person is absolutely in custody   149.82259875356047
upon my return home i sent for him and i then explained to him what i wished to procure   109.52014208505825
are you really frightened madame   166.43343126492385
your words clearly show us that they are deceived concerning you in the island of elba and have deceived us   31.15463886776564
never mind that foolish girl villefort said the marquise   127.63255935141302
said the young man laughing she thinks i am worth something   121.97072358713737
i recognized monsieur d artagnan   138.01726259300153
you wish it you are inflexible   152.64987711421406
but what has this vision of henry iv   169.80856417785637
now i think we are rich since instead of the 114 francs we require for the journey we find ourselves in possession of 250   214.3811505706136
what capital   116.85431875593395
come if so you will count and continue this conversation at my house any day you may be willing to see an adversary capable of understanding and anxious to refute you and i will show you my father m   125.7690211821023
they have selected a field of battle on which i am an abler general than they that of a conference   179.2326558113115
but today i wish to nurse you carefully   159.37700266319587
stop a minute answered caderousse   101.41843740886829
have you proof of this   101.58252877684203
for he saw between the ranks of the soldiers a passage formed from the carriage to the port   105.99090782602649
asked debray taking out his watch   52.48992798997246
sire said blacas who had for a moment the hope of sacrificing villefort to his own profit i am compelled to tell you that these are not mere rumors destitute of foundation which thus disquiet me   84.54093322138633
go and another sitting will accomplish what you have postponed in this   105.5647359543673
today is the twentieth of september   98.08202528445291
pardieu beauchamp mine shall be a splendid funeral   118.44177465788368
the count fearing to yield to the entreaties of her he had so ardently loved called his sufferings to the assistance of his hatred   131.42012439283397
not a second was to be lost   107.39565703177263
why you see no one knows what may happen   151.40335909600407
then you have no religion at all   23.0896122734151
yes sir replied the englishman   168.99740590726236
but they could discern nothing but a man of middle height dressed in black apparently of a certain age for the end of a gray beard peeped out from the bottom of the mask that hid his features   105.75563099232126
ah maternal love is a great virtue a powerful motive so powerful that it excuses a multitude of things even if after duncan s death lady macbeth had been at all pricked by her conscience   131.44700864182784
but the meeting was nearly concluded when the name of his visitor was announced   60.324691157893426
heyday madame   110.29553714392402
by your glorious father and by yourself whom i love and venerate above all the world i swear it   98.32495426080847
but still we can make sure that they are so   55.56253779581369
he was confessing to himself that he belonged to the latter unhappy class when planchet approached and said i will lay a wager your honor that you and i are thinking of the same thing   101.11545492525458
the sailors did not wait for a second invitation   79.50392485352452
what are the two fish   98.28958304771263
when you have discovered where they lodge come and await me at the town gate   142.9896159798433
go to the riverside ask for the brig sund and give this letter to the captain   145.77371108549443
the scheme goes forward it seems   153.1166724656748
this was neither long nor difficult   135.33849345540466
in the excess of his zeal he had accompanied the cart containing the scaffolding as far as the king s window and one of the crossbeams fell on his leg and broke it   84.82178915683214
yes yes continued m   96.01228912066789
de tréville and the guardroom of the louvre with the accounts of his love scrapes after having passed from professional ladies to military ladies from the lawyer s dame to the baroness there was question of nothing less with porthos than a foreign princess who was enormously fond of him   138.13306004219476
and i caught it mamma don t you remember   91.36922694465015
replied the count   92.77641750592322
she counted two then five then eight horsemen   130.63738431690194
do gentlemen then make verses   169.84703772037915
27 rue du helder 21st may half past ten in the morning   167.02637980001174
you are fastidious château renaud replied debray   59.12583956410452
20175m without reflecting that this is the only moment in which you can study character said the count   52.33600617802872
franz let him proceed without interruption and in fact did not hear what was said   129.99628477011117
i often think of that young man d artagnan   89.43302302938974
vampa took this wild road which enclosed between two ridges and shadowed by the tufted umbrage of the pines seemed but for the difficulties of its descent that path to avernus of which virgil speaks   128.7459868470961
now leave us alone mr   111.90916403954425
perhaps you liked what m   139.11918740259048
still when he recollected the independent proud spirit of eugénie he positively rejected it as utterly impossible though the same thought again continually recurred and found a resting place in his heart   120.15178890136572
the word is too mild   158.52647352361188
she has no occasion to teach me the way in which a man of spirit may obtain his pardon   128.66751363643064
replied planchet recurring to his besetting idea that monsieur bonacieux has something vicious in his eyebrows and something very unpleasant in the play of his lips   160.63164290341018
well over that coach house are the servants rooms with bells corresponding with the different apartments   77.9370515684825
these people who are looking at us are only merchants said athos and are looking more at the cargo than at us   1.507621813495149
do you not see how she suffers   55.21894746832674
help me lend me your assistance   112.83181773046883
does the letter contain anything valuable   128.6446519364566
d artagnan was lifting a glass to his lips   95.2916657699786
i never give more than four per cent and generally only three and a half   142.11837689458036
serpent muttered d artagnan i would give my chance of a captaincy in the mousquetaires for that to be my name   58.942665070929706
oh beppo is employed in the prison and i give him so much a year to let me know what is going on within his holiness s castle   130.53683691847488
his expressive eyes evinced the greatest tenderness   73.08766219233034
arrived at the foot of the back stairs he desired them to wait   94.7670723216155
and as regards his royal person he must sacrifice it generously and die like a king   147.3218300653287
but guests so precious that i have put a grating before each of their windows and bolts to their doors that they may not refuse to continue my visitors   200.35617532795175
d avrigny took the priest s hand and without meeting villefort who was engaged in his study they reached valentine s room which on the following night was to be occupied by the undertakers   68.63981119693696
château renaud perceived him and immediately alighting from his coupé joined him   75.82904005158903
it is the uniform of the cardinal s guards   96.64877261587903
doubtless unless he is at work which is the same as if he were out   75.54430791112065
you believed that i would not dare to quit the treasure over which my master had charged me to watch   84.14649862731432
or at least i guess   107.29118041336126
the abbé bowed   37.29580668403396
the jury took their seats   65.03668562978163
she gave it me last night   176.07698357280543
on their side from time to time the besiegers took the messengers which the rochellais sent to buckingham or the spies which buckingham sent to the rochellais   124.1852595846365
it is much better both for you and for me to stop where we are answered the wounded man   77.7424513492457
why should you expose your game to your adversary   179.23481976302224
and i also believe that he has not a very warm affection for his sister in law   90.78773118265592
my friends will submit them   122.34961670915445
20111m cucumetto departed without losing sight of carlini for doubtless he feared lest he should strike him unawares   65.98040856029778
fortunately the mariners were used to these latitudes and knew every rock in the tuscan archipelago   149.99832509800478
he will become so monsieur   83.63513135162725
i was still unable to divine for what reason m   61.5281632165352
and would you believe it count believe what   10.123742516222038
but though unwilling to introduce money matters into our present conversation i will just say this much that her extreme dislike to me has its origin there   211.79069426267654
0191m the jailer was accustomed to pour the contents of the saucepan into dantès plate and dantès after eating his soup with a wooden spoon washed the plate which thus served for every day   132.5266783950629
be it well understood that the fifty louis which i send are equally for aramis as for you for you as aramis   174.94229805476465
yes two soldiers   158.7175620675213
danger my lord   136.982699428016
noirtier s expression could not be understood   125.17009365596567
you must be fatigued from yesterday   94.88375845626511
toward two o clock in the morning somebody endeavored to open the door   81.9446539195846
franz   136.77006539725494
and like the celebrated sailor whose name you have assumed he said by way of changing the conversation you pass your life in travelling   130.19487131347623
to saint helena   129.81585850975944
he placed the muzzle of the pistol between his teeth   71.19743405159683
but speak   56.00501540601778
you must be mad to run against people in this manner   72.13622234704172
the notary then prepared to retire   142.30931722823496
he is inflexible in any resolutions formed for his own interests   91.35900841114554
and as his servant i will not allow you to be concerned in plots against the safety of the state or to serve the intrigues of a woman who is not french and who has a spanish heart   97.08210581033586
doubtless but not in the same way   73.62749986303699

he was occupied in anticipations of the coming scene between himself and the baroness whose frowning brow like that of olympic jove predicted a storm   148.801303546127
a horse for which château renaud offered you four hundred louis and which you would not part with   28.507057745553297

said the count in the same tone in which he would have given an order to his servant   145.37920772704737

suddenly another idea took possession of his mind so used to misfortune that it was scarcely capable of hope the idea that the noise was made by workmen the governor had ordered to repair the neighboring dungeon   94.37972863001747
that is to say to search the queen herself   118.81284464392586
said d artagnan what does my lord think of that reply   55.60129609962274
and you followed the business of a tailor   98.64308793676948
and as dantès was universally beloved on board his vessel the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at finding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly coincided with their own   102.10016136562761
on the contrary i esteem them but will not have them   106.37376321941485
i perhaps may leave my life in it for although it may be strange i have for some time had a presentiment that i should shortly die   126.53819136913933
but since i tell you cried danglars that with these three million do you expect to recover your position sir without touching those three million   65.18764810210597

yes i admit it   128.6940575402491
bazin my friend said aramis you don t seem to be aware that i can see you in that mirror and you forget that once for all i have forbidden all signs of approbation or disapprobation   117.26275138755113
the following sunday then the parisians arose with joy   166.8703919500516
you are crazy   74.46520858558497
mademoiselle danglars fortune will be great no doubt especially if the telegraph should not make any more mistakes   128.01422940029772
to name them would be to commit them to ruin so i merely said they were fifty and we were two   53.46680889445428
blacas is not yet convinced   97.76586179122009
30341m then morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was not illuminated   79.76087819122701
there was a moment of cold silence during which everyone was affected according to his nature   35.945674708750076
only think what the poor fellow may even now be suffering   167.65641594247205
no the sacrifice returned château renaud   159.9705923660487
and she had signed it   119.44145836082852
the executioner in short   156.8172201936721
you are right father   129.63550541284565
d artagnan made all these remarks with the rapidity of a most minute observer and doubtless from an instinctive feeling that this stranger was destined to have a great influence over his future life   27.98486588967502
the departure chapter 113   135.50667222036327

i detest him   90.94044808008533
seven o clock in the morning   134.84044283696565
fernand understood nothing except that dantès was absent   107.30471153368377
i should be obliged besides my steward to keep a clerk and a boy   86.97612441579022
replied d avrigny in a voice terrible in its solemn calmness   12.909088182556914
welcome among us your excellency he said to him   159.11405455020412
the man whose house you have just left   132.127718224496
then you can come and dine with me   79.55716892113381
a good animal whose paces suit me   58.41474179516497
my dear friend cried the lieutenant if you say a word i will blow out your brains   194.32768710388086
no one could suspect that those two hands had been engaged with others in drawing out from the social edifice the keystone of royalty   27.674607291549535
somebody said to me you are monsieur d artagnan   119.19889611732339
felton grew pale and made a step forward remembering that at the moment he entered milady had a rope in her hand   203.0749079925088
said d artagnan to himself can this be the seigneur du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds   149.1919614958718
i who am going to give you another piece of good advice   95.09127912871101
the host recognized him   151.67815706435667
she must have spoken   72.71665705052139
you have had a proof of that in what you have just related to me   131.52806391911096
i felt instinctively that someone approached me   163.22829669309513
no i would rather die   134.53711997809265
i know him now   78.66263165108036
tell me how tréville you know how i delight in accounts of war and fighting   101.71264447442952
lastly he had taken albert to normandy when he knew the final blow was near   137.42404857946548
he is my master and i am his slave   142.3794408621135
meanwhile the duke hung the crawfish up by a thread   6.221062498393408
how fortunate that eugénie is possessed of that strange character which has so often made me tremble   85.67724651461535
all replied mordaunt   131.90588121331055
to these registers there are added notes relative to the prisoners   132.81469954533836
i have seen you and invited you without any ceremony when you instantly answered that it would be impossible for you to accept as you were going to tréport   114.25919330893562
cavalcanti with your daughter   85.4696402331505
she is indeed daring   99.71149302639198
i would rather die on straw than hoard up a thousand a year by being governor of the bastile   236.94556756935077
milady and rochefort exchanged a smile and separated   106.69896918893171
i know nothing about it   132.07032712084737
so it was for me alone you have taken the trouble to cross the channel   150.89680309815967
i was about to say to these gentlemen added he that i forbid my musketeers to expose their lives needlessly   114.85415577197361
who had taken him rich brave glorious beloved by women feared by men to cut off his life s best happiest years   183.98872187005202
ali obeyed leaving the abbé alone with caderousse who had not yet revived   71.97257457298213
you are in a hurry captain   84.16905130941093
that can be managed   26.76302341924169
everything was as athos had foreseen   57.52156576886395
an inveterate bonapartist   85.7303552766528
was his second thought   131.66898981690935
but i pray you go away from that plane tree   163.3171940681284
a police commissary followed by four soldiers entered and dantès was arrested   171.43602432664136
and as this vengeance appeared to him to have a certain sweetness in it he could not make up his mind to renounce it   90.29528800156716
what is offered from a generous heart should be accepted generously   163.64875355482545
at this cry from the soul of the frightened cardinal anne became alarmed in her turn and would have recalled comminges   81.98174156967272
that is forbidden it seems to me   135.35363792898272
try to stand upright and let the lovers make love without interruption   94.95624507579204

answered porthos behold other players appear   180.808724980333
why said dantès if in two or three days you hail any fishing boat desire them to come here to me   125.59910040018647
he had not gone twenty steps before he became convinced that the woman was really mme   64.41246147241819
d artagnan in two steps was engaged with the foe whom according to custom he attacked impetuously but he met this time with a skill and a strength of arm that gave him pause   105.97780079144157
i gave her good advice by which she did not profit   102.39650827214116
indeed you only wanted misfortune to change my love for you to admiration   151.5233247790826
very well monsieur mordaunt said mazarin give me this second letter and sit down   108.13137412376942
sixty thousand francs per year   133.2899648442557
on the contrary stay monsieur d artagnan   106.53653272401692
besides what would it be to them   121.85806412374606
she will ruin us   65.72628657475258
her lover   125.58075338701126
didn t you hear me tell you monsieur d artagnan that i don t know where he is   41.48756707858314
yes said she it is madame danglars and her daughter who have come to call on us   190.39608962299553
i shall hold him responsible for his protégé s misconduct and i shall soon know all about this assassination   118.96968579034541
when the hour appointed for the audience arrived athos was obliged to stay until the queen who was waited upon by a new deputation from paris had consulted with her minister as to the propriety and manner of receiving them   172.2302861072356
will you not even say you will see me again   88.71413678675768
but if we do risk being killed said porthos at least i should like to know what for   102.9462423740133
danglars gave 16 000 francs for his horses   112.29973107301684
no take a more stylish horse phoebus or superbe   99.21338126364668
really you pain me   94.75395851220736
i do not recollect it said haydée   171.58344799447246
that his orders are not respected like those of our former bugbear the deceased cardinal whose portrait as you see hangs yonder for whatever may be thought of him it must be allowed that richelieu was great   39.73746708483996
morrel uttered these words with an energy which made the count shudder   145.32943643083416
bonacieux opening a cupboard and taking from it the very bag which a half hour before her husband had caressed so affectionately take this bag   20.205589485154817
well i do not prevent your sitting down to table replied beauchamp château renaud can tell us while we eat our breakfast   78.47325392237539
be satisfied replied bonacieux   87.01747101400315
the island was familiar to the crew of la jeune amélie it was one of her regular haunts   61.60815848615296
and he who pours out vengeance runs the risk of tasting a bitter draught   123.07851531068985
ask day after to morrow to have a pie supplied you by the new confectioner opposite the castle and who is no other than noirmont your former maitre d hotel   121.738907378463
the chances of war said athos are many but be assured we shall take no improper advantage of them   122.40059479729157
what does he say   136.8996748352654
would you not be happy to begin anew in my society and in that of porthos the exploits of our youth   160.0043474938834
you have no other   105.34567791239853
a merry morning to you sunshine   152.9376326365347
let them say what they will   120.61867413023656
three of the king s musketeers   108.19176950770888
luigi wore the very picturesque garb of the roman peasant at holiday time   96.80065834646751
i mean on my left yes there   57.658008813981375
i say sire that there is now but one way open   177.8751347014191
my first husband   27.32787490868948
cried morrel turning pale what is it   136.17197872571643
but you began a sentence sir and did not finish   186.78233757537078
yours affectionate de tréville well this leave of absence and that letter mean that you must follow me athos   125.95111827438966
athos a prisoner   154.58571565803393
uniform cross knee breeches   87.42114618603367
but valentine poor girl how will she bear so much sorrow   155.93677783454805
that sigh was the soul so chaste and so loving which reascended to heaven   143.79072983784124
and he glanced timidly at the count s blue coat   136.01480680848792
with such an expression of extreme terror that mousqueton started alarmed and blaisois was near fainting from fright   83.04426769613463
so we followed him through the lowest streets in the city and in half an hour s time he stopped before a little isolated house   48.11695543163263
then the pen of the clerk ceased to move over the paper   66.56750032430482
shouted athos with all the power of his lungs   76.06292434128738
cried broussel trying to disengage himself from the grasp of his two daughters and by a look restrain his son who seemed determined to dispute authority   165.4044514552308
i took the trouble this morning to call on the pretended count if he were a real count he wouldn t be so rich   136.53475955396445
and i will endeavor to give you no cause to regret your old master   134.58879201720677
madame danglars is ill said villefort   117.6496593060596
on the contrary observed d artagnan with a vexed look   56.44742159969138
no it is useless   144.86734161770968
made a peer at the restoration i served through the first campaign under the orders of marshal bourmont   145.65314626558194
how many covers   86.6676864788457
it seemed like the fête of jack o lanterns   22.348651766529827
i shall become worthy of her gratitude   140.88676301271784
for the moment she wished nothing better   33.16532923929567
as franz was about to take leave of m   125.89784167520077
he began gathering the grape leaves which screened the sun from the grapes and won the heart of the gardener   32.322369694236116
suddenly about nine o clock in the evening edmond heard a hollow sound in the wall against which he was lying   141.97053352568057
you had the fortitude to regain the house assisted by your nurse   48.860046697283366
he can not make me forget what i shall have lost   57.211953911032246
safe and sound as true as my name s jack butler   64.02263022484311
ah but the valise i want cried porthos is a well filled one my dear   138.61128621183573
no i did not say of poison but we can prove what was the state of the body   99.11663987959719
said athos in so stifled a voice that d artagnan scarcely heard him   91.12836634682918
oh my god my god i thank thee   143.5553201341516
he is very young   139.3381743046445
that was what he could not know   219.9962289767215
de monte cristo receives my apology   103.85425335029602
these young fellows can none of them drink said athos looking at him with pity and yet this is one of the best   145.62867683695754
aramis not liking to soil his boots with this artificial mortar apostrophized them rather sharply   195.52296130642168
there s a providence that watches over the deserving   234.07084620381102
i am on my own ground and have an undoubted right to place a ladder against the wall and to look over when i please without having any apprehensions of being taken off by the police as a suspicious character   73.78331955428439
i acted well as a man but you have acted better than man   115.96640631914315
tis too long a word to pronounce mousqueton   86.2728768845069
thank you sir answered the young man much moved   65.62936516417966
they thought he slipped as at first and the witnesses seeing he did not move approached and endeavored to raise him but the one who passed his arm around the body found it was moistened with blood   108.81346394069871
a globe of fire appeared above the glazed opening of the ceiling casting a strong light into my chamber   57.32988582267043
all the way and in proportion as the corridors became more deserted d artagnan wished to stop the young woman seize her and gaze upon her were it only for a minute   170.2800044332158
in getting introduced to her my principal object is to ascertain what part she plays at court   134.04076679171519
she had been there some moments and had heard the last words of the visitor   215.50939763038218
it would be difficult to describe the state of stupor in which villefort left the palais   104.14595186695274
there was a sudden gleam of joy in the officer s eyes which vanished immediately for he knew nothing of mazarin s purpose   47.73418576656175
gondy continued his way and went as far as the tour de nesle   84.49516645514421
what say you to that monsieur du vallon   175.78391664417524
athos hastened upstairs to conceal his emotion and regained with hurried steps the porch where olivain was waiting with the horses   89.38312429205526
he murmured and fell with his face to the ground   128.18075592160145
something like a smile was perceptible on madame de villefort s countenance   69.85869723490637
i do not carry brutalism so far   144.50994930873537
in that case i am lost said d artagnan   109.2107774769894
sir said broussel i am in bad health and can not give myself up a prisoner in this state   88.88427443359171
that will be frequently i assure you for i have found something extremely agreeable in your conversation   187.72678412040293
monsieur d artagnan said athos what is the penalty you demand against this woman   154.41491861203784
there is no gainsaying the fact that a very unfavorable construction would have been put upon the circumstance if the two women had gone without escort while the addition of a third in the person of her mother s admitted lover enabled mademoiselle danglars to defy malice and ill nature   61.93804180313947
you start for paris   125.5448701655251
reflect promise to be silent and riches consideration even honor shall surround you   68.71722320676912
listen valentine   94.04183408130137
the governor of course thought proper to threaten his prisoner that if he did not give up drawing such pictures he should be obliged to deprive him of all the means of amusing himself in that manner   163.78143092402684
morrel shook his head sorrowfully   74.3724425755173
as for the ladies it is needless to say that while they coveted the millions they thought they did not need them for themselves as they were beautiful enough without them   142.0710137963195
madame these are my orders   37.40565084100237
during the ligue about which guitant was speaking just now the people chanted nothing except the mass so everything went to destruction   145.85360445455396
the next day they indeed left accompanied only by baptistin   52.32863056640943
i will neither open my mouth nor draw my sword between this and calais   63.775251714425316
but as it was the bastille alone he looked at he did not observe milady who mounted upon a light chestnut horse designated him with her finger to two ill looking men who came close up to the ranks to take notice of him   60.838775905718556
to wait concealed in the neighborhood and assure yourself who are the men who come to ask for you   85.75863557251978
she is spending the day with the wife of the worthy gentleman who is receiving us   69.52413751800539
why did you not bring him close to the gate so that i could talk to him and pat him   149.44569276954365
in consequence i embarked for oran and went from thence to constantine where i arrived just in time to witness the raising of the siege   72.75227169599393
i do not therefore wish either to kill you or to be killed myself without a cause   113.0289011244003
cries of down with mazarin   100.62121375170712
de bassompierre had been talked of twenty years before and that was not saying a little   85.90434992514697
to give your majesty s reply to those who await it   164.33920197806046
franz was prudent and wished to learn all he possibly could concerning his host   66.61687979638714
for i was among those who seized him in the garden at amiens into which monsieur putange the queen s equerry introduced me   93.75504877465798
we are going to execute your wishes   160.32586167250835
i was far from france at that period   111.6728844112733
take my advice then and let no one into our confidence   100.15943209909034
and he again pointed to the bottles and the stewpans   106.66001868032447
replied one of the horsemen   103.17181629402117
at the end of yonder corridor is a door of which i have the key it leads into the park   44.57585827339686
well replied the traveller who seemed used to this difference between the servility of a man of the cities and the pride of the mountaineer if you refuse wages you will perhaps accept a gift   140.77505004477976
you would then have been too happy to have stooped from your grandeur to bestow a thought on me   101.39178888340773
at eight o clock all were in their places and m   103.90150995914718
cried d artagnan you were all in the plot then   120.19958107450107
peppino stopped before a rock overhung by thick hedges   77.09444931540044
the result of the experiment left no doubt whatever on the mind   174.98826267876683
dantès has done his replied the owner and that is not saying much   1.98345035281136
and as in pronouncing the last words lord de winter placed his hand upon the arm of his sister this start did not escape him   115.40595638287316
there was a great press of people in m   138.89903181001523
and i have but one scruple that of leaving my dear grandmother s remains which i had undertaken to watch   188.64631767304678
let us take a turn around the town and imbibe a little fog   174.67682452517772
persisted planchet who had prudently considered that he couldn t have too much information   122.76521810693086
i will appeal to any of these gentlemen could i leave my guest in the hands of a hideous bandit as you term him   129.94477523853575
and aramis ascended the ladder quickly and reached the window in an instant   97.10731771835012
as for me said planchet i seem to smell from this place even a most delectable perfume of fine roast meat and to see the scullions in a row by the hedge hailing our approach   66.89090058075637
treat him as a man of his rank and family ought to be treated   92.99988094239365
grimaud nodded assent   28.825808037876598
you who have faith and hope oh do not follow my example   140.0874403790673
and what is more and she held out her hand to him i restore my love   132.66000140642018
mademoiselle danglars is too rich for me replied morcerf and that frightens me   112.49411894072615
a cavalier charged with an important mission had come an hour before your arrival seeking hospitality at the very moment that the curé summoned to the bedside of a dying person left not only his house but the village for the entire night   105.33005360797553
the château d if the commissary of police as he traversed the antechamber made a sign to two gendarmes who placed themselves one on dantès right and the other on his left   200.57655158457504
on his first inquiry he was told with the impertinence peculiar to hired hackney coachmen and innkeepers with their houses full that there was no room for him at the hôtel de londres   63.49308646613928
mercédès lives sir and she remembers for she alone recognized you when she saw you and even before she saw you by your voice edmond by the simple sound of your voice   101.46764725445982
on the capture of charles stuart   58.559600643277435
it might be thought that milady timid as women are in general would have interposed in this commencement of mutual provocations in order to prevent the quarrel from going too far   123.63604756761822
yet he did not leave a foot of this granite wall as impenetrable as futurity without strict scrutiny   132.1198607873151
but it was my husband who would not hear of lending   45.292054884741546
as you see my health is but indifferent   107.86341656542024
well this surprises me for i thought you took the liveliest interest in all my affairs   87.35976817382883
then after seeing her eyes closed and hearing her breathe gently he believed she had dropped asleep and left the apartment on tiptoe closing the door after him with the utmost precaution   20.446262469706582
the sea was calm and with a fresh breeze from the south east they sailed beneath a bright blue sky in which god also lighted up in turn his beacon lights each of which is a world   140.62314390108435
but d artagnan being the more active reached it first and placed his foot upon it   126.09512434627148
they are these   92.20119127093689
porthos came up behind and unhooking the lamp on the staircase relit that in the room   165.66056804301877
however raoul must be diverted from this fancy   26.962267631132633
we are always in a hurry to be happy m   85.38828775511814
i said there were no fixed habitations on it but i said also that it served sometimes as a harbor for smugglers   92.83004348911547
the abbé sank upon edmond s bed while edmond himself remained standing   168.27477161152456
you are gentleman enough not to listen standing   106.71360563052646
all is ready for to morrow evening   199.09440429589927
then he went to bed and almost immediately fell into that deep sleep which is sure to visit men of twenty years of age even when they are torn with remorse   115.09735235968355
come d artagnan don t let us play a sidelong game   79.04740496631368
danglars uttered a cry and fell prostrate   147.42522966203285
porthos saw nothing in all this but a love meeting given by a lady to a cavalier or by a cavalier to a lady which had been disturbed by the presence of d artagnan and his yellow horse   87.32246791114714
how without incommding himself athos procures his equipment d artagnan was so completely bewildered that without taking any heed of what might become of kitty he ran at full speed across half paris and did not stop till he came to athos s door   139.60645301070483
possessed by this idea the cardinal resolved to know all about d artagnan immediately   135.2622386815144
those that have been crowned with full success have been long meditated upon and carefully arranged   129.70356307116805
athos sprang over the hedge and went up to the window which was without shutters but had the half curtains closely drawn   113.14047345466217
and the more he thought the firmer grew his opinion on the subject   118.64726122474809
yes yes murmured he i have often felt regret for the victim but never the very slightest remorse for the assassin   129.73801070086338
what is it to me who have passed twenty years between life and death   86.47527089164328
you know that is never refused among neighbors   104.28006136539975
morrel comes to aid me   125.53847234465252
i am a victim of the cardinal   138.7687413927671
ali has many faults mixed with most excellent qualities   142.4138841236095
oh said andrea philosophically determined to watch his companion narrowly does not life pass in waiting   146.5355183408674
where will it take me   158.38867318547798
but you will remain   122.86687541126219
notwithstanding a slight resistance on the part of monte cristo whose lips turned pale but who preserved his ceremonious smile andrea seized the count s hand pressed it jumped into his phaeton and disappeared   79.73981210196679
we avoid imprisonment and we play the part of heroes   132.2898333214747
one moment my lord whispered athos and he said something in a low voice   84.46479898468331
and to make porthos contented there was wanting what   95.38824807432803
gray blue eyes more gray than blue   129.91971711157106
by a banker of paris my correspondent   141.34043397766374
i never believe in anything i have not seen and as i never have seen apparitions i don t believe in them   75.0002242713889
apropos if you fire and you will do so for you are recommended to a young general who is very fond of powder remember that in single combat which often takes place in the cavalry never to fire the first shot   223.23113644006793
porthos opened his mouth thinking it a good opportunity to put in a word in his turn   19.976055918895142
yes it was about stop a minute yes it was about a woman   102.96478541557907
it was empty   134.53068573484956
the cardinal as his majesty had said was really furious so furious that during eight days he absented himself from the king s gaming table   101.31562652320444
yes count said milady in her softest voice and pressing his hand in her own i am happy in the love which your looks and your words have expressed to me every time we have met   106.86262069495979
alas madame returned villefort my profession as well as the times in which we live compels me to be severe   143.45682739083804
retorted la carconte   63.4815954766592
that is not prudent said caderousse   72.57130212488454
let us return with renewed strength to the battle field and i promise you 500 000 soldiers another marengo and a second austerlitz   66.99281232678831
opening the door of communication passed into the corridor which led from his apartments to those of anne of austria   102.86120923521257
but do you wish to marry andrea my dear m   82.2023544666627
attention porthos   24.431548438414254
he had borne with the public prison and with privations of all sorts   182.75220902509776
precisely so madame   109.69041474366813
don t be downcast   151.65333072182352
there were heavy maned lion skins from atlas striped tiger skins from bengal   127.82825580678184
the adieux were on this side longer and more tender than they had been on the other not that m   143.4405988690161
he had dark sparkling and deep set eyes hooked nose and teeth white as those of a carnivorous animal   64.91972557762054
but these advances could not go far with three musketeers who were already much in arrears and a guardsman who as yet had no pay at all   93.1198769041212

they arrived at ablain without accident   175.2175137819712
and as there was between these worthies and himself a perpetual battle of wits he had at first thought that dantès might be an emissary of these industrious guardians of rights and duties who perhaps employed this ingenious means of learning some of the secrets of his trade   94.42779053047245

athos set the lackeys to work first because since these men had been in the service of himself and his friends he had discovered in each of them different and essential qualities   30.559962982816543
then the count threw the bridle of his horse into the hands of a peasant remounted the steps went into the cathedral there to kneel down in the darkest corner and pray   108.1075735137217
bring it to me or rather no no   130.65249919791526

eh he said negligently this money is not mine   65.17164094793952
he was immediately recognized as one of them   130.51049374373338
you are now sanguinary   170.64685544161046
cried porthos clapping his hands and nodding his head   116.51231238743809

well madame in that case my advice i know that i am very bold to offer advice to your majesty my advice is that the king should not leave his kingdom   152.23759800129415

the latter to make a short cut had appeared on a sluice   146.38006214580332
lord de winter had announced her embarkation for the twenty third and it was now the morning of the twenty second   158.0396100009737
it is theology in verse   13.43378067562486
your turn my lord said athos   85.62883602516011
the uniform of the king s musketeers carries a certain respect with it and even if that were not the case i would engage with four of my men to put to flight a hundred of these clowns   198.29961863218648
he remained listening and gazing   123.43685887658387
it is five hundred feet from here in advance said d artagnan   68.86726980101618
it was her practice to pass hours either in her oratory or in her room without either reading or praying   92.06426343522183
the friend of my greatest foes   129.0120781509752
exclaimed aramis this will reconcile me to him   91.76398732913809
asked the doctor eagerly   114.72586207372878
till then   69.81577125865137
not very much said d artagnan   81.35973172789598
he cried or you are a dead man   31.169197866202765
it is the will of god   116.39671210228877
as he came near the hotel franz saw a man in the middle of the street   140.1712001389669
read for yourself and judge   207.08638142930482
nothing betokened that the man knew anything of what had occurred   127.70784509155773
that is possible go   111.49360293778084
these horses belong to monsieur de montbazon   106.87326042817352
he was a man of uncommonly sound sense   146.97094753645402
and more especially a notorious coward   103.12084999751394
noirtier for whom france was a vast chess board from which pawns rooks knights and queens were to disappear so that the king was checkmated m   132.24703630047637

of course not   85.34078987345175
at last a nightingale lost in a thicket of shrubs in the midst of its most melodious cadences had fluted low and lower into stillness and fallen asleep   148.25735251254235
he was carried home in the arms of the people   34.38490444781347
i stumbled over some object   29.69160061793177
and you say he is dressed as a monk grimaud   137.92728222611942
very possibly i may not go answered franz   85.98493518648685
said my father to some people who were holding a paper inscribed with characters of gold   128.04405368054535
the whole brought up by fernand whose lips wore their usual sinister smile   101.08717478597973
did it belong to m   99.79557176081137
thank you said the cardinal biting his lips with anger   145.97751544317245
in french en avant   105.62470782432699
ay that will do at armentières   109.48370069559172
danglars be there   131.2535274919011
we will return   96.74268125999043
paris is not paved with cambric   46.117143575425644
oh misery cried franz the only hope which sustained me and enabled me to read to the end was that of knowing at least the name of him who killed my father   115.5412603540074
your holiness said the curate here is the person of whom i had the honor to speak to you   171.98703991972394
that makes no difference said aramis coloring   164.75516544496028
your eminence may be certain of that   115.01916634738208
and a comforting one too added d artagnan seeing the delight that his intelligence gave the young man   85.57031322317567
morrel had to pay within half an hour 287 500 francs   60.420456233088075
do you say resumed d artagnan that you suspect that impertinent gentleman   148.83517536626718
the queen cast a glance around her and saw the cardinal behind with a diabolical smile on his countenance   21.148798147480207
your pardon madame i know all that   218.1280714270676
cocles had seen them go without thinking of inquiring the cause of their departure   132.64485742977072
means for classical tragedy chapter lviii   117.70646484636222
faria smiled   151.35419009646583
at this exclamation the man on horseback turned slowly and with a lofty air and the two travelers could see displayed in all their brilliancy the large eyes the vermilion visage and the eloquent smile of mousqueton   102.96904039719197
we have no time to lose   168.89369943884853
at this very moment my lord he no doubt dreams that he is one already   135.65739113289712
who is this groslow   157.04790976516395
his eyes were full of melancholy and from their depths occasionally sparkled gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred   135.8269539259673
behold nebuchadnezzar   96.08772034135818
meanwhile carried away as we are by our narrative we must leave our three friends to themselves and follow the duke of buckingham and his guide through the labyrinths of the louvre   135.22916691123183
and yet as she could scarcely breathe she rose and went towards a looking glass   154.8075419216856
an instant after the countess resumed you came to inquire after my health   131.05168426394872
if your income is lessened i shall be obliged to make you a canon of notre dame   126.84328081481425
at that instant the little side gate leading from the waste ground to the street was noiselessly opened and a tall powerful young man appeared   101.22692243555679
it is you who stabbed selim   51.87958847485486
d artagnan raised himself on tiptoe and as the carriage passed saw harrison at one window and mordaunt at the other   89.77456211609724
but at any rate you know where he is monsieur d artagnan   182.2946494344991
come come fernand said caderousse hold up your head and answer us   155.4332742129284
it was never without a nervous shudder since the dinner at auteuil and the events which followed it that madame danglars heard monte cristo s name announced   133.19926423858007
be easy on that score m   128.4016310093775
the moment that d artagnan saw that his wish was accomplished and his man would not escape him he recovered his usual tranquillity   115.09940251984187
the suspicion that it was she had crossed the mind of d artagnan when she drew the handkerchief from her pocket   153.69555014477228
explain yourself then   195.35891684924053
cried the two musketeers   125.88474942473697
this was the departure of fernand of fernand whose crime she did not know and whom she regarded as her brother   68.11908524532998
you do not like dantès   138.4978345585032
never mind where it comes from said porthos let us taste it and if it is good let us drink it   94.96465873933508
yes that first and other things afterward   188.87791670978953
and your two other friends   77.25085746578031
then if he persists notwithstanding all this as that is as i have said the limit of my mission i shall have nothing to do but to pray god to work a miracle for the salvation of france   63.04766812290456
come my friend come let me embrace you   132.70368547124417
and he raised his cane six inches higher   122.36810628862102
the air seems darkened with the falling confetti and flying flowers   95.80492537261986
resounded from all parts and was death to mazarin s ears   91.92701361079892
the fêtes are veritable pleasure days to the italians   108.86317273925151
ah your excellency i am overwhelmed with delight   129.56747415097686
i do not know him viscount   58.5766389410934
what is past is past   91.9166503496487
it was the first time he had ever met a similar client   87.92497663200926
well my lord my friend has three magnificent estates that of vallon at corbeil   111.95902812666792
the sight of what is going on is necessary to young men who always want to see the world traverse their horizon even if that horizon is only a public thoroughfare   100.53012679139954
he was going toward the door when mazarin stopped him   75.4197152303085
lover and husband ah madame said d artagnan entering by the door which the young woman opened for him allow me to tell you that you have a bad sort of a husband   133.8666541942547
you wished it to be preceded by all these titles   91.01239125581186
my sleep then must have lasted twenty four hours   34.664264269518654
the latter recollected the terrible caution of monte cristo   105.27755431917343
i went to him and told him all   156.9598739418539
if he persists his eminence made a pause and resumed if he persists well then i shall hope for one of those events which change the destinies of states   73.51938073255607
you conducted him to the wounded man and you had time to observe him and perhaps you would know him again were you to meet him   12.511627088540337
the young men bowed and quitted the box   64.7436539530755
but as good luck would have it just as i thought i should have two affairs to manage our friend was brought home with a broken leg   179.93472934564977
monsieur said the old man ask me nothing   129.60083979425977
the host instantly made him a sign to follow went out with him by a door which opened into a yard led him to the stable where a saddled horse awaited him and asked him if he stood in need of anything else   180.76788357649033
the general tore the handkerchief from his eyes   175.69603389933616
justice has its formalities   181.00570792885458
but you will come and call on my mother before tomorrow   116.21436260949105
but will no one remain in the house my lord   3.6854452870281023
they say that monsieur de buckingham is in france replied aramis with a significant smile which gave to this sentence apparently so simple a tolerably scandalous meaning   105.64399612722642
she was an angel on earth before being an angel in heaven   87.21695093137654
from the abbé busoni   66.74232183853086
and i made some others also which i hope i may fulfil in due season   93.18104155860561
if only they close the guardhouse door   43.14236185394451
on the top of the wall sentinels went and came with a frightened air   153.04271189996356
and that you know is fernand   162.06968801461764
to answer you would be to forget it   110.1506399461233
whether queens or not they are always the same   47.938409049524424
doubtless both of them understood that the situation had become too serious to lose time in useless words and aimless wrath   147.7687365004484
it is no nonsense   121.85238999896912
take a cigar   105.58290921262446
spur spur   43.68539475573988
athos pale but resolute   144.0653657814292
a tremor of suppressed rage shook the whole frame of the count and making a violent effort over himself he said i have a right to insist on your giving me an explanation   133.9831783285595
there is certainly some magic underneath   110.05045375260308
there was something so strange in these three words that everybody except the king shuddered   111.00598171780803
franz and albert looked inquiringly at each other then at the gorgeous furnishings of the apartment   93.8700825376072
we can chat better in doors and there is no coachman to overhear our conversation   169.56656448259062
it is he who forsook us   199.88169775985915
chapter 45   135.6847857461296
he can not acknowledge me openly it appears but he does it through m   167.23066001958
brava   77.24983416413036
i gave one to the sultan who mounted it in his sabre   98.06642994223523
and the cardinal m   97.07983002580679
said the other turning on his heels and surveying the young man with as much astonishment as contempt   80.40678094421148
could your conversation have been overheard by anyone   36.11024888465734
twice for my majordomo   101.70907394932988
30169m notary said she do you want a notary dear grandpapa   160.2305399551306
i bought said he the business of my predecessor on the strength of his assurance that he supplied the castle   154.25535686237464
athos began to despair   102.54663458392342
a day or two of rest will set me up and i hope i shall find among the rocks certain herbs most excellent for bruises   125.98733871014981
a lofty room on the ground floor containing all the ingenious instruments the english eminent in piscatory pursuits since they are patient and sluggish have invented for fishing   14.534858703509386
now continued he addressing planchet you have eight days to get an interview with lord de winter   140.2065716865248
i too could dine where i like   32.08360938652953
the host quitted the room in agitation and as for his wife she had fled at the sound of her husband s cries   176.20788503949717
cried the king whose face was lighted up in spite of himself by a flash of joy   128.8147564752791
certes cried athos you are the best mounted poet of france or navarre   179.61200415951092
danglars absorbed in an interesting conversation with m   156.07159138443103
in the second place because he rather deserved the odium which he had incurred   125.38045712932569
he proceeded nevertheless and came opposite to an iron gate ornamented in the taste of the period   166.46573523458466
i could make of that subject two volumes the size of this continued the jesuit   146.3349766118421
d artagnan remained all day in his quarters assigning as a reason to himself that the weather was bad   124.33456662178301
let us go to the parpaillot then for here the walls are like sheets of paper   80.40718015412287
a rich uniform half french half oriental set off his graceful and stalwart figure and his broad chest was decorated with the order of the legion of honor   78.652221398981
terror seemed to have deprived them even of the power of uttering a cry   186.7679077206805
the third to let the enemy fire first   150.93042497958723
the famous secretaire is in the dressing room   77.35518819594212
unknown you say is the man who rendered you this service unknown to you   62.827712200530684
well asked he when franz had finished what do you think of that   141.44772760085715
that is to say he fought for the independence of the greeks and hence arises the calumny   115.32900412663203
hitherto the excitement of fulfilling a duty had sustained them   143.47163577824165
wilkom suster said planchet   127.52012193669759
these narratives were frequently the theme of conversation between luigi and teresa   138.05221962615045
thus you see though born in paris i was brought up in corsica   164.23804031335914
well that some one will open the doors   167.08717990258515
one moment gentlemen cried flamarens   88.61076557031251
but unfortunately every executioner has his assistant his man or whatever you call him   71.32000591681046
what is worth a louis   154.2763538913808
he seemed to be quite overcome   66.62120327385736
and i thank you for planchet my dear athos   198.96303379060953
armed to the teeth   198.44848625447085
this kind of ceremony had not then been abused and it produced a great effect   99.36665394084477
had you not a meeting with my son this morning   43.87797464508856
it is he who has raised all this revolt   108.01893724891428
if my lord suspects they have been stolen perhaps the person who stole them still has them in his hands   147.22185339175394
twisted his mustache proudly placing his hand upon his hip   112.6890126361376
the cortege proceeded to notre dame where a te deum was chanted   73.52149402156566
and now i am convinced said d artagnan that this abduction of the queen s woman is connected with the events of which we are speaking and perhaps with the presence of buckingham in paris   66.35769550471056
besides what was morcerf seeking   154.0273228238098
well this evening will come thank god   137.0819235174918

danglars has sacrificed them to the selfish consideration of gaining some thousands of paltry francs   125.88789678154613
he tried to follow monte cristo   28.81021188217234
de tréville who detected him at once   108.6384900466496
how the devil do they venture so near the hotel de bouillon   91.84121605883311
and i deny it said tréville   85.59340060371598
as he was about to leave the presence the cardinal gave him a friendly smile and said a perfect harmony reigns sire between the leaders and the soldiers of your musketeers which must be profitable for the service and honorable to all   143.54594263662227
alas would i could weep like you   97.5013225441707

he told how he had a rendezvous with a young woman before that pavilion and how not seeing her come he had climbed the linden tree and by the light of the lamp had seen the disorder of the chamber   115.1981476607448
meanwhile the miner underneath was heard working away incessantly when suddenly an unexpected noise resounded in the passage   103.57158148892952
only the people remained full of noise and excitement   135.28011672389414
danglars of it till i am tired but he is fascinated with his luccanese   71.99252310077839

said franz interrupting himself   169.95450818151508
tell me truly whether you are in earnest or if this project of visiting paris is merely one of the chimerical and uncertain air castles of which we make so many in the course of our lives but which like a house built on the sand is liable to be blown over by the first puff of wind   56.220054982724015

the matter was to ascertain by reconnoitering how the enemy guarded this bastion   82.79114086586186
i sank on my knees my hands clasped round one of the bedposts   155.43207370159215
now that they are guilty of a conspiracy against england will your honor give me all four of them   202.1722028640234

this was a useless clause in the bargain for whenever the coward sees the first glimpse of the shores of africa he runs down below and can only be induced to appear again when we are out of sight of that quarter of the globe   163.16639643674205
monte cristo took up his glass again as if nothing had happened   88.57953344434068
nor does it much disquiet me   106.40237091701195
and do you account me that title   143.23394903445651
everyone offered his own   159.04098130319827
it had to do in some way with certain studs and diamonds   144.61633054626668
it is not your father or madame de villefort who is ill   121.3758053280324
he found outside the door the old servant to whom valentine had given directions   136.56265838249269
he comes to fetch his wife and daughter   112.22116316318704
the cardinalists were three   194.76545194501136
you will soon be paid   68.65128713665226
murmured milady becoming exceedingly pale and drawing back till the wall prevented her from going any farther   68.98638616530977
this is one of those attempts that happen every day   54.16647497350636
truly madame i recollect m   68.94392239008556
ah my young friend added the curate groaning do not regret the devil i implore you   98.2477749683721
then in a lower and more gentle voice he added   24.65774543705534
i am replied the latter gravely   113.52961413843052
we could scarcely have requested your mother to take a sword and fight us   87.52254278680444
and he sat down and began to cast up the accounts of his party whose money he managed   92.66565900627964
and this can best be effected by employing the most inflexible agents to put down every attempt at conspiracy tis the best and surest means of preventing mischief   87.52802204749045
but i know you to be a man of honor   118.5087227335189
you are completely mistaken sir said monte cristo coldly who felt the perfidious manœuvre of the young man and understood the bearing of his words   98.72746238294974
and he withdrew to seat himself upon his goat skin which reminded him of the smell of the brandy   189.63396740649216
we are very happy monsieur replied julie   181.9561375790318
the baron had had a plank nailed over the grating   73.5769859741963
i have still twenty pistoles sir   87.42362178687759
a thousand fiery darts are piercing my brain   72.25825341996156
could you not spare me the increase of torture which your visits cause me   2.3797262981556173
what do you propose   78.07554167339802
the president looked at his auditors   162.67835136535922
no no you are deceived she is a queen   59.1084450059873
of course they will do so as honorable gentlemen and the best proof i can furnish is this so saying he threw his hat on the ground pushed back his chair to the wall and bowed to mordaunt with true french grace   165.7249750540423
and he remained again motionless and thoughtful   75.34856478149167
they were obliged to stuff at least twenty pounds weight of shot in the small rider s pockets to make him weight   80.35289806393135
oh fear nothing madame   103.90596113494746
felton made a slight bow and directed his steps toward the door   41.1393419269498
the frenchman had been so impatient to reach the house of thomson french that he would not wait for the horses to be harnessed but left word for the carriage to overtake him on the road or to wait for him at the bankers door   213.69021941876946
the garden was long and narrow   100.56881822454807
there will be time for both   118.62331793577627

yes that s the thing my lord   82.2706384225813
danglars by the unexpected appearance of the brigade of soldiers and by the disclosure which had followed the mansion was deserted with as much rapidity as if a case of plague or of cholera morbus had broken out among the guests   121.99621023733958
for perhaps they were too high placed for anyone to dare look for them where they were   162.5050555026088
la ramee took his hand and laughed aloud   95.93259173423226
i do not think you understand me replied caderousse calmly   168.48656506727338
why you have just said a man of high distinction   164.06007173766704
because madame it was necessary to prove to your majesty one thing of which you doubted that is that we still possess amongst us some valor and are worthy of some consideration at your hands   150.41761487701467
she was talking with great animation with the stranger   142.85617273546185
bertuccio obeyed and despatched a courier to pontoise to say the travelling carriage would arrive at six o clock   197.16214132070118
perhaps there is still time to save us   86.57478592334736
so you see being in constant fear of being forced from that position i am armed to the teeth   107.80794800397732
villefort wiped the perspiration from his forehead   113.32259364778042
go up when you are ready and sleep well   111.46614106170001
and at the first alarm we can leave france   13.497934718850217
and the count took a bottle from his pocket containing a red liquid of which he poured a few drops into the glass   120.13870510598802
no i would join the escort   146.493409903748
olivain pretended to have heard nothing and entered the tent   110.94686881623926
such a beautiful woman   66.71285703436979
i content myself with saying command monseigneur   113.35725660762662
gasped danglars so be it   96.79194241440736
otherwise you would know that since we left paris monsieur le cardinal has returned thither five or six times   75.2373103296542
go sire not that you incur any risk for your adversary is powerful enough to show you mercy but because it would be humiliating for a grandson of saint louis to owe his life to the man of arcola marengo austerlitz   18.018160724552544
to this cavalcanti replied by saying that for some time past his son had lived independently of him that he had his own horses and carriages and that not having come together it would not be difficult for them to leave separately   139.9304186714686
it is magnificent continued beauchamp to be able to exercise so much self control   96.99525663186995
bazin scratched at the door and as aramis had no longer any reason to exclude him he bade him come in   146.568279276601
when he saw luigi he put his horse into a gallop and advanced toward him   41.69714155785631
would you pass in his eyes for a prophet   82.29642688189418
it is i said d artagnan in a subdued voice i the comte de wardes   108.5472530814841
if grimaud was slow in speaking we know that he was quick to act   117.58428682646833
i began to fear that he would not come   147.75982996902326
the sum was collected in a minute   61.24541886365404
and therefore marie came seeking hospitality from the guest of the good abbé and not from the good abbé himself   88.87821955785728
mousqueton remained glued to the door awaiting the explanation of this strange occurrence   111.85990466142401
no one could be seen or heard   144.70991622042249
i like men of head and heart   117.67355304835588
this was what vampa longed for   65.047271450826
de saint méran s house   121.04631629332192
some highlanders were listlessly keeping watch   178.7444885797463
and let us admit it the involuntary sentiment which she felt for her young protector decided her to speak   69.63209109645473
certainly madame you appear to extenuate some cases and exaggerate others   197.90357529384005
he went toward the door and opened it hastily   86.18957297259786
there is half past ten striking albert   113.68176087338217
under cover of the mea culpa striking her breast so vigorously that everybody even the lady with the red cushion turned round toward her   39.48596040116108
it concerns the best interests of your father said the messenger   91.59819836450721
danglars was quite annoyed by the young man s indifference   97.99303814465081
do you think then madame replied felton in the same serious voice but with a milder tone do you think i assume the right of preventing a creature from prostrating herself before her creator   69.77542525321
my dear love pray do not say any more about them and i promise you another pair exactly like them in appearance only more quiet and steady   10.966903155068593
sometimes killed but sure in that case to be both wept and avenged   112.49212026275706
well said milady for you i will wait   98.31086045002995
cried d artagnan taking the man for a thief and seizing his sword   130.33693044407178
well just as you like my prince   160.19445419223894
she was very plainly dressed as would be the case with a woman of taste walking in the morning   97.80136628858395
you have an answer ready for everything replied the queen and she took from her bureau a document which she filled up and signed   94.54751522840225
i desire to go to thirsk   145.06793956165754
thin and lanky   139.1736211065357
where she was known as la belle provençale   110.60272112539732
it was high time for her to make her appearance at the gate for maximilian had long awaited her coming   179.3517789276279
well we must wait   62.49355371061632
but grimaud s ingenuity was more prolific than his speech and therefore at the first halt he sold his steed and with the money obtained from the purchase took post horses   64.42985483358848
but what the devil   116.53839824692892
it is their business to judge and they shall judge   87.2328366417676
what king   133.5802875413117
i thought she loved me well enough to wait for me and even to remain faithful to my memory   113.23430924942093
there had been no stipulation in her favor   89.29677656562565
to see this woman so beautiful fair as the brightest vision to see her by turns overcome with grief and threatening   107.8235418359251
and popular proverbs contain sometimes a wonderful amount of truth   72.56292722909251
tell him i will come when i leave my dear grandmamma she replied feeling with true delicacy that the person to whom she could be of the most service just then was madame de saint méran   26.759124664005256
with the entrance of m   89.43657738763248
fortunately lord de winter is rich   137.16072785888917
he now arose his head bowed beneath the weight of grief and shaking his damp dishevelled hair he who had never felt compassion for anyone determined to seek his father that he might have someone to whom he could relate his misfortunes someone by whose side he might weep   80.6058821443335
only he was engaged with someone and begged danglars to wait for a moment in the drawing room   206.95159091024388
i called the valet i stopped the postilion i spoke to m   160.07099946085097
it appeared to the young man that the guards on seeing him depart chuckled among themselves   144.31472332947826
nothing more is wanting than to arrest the count as a vagabond on the pretext of his being too rich   106.64852589735654
and he made the same friendly salute as d artagnan   114.18158133172743
villefort s only answer was a stifled groan   147.39380434562943
madame cried the cardinal seizing hold of anne and drawing her back madame what are you about   220.2753123411141
he called porthos to look at it   222.08200107987358
the middle one   91.54300129301518
40179m you think then all is not over yet   83.70104724185686
he heard her ascend the little staircase which led both to madame de villefort s apartments and to hers   53.58346931693373
after finishing that calculation i had a minute s hope   69.99879112089829
oh i will be a match for you   82.19478301736854
hem replied d artagnan   169.7854597753672
as luigi spoke thus he left her   65.70930431835171
i am young and strong   86.75432524633938
he is an old friend of mine who has plundered me pretty well already and in the hope of making more out of me he will take a less price than the one i offer you   57.04891029498126
oh said madame de villefort smiling are you courageous enough to sit down upon the very seat perhaps upon which the crime was committed   26.146819179596648
the dinner chapter 64   117.66288235683382
bazin perceived he was wrong   71.08228014124569
porthos sighed for the fifth time d artagnan had counted his sighs   93.04388054232987
noirtier is quite evident to me and i can quite easily connect the train of ideas passing in his mind   137.02430973783308
the next day kitty went to see the young man again and related to him all that had passed on the preceding evening   175.8784363777679
it would have been too absurd to offer him in exchange for his excellent table the very inferior one of signor pastrini   138.65350777408707
a little better sir   57.60512898181025
athos had dropped some words which proved that the conversation she had with the cardinal had fallen into outside ears   141.85929606490456
he had still a nose but his cheeks fattened out each took a portion of it unto themselves   138.41338051068627
and all these skins were strewn in profusion one on the other so that it seemed like walking over the most mossy turf or reclining on the most luxurious bed   136.23869537397584
i shall faint again   50.3288392337138
laporte said the queen it is time for his majesty to go to bed   118.9572075612474
once in service i shall be rich once in m   109.20421403038546
nature has made us thus   153.09797962805774
in his youth d artagnan had often headed the bourgeoisie against the military but he was cured of all those hot headed propensities   41.547156282944016
on the contrary there is not an hour we have passed together that is not present to my memory   155.05006535168917
i do not think he is   81.88470195309091
in fact he did not notice the offered hand   58.268369498798585
said the light horseman   15.421250896260034
replied the young man   146.49042325841387
they don t yet know sir on account of the swelling   126.69926430715029
when the cardinal was out of hearing and sight that grimaud kept bad watch   69.94129462862638
and yet without the man the king would have been rescued   167.15395617280518
but i doubt if it be his real name   64.04511916038163
cried anne of austria with an accent of terror which proved how much greater an interest she took in the duke than she ventured to tell   71.96438330016622
the count advanced accompanied by maximilian and emmanuel   162.93360974527704
he was stout had a short thick neck   108.22569575859225
ah i knew her   125.13001243494655
oh said milady raising herself i defy you to find any tribunal which pronounced that infamous sentence against me   116.46973368122289
when at the shout in the name of the king an officer ran up and seeing the uniforms ill treated he sprang into the scuffle sword in hand and brought unexpected help to the guards   181.3948664075865
while the count picked up the paper he put spurs to his horse which leaped in astonishment at such an unusual stimulus and shot away with the rapidity of an arrow   81.93150129754662
i always have one ready day and night   128.4784293934404
the queen s eyes followed the retreating figures and when the last had closed the door she turned away   67.55093061579575
did he allude to his hope of being captain   193.47438487274513
up sire   152.30391825956968
no i don t want your help watch the cardinal   164.04501867197274
yet in spite of all this seduction milady might fail for felton was forewarned and that against the least chance   201.34235948363977
chapter lxvii   279.09615270282995
but without fail   129.52408516236449
my dear athos we are enveloped in a network of spies   15.246796749346501
d artagnan returned and again attacked him   114.98557244639392
you shall relate them to me my child   47.26538837701662
i hoped in silence   148.27316026598385
the superior met her   111.3192822676389
upon my word said she it is very droll and that mad marie michon fared better than she expected   201.733515191349
shall you be present in the reception room   133.92212590010584
the other day a banker s clerk brought him fifty thousand francs in a portfolio about the size of your plate   118.50849999138651
the dull driver smoking his pipe was plodding along toward the limits of the faubourg saint denis where no doubt he ordinarily had his station   142.14279360448745
he pushed through the crowd approached athos still insensible and as all this noise and commotion inconvenienced him greatly he required as the first and most urgent thing that the musketeer should be carried into an adjoining chamber   53.091923632532975
but where did he find it   118.50722037068682
then the young man tremblingly comprehended what a terrible thirst for vengeance urged this woman on to destroy him as well as all who loved him and how well she must be acquainted with the affairs of the court since she had discovered all   131.8555878564877
there still remained planchet s horse   124.37772328719531
have you seen the cardinal   135.1489059399401
friquet seeing this fine officer thus walk away followed by two guards amused himself by pursuing them and did this so much the more gladly as the ceremony ended at that instant and the king remounted his carriage   111.16431327348512
and when did you arrive here   105.79204183447408
de villefort when shall i see you again   92.93967914250887
cried he briskly   116.80324471786294
my friend exclaimed monte cristo in a tone of exquisite sweetness   70.45358089687872
the lovely venetian is it not   113.81913231330874
caderousse looked at the young man as if to get at the truth from the bottom of his heart   7.572209973651923
a physician a physician m   90.2211848367246
i shall no longer attempt my life   119.28424933184311
if you loved me you would view all this otherwise   108.53915286338763
is that all you want   103.04057906059562
renée was with all the rest of the company anxiously awaiting him and his entrance was followed by a general exclamation   127.15514849412058
it does replied the abbé   89.87046119674083
but really my dear count we are talking as much of women as they do of us   66.02779940163245
suppose mine had had the glanders or the farcy   166.7673524716415
everything will be forgotten madame said villefort   80.6579788245722
on the landing they were no longer fighting but amused themselves with stories about women and in the antechamber with stories about the court   204.95858848681127
and you what will you become   120.40481830103522
he s now a citizen of paris   117.42780096809203
each of these mobs was led by a chief one of whom appeared to belong not to the people but to the honorable corporation of mendicants and the other notwithstanding his affected imitation of the people might easily be discerned to be a gentleman   68.13608049903675
a quarter of an hour afterward the rowboat of this craft took them all aboard   136.07034243702964
i promise you that to make up for her want of loyalty i will be most inflexibly severe   103.52367152291387
athos merely glanced at it   141.5103696765102
come ease me of my anxiety or else frighten me at once   99.97889861192786
in what can i have offended her i who ever since i have known her have lived at her feet like a slave   93.84450148176532
planchet was more courageous it must be admitted by day than by night   117.65191790092379
franz was about to ring for signor pastrini when that worthy presented himself   124.54977269666698
no monsieur be satisfied   134.29875732020892
milady became as pale as the sheets in which she was lying and mistress as she was of herself could not help uttering a cry seizing the hand of the novice and devouring her with looks   152.1585938752996
and in five minutes they stopped before the count s door   6.125128058864249
you are thus deprived of seeing a man guillotined   119.68557044310802
and that being led to the scaffold he had been saved by an indignant people   146.03729963619378
the queen bent over him and kissed his brow   148.98448457150906
and i shall satisfy myself with referring such of my readers as appreciate the pictures of the period to its pages   118.98625946774388
she had only one day left   79.75022246935859
cried the countess how terrible a vengeance for a fault which fatality made me commit   141.9765253252964
when the buzzing murmur of the antechamber to which the summons which had been made had doubtless furnished fresh food had recommenced   109.09808962702043
we have not thought about it yet madame answered d artagnan with that gascon effrontery which had in him the appearance of naivete   52.3257929903799
i searched ransacked counted calculated a thousand and a thousand times the income and expenditure of the family for three hundred years   177.30168766484425
i promise it   77.19106021230633
sire resumed tréville as i told you monsieur d artagnan is little more than a boy   159.32314095198143
when he had run over all these names in his memory again read and studied them commenting meanwhile upon his lists he shook his head   111.32779450847637
how much did it cost you   141.69252033360402
my faith my dear aramis said d artagnan who detested verses almost as much as he did latin add to the merit of the difficulty that of the brevity and you are sure that your poem will at least have two merits   102.10097233722668
he soon saw that the vessel with the wind dead ahead was tacking between the château d if and the tower of planier   82.9282529529318
see that you forget nothing said athos appearing to look about him that he might hide his emotion   175.39443978611985
that he had never spoken to the one or the other   130.3008046489482
the duke saw that he had not controlled himself as he ought but at that moment as if he had listened at the door and comprehended the urgent need of diverting la ramee s ideas grimaud entered and made a sign to la ramee that he had something to say to him   92.04137888135145
they played and i won   118.82259913927308
but you first came to breakfast did you not   106.31421331545255
but it is not the less true that that letter and planchet retired shaking his head with an air of doubt which the liberality of d artagnan had not entirely effaced   99.08515473352216
don t ask me for counsel   46.72084351442503
draw out one of the feet that support the bed   152.8824732530337
athos fell on his knees and remained some minutes as if bewildered or stunned   113.03408003575056
i had him put into a leaden coffin and i am preceding him by a few days   64.7899444771317
but as villefort saw his father but seldom and then only when absolutely obliged and as he never took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there all the old man s happiness was centred in his granddaughter   93.88578794451513
that is useless   156.06886512658394
that he has there met de beaufort de bouillon the coadjutor and d elbeuf and that not one of them had any desire to arrest him   160.42022892530593
and i also said aramis   63.46693054100096
ah i know the way you get good sweetened rum over there   215.65376768640726
villefort s conduct therefore upon reflection appeared to the baroness as if shaped for their mutual advantage   75.57049548682227
i was really happy   154.22990812227383
a second smile almost imperceptible stole over the rosy lips of the pretty young woman   120.99477839698656
and so at last old dantès was left all to himself and i only saw from time to time strangers go up to him and come down again with some bundle they tried to hide   96.69708298696662
and how so if you please   89.09869767492626
and he gave his arm to his old comrade whose eyes were full of tears nor could grimaud tell whether the tears were caused by wounds or by the pleasure of seeing him again   90.28245441792846
my throat is closing up   217.23542655746965
and the procureur breathed more freely than he had done for some time   72.45623797016667
chapter iv   109.78333104454195
there s one just arrived and she handed the letter to d artagnan   98.32107464810824
they did you not see what they did   175.5183987471324
i now remember having had the honor of meeting you   149.28201165223302
there was a moment s silence during which the noise of the banker s pen was alone heard while monte cristo examined the gilt mouldings on the ceiling   94.62138858885329
he told me that he was anxious to restore you to the position which you had lost and that he would seek your father until he found him   117.85638683511247
does it belong to the smaller or to the larger of the two   151.4922351763821
he only drank from the cask   128.2005174025946
he saw d artagnan and porthos enter with internal pleasure yet showed no joy in his countenance   134.99366315317837
that is it precisely signor aladdin   92.08527304786583
this belief was changed into certainty when franz saw the bouquet conspicuous by a circle of white camellias in the hand of a charming harlequin dressed in rose colored satin   151.261498802331
he reiterated   122.30263970605449
diffident in allowing the sarcastic aramis to perceive how strong were his paternal feelings   70.04226893598891
but alas i have heard it said that hearts inflamed by obstacles to their desire grew cold in time of security   70.5577746204403
i think he tasted them one day   120.82851939041221
i have seen him lose as much as two thousand pistoles laughing all the while till the tears rolled down   53.84167650573507
and i will send you back to your mass book master abbé   83.3001470991783
my brother continued she was not that my lord buckingham whom i saw on the jetty this evening as we arrived   166.4025947291085
by your father s tomb   79.16092143292707
a prisoner you will not recover your liberty through me   147.10436385949563
answered caderousse double locking the door   42.49743531535084
i depend upon you to escort me home   78.43427120464203
it was julie who uneasy herself had anticipated her mother   84.22236181636256
but there s his comrade   120.8676070301875
the minister bowed his head and while a deep color overspread his cheeks he stammered out by the telegraph sire   43.91500047785951
declare to belong to him alo   148.71999292880207
oh i ll answer for you said the gascon filling porthos s glass to the brim   124.0142085417607
but instantly hisses and yells stifled them remorselessly   112.81810446998666
upon my word said dantès you make me shudder   56.80402334744272
those who were acquainted soon formed into little groups   63.66217174086479
they are all the same price   158.74547287626493
owing to him   49.357585858576826
are they in danger of dying   149.9364309721289
and five minutes after i left without having heard one word that had passed   64.19738520921226
and only two windows looking toward the road one of which was in a pavilion parallel to that which aramis occupied the other belonging to aramis himself   87.26601644702185
what then would be the use of all i have suffered   150.8217709058829
i then wrote to the cardinal   185.14915332061776
my intention said mazarin is not that you go with a great following   100.11869156534138
it was not without foundation that a report of the king s intention to leave paris by night had been circulated   84.75172493052769
enter sir said he   38.97250890819505
yes it was a prison for i tried in vain to get out of it   167.84791532799662
d artagnan going to a distance to discover aramis   124.61404667918211
i am here   101.44201842585753
a fearful day when to day we find our friends   89.80976062726972
it however became necessary for one of them to break it first and as d artagnan appeared determined to leave that honor to his companion aramis said you see that i am returned to my fundamental ideas   160.1417248762308
no reverend sir   188.29287468600506
this is what the god in whom on your death bed you refuse to believe has done for you he gave you health strength regular employment even friends a life in fact which a man might enjoy with a calm conscience   105.36677338517023
raoul then approached them as athos had directed him to do   190.73866526552854
i faith said rochefort there s no great difference i think between a dead man and one who has been buried alive   145.1619170089907
i beg you to excuse me madame   40.081936492805454
and if he has taken off his mask i shall be able to see   124.26919742148932
for la rochelle   157.5997449064801
the four horsemen looked round them with astonishment for they sought vainly in their minds to know who this other person could be   170.04586168611718
no i have given up poetry except now and then to write a drinking song some gay sonnet or some innocent epigram   152.79385103969074
there is nothing to do but to send monsieur mazarin to the most distant frontier and to take care that he does not return even by that nor any other entrance into france   53.373382297317626
those bearing plumed hats and gold swords were stopped and made to cry long live broussel   106.94706738639763
how were you to blame in that affair   176.45417487164104
haydée smiled sorrowfully and shook her head   111.06357066947858
the two friends turned down the first street they came to   95.58325643042619
the queen made a curtsy less from etiquette than because her knees were sinking under her   119.25985748417612
well said d artagnan smiling at the misanthropy of athos which from any other person would have offended him i ride what i can get   178.19715154787622
boy see if the mule belonging to the monk is still in the stable   112.86472722472999
and you what will you do   184.26513291297545
i prefer going sir   192.1976901895805
he had a glimpse of objects as through a fog   129.4240474380473
you are puzzled by what you see here but one word will explain everything   90.55459488959207
you allow me to give you this title   122.46649289948996
oh you render me the happiest of men   79.87857519408891
here was an opportunity of making up for past disappointments   78.9758561718553
poor brute accustomed to be covered up and to have a stove in the stable the arabian finds himself unable to bear ten degrees of cold in arabia   70.42963883605549
she listened at eugénie s door and hearing no sound tried to enter but the bolts were in place   128.62113483610008
is it madame de morcerf who has displeased you   45.81913835220192
it is true you called her thus   2.264818597915209
one may be a jailer or a keeper and at the same time a good father and husband   62.37641343820917
the king sighed deeply   100.15099934415794
but athos   29.163505402632964
i can not help doubting answered danglars with his stupid smile   150.70465414399203
come what did she say   157.61333996657652
it was at the traitor s cross that lesser criminals were executed   139.38783942461146
this confirmed milady in her opinion that the abbess was rather royalist than cardinalist   99.53531502631542
and how long had you to take care of him   108.25717233495034
but what was their surprise after passing saint denis to hear that at saint germain people were singing and laughing and leading generally cheerful lives   142.91781992367726
the coadjutor   125.39104273464076
personally i do not know you   28.1291436843143
i sprang toward the table i seized a knife i placed it to my breast   100.93449999671464
if he still lives by all you hold most sacred do not abandon him   99.25852908006203
you do not understand   36.409875078365715
the sounds drew nearer   100.57010071179963
i swear not only that it shall never again be pointed at your breast but that in the bottom of my heart there will never in future be the slightest hostile sentiment   140.08546127460173
say when shall it be   96.81388121425698
you might have taken lord winter who tis said was your uncle prisoner but you preferred killing him   99.88877627174425
through the open door was visible a portion of the boudoir containing an upright piano and a blue satin couch   108.34288519836001
and in what part of auteuil do you reside   238.03092358579767
you have an account open with messrs   200.66433924555173
he could not speak   117.93896027737082
his friends who anxiously awaited him saw him returned with joy   135.85425630915765
i can not help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him that trick you were planning yesterday   102.18651571017219
in that case your mother would hold me in aversion and i do not at all wish that   103.53134846999318
was i not your second   161.9319561234977
d artagnan bent low and following the cardinal up the secret staircase soon found himself in the study whence they had first set out   155.41126606106533
you have only to descend by the private stairs and you will find me at the door   163.15942955631607
and more i repeat it with joy with triumph i have always found some proof of human perversity or error   31.504162532357668
you must perceive that in my quality of a husband this concerns me   170.6442832961763
then sire may i present him   208.2215826430915
yes it is i said the count whom a frightful contraction of the lips prevented from articulating freely   98.48160436100642
cried d artagnan they ll suppose us to be stronger than themselves as we re in pursuit   94.58175985836277
although the key was in the door the coadjutor knocked   25.169713924106816
but this second letter said athos you forget that   61.569638343421225
like the rats that one by one forsake the doomed ship even before the vessel weighs anchor so all the numerous clerks had by degrees deserted the office and the warehouse   79.84622659898534
tis well danglars tis well   116.11990521480884
it was evident that he had not slept   114.93998039965598
a sigh escaped from the mouth of mme   81.77388161559713
arrived at leghorn he repaired to the house of a jew a dealer in precious stones to whom he disposed of four of his smallest diamonds for five thousand francs each   135.27549436085172
you shall not call said felton throwing himself between the duke and the bell placed on a stand encrusted with silver   87.83698573014965
this was a man whose face the concierge himself had never seen for in the winter his chin was buried in one of the large red handkerchiefs worn by gentlemen s coachmen on a cold night and in the summer he made a point of always blowing his nose just as he approached the door   128.08876884202465
my brother met some emissaries of the cardinal in the uniform of musketeers   160.94210527565616
save me   148.94267512699224
they began to comprehend   13.167325787389956
thou liest subtile one said d artagnan to himself   167.22401956926134
merely his daughter   125.82992142273892
it was a lieutenant s commission in the musketeers   87.02499860592987
undid the order of the saint esprit which he wore to honor the two frenchmen who were with him and passed it around winter s neck who received on his knees this striking proof of his sovereign s confidence and friendship   104.90622393818873
for he had risen from his seat and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong upon his rival when mercédès smiling and graceful lifted up her lovely head and looked at them with her clear and bright eyes   192.70131754336165
what do you say sire   88.92312333173618
planchet said d artagnan i commit the corpse of this poor devil to your care   127.81010480714491
if you hear anything of monsieur voiture be so kind as to send me word to morrow   184.86943267058945
the love i have for you is very different from the love i had for my father   57.587457708853165
since i was a faithful servant my lord to cardinal richelieu during his life it stands to reason that now after his death i should serve you well in defiance of the whole world   18.285694768404568
villefort rose and ran towards his mother in law for it was she   150.85380254526333
germain i believe and they had appointed to meet at the carmes deschaux when they were disturbed by de jussac cahusac bicarat and two other guardsmen who certainly did not go there in such a numerous company without some ill intention against the edicts   108.90238761005988
but on the other hand you must promise me not to attempt your life before that time   167.0547894641279
this probability afforded him his first consolation   121.6646992984737
the young men then rose and bowing to the count quitted the room   101.28163849713803
are you quite decided albert   162.55842789139348
40092m no thank you i am thinking of other things besides breakfast just now   116.8910779563916
bourges is the capital of charles vii   60.98485561133604
captain gaumard recovered from his illness had returned from palma   129.70771203049242
her position in the count s establishment is not sufficiently understood   70.50450599408828
d artagnan had just passed the rue cassette and already perceived the door of his friend s house shaded by a mass of sycamores and clematis which formed a vast arch opposite the front of it when he perceived something like a shadow issuing from the rue servandoni   116.45668388115293
more than once an involuntary trembling seized them when called upon for some unexpected service   80.34073880456111
my plans require secrecy and would be jeopardized by a too extravagant equipment   46.028722551011896
jacopo will carry you to leghorn where monsieur noirtier awaits his granddaughter whom he wishes to bless before you lead her to the altar   85.9655815834717
because you do not love me madame   122.18840774288856
as soon as the earnest money was paid d artagnan took possession of his lodging and passed the remainder of the day in sewing onto his doublet and hose some ornamental braiding which his mother had taken off an almost new doublet of the elder m   55.59949867744844
they are contained in this box which you will not open until you are on the other side of the channel   52.278753137866595
what i say replied bonacieux is only that i may know whether i am delaying you   145.13453079914962
i fear i shall be forced to suspend payment   147.9627733701219
on intrigues from intriguers   113.26292504883959
well here we are at last said one of them   140.5617094916374
tell me then   51.70847423318026
while the third an old sailor at once the pilot and captain looked on with that egotistical pity men feel for a misfortune that they have escaped yesterday and which may overtake them tomorrow   140.6202339924967
is this all   5.838913183579649
nothing else   71.46332562499114
and you count have made this match   136.709242955722
this doctor has a niece continued aramis   71.76472240710493
all the artillery was ready to move and started off at a moment s notice   50.627191795157195
there will be no necessity for me to make a note of these particulars for there before my eyes beneath my feet all around me i have the plan sketched with all the living reality of truth   135.38861216264294
barrois acknowledged no master but noirtier and never allowed his desires in any way to be contradicted   74.63137291007317
it was evident that he had attempted to regain his bed but had not had sufficient strength to do so   132.89619077498986
athos has made me see that s all   90.68694166328609
the queen remained for a short time to receive the compliments of the city dignitaries and to reply to the salutations of the ladies   116.79356159858183
porthos pretended to be confused   117.60703140220001
they would have carried him to greenwich he said and put him on board a felucca with five barrels of powder in the hold   87.9324627155379
the harlequin had reassumed her peasant s costume and as she passed she raised her mask   64.62783382299342
my very self dear friend   150.79335626739618
0147m who could know that i was here already   139.86541723633124
the time for wine came   167.0423467291595
de saint méran with you   150.23202397250247
apropos said d artagnan loud enough for the servant to hear him are you satisfied with olivain   66.79609695155654
a signed statement noirtier was prepared to receive them dressed in black and installed in his armchair   121.15491269402874
then wretched creature then you tempted god a third time   157.22674752982994
every kind of revenge was practiced upon the duke by the governor in return for the insults of the innocent pistache   109.02793333524411
it was easy to see that olivain had not been taught in the school of the planchets and the grimauds   90.72670266125002
she cried never   136.22111163675103
danglars has left suspiciously   138.3808516131438
him i can place at your disposal   161.07649364922622
but now we are alone although it is immaterial to me where are we going   108.53961011942035
his name tell it me   84.07151722313917
otherwise you see although i am sure that general oliver cromwell can intend them no harm it would have a bad appearance   72.71324056478647
danglars signature the next morning dawned dull and cloudy   191.94348315300613
then the trampling of horses and the clashing of steel were heard   134.4051101585678
well what of that   68.0861876259107
you have received a regular letter of advice   187.71116387921842
it is easy to perceive that you come from a distance   70.09321281275317
coquenard who knew that a simple minded procurator was a very rare variety in the species smiled a little and colored a great deal   55.89803696116971
morrel said not a word   88.73784720106131
what the devil can you do with all that   140.9035848660301
he had to collect the documents he had long been preparing against this storm which his sagacity had foreseen   139.83287503484792
for you and your comrades   105.11297084144365
this plan succeeded   123.2993894153949
half an hour had passed when the carriage stopped suddenly   6.572810641085368
well returned mazarin we will satisfy you   88.3271968423739
and though i do not much rely upon his promise i wish to be punctual   81.46235990275844
besides they have erected a triumphal arch for me to enter my barony which will kill my neighbors with envy   133.65580321546773
we are going to fetch our brevets said d artagnan and when we come back master mazarin will sign them   77.91514500511195
at this moment laporte reappeared   76.11855919498142
the council of the musketeers as athos had foreseen the bastion was only occupied by a dozen corpses french and rochellais   116.85844683313154
thus the future father and son in law stepped into the same carriage and morrel seeing them pass became uneasy   89.58445570503832
whilst they spurred their steeds they held their pistols ready also   101.43298838864948
well in a quarter of an hour he shall be with you   37.72158328945092
yes monsieur it is here he lives the servant replied to planchet who was not in livery   123.68930128376408
he has a lieutenant and that lieutenant is monsieur mordaunt   65.7714035024195
because over this king watched the spirit of another man even as this lamp keeps vigil over this coffin and illumines it   204.91684148137006
we shall find her still in the despairing attitude in which we left her plunged in an abyss of dismal reflection a dark hell at the gate of which she has almost left hope behind because for the first time she doubts for the first time she fears   60.683272195124545
does he regret me a little   80.0288382766945
try and find a seat there is one by that geranium which is the only thing in the room to remind me that there are other leaves in the world besides leaves of paper   118.54987109326599
not too much so replied d artagnan with a bow that was not deficient in dignity since you do me the honor to draw a sword with me while suffering from a wound which is very inconvenient   125.8698247472002
franz gave him albert s letter   121.64245904589133
oh the great man   127.2981299149152
still the expression of her eyes seemed to inquire if your intentions are pure why are you here   107.14717993466517
porthos bowed as if in assent   51.22512632816718
it had been d artagnan s practice ever since the riots to sleep in the same room as porthos and on this eventful morning he was still there sleeping and dreaming that a yellow cloud had overspread the sky and was raining gold pieces into his hat which he held out till it was overflowing with pistoles   162.9883409079877
but i require a strong mind to smile on my last moments   61.429370741689254
in the bastile   108.38427649413296
i have lighted it   60.18689255385629
his orders were executed and the following evening he received these details the abbé who was in paris only for a month inhabited a small two storied house behind saint sulpice   134.22644910313863
as soon as ever the king comes of age he will issue his commands himself and tis far pleasanter to obey the grandson of henry iv   21.653194534292254
he asked what was going on   71.8784679855014
we did not see his companion come out   101.87122216652361
the concert must be a delightful one   80.92018839320198
the damp had rendered it friable and dantès was able to break it off in small morsels it is true but at the end of half an hour he had scraped off a handful   63.92651135895517
the italian opera is in london   125.7905158463932
porthos looked very melancholy   150.77983487125778
he was taken at compiègne and all is over   70.80655890915439
pardon me then a fault which is perhaps great but which certainly was involuntary   61.981872763039824
nautilus   127.88567321363999
we must let the king know immediately   24.654950754079522
we mean the flight of eugénie and the arrest of andrea cavalcanti or rather benedetto together with the accusation of murder pronounced against him   152.56765858809672
the comte de wardes was announced and d artagnan was introduced   141.72118969108197
monte cristo approached and dropped on his purple lips three or four drops of the contents of the phial   80.04178168720188
but do you understand the mission you are fulfilling   91.7446153723811
every one was full of curiosity as to who that unknown executioner could be who presented himself so opportunely to assure to the people the promised spectacle when the people believed it had been postponed until the following day   99.90754208737792
phantoms are visible to those only who ought to see them   104.34397992537527
they tacked and kept offshore   237.48794242497564
on your side a solemn oath to remain neutral with respect to me   33.06440777424176
eh gentlemen let us reckon upon accidents   117.22845285432152
and all this because he had trusted to villefort s promise   82.01520379803006
endowed with a rare genius for intrigue which rendered him the equal of the ablest intriguers he remained an honest man   157.0331518312853
but said aramis shall we not be suspected by colonel harrison   93.6661386281244
and barrois turned towards noirtier who immovably fixed in his armchair was contemplating this terrible scene without allowing a word or a movement to escape him   121.60967739069734
poor dantès   146.36810710094196

d artagnan spared mazarin the trouble of insisting and after looking to see if the stone was the same and assuring himself of the purity of its water he took it and passed it on his finger with indescribable pleasure   142.57459923709231

never had the struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now and if it was not a sublime it was at least a curious spectacle   154.4194192479486
so serious that i must take leave of you for a few days   187.64797262468795
then emmanuel   193.78767283430665
he was not the less intoxicated with joy electrified by love   54.59919337836945
the arms of d artagnan fell powerless by his side   107.3859241198434
franz anticipated his wishes by saying that the noise fatigued him and that he should pass the next day in writing and looking over his journal   86.4694823309675
at the same time monte cristo s voice seemed to resound in his ear with the words he had heard only two hours before whatever you want morrel come to me   56.64850481839454
that your eminence will go at once to the queen   60.31451355450671

i shall therefore not visit either of these telegraphs but one in the open country where i shall find a good natured simpleton who knows no more than the machine he is employed to work   128.67956893610875
and remorse preys on me night and day   90.40265183295708
and how did he treat you   29.424926149390387

let me see your plan   72.1513187222566
madame danglars then concluded that the young girl had been overcome with the terrible excitement of the evening and had gone to bed and to sleep   85.38871889088219

andrea looked steadily at monte cristo and disappeared in the second drawing room   124.3075316164021
dessessart made him a sign to approach   115.22151989147946
a sublime action at all events for mousqueton looked upon himself as dead   87.68578901659973
there alone the corpses belonging to him would be surrounded by worthy associates   33.70813540706136
at the same instant aramis placed his sword point on the breast of his fallen enemy and forced him to ask for mercy   152.9326294206485
i am sure of it said athos   160.5566101483911
on the contrary we are all free agents   116.92960517145882
but after the death of valentine there has been no doubt in my mind madame and not only in mine but in those of others   55.27595968488187
shall i wait for you   169.84616273206663
a track of blood on the snow marked his course   17.525294672546764
and perhaps i may in my own person be able to prove to you how completely you are in error   119.86720787619768
so that said monte cristo you have lost nearly 1 700 000 francs this month   76.7055854107179
but said the officer i thought you were in his service and that it was he who sent you to general cromwell   111.61790653990009
it was perhaps some plot against you   78.70615487623851
but she that is another thing   79.7578957895841
i am an assassin then and not an officer of justice   53.19555098083603
oh the miserable wretches   159.20700808327746
now in the army from the division generals who desire the death of the general in chief to the soldiers who desire the death of the corporals all desire some one s death   209.23341444727095

buckingham gave d artagnan a chamber adjoining his own   118.33237939177788
at the sight of his friend porthos uttered a loud cry of joy   109.81163723338075
a significant silence followed these words and as the general did not reply close the doors said the president to the door keeper   115.86659533326285
juxon replied with a sign which meant that he knew no more than aramis about it   125.70600045067269
a second look was exchanged between athos and aramis   22.01432953079511

then she sobbed aloud   85.50364990769128
bazin was stupefied at the sight of the gold and forgot that he came to announce d artagnan who curious to know who the mendicant could be came to aramis on leaving athos   72.87581431515096
art thou dumb   115.2082509330762
saying which monte cristo bowed and disappeared behind the tapestry leaving the major fascinated beyond expression with the delightful reception which he had received at the hands of the count   73.639995491711
it was completely deserted   42.72302482675617

wait said athos   170.41599315126132
if a repast were on foot athos presided over it better than any other placing every guest exactly in the rank which his ancestors had earned for him or that he had made for himself   208.4384647827655
morrel shuddered and looked at the man who spoke with more assurance than he had hitherto shown   173.2991485039394

eugénie closed her eyes   114.99929081927603

it is indispensable my lord   76.62066447827507
he had no means of resistance   88.81354013055498
has anyone been speaking to you against me   134.244876835791
this will has already constituted haydée heiress of the rest of my fortune consisting of lands funds in england austria and holland furniture in my different palaces and houses and which without the twenty millions and the legacies to my servants may still amount to sixty millions   96.3874986648963
he took the arm of château renaud and turned towards the vault where the attendants had already placed the two coffins   44.26421698696163
we have arrested monsieur de beaufort but he is the least dangerous among them   121.71318375628397
the prince dismounted ordered one of his aids and raoul to follow his example and directed the others to await his orders keeping themselves meanwhile on the alert   82.96799854488292
not a step forward or you re dead men   104.60571035628375
and you say that you dug your way a distance of fifty feet to get here   124.84433973829621
friends are shadows   196.27964749279886
waiting for whom   98.82338037439294
i dreaded to become mad and forgetful   154.10136573829695
replied the old man   114.9868528149313
upon a look from the procurator accompanied by a smile from mme   73.55147046342208
well his love is half real half fanciful   162.9188021284338
yes i will take a biscuit as you are so obliging   100.31335299025245
tréville smiled   147.17975903868827
ah if i were but twenty years old   91.43464315069234
who rang   96.64470368451006
d aiguillon marion de lorme and several other gay women   146.04233210626154
as ten o clock was striking d artagnan left m   220.8730627735689
lead us grimaud   72.45193656207084
no mercédès said monte cristo no   137.16163990312396
but harrison paid not the least attention to him and entering the king s room followed by his companion charles stuart said he an order has come to conduct you to london without stopping day or night   122.16151982708054
in the stable   60.2769894597755
they had one and all deserted the accursed house   78.21076200493441
d artagnan overcoming his repugnance to mordaunt walked with him upon the deck and invented a hundred stories to make him talk   143.76525353398554
i hid myself in the one nearest to the path villefort must take and scarcely was i there when amidst the gusts of wind i fancied i heard groans   107.79317273518518
i am sir said the king much agitated   134.94614082760123
yes said the count you are right it is miraculous   86.05737495415967
her forehead almost touched the carpet when the count sprang forward and raised her   135.84378743738793
but their wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which dantès handled the helm   104.03242528789656
with the frenchman the man who had followed him entered too   63.747328246098334
he had spent every farthing that had been allowed for his journey as a reward for the majestic and solemn manner in which he had maintained his assumed character of father   65.84429632833303
i can not hope to be very fluent but i certainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes   123.82484254417275
he therefore informed m   84.04990924258728
haydée replied the count you know that you are now in france and are free   117.83183180407772
villefort pressed her hand to let her know it was not a dream   127.6103475793574
said the gentleman   82.3319309375139
the duty will be tolerably long and not very amusing i know   106.48276655483164
face long and brown   90.25644684285788
well monsieur de busigny i will bet you said athos that my three companions messieurs porthos aramis and d artagnan and myself will go and breakfast in the bastion st   130.39844076178287
exclaimed franz and the sailors in unison   64.2986939036663
don t forget to treat me harshly in speaking of me to the abbess   80.90863869667622
and you stopped there   173.7977636225352
that has naturally led me to love no one so much the better now you have my profession of faith   123.5146267374474
you have today acquired eternal rights to my gratitude   126.34490744861034
really he is by no means a light load   123.02054614502781
the sight of this officer recalled villefort from the third heaven to earth   113.95485265385918
or rather by instinct   106.43686776243533
felton quite bewildered almost mad stood speechless   45.66133504472421
you say you were on the point of being made captain of the pharaon   130.33328591958127
oh i am done with considering   194.64724727913602
it does not matter   75.59084138603552
inquired the marquise   136.3417812959068
i felt myself fall to the ground my mother had fainted   132.10242304496566
but as he did not think of giving this order till five hours after the event that is to say till two o clock in the afternoon two vessels had already left the port the one bearing as we know milady who already anticipating the event was further confirmed in that belief by seeing the black flag flying at the masthead of the admiral s ship   125.60578760120718
cried he pressing his lips to those of the prisoner   134.8852367501629
i have had ten or twelve sailors under me and if you question them they will tell you that they love and respect me not as a father for i am too young but as an elder brother   171.13514816538816
woman is weak monsieur cardinal said the king   163.86307284597626
but now suppose this poor comte de wardes were less guilty than you think him   142.5469347610599
then he took milady in his arms and set off briskly in the direction opposite to that which the patrol had taken   65.3032510856146
and a desire of vengeance disordered the features of milady which however immediately recovered the calm and benevolent expression which this woman of a hundred faces had for a moment allowed them to lose   54.77777550071147
ah ah said gondy you will undertake then some night to throw up some ten barricades   97.73701654867557
d estrées   93.83339382277622
do you know what that warning was   127.8983075101288
it was too soon for a visit from the examining magistrate and too late for one from the director of the prison or the doctor   56.536979390827284
very well you can retire m   7.297381247060784
where was she built   133.0633669396619
you mean to say you have been freed from confinement   119.925032306252
13 oh yes   197.594030736311
he was notwithstanding anxious to set out   102.480713738301
fight on all occasions   135.38799623914753
had dantès found nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale   40.42417738245112
i have acquired certain knowledge that that woman was concerned in the abduction of madame bonacieux   218.2521572677686
i admit that would reassure me greatly   66.28104388406123
come then   14.556426729269575
villefort seized the letter and hastily broke the seal   129.191510224678
suddenly he felt an arm thrown around his body and a well known voice behind him exclaimed father dear father   104.0650533484045
on the receipt of the count of monte cristo   77.05874913086951
a bed without curtains four armchairs and a couch covered with yellow utrecht velvet composed with a prie dieu all its furniture   72.14084185024879
the sheep will bleat for pleasure the ox will bellow with joy   117.41347216734634
the great man has called me his friend   128.15429295944534
as porthos and aramis were undressing him in the hope of finding his wound not mortal a large purse dropped from his clothes   100.66556958173074
danglars left last night   117.08442984112214
the elder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation like that of all who have experienced many trials contained many useful and important hints as well as sound information   56.861016950053674
we became orphans i at five he at eighteen   123.36963600556365
you have given me gold   176.93346514145702
to night we stop at derby   152.63512158226595
but you must really permit me to congratulate you on the ease and unconcern with which you resigned yourself to your fate and the perfect indifference you manifested as to the turn events might take   45.29939176987111
edmond related to me everything until the moment when he was arrested in a small cabaret close to marseilles   157.25569201215313
bertuccio interrupted the count   86.72961858260805
i heard no other noise but the beating of my own heart   59.53892007245802
true the young man had warmly and energetically thanked the count on the previous evening   84.38277768217975
suddenly he felt the fresh and sharp night air and dantès knew that the mistral was blowing   51.49442043599444
there s no use in thinking any more about athos   105.80987140735215
wait here ten minutes said m   154.82638014029573
at seven o clock in the morning he arose and called planchet who at the second summons opened the door his countenance not yet quite freed from the anxiety of the preceding night   118.36401853492559
we were in the palace of yanina   183.92179376409348
it was indeed peppino who was preparing to mount guard as comfortably as possible by seating himself opposite to the door and placing between his legs an earthen pan containing chick peas stewed with bacon   147.80409059699065
sir said planchet when he saw d artagnan on the summit of the ladder this way is easy for monsieur aramis and even for you   76.74763327082505
no my daughter is not guilty   151.25213509541612
the nobles and ladies of their majesties suites were to dress two by two in chambers prepared for the purpose   129.26986520521888
all four besides immediately broke off their conversation   232.3700183547578
d artagnan did not reflect that he had only known the mercer s pretty wife for three hours   126.19063437793085
art thou sure   104.74920230301402
cried aramis do you see count   196.69389182779568
louis de bourbon prince de condé who since the death of his father henri de bourbon was called in accordance with the custom of that period monsieur le prince was a young man not more than twenty six or twenty seven years old with the eye of an eagle agl occhi grifani as dante says aquiline nose long waving hair of medium height well formed possessed of all the qualities essential to the successful soldier that is to say the rapid glance quick decision fabulous courage   176.54908101040797
the musketeers set off and d artagnan was left alone with raoul   83.92388050770411
this evening the margin of possible delay expires   86.87013858021862
said d artagnan affecting surprise   157.12519921562298
cried d artagnan is the poor fellow worse then   80.20376351215924
do not disturb yourself do not disturb yourself   45.88581416631642
very well take blaisois with whom i know not what to do since i already have grimaud   125.906017774886
said the abbé turning towards dantès and surveying him with the kindling gaze of a prophet you are young you will see all this come to pass   138.7475294786288
comminges turned and saw dame nanette her eyes flashing with anger and a broom in her hand   156.71005015213518
the accusation comes from monsieur de la trémouille from the duke himself   166.28660988663736
what do you fear vasiliki   127.20822022572197
i love her   132.3372220563693
everyone knows that drunkards and lovers have a protecting deity   117.60235214683287
yes said the man who could scarcely believe in such magnanimity but is it not to have me hanged   92.87059375522377
i hear a horse s steps   185.7056565426587
well replied athos i am not far from approving the idea of monsieur porthos   40.325459062012555
sell the crown diamonds   89.81732341118901
if i should not be in wait for me   99.7539078939169
the pharaon has gone down then   155.0295674211299
the cardinal was lavish to his underlings   93.76782495723077
they might have remained much longer lost in one another without anyone noticing their abstraction   94.137019116927
once in london we shall be hard to find without considering continued athos throwing a glance at aramis the chances that may come to us on the way   149.894825599618
meantime the three friends were standing motionless before the awful sight which d artagnan in raising the shutters had disclosed to them through the narrow opening of the window   125.60675551997365
yes my child   178.0366611391184
athos sprang up but after an instant of motionless silence he said to the astonishment of his friends monsieur mordaunt a duel between us is impossible   121.89861770275209
they saw my mother in law their former regent expelled by the cardinal   136.32270638524682
this beam crossed or rather blocked up the hole dantès had made   116.40342584844183
de villefort would be obliged to pass by one of these clumps of trees   151.22143666504718
he must have been prevented by monsieur de tréville or monsieur dessessart   81.3047153937676
and d artagnan poured out a glass of wine   130.77065929849942
or the mysterious benefactress said athos   103.93077485861302
and how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work   159.13648962855626
and you another order for i see you have a blue ribbon at your button hole   46.00504523800748
he filled two glasses and by a sign invited d artagnan to drink   186.82117367542787
to you as the king s attorney i denounce mademoiselle de villefort do your duty   173.48106555547008
but if there be any letter he will give it to me   140.21524001880502
a crowd of masks flowed in from all sides emerging from the doors descending from the windows   140.6613009188394
i am come to talk to you about a thousand things   73.10181635697454
the young man fled while she was still threatening him with an impotent gesture   115.5415554777365
they saw or rather continued to see the image of what they had witnessed   136.22152319366404
said andrea do you want anything more   116.22799872705126
the old man was attired in a suit of glistening watered silk trimmed with steel buttons beautifully cut and polished   50.09380039863584
the count extended his hand towards the library   82.4960956123588
did he mention my name   119.06290366177265
and then followed a dream of passion like that promised by the prophet to the elect   78.53585255031852
of glorious memory who was the king of the gascons as his majesty philip iv   111.23417262067272
do you authorize mademoiselle valentine to intrust herself to my honor   171.13724865450754
she who mistaking you for the cardinal s guards has just fled away   118.97864322653525
but he repented of it   74.10670270013927
it is one of the best houses in europe said danglars carelessly throwing down the receipt on his desk   97.8632540522565
but he was not sufficiently broken into the fashions of the gay world to know how to extricate himself gallantly from a false position like that of a man who begins to mingle with people he is scarcely acquainted with and in a conversation that does not concern him   108.62822046564688
i saw her this morning and bade her adieu   86.29297670621698
with the enmity of the government   117.47671148213499
you are the queen   129.8316528653122
bonacieux saw that he hesitated   98.25895799739664
have you come to sup with me   134.74075353074696
do you remember your father haydée   88.52452165118571
has anything particular happened in the neighborhood   113.6490847437609
planchet followed the movements of his master as if he had been his shadow and was soon trotting by his side   46.491030554791095
at two o clock the tennis balls began according to grimaud s directions to take the direction of the moat much to the joy of la ramee who marked fifteen whenever the duke sent a ball into the moat   126.35341010801802
i have but little influence now but all that i have shall most assuredly be his   167.30106560091795
the table at which the puritan officers were seated was round and whether by chance or coarse intention harrison sat with his back to the king   121.20860228652195
the drawing room was lighted up they went in there   116.43176951944552
the count went to his secrétaire opened it and pulling out a drawer filled with gold said to franz i hope you will not offend me by applying to anyone but myself   60.238319406395306
and the prisoner he continued aloud was he ever heard of afterwards   182.1131333772257
i recollect now said the officer in a jeering tone   84.21284330334106
now let me tell you some news   114.3804277782567
because it is for victors to make conditions and you are not yet victors gentlemen   129.50960281429064
no happily that unjust prejudice is forgotten which made the son responsible for the father s actions   146.2915935225891
nevertheless day dawned without darkness having brought any accident   57.73707109812435
did you know me better returned the count smiling you would not give one thought of such a thing for a traveller like myself who has successively lived on macaroni at naples polenta at milan olla podrida at valencia pilau at constantinople curry in india and swallows nests in china   136.07351500908462
it was only to fight as an amateur   136.40117701551645
our house transacts business to the amount of a million a year from which we derive an income of 40 000 francs   60.78616995895791
and albert rising kissed his mother on both cheeks then stood looking at her   116.60800870745747
debray mechanically stopped and looked at the baroness whose face became covered with blushes   106.5028783056427
oh make yourself easy on that head replied aramis   149.0152451375222
bring me a million such as that said danglars i shall be well pleased putting the draft in his pocket   150.47725444264938
it is only a question of how much shall be charged for them   108.97653004021683
you are then some secret implacable and mortal enemy   144.72470393431664
your horses are ready saddled in their stables are they not   99.45675535492327
one may readily conceive that during these jokes which were intended chiefly to divert athos from the scene which had just taken place the servants with the exception of grimaud were not silent   87.71598278673267
a man who accustoms himself to live in such a world of poetry and imagination must find far too little excitement in a common every day sort of attachment such as ours   126.79627932839082
the mere sound of it filled them with terror   123.53469206879863
mercédès opened the door of the study and had disappeared before he had recovered from the painful and profound reverie into which his thwarted vengeance had plunged him   168.38151027618972
you will find a horse in the stables quite as good as this   113.7999986574995
that is to say that the fault lay with my people and that i was ready to offer you my excuses   122.95189418261016
but when the saddle and arms for grimaud were purchased athos had not a sou left of his hundred and fifty pistoles   159.80955846821013
oh i am very presuming i am aware   44.609285605340546
you can not guess said he what there is in that small vase can you   79.80672984971335
yes it is an extraordinary story said beauchamp   100.06585884127625
was he to be carried back by the wind which had blown him there   13.42850101917358
if it were so answered athos we should not be taken there by lord de winter for he would come in for his share   134.26634038304803
this idea imparted new energy and in three days he had succeeded with the utmost precaution in removing the cement and exposing the stone work   106.03419177567025
certainly neither i nor fernand said danglars rising and looking at the young man who still remained seated but whose eye was fixed on the denunciatory sheet of paper flung into the corner   131.07657009286416
none of her women accompanied her   203.05281121705207
sire said the cardinal leave severity to your ministers   130.9826014895765
the spit turned the stove roared the pretty madeleine wept   137.28957842951073
athos and aramis exchanged smiles   15.366287014937868
but his person was so admirably shaped and so well proportioned that more than once in his struggles with porthos he had overcome the giant whose physical strength was proverbial among the musketeers   108.31196332843483
madame de morcerf had lived there since leaving her house   21.784939311051502
the general remembered that i had formerly been a naval officer and he gave me the command of this expedition   44.196069614278144
she did not know what might take place during this night which approached so menacingly for large masses of cloud rolled over the face of the sky and distant lightning announced a storm   74.96705435377422
i recognized him when the wind blew upon his cloak   99.10364523715239
or perhaps you guessed that he was here   121.10174576271385
you are a jewel of a man mr   119.46216911068417
de villefort if you do not strike first   153.98062445880078

danglars observed a man in a cloak galloping at the right hand of the carriage   87.00611788924896
every one grows childish in prison but the character of monsieur de beaufort was particularly disposed to become so   69.66365018094712

asked aramis laughing   166.58319082627634
those idiots   94.92567287693146
at this moment a monstrous battering was heard   62.23480689703573
villefort forced a laugh   114.54854171311744
you will not accept my gold   108.64306558666891

the three friends looked on panting and astonished   97.05750730035842
and madame de villefort found on their return that the count of monte cristo who had come to visit them in their absence had been ushered into the drawing room and was still awaiting them there   186.05309834583556
besides kitty will tell nothing   179.80130103956262
the wind was chilly and the jetty was deserted as he approached it   88.37182655340492
but ere he had gone many steps he heard the man loudly calling him to stop   97.92936625510454
franz looked up they were opposite the rospoli palace   226.1644394433014

i took the wall you are mining for the outer wall of the fortress   25.23705129748444
among these thousands moved in bands numbering from one hundred to two hundred pale and haggard men clothed in rags who bore a sort of standard on which was inscribed these words behold the misery of the people   122.39021136975413
but scarcely had he departed when he turned and clasped porthos in his arms with an expression not to be doubted   156.27110447264243
his eminence then orders me said the lady   148.77835305028958
but he will never have the king   97.09336433332976

there was silence   201.93662094623758
let us choose a place of rendezvous continued athos and in a last interview arrange our mutual position and the conduct we are to maintain toward each other   164.98628886072308
and this very tool has sufficed me to hollow out the road by which i came hither a distance of about fifty feet   131.04089207401094

these words were uttered in so mournful a tone that their real meaning did not escape albert   106.81818464754579
then turning to mercédès he inquired who is this gentleman   98.20203047821151
the rock half open afforded a passage to the young man who disappeared like the evil spirits in the fairy tales   137.19597711418285

madame have pity on me exclaimed de winter   197.38448446123311
and faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to the young man who threw himself upon his neck and wept   190.97020864012353
well then that green preserve is nothing less than the ambrosia which hebe served at the table of jupiter   96.33165520892284
but he did not succeed and became too intoxicated to fetch any more drink and yet not so intoxicated as to forget what had happened   28.187154329915515
it was he who saved the life of your step mother and her son   11.73345320571218

the accident was set down to the account of robbers who had stopped the chaise in the wood   55.95664572680164

he had scarcely entered when he began to agitate his nose and his jaws after the example of his clerks   93.7499054630113
his eyes were fixed upon the little pavilion situated at the angle of the wall of which all the windows were closed with shutters except one on the first story   49.12545926792944
no athos no you are mistaken said d artagnan   90.19179391653071

if my musketeers are guilty sire the guilty shall be placed in your majesty s hands who will dispose of them at your good pleasure   18.2897736681861

and if it be necessary that like lucretia i should sign my accusation with my blood i will sign it   113.6120804098302
if such be the case my dear valentine you must yourself have felt or at all events will soon feel the effects of his presence   133.36243077037142
one last spur instead of making him advance made him fall   123.18447344282599
d artagnan regained the trench and threw the corpse beside the wounded man who was as pale as death   99.31253470713683

and that worthy monsieur du vallon are we not to enjoy his society   159.44845735170705
on my word said the inspector in a low tone had i not been told beforehand that this man was mad i should believe what he says   118.98761785806279
yes your majesty there is a title which i covet much replied scarron   103.49243463322946
au revoir albert   100.56355295149254
so saying madame de saint méran extended her dry bony hand to villefort who while imprinting a son in law s respectful salute on it looked at renée as much as to say i must try and fancy tis your dear hand i kiss as it should have been   185.8646280488342
but i told him i was only mate and that she belonged to the firm of morrel son   98.30524610662357
i do not think so   143.11677744051664

because replied franz you seem to me like a man who persecuted by society has a fearful account to settle with it   31.073335606297377
this child has caused me to recover what i had lost   107.5794694291374
and now gentlemen i repeat excuse me but on that account only and on guard   100.64518443095807
danglars looked radiant with joy   146.7602085780176
just as they were beginning in the english fashion to leave the spoons in their cups the door again opened and danglars entered visibly agitated   215.61413436346885
and i think you will be satisfied on that head   168.4922254330633
we have only lived up to the present time because we believed each other dead and because a remembrance is less oppressive than a living creature though a remembrance is sometimes devouring   105.84671153589935
danglars seeing that if he continued the conversation in the same tone in which he had begun it the whole thing might turn out to his own disadvantage turned to morcerf and said count you must doubtless be surprised at my reserve and i assure you it costs me much to act in such a manner towards you   126.78461364213246
taste this and the mines of peru guzerat and golconda are opened to you   75.53958225612976

what a proposition   106.40999263747867
the praise was well deserved for had not the count heard it from the baroness or by one of those means by which he knew everything the baron s countenance would not have led him to suspect it   24.782782341601177
and milady but obscurely perceived the means which could lead to this result   125.82086783007979
bring with you the whole army   120.21511539558517

i will look at it again   54.08452125970961
the cardinal exaggerated as i perceive   112.38232313948966
monte cristo opened the tortoise shell box which the lady presented to him and inhaled the odor of the lozenges with the air of an amateur who thoroughly appreciated their composition   110.20499157735344
the bible said aramis makes our belief in them a law   119.8349975314051
ali bring me some water   58.85589102024748
grumbled the cardinal   111.82897036371988
what must i do to attain such sublimity   155.8928197160147
do not my mother and you agree   89.55778686549884

we may say that he is not equal to his mother when we put foot in france if we are not poisoned or killed before then   76.50754908321207
what would his guards think if they heard him shout like a madman   128.6531563172155
she ran to the table emptied into mme   83.58392853629549
the retreat of rocca bianca was at the top of a small mountain which no doubt in former days had been a volcano an extinct volcano before the days when remus and romulus had deserted alba to come and found the city of rome   114.13452318276126
if i am killed well then mother you can also die and there will be an end of our misfortunes   99.94547745520062
and you are disposed to serve the cause of the people   130.7817638342024

at ten minutes to eight beauchamp arrived   90.30352502518356

that having a house to purchase you purchase it exactly at auteuil and that purchasing it at auteuil this house should be no   82.30299061292823
said d artagnan i see that although we have had the honor of traveling in your company you do not know us   59.777996948230125
asked mercédès   48.61246217258245
he had on his estates the rights of high and low tribunals   80.88597649513716
tis not good to be about just here without a light   94.05339522529363
fernand too is invited   82.13812540006978
i knew a person of that name at the court of the queen of etruria a noirtier who had been a girondin during the revolution   157.54900401670957
say rather crime   157.4513393469227
we must speculate upon the faults of people and not upon their virtues   140.72851592859692
and you were deceived my dear sir replied aramis coldly very little sensible to the reparation   77.82369479821963
with pleasure replied d artagnan   134.22104473761704
he called me by this name when he was in good humor   115.99665932555989
the two notaries looked at each other in mute astonishment and inquiry as to what were the real intentions of the testator   127.0566769593812

on entering his hôtel m   60.22253680533827
but keep it and we shall be quits   195.48131491851697
why should they not   140.56901281519205
do you not know me felton   138.32421876255646
the duke was obliged to make as many efforts to awake as he had done to go to sleep   132.13365086357612
recollect what our excellent father so often told us it was no englishman that thus saved us   3.0668264751337375
deeply engaged with a sort of inward contemplation valentine had ceased for a moment to join in the conversation   118.60804042945787
monsieur bertuccio meanwhile the count had arrived at his house   120.19406047509908
reunited   190.36436789481002
it fell naturally to the count de guiche to make reply   91.18304772630398
we will therefore leave the two friends who had nothing important to say to each other and follow aramis   92.95629725234001
with women perhaps   87.37297284557026
i can trust you you are a true frenchman   68.58789841990844
this can not be the establishment of athos   1.43646513519505
come now said the duke give some particulars of the plan for our escape   115.85630574604325
it was not you who introduced me into the world and had me invited to a certain dinner at auteuil which i fancy i am eating at this moment in company with the most distinguished people in paris amongst the rest with a certain procureur whose acquaintance i did very wrong not to cultivate for he would have been very useful to me just now   99.77107842607019
the storm will blow over more easily believe me   120.98164472764877
carlini besought his chief to make an exception in rita s favor as her father was rich and could pay a large ransom   72.44301502382632
was not your father a bonapartist   129.11249454556884
from my father   76.97920308148198
0313m two hours afterward dantès sailed from the port of genoa under the inspection of an immense crowd drawn together by curiosity to see the rich spanish nobleman who preferred managing his own yacht   148.72413700942627
as to the second reproach i have heard it said that she does not love the english but an englishman   128.33467496571348
on the contrary replied the count did you not hear her declare that we were friends   107.16104243772317
oh my dear viscount do talk reason   39.32510099576008
are you displeased with me   162.2328130519929
and follow me wherever i go   54.18969014670413
but the king took advantage of the privilege he had of leaving his lady to advance eagerly toward the queen   123.68067621002578
grimaud is it thou   183.04507892238144
it was a sensation in which pleasure and pain were strangely mingled   124.06654245478929
to morrow i plunge into an adventurous affair in which i may be killed   128.788206142917
you understand this do you not my most precious wife   192.29746600543757
cried the surrounding group   128.1507757452335
bonacieux became as pale as death and grinned a ghastly smile   159.9407321690063
the carriage started at a measured pace without betraying by the slightest sign that it contained people in a hurry   137.85547502334123
what i think of is that we have crossed swords as enemies   100.2398125556339
a glorious prize   110.39666246183849
everything is relative my dear young friend from the king who stands in the way of his successor to the employee who keeps his rival out of a place   111.89620285739835
the only thing i could not conquer was a strange trembling in my knees   106.16004043428867
valentine imperceptibly thanked him while two silent tears rolled down her cheeks   65.36594731892913
morrel unfortunately replied the count i am witness that m   83.70945805942304
is then all that i have heard really true   56.57112726048396
come and i will explain to you   130.1298907680424
poor cardinal   2.9450065627280964
we have said that athos loved d artagnan like a child and this somber and inflexible personage felt the anxiety of a parent for the young man   78.02989463532855
that however does not hinder me from being entirely devoted to his service as i am to that of your majesty   56.61520083792583
there are special reports on every prisoner   145.5088696313597
well what are you doing count to a former lackey   76.15191071675926
the ass   140.2064642765824
ah don t be angry i beg of you that would be useless   152.90092395624592
that will amuse you   53.78096367559276
and who told you this fine story sire   113.80172013864296
the deliverance of the cardinal perhaps   83.40571265560476
he bestowed the same attention upon the cambric front of a shirt which had considerably changed in color since his entrance into the prison and he polished his varnished boots with the corner of a handkerchief embroidered with initials surmounted by a coronet   83.73405223933466
we have promised and we will keep our promise   140.12624135169332
absorbed all the smaller stars of his court in his own vast radiance   117.10838216229214
d artagnan was profuse in gallant speeches and protestations of devotion   92.55868144119871
caderousse wrote the address   95.8822880431421
ah gentlemen you want battle   87.38258690367724
ah madame said monte cristo you should not talk thus   142.33903850700668
i had no hope of getting off so easily   81.13626662791822
this was the plan which had appealed to him to afford the best chance of his security   105.64877646562806
what will that cost you my dear monsieur mordaunt   162.76635249587324
so much the better for i must leave you   42.726709333468946
i must have left it in my room she said   118.96724778021058
that makes three weeks   178.05233922786124
d artagnan felt he had allowed himself to be carried away and that he had committed an error   131.94666330033107
no not precisely   103.0416940183575
he had his musketeers therefore as louis xiii   88.3918307988253
i set out five hours after her from portsmouth said lord de winter   68.02865797165504
but you know him m   129.84369696075026
it is true he had been playing the day before   55.92228967235025
certainly directly the curtain falls on the stage   135.13796242909265
what you are ignorant of lord de winter s designs upon me   43.316874397880525
cried d artagnan more moved than he had been for a long time don t despair my friend if you have not received any letters from the count we have received one   150.20436422661157
no in truth you are no visionary my dear friend and now i think of it you yes i faith you re right those delicate yet firm set lips those eyes which seem always at the command of the intellect and never of the heart   52.49688430571335
but excellency said pastrini still striving to gain his point   86.81904119642331
a magnificent peach was hanging against an adjoining wall ripened by the same artificial heat   52.98297786652902
god is speaking to your heart and your heart speaks to you   90.42505654504713
projectiles continued to hail down from the windows and some shots were heard the echo of which though they were probably fired in the air made all hearts vibrate   30.874404896812663
0349m to get your secret without paying for it you blockhead   220.58675411351723

well my boys said the brigadier the brigand must really have escaped early this morning   156.96077746923186

some place it on mount ararat others between the rivers tigris and euphrates   15.869396787245918
they had not yet begun to slay but it was well felt that the inclination to do so was not wanting   181.0389390870203
from pure zeal   120.891210672613
ah your excellency murmured the pilot you should not have done so   46.1191667615233
in that case it would be quite another thing   128.698488314781

they were heartrending   26.088676731456715

follow the culprit s steps   140.1454020807791
said albert in a low tone to monte cristo   167.9779118973263
i have them   160.9824379079949
my lord let us come to terms   138.41351254057875
interrupted porthos one of whose faults was a great looseness of tongue   96.15906181753304
yes if you have nothing more to say to me   140.62684208818504
where are you taking me   65.80979876957821
the queen became exceedingly red and replied that having in the evening broken one of those studs she had sent it to her goldsmith to be repaired   98.69171799916006
i hope to kill all four of you but i am more likely to kill the first than the second the second than the third and the third than the last   102.41047931996965
but i shall not be allowed to go   71.37906475995048

you assert a great deal said mazarin   51.18939717074315
and i consider it impious to attempt that which the almighty evidently does not approve   105.96873337843795
and on this assurance the four friends who had finished their modest repast separated with the promise of meeting again that evening   57.78830387022521
at one of the extremities of the camp near an immense tent in which the scottish officers were holding a kind of council presided over by lord leven their commander a man attired as a cavalier lay sleeping on the turf his right hand extended over his sword   86.68175292335017
a moment s silence ensued and then in a full sonorous voice the king exclaimed remember   76.23887699525486
on the evening of one of the warmest days spring had yet bestowed on the inhabitants of paris might be seen negligently thrown upon the stone bench a book a parasol and a work basket from which hung a partly embroidered cambric handkerchief while at a little distance from these articles was a young woman standing close to the iron gate endeavoring to discern something on the other side by means of the openings in the planks the earnestness of her attitude and the fixed gaze with which she seemed to seek the object of her wishes proving how much her feelings were interested in the matter   98.19215212020951
the porter got up as eugénie expected and even advanced some steps to recognize the person who was going out but seeing a young man striking his boot impatiently with his riding whip he opened it immediately   89.0990797981062
i understand replied fernand you can endure your own wretchedness patiently but you are afraid to share mine   196.08414776338816

i don t speak of your warlike exploits monsieur said mazarin   143.59978578414
i am rejoiced to hear you speak of monsieur d emery as calculated for a post which requires a man of probity   101.33466181903312
only as they went out aramis placed his hand upon the arm of d artagnan and looking at him earnestly you have not spoken of this lady   89.30951475195816
but believe me when i say that imperative necessity has imposed the painful task upon me   29.016566657962485

the day came at length and was almost as feverish as the night had been but it brought reason to the aid of imagination and dantès was then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in his brain   114.84680817312166
villefort also rang   102.4283124302633
but our gascon cadet was as may have been observed of a provident and almost avaricious character and with that explain the contradiction so vain as almost to rival porthos   58.22772121453793
and that you may not forget me take this   78.91032620493351
he is now at toulouse   89.73881970264534
on his return home the coadjutor was informed that a young man had come in after his departure and was waiting for him   45.015591063967065
i thought you did   140.68581027756193
why this is the way of it said the minister with the gravest air in the world napoleon lately had a review and as two or three of his old veterans expressed a desire to return to france he gave them their dismissal and exhorted them to serve the good king   129.55955745104728
the cardinal however contemptible might be the triumph gained over so vulgar a being as bonacieux did not the less enjoy it for an instant   99.47079732605377
the carriages could not move about   109.54247636717479
he bounded like a chamois cocking his carbine as he went and in a moment reached the summit of a hill opposite to that on which he had perceived the traveller   106.37171376787137
so saying he bowed to the baroness and her daughter exchanged a parting shake of the hand with debray and the count and left madame danglars box   130.19684049298482
he kept himself upright and dreamed without sleeping   67.40536766710244
d artagnan however gathered from his equivocal replies that the road to the right was the one he ought to take and on that uncertain information he resumed his journey   78.83813402630982
but it must be also said that the very name of milady paralyzed him   153.99504074141856
i encircled the castle   92.34281853144621
beware of what you do   54.83962068589892
that is with a bow and our debts of honor paid   19.052232597640355
but you my dear athos you who so generously distributed the englishman s pistoles which were our legitimate property what do you mean to do   29.975468003898698
and now take this   161.84684172430104
tell me for the hundredth time that you refuse my love which had your mother s sanction   105.64170480942477
now a barber would only be surprised if a man gifted with such advantages should consent voluntarily to deprive himself of them   56.59748977357318
for the sake of being a count   134.96161592851627
on the contrary i do   33.86215403979206
d artagnan picked it up   87.42232105743639
for in three years madame i have only seen you four times the first which i have described to you   116.41754546992095
the horses went like the wind and in a few minutes they were at the gates of london   123.3785701825916
de villefort had perceived at sunrise had all disappeared as if by magic and one of the softest and most brilliant days of september shone forth in all its splendor   134.23210674676926
it appears however said lord de winter if there are any measures to take against the countess it concerns me   52.36143221893868
the king was already sanguine but when he perceived aramis his hope turned to joy   126.24577139924168
at this the delight of the mother was almost frantic   129.3937678571262
mercédès smiled sadly   89.65319116683654
who can say whether we shall ever see them again   159.00736190410464
but he did not come   147.17040164091986
yes no   80.03241569826446
i could see nothing but a gray beard under the fringe of the mask   131.69728150166745
my friend aramis paused   143.33355257585532
he reflected for a second and then descended the stairs   135.2335067116753
cried the young man   68.92339038618206
and i reply to you sir that this abuse of power this exile under a fictitious name are infamous   142.45554218547426
if that were so he was indeed a highly favored prince   179.93064322628982
but soon a ray of light which penetrated through the chamber together with the warm and perfumed air which reached him from the same aperture the conversation of two of three ladies in language at once respectful and refined and the word majesty several times repeated indicated clearly that he was in a closet attached to the queen s apartment   81.22576882166717
the cellar what cellar   141.4384867936722
milady wished to please the abbess   139.83404456113803
sacré bleu   108.32248770078264
in order that his wounds might be examined he was undressed and his clothes were thrown into a corner where the police picked them up with the exception of the waistcoat which they overlooked   41.66468593164379
it was a temporary indisposition   68.38701206557892
then the carbineers scoured the country in different directions but in vain   100.31305155211408
i never saw one with such a hide in my life   135.53670859887382
on the contrary albert turned frightfully pale   94.47962916040491
madame danglars rose from her seat pale and cold   119.83161187564241
well it is just for that reason that we have called you my good m   75.77474277535401
what has the count done   99.20944453241611
here said he is a proof of my satisfaction   85.83773237523651
of ali pasha and the beautiful vasiliki   176.01437223005163
morrel said the count have you ever seen me fire a pistol   156.67861937300725
if i live i am only a man who has broken his word failed in his engagements in fact only a bankrupt   187.16929316017496
speak freely   74.7226086759789
absent kings are very soon forgotten   167.85540027324657
a man on whom we can depend i hope   79.51293152223226
no i have not asked you that said aramis with his subtle manner   61.33936508497882
if mercédès in short no longer resembles her former self in her features you will see that her heart is still the same   109.40252355236966
we will discuss that subject at length some future time said he   107.062689501511
in the eyes of everybody this was a declaration of war between the two kingdoms   122.20626353046008
nature subdued must yield in the combat the dream must succeed to reality and then the dream reigns supreme then the dream becomes life and life becomes the dream   129.86432581617387
but first said morrel allow me sir to tell you who i am how much i love mademoiselle valentine and what are my designs respecting her   127.66952380778358
four men prepared to do so   20.968013247143674
dantès wanted but little of being utterly mad   180.88581468010952
monsieur and madame de saint méran died as soon   92.63374244026849
that would carry you to the end of the world   126.37769629968327
however i m glad not to fight them until to morrow   151.99965560245292
bring six of them   57.457397947488914
my mother experienced the same sensations for i felt her tremble   98.15430419196989
the guests now all took leave of athos excepting the old duc de barbe who as an old friend of the family of la valliere went to see little louise and offered to take her to blois in his carriage   139.67407949904236
danglars fancied that they had reached the long desired point   134.3664318171455
it is said m   117.2226144905892
peppino obeyed   40.159148352077295
thank god you have come   37.34288133804631
his head with piercing eyes a straight nose a chin cut like that of brutus had altogether an indefinable character of grandeur and grace   120.3073870689141
de monte cristo arrived   108.0043508194535
it was necessary to find some neutral ground on which an exchange could be made and then to try and land these goods on the coast of france   106.93165787066053
set out therefore in a week with your suite and go to the hotel de la chevrette rue tiquetonne and there await me   91.74754214823234
but in fifteen days as you know or as you do not know this fatal campaign is to open   142.7412831609668
i acknowledge it affected me and indeed all the committee also said beauchamp   74.59882908712788
at the expiration of ten minutes felton came   73.33218878147628
if the lemonade be pure and inoffensive the syrup will retain its color   139.35017395681555
probably you have some correspondent in greece   153.10199327454902
no false modesty   73.5925226365907
thus a new a stronger and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the realization of their hopes   122.90124586966678
he gained just twelve hours by this engagement   126.36339331145533
an excellent one said valentine   174.21351459173823
having bowed to the two ladies he extended his hand to debray   62.343550731898034
ask planchet   172.85002074445367
that is his fault   112.06157684303116
true true   177.4917320084482
but please god it won t be much and you will see him in a few days all alive and hearty   97.20915356517179
athos is going to examine the castle which it will be necessary to render impregnable in case of siege   104.6247082502515
once more farewell my dear sister   67.93573121520895
the nervous excitement of which we speak pursued valentine even in her sleep or rather in that state of somnolence which succeeded her waking hours   150.26823681234228
it is god himself who sent us here   95.03394282332948
de tréville requested athos whatever might happen to be observant of his duty to the king but particularly to the queen begging him to convey his desires to his comrades   105.03748588182638
the other grave is that of the man who met his death from the hand of edmond dantès   165.50419108702357
mazarin and guitant conversed together in whispers   63.950202645861
an awful sadness enveloped the heart of charles   118.13775945413414
two or three houses were in flames and a dull noise was heard which indicated what suffering was endured by a town taken by assault   88.44281225968778
as i told you my dear morrel m   76.01129590853105
but your mother   95.01614646899426
then saluting the king and the cardinal the queen resumed her way to the chamber in which she had dressed and where she was to take off her costume   101.29256230191905
reflect athos   132.13159812289962
monsieur we think of what we can and not of what we will   58.52173761717121
in prison he had suffered his beard to grow   99.95533671410412
0307m edmond was seized with vertigo   108.46148238691602
then said the count i am emboldened to speak openly to you   147.7621378369877
it neither increased nor decreased my income   58.448258815407534
the glass is three quarters empty   102.98282001212962
oh when i said i was alone said milady hoping to make the novice talk by talking of herself it is not for want of friends in high places   123.59219510555843
alas it is unhappily but too true   133.64303944424128
it is written in the good book said monte cristo that the sins of the fathers shall fall upon their children to the third and fourth generation   90.22547334549269
when he opened his eyes dantès found himself on the deck of the tartan   60.14310260725499
and when a man like him comes to another recalls to him his plighted word and this man fails to redeem the pledge he has at least a right to exact from him a good reason for so doing   29.116871454017144
elssler was dancing in le diable boiteux   71.88312540823162
no said monte cristo folding the five notes most decidedly not   113.41966012266695
i shall be one someday   28.94162159241189
yes this self of whom i thought so much of whom i was so proud who had appeared so worthless in the dungeons of the château d if and whom i had succeeded in making so great will be but a lump of clay tomorrow   90.60647992424597
at the foot of the cardinal s gallows   102.73519748053285
besides said she the sum you required me to borrow was rather large   194.0142171544592
two well trained servingmen were in attendance on the company   156.35154227674863
i do not understand you sir said the baroness trying to disguise the agitation of her voice and the flush of her face   142.61225879460432
both were free from the fear of pursuit   30.115164100579392
the clouds which m   107.36633183064713
it was wrong monsieur porthos   94.76667938640169
then you know him   131.48759445669768
it was a fan which madame de villefort had left in the carriage   146.3797857119452
they had grown together like two trees whose roots are mingled whose branches intertwined and whose intermingled perfume rises to the heavens   85.71652914371248
but how did it happen that such a great princess became a slave   124.11191423818221
d artagnan returned to less important affairs and the three musketeers repaired to the king s quarters where they had to prepare their lodging   119.49845855688223
then milady collected all her energies murmuring in the depths of her soul the name of felton the only beam of light that penetrated to her in the hell into which she had fallen   63.75437595452392
what was the matter with you baron   130.4475703734713
and we are going to his house   49.8739786346704
at length m   2.574759886806916
he had no time to draw from his holsters   160.54020856045761
i have almost killed myself by my needless haste   164.35552768485292
thin pale with light blue eyes and tawny flaxen hair   118.31657822771986
at ten steps from the place where they halted was a young man in black who seemed waiting for some one and who from the moment he saw them enter the town never took his eyes off them   110.40323129127337
of course said d artagnan   101.69872454902176
oh i remember said d artagnan   5.0797487106593024
am i mistaken then   44.46208485532607
your servants said he who were repeating the whole of the sorrowful story   163.80975870001646
la ramee adored his wife and children whom now he could only catch a glimpse of from the top of the wall when in order to please him they used to walk on the opposite side of the moat   145.14312959928617
in a second la ramee was gagged and laid prostrate   156.6443474890796
well well monsieur de villequier mazarin interposed i shall make it my care the king hears of your loyalty   141.76160421545848
and he jumped on his horse and set off at full gallop snuffing the fresh air in his triumph and shouting out with an expression of face which it would be impossible to describe free   46.33535881401919
cried caderousse rising and drawing up in a heap the gold and notes scattered over the table and which he covered with his two hands   102.34642404278401
0259m yes sir   104.57736626692632
but notwithstanding his earnest wish he was delayed by the dissensions which broke out between mm   111.68642239161461
sire buckingham has been in paris five days and only left this morning   149.51023183724428
you have indeed repaid me munificently for my services   175.71515942363175
he accepted the offer without enthusiasm and without regret as one of those conventions of society which every gentleman looks upon as a duty   177.00888625427615
it is not my intention here to enter into an analysis of this curious work   132.95287468525675
raoul conquered the very natural feeling of timidity he experienced and approaching the prince my lord he said will you permit me to hazard a few words on that subject which will perhaps relieve you of your uncertainty   15.495195310295045
the astonishment of mazarin and of anne of austria was great when it was announced to them that the city which the previous evening they had left entirely tranquil had awakened to such feverish commotion   57.62386210657871
and i frequently make use of it with all possible prudence though be it observed he added with a smile of intelligence   224.76107531623416
he could like the king touch the greatest of us on the head and touching them make such heads shake on their shoulders   152.27743158867833
my pride is to see the accused pale agitated and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire of my eloquence   102.56045889468542
our athos who was as virtuous as scipio   53.2298847417143
follow him said athos   95.0645177607005
oh no he has plunged a thousand daggers into my heart tragedy weapons i own which instead of wounding sheathe their points in their own handles but daggers which he nevertheless believed to be real and deadly   100.9951845997885
my dear host and you signora said albert in italian excuse my apparent stupidity   200.76702371943648
that brave and unfortunate athos was wounded on that very shoulder against which i must run head foremost like a ram   134.4887060910562
the stranger was about to reply   93.35522774222805
with repressed smile come in baron and tell the duke all you know the latest news of m   138.59539185919317
and others went to the police office to inquire if he had taken out a passport   201.9952838633401
are you not mistaken   62.54744752242407
and by the rapid glance that the young man s eyes shot forth villefort saw how much energy lay hid beneath this mildness   94.08787317428707
d artagnan saw from the expression of the queen s face that she was about to issue some violent command   60.40712330519365
but i fear that you will be much disappointed accustomed as you are to picturesque events and fantastic horizons   133.12631913090888
my dear friend said the cardinal leaning as they walked through the garden on his friend s arm you told me just now that you had been twenty years in the queen s service   56.414650192149175
i should say you could   174.9070998820011
to nobody in the world   154.16365747423075
and the self satisfied gascon was convinced that sooner or later she could not fail to respond   90.50926640605333
by no means madame   144.25035551892472
certainly said danglars in the most natural tone in the world   110.30190707565691
with these reflections he entered his carriage and returned home   116.26394777869027
then we must fly   83.58394890708452
tapestry hung before the door by which franz had entered and also in front of another door leading into a second apartment which seemed to be brilliantly illuminated   74.56387806987223
lord de winter and the three musketeers looked at one another inquiringly   214.64534581376913
i depend upon your word   116.09298448944449
the boat glided along the ferry rope under the shadow of a pale cloud which hung over the water at that moment   151.38945867908822
shall i give these papers to m   55.68124174301489
oh real enough from anxiety doubtless at any rate they postponed the matter for two months   130.8242424942774
i have already told you answered the abbé that i loathe the idea of shedding blood   106.31508210425424
why this man is a cask   172.84393051688363
it was you who had madame bonacieux carried off   110.57512053010242
i have bought enough fish of him to know his name   178.4292657627758
the mendicant uttered these words in a tone of such humility such earnest repentance that gondy placed his hand upon him and gave him his benediction with all the unction of which he was capable   70.593104977163
what is your pleasure   86.26927959004104
oh doctor what a dreadful word is that   104.35922068698233
she therefore confined herself to a prudent middle course   227.3821549896433
praise god monsieur replied they bowing together   113.1788449159028
and in order to avoid fruitless toil he sounded all the other walls with his pickaxe struck the earth with the butt of his gun and finding nothing that appeared suspicious returned to that part of the wall whence issued the consoling sound he had before heard   95.1630645667573
the englishman turned down his shirt collar and showed a scar whose redness proved it to be a recent one   63.72939934527892
if i stay in paris i can not go to rome   137.0165624795553
from you i have nothing to conceal   0.6401068811383936
you killed that woman   57.350868845475546
i pass my life upon my legs   75.70532843836882
my father who is a merchant placed me with his correspondent who in turn sent his son to join our house in london   169.9290868122372
but you said i think that i had nothing else to do   179.25489708070958
death is about to return to the tomb the phantom to retire in darkness   0.022632757370303125
very good said the queen be as grateful as you like it does not implicate me   92.89614596093388
i claim then the right to choose my opponent   98.24679005857222
before we are alarmed we see correctly   148.5852483320667
yes he said there have been some who have suffered more than i have but then they must have been martyrs at least   175.46779228585896
by this arrangement d artagnan could nudge porthos with his knee and make signs with his eyes to athos and aramis   203.00431908002207
he is quite aware that there are two gentlemen who greatly aided the escape of monsieur de beaufort and he has instigated an active search for them i can answer for it   121.98896126166103
then during the day tell rosa that when i leave the opera i will sup with her as she wishes   180.77039335119127
you have sent for me sir said athos to m   101.29072622150939
eight days had been occupied in preparations at the hôtel de ville for this important evening   180.24899885185062
the opening of this door disclosed a brilliant light and she disappeared   115.00710560014787
for when albert and franz again encountered the carriage with the contadini the one who had thrown the violets to albert clapped her hands when she beheld them in his button hole   135.4298291429211
have they not heard that of their colonel   95.74563854589745
and that father is well caderousse it is monte cristo   77.10556303736533
monsieur du vallon that worthy gentleman for with the exception of yourself monsieur d artagnan there s not a man in france that i esteem and love so much as him then my lord replied d artagnan pointing to the purse which mazarin still held if you love and esteem him so much you understand me   92.04737857038005
monsieur de busigny said athos will you be so kind as to set your watch with mine or permit me to regulate mine by yours   152.565500301152
but why all these precautions   170.1431843411026
so far so good laughed athos   116.44081703987379
milady passed her two arms round felton s neck and let herself slip out of the window   81.71503546014574
i ask your excellencies pardon but this is quite a french demand   190.29954294024714
the president stopped the coach   147.46378790094474
everything goes on smoothly so certainly dear friend i shall not meddle in politics   184.49659483328702
he cast himself on his knees seized the hand and touched it respectfully with his lips   41.189213629275
is included in this sum   80.10725924056534
if algiers were good for nothing but to furnish the means of carrying so admirable an idea into practice it would be an acquisition well worthy of struggling to obtain   43.74517448222788
said athos smiling if it be not a secret   101.57784069103083
he could not recognize himself   81.43186312959382
my dear viscount how have you discovered that i did not like m   51.22266678718335
and there is nothing i would not do to prove to monsieur that i am attached to him   85.47433517151428
but one gets out of prison said caderousse who with what sense was left him listened eagerly to the conversation and when one gets out and one s name is edmond dantès one seeks revenge what matters that   126.46005754589
in the midst of the disasters that befell the house cocles was the only one unmoved   130.57808353834162
the truth madame said mazarin placing a pen and a paper before her you must   76.60331491901363
really returned the count relate it to me for it begins to interest me   76.04349953593396
bonacieux had remained insensible to vulgar seductions   109.00950805224424
ah sir you have given me confidence   55.34716420265287
for instance having tried every other remedy to restore movement and speech to m   58.27575078772125
danglars i ask you only how your engagement stands   37.70329345792288
you have very tender mutton and i wish you joy of it   65.46746452261701
i was shouting down with mazarin   99.56628605205478
and what is become of this benedetto   97.65733351009749
this yacht had been built by order of an englishman who having heard that the genoese excelled all other builders along the shores of the mediterranean in the construction of fast sailing vessels was desirous of possessing a specimen of their skill   102.02710494135425
i want recommendations and some information relative to africa   155.75001953600878
and if you please by the corso   71.390831575954
sir said the cardinal you have heard me   131.6952826786903
he then with noiseless haste took out the horse that he had ridden on the previous evening saddled and bridled it himself and led the animal into the alley to the right of the kitchen garden opened a side door which conducted him to a bridle road shut it after him and d artagnan saw him pass by like a dart bending as he went beneath the pendent flowery branches of maple and acacia   90.11078793962872
beneath these windows a wooden balcony extended the entire length of the house   94.33821580325122
during the six weeks that athos and aramis had been absent from france the parisians finding themselves one morning without either queen or king were greatly annoyed at being thus deserted and the absence of mazarin a thing so long desired did not compensate for that of the two august fugitives   43.909740733141476
six hours after he left pierrefonds he was at saint germain   121.18566369469272
cried milady with an accent that admitted no doubt of her truth   167.2370685897887
what do you think of the count   126.78221067570202
i will not talk   71.9327403564871
villefort s brow darkened more and more his white lips and clenched teeth filled dantès with apprehension   129.48951698012013
but he bethought him of m   48.41850980767363
really have you had a vision of the seven fat kine and the seven lean kine   160.85243142184646
chapter 104   71.58496302626784
sir said the count the world unjust as it is will be pleased with your resolution   97.3291117100515
asked the beadle   46.684244054087955
noirtier looked at the dictionary   127.35902057152327
threats   125.36309732903459
she treats her children ill but she always welcomes strangers   153.4352875975481
de comminges and desire him to shut himself up with his men in the guardhouse and in the stables   134.11328251731683
i have already told you avenge him   101.51034426273708
and is it possible that this frightful combination of crimes has been invented by a woman   171.70938769971818
try aramis to keep near the king   119.67102055860653
the count s cheeks became scarlet and he coughed in order to have an excuse for putting his handkerchief to his mouth   62.592001241994836
you will get me out if they put me there said d artagnan   107.36449105353124
laporte give the light to monsieur the chevalier de coislin   66.54682682771916
hold if that should happen although i am a christian m   97.8680332117068
porthos nodded in sign of agreement   127.82051514420789
monsieur d artagnan is my tenant although he does not pay me my rent and even better on that account ought i to know him   106.12444128664866
he awaits the answer   97.63537518104368
messieurs athos porthos and aramis   99.90824062521419
mazarin thinking that it would be the means of increasing the zeal of his two defenders if he procured them personal thanks from the queen motioned them to follow him   204.1475628362071
at the first announcement of peace madame de chevreuse frowned and in spite of all the logic of athos to show her that a prolonged war would have been impracticable contended in favor of hostilities   189.4908676083123
as grimaud entered he saw this comb on the tea table   102.54459402084149
surely at the death of mazarin   67.27050090567646
there are men somewhere about but that s of no consequence to us said d artagnan   178.44778323187356
that seems to me as hazardous as uncertain and convinces me that my scheme is far better than yours   120.74477029858406
but he had no sooner landed than he heard a noise of horses galloping upon the paved road   101.39646421136179
d avrigny who saw that would be a means of his remaining alone with noirtier expressed his opinion that it was the best thing that could be done   100.17099159134467
the curtain was drawn and yet the image of his father was so vivid to his mind that he addressed the closed window as though it had been open and as if through the opening he had beheld the menacing old man   135.56819161715978
a coffer of which he had so often heard and which the hands a little wrinkled it is true but still not without elegance of the procurator s wife were about to open to his admiring looks   90.13635930335182
come said monte cristo touching his shoulder with his finger are you a man again maximilian   87.49089907521612
de tréville who could not fail to think the manner in which d artagnan had left him a little cavalier   61.0202196358984
have you my dear aramis thought sometimes of those happy happy happy days of youth we passed laughing drinking and fighting each other for play   123.93011420646532
here is de winter coming said athos   58.24180524500984
you are questioning me like a king s attorney   71.47264292359398
since he could not be a bayard he would become a raphael or a michael angelo   133.75004869405208
said mercédès blushing as rapidly as she had turned pale and again becoming paler than ever   89.75122973956981
well that s all very sensible athos said d artagnan   170.65902469791973
exclaimed porthos looking at the gascon with the most profound admiration   151.76687009937686
i think you re right answered he we shall have a gale   172.81294694907066
the travelers then comprehended that there must be some reason why the unknown preserved such a silence and ceased to address themselves to him   93.57446914933439
what a cold wind   161.1343029123196
he went to desire you to come to the palace   147.66407834531879
we want first to put our prisoners in a place of safety replied d artagnan   64.10491867847861
but not for me who have grown pale over them by many nights study and have reconstructed every phrase completed every thought   117.44856525832026
we don t want either rope ladders or gag pears now   76.74423584227969
she then returned to her room calling for help as loudly as she could when suddenly her window which was twenty feet from the ground was opened a young peasant jumped into the chamber seized her in his arms and with superhuman skill and strength conveyed her to the turf of the grass plot where she fainted   64.59371955766952
has such and such a perfume done anything for me   169.9508426488224
but if they refuse can i count on you   39.71033961911698
villefort is no longer at marseilles   149.17034563663006

work slowly said the curate   94.00299889239237
i believe then that it is not on account of any intrigues of her own that my wife has been arrested but because of those of a lady much greater than herself   85.52435832104501
i take pleasure in saying that you have served me faithfully bertuccio   7.02880953838914
alas sire it is but too true   18.741708416340117

you are active vigorous and you have arms   63.466125800852645
he turned around recognized athos and aramis and held out his hand to them   114.27771956001568
and it was a fierce one   93.24152090732223
at last the heavy machine which was called a chariot in those days came out rumbling against the gates and de winter still on horseback bent again to the door to converse with her majesty   115.41553430713682
from the notary m   159.80617283785892
poor fellow what is it   69.59691532964541
why the vilest animals are not suffered to die by such a death as that   54.84928490357315

dantès nevertheless determined to make for them   179.82871393562874
morrel sighed deeply and passed his hand over his forehead which was covered with perspiration   143.4781353048429
four strokes of the oar brought them to land   18.9638068312821

in great dangers the devoted ones cling to each other   116.18971044622559
now that i am a captain in the royal musketeers i must make an appearance   32.20929808144028
it advanced swiftly and gracefully leaving behind it a glittering stretch of foam   156.71394856655664
50243m mon dieu   0.075050777595564
he is advancing as rapidly as his own eagles   94.31914275310129
but to you at least m   136.9034033689569
still i will go   110.80669193121547
asked mazarin trembling   129.29139710775718
the musketeer signified by a nod that these commands should be obeyed to the letter and d artagnan went out followed by bernouin   83.15261377750193
he gave her a box told her not to open it except in london   89.93299258872838
my son said the abbé you who are a sailor and a swimmer must know as well as i do that a man so loaded would sink before he had done fifty strokes   146.67845155030983
dear maximilian interrupted the count listen how adorably duprez is singing that line o mathilde   97.40496936173687

a sailor was rubbing his limbs with a woollen cloth   113.07055062006499
which are your windows   133.60968413764988
the young man s eyes were red and he seemed dejected   123.72441472433825
milady was then able to judge of the effect she had produced   57.33985578867402

then it seems i am to eat alone remarked the jeweller   82.38378292662179
he recognized albert but thought it better not to notice him as he looked so angry and discomposed   146.45688317534513
if you ask him he says sinbad the sailor   182.35743239547378
when felton had seen her recover with the veil of chastity those treasures of love which were only concealed from him to make him desire them the more ardently he said ah now   89.70963524029354
ah yes he said i know them   204.34634650380696

young man said he to d artagnan a suggestion   143.8593396002359
my good friend said the man in the cloak excuse me for saying that you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant act   105.12716940848159
for all that was done for our service   113.9170606769415
still it appeared as though they were stationed at equal distances from one another like sentinels   68.51471758179346
to surround the scaffold with twenty of my best men who at a signal from me will rush forward directly peppino is brought for execution and by the assistance of their stilettos drive back the guard and carry off the prisoner   72.79657774569162
the dinner can not have had time to get cold   95.97728827008773
d avrigny struck his forehead with his hand   66.2430261529548
but before they could meet the vessel again changed her course   157.35161561420804
where can i sleep   94.21720550554217
de boville had indeed met the funeral procession which was taking valentine to her last home on earth   197.82291865756855
if he be innocent of course he will be set at liberty   179.98946918366838

the marquis rang a servant entered   158.24796532681557
it is something to be well received   140.67591032984095
and every day the cardinal under some pretext deferred fixing it   135.363571313229
my dear athos you view things on the dark side methinks   117.11128467341554
the young man with the intuitive perception of a lover quickly understood the circumstances in which she was involuntarily placed and he was comforted   189.937733567851
never mind that   101.76110159142793
a year after madame   198.13132007087

if they recognize you you are lost   87.98324490465492
you believe and yet you deliver me up to him who fills and defiles the world with his heresies and debaucheries to that infamous sardanapalus whom the blind call the duke of buckingham and whom believers name antichrist   107.07226956801841
did you ever see mercédès again   166.3495469560618
you must dress yourself raoul said athos i am going to present you to some one   169.670114496728

milady had sunk into a chair with her hands extended as if to conjure this terrible apparition   87.2863381184884

but that is not a man s name   149.11014026751133
we are coming nearer to it now   72.1933577204659
i have not that honor monseigneur replied the latter his eyes dazzled by the brilliant style in which d artagnan traveled   85.37442944838
and now gentlemen he continued turning towards m   38.65673495265257
for everything   170.7977605518701
suddenly planchet entered bringing two letters for d artagnan   198.69631864896033
that s very simple replied athos   108.16764377404795
my fifty recruits from the chevalier d humieres who are destined to enter the light cavalry and who have only received as yet for their equipment their white cloaks   151.17113909305127
she was lost in reverie and the reverie of crime is remorse   84.85868386247977
cried d artagnan i will be there ten minutes before twelve   88.70038226540939
when besieging paris had loaves and provisions thrown over the walls   138.41160241805858
cried the people with one voice   55.29955991445566
his voice went to my heart observed julie   94.5039810651571
i have the honor to inquire from your majesty what you desire monsieur d herblay and myself to do in your service   116.75063756429975
i your son as you call me i will not let you   134.87907249731703
in that case monseigneur do you believe the cardinal will be so kind as to tell me what has become of my wife   128.1201111871383
milady reclining in an armchair near the chimney beautiful pale and resigned looked like a holy virgin awaiting martyrdom   61.3488213282695
my mother cried mordaunt with eyes on fire with a look of hate impossible to paint i can only offer thee one victim but it shall at any rate be the one thou wouldst thyself have chosen   173.97191224548632
porthos opened his eyes in amazement   69.38505301611481
every frondist must put a knot of straw in his hat   152.0776009319086
when supper was over blaisois entered   206.08711833631102
now you must agree that these are indubitable symptoms of insanity   125.89825826573355
israel is dead but he is avenged   40.51065405919195
bonacieux from the convent of the carmelites of béthune   17.416778157273754
6 guillotine   14.826295974977668
with 200 francs   87.55498437689512
mazarin being thus placed beyond the pale of the protection of the law preparations on both sides were commenced by the queen to attack paris by the citizens to defend it   122.2406117315627
it must be done   147.18048687918457
in what a tone you speak   131.69992992815367
we understand each other perfectly then   184.11106854686747
by degrees everyone awoke   141.95909476894028
answered danglars   143.94506168880156
milady thought she recognized this shadow in the gloom   118.96286242958811
once pale he was now yellow   89.31899300330869
the poor fowl was thin and covered with one of those thick bristly skins through which the teeth can not penetrate with all their efforts   115.38473742145328
but now listen to this   124.6827996642227
d artagnan who had just dismounted then saw outlined against the wall the enormous stomach of mousqueton whose down drawn mouth emitted sounds of distress   59.37899232192603
i am extremely sorry you find me so ignorant a cicerone replied morcerf but i am reluctantly obliged to confess i have nothing further to communicate yes stay i do know one thing more namely that she is a musician for one day when i chanced to be breakfasting with the count i heard the sound of a guzla it is impossible that it could have been touched by any other finger than her own   82.36741216446757
astonished at the prolonged slumber of the patient and frightened to see that the arm was still hanging out of the bed she advanced towards valentine and for the first time noticed the white lips   111.64789749558142
but my dear fellow if that some one recognizes us if that some one cries out we are lost   164.71185758720688
i have a letter to give you from the count   79.9055354096868
the story of ganymede maximilian is not a fable but an allegory   129.86489821755657
the hôtel de la trémouille   127.01016122431999
but unfortunately these charming chambers were at the opposite extremities of the hôtel   81.03557892137547
well what is to be done   170.83490389758734
who brought it into this room then   120.77919880877756
and approaching the desk he removed the sheet of paper which morrel had placed over the letter he had begun and took the latter in his hands   183.94761467346427
well inquired the jeweller is the cash all right   110.00320006137878
in ugliness in so far as a man can resemble a woman   68.37271761098077
and yet so powerful is majesty amongst us this man has not even the honor of a tomb at the feet of him in whose service his life was worn away   104.34624276727509
you have rapiers here of every form and to suit the most exacting taste   152.35147483667066
steps approach i go adieu   79.47082956527257
we want money for our return to paris   169.50486831969266
and at that moment he could safely promise to do so for he felt as though it were not enough to love him merely as a friend or even as a father he worshiped him as a god   100.3655679681449
but for the honor of the king of the queen   80.10361154597797
indeed my dear friend said m   136.69136484236708
he looked coldly at the queen who nudged mazarin to make him say something in his turn   103.84980588169107
in a couple of hours he returned   203.50239513756992
in a short time the two unfortunate beasts who had not eaten anything since the morning made such a noise in raising and letting fall the knocker that the procurator ordered his errand boy to go and inquire in the neighborhood to whom this horse and mule belonged   27.551300043514814
milady assumed her smile of a resigned victim and shook her head   74.83700495550949
it was a name that too often resounded in her majesty s ears and too often vibrated in her heart for anne of austria not to recognize it   121.61837758006403
the minister receives two hundred petitions every day and does not read three   135.7097956195368
there was an energy a conviction and a sincerity in the manner of the young man which silenced the tumult   107.91285174905843
hearing these words the two shadows blockaded the road and by the light of the stars might be seen the shining of their arms   187.36291069931877
by your misfortune   59.901431807047665
i insult you   118.13032546826821
the four seamen who composed the crew obeyed while the pilot looked on   147.13102568468597
i will have three fleur de lis embroidered on it in gold and will give it to your company as a standard   150.64992481118261
and who confounded unknown lost in the crowd gathered at one of the doors looked on at this scene comprehensible only to four persons the king the queen his eminence and himself   70.59096429187609
and now although you have wronged us of perhaps 10 000 francs will you have your supper with us   102.34757117907105
but in losing you i lose my life   57.14211971665551
the road was long but the horses upon which d artagnan and planchet rode had been refreshed in the well supplied stables of the lord of bracieux   105.5127127638108
d artagnan became more and more astonished   123.21768444329219
mordaunt felt that he had no time to lose and he lost none   157.2225244220237
i am sorry if you die that you should die with sentiments of hatred toward me   102.9017662424726
i was like you and had a king in keeping   155.8929579404092
you may be above others but above you there is god   140.7344342478221
i hope the accident has been of no consequence   20.561755072603148
he had no doubt that it was the messenger from albert   194.493582055052
come said he to himself be a man   90.2164462669458
then he let his head sink upon his two hands while d artagnan stood before him stupefied   67.76365337533485
for as the gladiator said to the emperor when he entered the arena he who is about to die salutes you   83.31138067397795
no said d artagnan it is in advance   157.26569272844205
they might have been said to fall on the shield of minerva which some philosophers assert protected sometimes the breast of sappho   120.39215311624262
it is much more convenient at paris when anything can not be done you pay double and it is done directly   99.67488898705264
no no it is useless stammered m   176.59009618175043
but not until two o clock said d artagnan with the same calmness   58.11837057111334
then her brow darkened   146.54629725261896
and who had a lackey named grimaud   68.03505256251142
my way is the way of all gentlemen and i know only one way answered athos haughtily   184.25811437623756
certainly certainly cried franz   91.8216893639597
gentlemen he said turning to those who were near him can any one of you speak spanish and serve me as interpreter   56.72324164497226
for two days no one knew what had become of her and everything remained in suspense   128.10904902988557
oh how extraordinary   196.26163016763417
you have already given me that reason and i find it excellent   42.471180812458584
a woman who poisoned her second husband and who attempted both to poison and assassinate me   140.14949042962337
the latter put his hand to his sword and said with the smile of a man who for thirty years has jested with death would you assassinate me sir   95.49491162549248
in that earnest look might be read a deep reproach as well as a terrible menace   75.88392985261163
grimaud seemed to him an antinous   110.25417976985639
at last d artagnan having got up too close stepped back to prepare a fourth thrust but the moment when after a fine quick feint he was attacking as sharply as lightning the wall seemed to give way mordaunt disappeared through the opening and d artagnan s blade caught between the panels shivered like a sword of glass   105.94811142096592
since the 28th of february 1815   146.63987710288706
they denounced edmond as a bonapartist agent   62.01543299571621
they both advanced beneath the trees through whose branches streamed the moonlight   99.40726162369705
charles who is my prisoner may still have friends but i have none   139.57480770145958
then they did not watch over this man   130.40325119614826
i am convinced that these gentlemen return your kind wishes and will be delighted to kill you also   124.85554551638248
the sound was heard by the people about ali who instantly opened the box door   65.93776252724456
at certain conventional moments the spectators would suddenly cease their conversation or rouse themselves from their musings to listen to some brilliant effort of moriani s a well executed recitative by coselli or to join in loud applause at the wonderful powers of la specchia   91.48590509218381
so much the worse sir said anne of austria   81.02032685228892
mordaunt sustained this new attack without wincing   142.03873364476684
the stranger went out   134.3327528764543
and had she crossed your path and you had crushed her like glass still edmond still she must have admired you   79.60744550086375
tis the appointment monsieur de tréville held you ask of me   99.25456912861887
now then margotin cried he speaking to the dog will you be quiet   73.12964362441032
and what is a fronde   109.10799412415156
and now when are we to go   120.01141702475923
his head fell on his shoulder his legs bent beneath him and his movements were apparently automatic and unconscious   170.35576647952038
where have you been   180.57527331238262
said a voice that seemed to come from beneath the earth and deadened by the distance sounded hollow and sepulchral in the young man s ears   110.82633108397428
mazarin was in his study working at a list of pensions and benefices of which he was trying to reduce the number   123.15696082919068
aramis is mildness and grace personified   170.83654806133137
ah he exclaimed that woman became criminal only from associating with me   115.44185107459003
well monsieur do you know who this great lady is   123.07331143233972
well my captain said porthos quite beside himself the truth is that we were six against six   161.85574683283284
raoul angry and at the same time uneasy ran after him and seized him by the arm   112.78089231417663
that of rouen   82.41980628059629
hush gentlemen here is the court   89.51961522855566
imagine a man who has transacted business with me for i don t know how long to the amount of 800 000 or 900 000 francs during the year   68.24525841562718
i will even venture to say that i am certain m   115.0284028003861
the mob had already assembled when the confession terminated   155.11834450641146
but do not let us lose time   124.91834941826183
what do you wish for   114.26890374033458
she took me away without speaking   112.98950371396718
0099m go on sir said he   97.24058703309883
then he is not dead   83.46188094023209
and yet you said he had money   120.87319843987126
the floors were covered with the richest carpets turkey could produce   137.24774246791574
yet its notes so tenderly expressive and fearfully grand as the wretched husband and wife give vent to their different griefs and passions thrilled through the soul of franz with an effect equal to his first emotions upon hearing it   85.26117127388241
but he forbade that anything should be given to her except what he ordered   79.59197612210075
so long as the nets were good they caught fish   103.69110446668469
it is a rock   142.91827001421277
mousqueton took the place of the coachman and drove standing for reasons known to himself like automedon of antiquity   84.26564822594175
but i confess i always thought you jested   170.55919572674097
we will lay your case before the commandant of the post   215.01178081165457
but after all said he lowering the point of his spit where is this letter   62.49665055360828
i would rather have lost a thousand pistoles than have lost it   108.80387139635731
dantès seized the handles and strove to lift the coffer   53.79640635287661
the exclamations the insults addressed to benedetto who remained perfectly unconcerned the energetic gestures the movement of the gendarmes the sneers of the scum of the crowd always sure to rise to the surface in case of any disturbance all this lasted five minutes before the door keepers and magistrates were able to restore silence   157.09447467217564
tis i who am too soon   41.89457425483876
he is well behaved   121.10118322842479
as i had nothing more to do at versailles i went to auteuil and gained all the information i could   189.74137409784686
but how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all this   137.80186587193597
through the closely fastened windows the prisoner could perceive the houses and the pavement that was all   126.87610573053553
i can t see   52.654753397975334
the count wished to speak but a gush of blood stifled him   79.45619746461765
bowing under the weight of twenty four years reminiscences he thought not of albert of beauchamp of château renaud or of any of that group   89.71387265582447
de villefort are both coming to this dinner   80.7163314883094
on the contrary you will give me great pleasure   124.18604773891953
impostor repeated villefort   136.6426098958115
the ball has broken the thigh bone and entered the intestines   121.83719828843165
on reaching the gate the captain of the post advanced at the head of a dozen men holding a lantern in his hand   165.33579665330612
his words were re echoed by the whole party with vociferous cheers   42.65465139707128
they will be the very men for it   137.40517442184918
d artagnan said aramis in a reproachful tone how could you believe that we had made a disturbance   186.44611308918107
yes i promised you   54.84227047954714
what horror   82.75203736128033
i arose   104.58107240555631
but towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had gone by faria not seeing the young man appear tried to move and get over the distance which separated them   164.34251255931315
at length providence has done something for you   47.0987206132493
after supper i exhibited the same marks of languor as on the preceding evening   136.48262719091161
and throwing the match on the ground he trampled on it and extinguished it   169.41387977970038
scaffold executioners victims all had disappeared   127.61444028763384
his voice had become rough and hoarse   147.06285258760377
they came with their usual promptness and the coadjutor spent with them a part of the night   75.07266147477016
you no more deceive me with that false calmness than i impose upon you with my frivolous solicitude   116.55917890502212
do you think the count of monte cristo had ever been in france before he made this visit to paris   38.35012479180659
and if they come back fire   136.87439892447807
well i was a million in advance with him and now my fine jacopo manfredi suspends payment   100.88394602338369
at sight of this man d artagnan started and half drawing his sword sprang toward the door   165.62373066459347
and i am the more grateful to your eminence replied anne of austria with a smile that proved she was not the dupe of this ingenious gallantry from being certain that these two studs alone have cost you as much as all the others cost his majesty   106.98143905583743
an instant later the jingling of spurs was heard upon the stairs steps drew near the door opened and a man appeared   145.7130705190047
i let him place the box in the hole he had made then while he stamped with his feet to remove all traces of his occupation i rushed on him and plunged my knife into his breast exclaiming i am giovanni bertuccio   117.94433959477755
thank you said andrea   117.38651477196258
he wished to enter it as a conqueror   72.21770559652046
do you wish me to leave   102.85483332024764
so beautiful   133.60702296312334
why edmond dantès and myself were intimate friends   167.9748431244687
take this letter said d artagnan   28.43496945380899
for ten years i dreamed each night the same dream   108.9577627514237
because if as you say athos and aramis are in real danger this is not the time to abandon them   78.63354360837613
50233m i am entirely yours count   47.25461565079229
but she always laughed at me   145.37130748743743
in the smuggling line   119.67664882047869
a senseless word   65.29558597805035
on my life   172.37352901077622
but he had seven or eight years before this period sold his establishment to a tailor at marseilles who having almost ruined himself in his old trade wished to make his fortune in another   128.94227430121148
she must know nothing of the matter   143.22785801703503
but my lord returned la ramee what would you do if you got out   107.96227194068506
at nine o clock then be ready here at the hôtel i will come and take you   118.09376900764454
you can write it yourself   160.5009734997327
leu being not far from that locality   117.28930232243863
which has happened to you   213.78344644728037
and what a strange air for a victor   117.50450912341618
how attentively he looked at you   84.06483591338443
cried milady throwing herself at his feet   167.67101227791835
tell me on what footing your household was established by your first husband and although i am only your brother in law i will arrange one similar   110.83159265737545
what are your grandmother s symptoms   15.584250666360703
but after his illness grace touched him and he determined to take orders   122.72467068327953
they sent for a cabriolet   105.40095835379971
approach him said she and when the next waiter passes insist upon his taking something   114.73337300927447
go he said go my child   80.22469607236653
unfortunately as he advanced his anger increased at every step   77.2655415261489
but said valentine timidly does all the father s shame revert upon the son   111.73928339096015
two hours and a quarter my officer   96.21051759018987
i was charged indeed with a mission to the cardinal and had set out for rueil when seeing monsieur de chatillon charge an invincible desire possessed me to charge at his side   71.21977651900312

replied the musketeer with a sad smile which d artagnan alone understood   32.101698938177975
hung by order of his highness the duc de beaufort   64.76122791525398
but these considerations never occurred to the duke and every day the cardinal received fresh accounts of him which were as unpleasant as possible to the minister   94.01169888767357
no accident has happened to him   200.423944389108
athos forced his way through and entered followed by the young man   201.25213803663087
is he rich   158.52107833407047
france will not perhaps be always ungrateful   132.62493575575473
valentine opened her eyes   141.01951079914105
the man he sacrificed to his ambition that innocent victim immolated on the altar of his father s faults appeared to him pale and threatening leading his affianced bride by the hand and bringing with him remorse not such as the ancients figured furious and terrible but that slow and consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up to the very moment of death   99.70146368461226
at length i discovered that he went mysteriously to auteuil   171.3491430756878
and then resumed d artagnan to this decrepitude is probably added poverty for he must have neglected the little that he had and the dirty scoundrel grimaud more taciturn than ever and still more drunken than his master stay planchet it breaks my heart to merely think of it   130.90100434221395
remember that she is a woman whom you have dishonored   88.92431911758038
nay count said the baroness it would have been somewhat more gallant to have placed the ladies first   126.21528894032001
and besides however good an appetite we may have and however great our thirst there will be something left on the plates and in the bottles and that something will be yours   123.74421567447908
but the banker recollecting what had transpired the day before did not wish him admitted   55.06033400522509
accordingly it was admitted to the presence of anne who silent and lofty as ever listened to the speeches and complaints of the deputies   132.84978901493517
she was within three steps of the bottom   135.1289391377999
now that she believed herself to be no longer observed a sentiment resembling ferocity animated her countenance   137.77883151750305
you know or you don t know that that is what we ask of you   152.5051155155776
the comtesse de morcerf   180.78861647557153
i fear that when the torrent has broken its embankment it will cause fearful destruction   89.216196738615
why the same we had intended doing three days since set off   124.94028219939891
if you had seen at what a pace he came like the wind   56.03523945628212
then the king who without our suspecting it had overheard our conversation interrupted us by saying villefort observe that the king did not pronounce the word noirtier but on the contrary placed considerable emphasis on that of villefort villefort said his majesty is a young man of great judgment and discretion who will be sure to make a figure in his profession   128.56186973560705
this horrible place contained fifty cells   146.27502032014436
then an idea crossed my mind which was confirmed when i saw the procureur lift from under his mantle a box two feet long and six or eight inches deep   97.53123969959763
for you and for your companions to be cut to pieces and then i should have been free   126.204217378471
it is exactly for that reason said mazarin that i wish to start before them   132.38683298263643
is he not a count   102.98760087346248
ah said a gallant old general who in 1809 had sung partant pour la syrie we will not go alone to the garden   81.98582736899678
and how does m   57.01934582223228
but to his friends to athos and aramis was apparent a certain feverishness in his gayety   107.52195572632571
your excellencies permit it   76.4052282262121
asked monte cristo with an emotion he in vain endeavored to dissimulate   83.30057863720134
they continued at their best speed for two hours although the horses were so fatigued that it was to be feared they would soon refuse service   127.37347962351043
embrace porthos from aramis and myself   111.01209584843009
but my love came out from it more ardent and more eternal   126.18475601136188
the news which filled the palace with tears and groans soon became known and spread itself throughout the city   59.44134974123911
here i await thee   109.0287336754271
i seemed everywhere to hear your moans behind me in the bed and i dared not turn around   57.34210649171719
men who did not wish to be seen would not light a fire   42.41690498694064
and i will adhere to it   160.34765099486867
but it has none   128.83619180265043
count albert   121.77395397980268
go on with the lights said the inspector   151.18867678432179
your honor gave me two of these frenchmen when they were only guilty of fighting for charles i   77.45355068972373
the musketeers trotted up and at the same time the ten men whom d artagnan had given to comminges appeared   98.63740086728549
what is the meaning of all this   116.53091406274525
the doctor of the dead then laid his permit on the corner of the table and having fulfilled his duty was conducted out by d avrigny   118.72174339755534
has he built one here then   172.4749512463729
he says you were the sun of rome and that without you all appears dark and cloudy   206.21087739047255
vasiliki said he to my mother trembling perceptibly the instant approaches which will decide everything   96.05526888280335
the contract three days after the scene we have just described namely towards five o clock in the afternoon of the day fixed for the signature of the contract between mademoiselle eugénie danglars and andrea cavalcanti whom the banker persisted in calling prince a fresh breeze was stirring the leaves in the little garden in front of the count of monte cristo s house and the count was preparing to go out   62.292407004061445
in spite of herself her thoughts constantly reverted to that handsome young man who was so brave and appeared to be so much in love   133.61190406653853
we profited by this respite on the part of the government to make friends everywhere   145.56499989289568
but continued she lord wilmore had a family or friends he must have known someone can we not oh it is useless to inquire returned the count   32.56113261034653
spectre against spectre   139.01275546932234
i was determined to eat only such things as could not possibly have anything soporific introduced into them   140.4072572339359
no answered athos   75.29589389835742
god only knows   152.36260907063902
four years ago penelon was at trieste penelon count is the old sailor you saw in the garden and who from quartermaster has become gardener penelon when he was at trieste saw on the quay an englishman who was on the point of embarking on board a yacht and he recognized him as the person who called on my father the fifth of june 1829 and who wrote me this letter on the fifth of september   63.26286097051832
did you recognize him   205.07541528181105
the expression of terror which for the moment had overspread the features of the young man had now disappeared   158.45538019792681
do not hurry yourself monsieur lest it be observed that we go out together   116.67925658602346
but now to die would be indeed to give way to the sarcasm of destiny   88.13709824573276
he threatened you   114.1663018148715
i am ready to accompany you sir said maximilian   101.64800979017393
the young louis was already dressed with the exception of his shoes and doublet   176.3122390337617
what design can i have   84.69856079471126
you only breakfast   192.06400940933162
yet she remained impassive looking at him with that fixed stare which is tolerated only in women who are queens either by the power of beauty or by the right of birth   121.83511010499299
because going hence as emissaries to cromwell we became partisans of king charles   104.78047608293308
her eyes followed the motion of the door as it closed behind lord de winter and felton and the moment she was alone a fresh fit of despair seized her   96.64127630312683
the catacombs of saint sebastian chapter 38   158.0829033068096
come come said maximilian i will serve as your guide   64.45778652744409
and he and his companion resumed their walk toward the convent   121.27156273073112
for three days ago i posted from marseilles to paris with all possible speed half desperate at the enforced delay   115.44328257422177
therefore do not make yourself uneasy on your brother s account   148.39962375075456
let madame danglars know that i accept the place she offers me in her box   86.46505306720553
but can we travel forty eight leagues in eight hours   90.63986688780231
do not take any witnesses with you when you go to beauchamp visit him alone   55.2044549882294
not only in the same hotel but on the same floor   116.54377752005057
sandy hills about dunkirk from which it derives its name   54.91341361131889
and now once more adieu said morrel   158.99013616540807
what is this rent   199.4531217703045
and i do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be more fervent than mine   140.2957920702948
what do you say to this project   165.62403105752225
ah captain   111.44006138454947
you will lose the preference and that will be your fault   115.87244390683112
may i be permitted to inform my wife   70.52485894042945
but did you see the queen   112.89735651459087
on perceiving monte cristo she arose and welcomed him with a smile peculiar to herself expressive at once of the most implicit obedience and also of the deepest love   130.20455923937604
a few minutes later they were on board but the embarkation of the horses was a longer matter than that of the men and it was eight o clock before they raised anchor   157.0850506649972
the life of a man was to him of far less value than a numeral especially when by taking it away he could increase the sum total of his own desires   197.16865350581008
of all his friends athos was the eldest and the least resembling him in appearance in his tastes and sympathies   58.66341614831305
well no not very   180.24501482254746
but i have always observed that poisoners were cowards   141.84966392107845
go on go on replied d artagnan laughing heartily   51.779938888930374
the penknife   93.96009008442573
this calmness of busoni combined with his irony and boldness staggered caderousse   153.57686579265757
he lives at the bedford tavern greenhall street   164.05224514778425
they knew the count s energetic and violent temper   175.929855695411
i suppose that you think it necessary that i should disturb the repose of these illustrious lords to say gentlemen your servant mousqueton is thirsty   179.21701560902767
yes as far as i am personally concerned   95.37416755904587
he had therefore set off at a furious rate from the rue meslay and was hastening with rapid strides in the direction of the faubourg saint honoré   46.487628206402476
the picture seems to have a malign influence for my mother rarely comes here without looking at it and still more rarely does she look at it without weeping   114.6334058081859
tender hearts   49.81059365790557
at bourges   133.45210638577404
d artagnan himself was moved by them   79.68794096063996
by no means my dear porthos   168.72622513844692
gondy sprang to the window and threw it open   83.28093350365401
at the slightest sound he rose and hastened to the door convinced they were about to liberate him but the sound died away and dantès sank again into his seat   126.86427174007792
for there are two distinct sorts of ideas those that proceed from the head and those that emanate from the heart   40.33689673068518
softly gentlemen   174.5545785698331
felton s orders were for the rest executed with a silent rapidity that gave a good idea of the way in which he maintained discipline   83.35919541877942
a glance was exchanged between athos and aramis   141.6588223958773
take advantage of all and live happily and long   184.58299971563014
anne ascended the steps side of the bed and softly kissed the placid forehead of her son   63.9029655664375
instead of the costume of our fathers which you despise i will wear a varnished hat a striped shirt and a blue jacket with an anchor on the buttons   64.03866789151357
strange shadows passed over the countenance of the dead man and at times gave it the appearance of life   122.98951081641248
what is your name my brave fellow   147.80510143945222
d artagnan thought it was proper to follow this example   62.856251595375845
it appears to me that we have an account to settle with him and that it is not our custom to leave a place without paying our debts of this kind at least   83.45082392137026
the thing is impossible   111.66740445002287
you could do no such thing fernand   132.4209062771778
bonacieux was the very life of d artagnan   162.52984797075973
do i wish to know that he gives advice   127.04396093628024
never mind i ll fix that all right   145.57877817530482
but this dinner was not intended for you alone porthos   103.63864788258773
mazarin opened the coffer   103.07414909295206
go sir replied the tutor   174.23986835456583
the stranger waved his hand and continued to descend   138.62339877751216
but suddenly his purpose was arrested his hands fell by his sides and the half uttered bravos expired on his lips   145.49311107228928
molière or beaumarchais would reply to you madame that it was precisely because i was not that i had cured my patients   131.54747165336772
from master bazin to be sure   122.71605932679915
said d artagnan but only his lantern   167.15640059238495
edmond you have a very handsome mistress   190.6868095838257
the poor women felt instinctively that they required all their strength to support the blow that impended   120.15471672761191
d artagnan said nothing but twirled his mustache with a peculiar gesture which showed that his fine gascon humor was awake   84.19684560876118
i can tell you nothing more at present   122.79119911010505
franz returned to the manuscript and continued sir said the president you have been invited to join this assembly you were not forced here   121.88458566334633
it was time two hours after he was delirious   206.7311473958494
and why when everyone else was allowed to be ransomed might he not also be   38.54369433117513
do you think that likely   124.08687379914663
the young man pressed his lips on the same spot on the old man s forehead where valentine s had been   77.26464361729536
and milady went to bed and fell asleep with a smile upon her lips   20.191330236545483
that is another thing said porthos   147.95891901468678
ravishingly   181.68104065714337
the blow had struck home and danglars was entirely vanquished   132.66466294063298
and villefort without seeking any further explanation and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws us towards those who have loved the people for whom we mourn extended his hand towards the young man   5.36991407008334
but you are sure you will promise me this   108.89734786597784
his countenance was calm and his step firm and he was dressed with great care in his military uniform which was buttoned completely up to the chin   115.10810916443707
you hear m   59.86863878958112
valentine turned her eyes away and with an indignant expression of pride and modest fear exclaimed sir i think you have been guilty of an unparalleled intrusion and that what you call protection is more like an insult   141.92203331147618
oh that is charming said albert how i should like to hear my countrywomen called mademoiselle goodness mademoiselle silence mademoiselle christian charity   46.25860099614803
the president without answering approached the witness who held the lantern and raising his sleeve showed him two wounds he had received in his arm   168.22872211495707
i have no will unless it be the will never to decide   171.00236435086035
then though yourself a servant you have other servants to wait upon you take care of your clothes and see that your linen is duly prepared for you   143.77819857743242
i love edmond dantès the young girl calmly replied and none but edmond shall ever be my husband   195.9259825990888
a quarter of an hour afterward porthos appeared at the end of the rue férou on a very handsome genet   72.97300252403456
immediately the door opened and the superior entered   177.93572313727668
but his heart will be in the army commanded by the duc de beaufort   108.43286952516658
he delayed presenting himself at morrel s but the owner hearing of his arrival went to see him   149.8021105683365
wherefore did you not apply then madame to the first person you saw from us   103.89155913108645
but this mattered little to him now rita had been his   116.20930276582817
messieurs musketeers i will not have this haunting of bad places this quarreling in the streets this swordplay at the crossways   76.14212658458435
i dare say you have nothing else with you   103.4008745055419
and then he walked rapidly to and fro and pressed his burning forehead against the fence   22.110781298176136
your friend s lackey was leading him   80.84838456030869
0197m chapter 16   59.56387369459494
you forget that my enemies may arrive at any minute   77.99276266993436
i therefore maintain in spite of morcerf that not only is the count the object of interest at this present moment but also that he will continue to be so for a month longer if he pleases to exhibit an eccentricity of conduct which after all may be his ordinary mode of existence   128.1583593475862
it is eight thousand that we want to complete our outfits toward which it is true we have already the saddles   111.98923010633375
albert was impatient to see how he looked in his new dress a jacket and breeches of blue velvet silk stockings with clocks shoes with buckles and a silk waistcoat   86.80238740274015
we are in france and i am spanish   2.9876416780584947
now we have found everything except money it would be stupid to be killed   79.2252059037485
well i shall look upon it as an expiation   15.914995239353473
i absolve you   77.5271567032562
madame de villefort unconscious of the passions that exhausted their fire over her head at that moment held her son s ball and was making signs to him to reclaim it with a kiss   149.1598373927788
he was thirty three when he escaped   114.63536026822472
your having sent for me is another proof of your affection   57.52515654577754
a vessel was setting sail for algiers on board of which the bustle usually attending departure prevailed   134.32334436184186
with these words he drew in his turn and crossed swords with his adversary   99.42749147529773
let us manage it better   207.24945096653022
he entertains a very high opinion of m   165.82690409731347
i looked upon myself as another judith   158.2047416947387
you see edmond i am not mistaken and have cause to say spare my son   112.34063487425264
he turned his head looked around him and saw no one   92.17592439945666
i was promised he should die with me   134.6337248756269
the officer took bonacieux by the arm and led him into the antechamber where he found his two guards   123.73808219454801
like virgil s wounded hero he carried the arrow in his wound and arrived at the salon villefort uttered a sigh that was almost a sob and sank into a chair   80.86333484365294
raised to the height of twenty feet so as to be on a level with the window it had two lower stories   102.57293724445677
we must extricate ourselves from this position   97.95215100538643
said athos speaking in a low voice   118.9742428568351
they took him for you   168.3456873112905
how very astonishing   121.52882411244703
well if he does not come it will be because he has been delayed that s all   115.89701930070663
this space passed mme   66.59093750993591
the count of morcerf s adventure exasperates the young man   111.31504602068793
there as in every spot where monte cristo stopped if but for two days luxury abounded and life went on with the utmost ease   56.365435461582976
so that in spite of edicts ordinances and decrees there he is captain of the musketeers   154.6771643461954
it is he whom we must warn   130.82759907203143
do you possess that right over bertuccio   71.41800417890914
at ten o clock the next day they met again   97.6293422560091
my father thirsts for revenge as much as you do yet even he conjures you as i do to keep this secret   111.94971706084004
the heights of pindus towered above us   125.2048137467849
it is the same man whom i rescued from the hands of the banditti at rome   138.13544287863138
noirtier you intend leaving your fortune to your grandson edward de villefort   121.9393418817435
there was above all one room continued monte cristo very plain in appearance hung with red damask which i know not why appeared to me quite dramatic   107.66048655599
as soon as these studs shall be in your possession inform me   82.33306623805058

well then pursued madame g with considerable animation you can probably tell me who won the jockey club stakes   96.4187383219762
excuse me said d artagnan endeavoring to resume his course excuse me but i am in a hurry   112.5314602325951

but monsieur does not tell you silence with respect to me silence with respect to my friends   51.34642312746579
asked villefort after a moment s reflection what interest can this m   86.84166265294675
she is still alive and i am astonished at it   103.00622086666971

porthos made a thousand flourishes asking bicarat what o clock it could be and offering him his compliments upon his brother s having just obtained a company in the regiment of navarre   94.61856044299184
what a wrist   143.65908489775933

cried his eminence for the third time   185.55585310853738
at this moment the door opened and madame de chevreuse was announced   161.5567211237689
how not much   127.83855480527544

ah if your excellency chose said the captain you might have capital sport   76.32033750505124
my friend she is a woman   76.03721400174709
at present i confess that is the thing i stand most in need of   160.16618407834756
for it did indeed seem to be a ring which was placed there   93.1265254013886
is this the same lemonade of which you partook   52.50987080444585
i have seen them before   155.1056197606258
not the slightest but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere joke should lead to such consequences   182.5426877883475
for except myself these rooms would not hold a shadow more unless that shadow were feminine   28.409913935367925
why are you bequeathing all your fortune to me   83.72954363176532
villefort who did not choose to reveal the whole secret lest another should reap all the benefit of the disclosure had yet communicated enough to cause him the greatest uneasiness   97.18559713421338
but i wish to remind aramis that he can not quit the camp and that nobody but one of ourselves is trustworthy   102.49205821512771
everyone obeyed   48.6448549000801
d épinay became very pale   183.09824967189388

but i have seen things so extraordinary that what you tell me seems less astonishing than it otherwise might   215.6057627446679
we have given ourselves to you   27.41074104922862
i persist then madame in my wish he laid an emphasis on the word that your majesty should receive the coadjutor   169.30627136979234
cried aramis eagerly   164.53268322246814
if i had anything by means of which i could inflate the lungs said d avrigny looking around him perhaps i might prevent suffocation   200.28724597236595
by denying all it might be suspected that he must know too much to avow   154.77034089703534

but you my poor child   129.92137140577645
without a doubt he must   134.84644328334193

porthos rose saluted his friends and followed mousqueton   100.51709765082362
observed gaetano   97.97162707404291
is it true asked gondy feigning astonishment that her majesty summoned me to ask for my opinion   119.79468019580897
ah madame replied monte cristo all this is an affair between the french captain and the daughter of vasiliki   71.88654447127223
the guide held the door open   127.78565032407913
be assured gentlemen we shall do you honor in our dying   129.01158498008937
planchet art thou there   87.73774931242806
well then planchet gallop up to it whilst i tighten my horse s girth and come back and tell me if there is a light in any of the jesuits windows   106.35940913442244
then a piercing cry escaped from his breast and he cried still the hand of god   161.03820123378046
and do you say this wedding is at hand   169.50015143084255
athos whose acquaintance i made about that period and porthos who had in addition to my lessons taught me some effective tricks of fence prevailed upon me to solicit the uniform of a musketeer   81.11802933348767
olivain was at the same distance in the rear when suddenly there resounded five or six musket shots   86.81104009166155

de monte cristo purchased a house at auteuil   90.38454334667698
and she greedily read the following few lines my dear child hold yourself ready   106.67573277342683
replied grimaud beginning a fresh sum   135.40145373565664
but never mind tréville come still by the back staircase   100.82055400000174
and if i were sufficiently intimate with him to allow of giving my advice i would persuade him since i have been told m   93.87975421311725

at the expiration of an hour edmond was awakened by the roar of thunder   110.61535817645782
cried d avrigny with grief and surprise   97.33651562895874
the chateau   171.75944741587153
at length milady could hold out no longer   112.09827289659582
you have no more the appearance of coming from thence than you have of going there   83.37146173316205
france enfeebled the authority of her sovereign contemned her nobles returning to their former turbulence and insolence her enemies within her frontiers all proved the great richelieu no longer in existence   43.83778443599891
this idea was one of vengeance to me and i tasted it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my captivity   152.64093735482754
i could not help thinking so just now   55.50868681055204
i have let thee perish   114.22090598765267
monte cristo approached her and silently took her hand   55.79676348910402
caderousse lingered for a moment then taking leave of old dantès he went downstairs to rejoin danglars who awaited him at the corner of the rue senac   94.46170836734433
i summoned all my strength and courage to my support   34.04295728691817
one of your guards my prince   83.79409217503152
who could have said so the evening before   194.91913686259704
aramis at crèvecœur with a ball in his shoulder   135.51777713010358
but all this was so dark and so indistinct in my mind that these events seemed to belong to another life than mine and yet mixed with mine in fantastic duality   87.06391856235176
yes monsieur officer stammered the mercer more dead than alive at your service   135.00876988345283
as to franz he had no letter of credit as he lived at florence and had only come to rome to pass seven or eight days   135.83105171977218
how does he come by his name his fortune   115.04553801126693
himself who took a pride in being considered a past master therein   41.384373865030454
now it will scarcely require two years for me to communicate to you the stock of learning i possess   114.57672674639889
but he was beforehand with me he had quit the curacy the night before   94.99745011023917
these thoughts gilded as they were by a last reflection of love were not the less sad   178.23360069863435
but what he saw made good what he lacked in perfect comprehension of the language   104.14401115259327
i am your only daughter and you are not so exacting as the fathers of the porte saint martin and gaîté who disinherit their daughters for not giving them grandchildren   150.29445598319546
carlini returned anxious to see his mistress and announce the joyful intelligence   116.05998030392608
with that you may be satisfied he can make his way both going and returning   119.85286621062902
the color mounted to the baroness s face and villefort turned awfully pale   122.95472643261729
rochefort whom he had seen in notre dame   88.4800547554487
in short i see you to tell you that we must never see each other again   110.90756228758778
exclaimed the queen the friend of my husband   23.202063741877694
he gave them a tolerable repast   76.99518085060201
i feel myself quite in a humor for it   69.0632767244662
meanwhile all things considered and notwithstanding his suspicions as the wound might be serious he immediately sent off a mounted man to find a physician   74.4307426295029
and with these words monte cristo took from his pocket a small case containing his visiting cards and drew forth two orders on the treasury for 500 000 francs each payable at sight to the bearer   22.780163402206497
has she made a fortune also   108.06435321185555
chapter 42   82.51793793060881
i carry no sword this morning and can not return home to procure one   113.84816310098446
yes said he i came quickly   119.24978319468008
de tréville was at the moment in rather ill humor nevertheless he saluted the young man politely who bowed to the very ground   107.80113744323043
stay said debray   109.88206152911081
the conflict was not long   205.84973328647237
and he wiped his eyes still moist   78.18900504818386
but i can not suffer a poor old man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your fault   107.36337767980524
porthos had not only been well received by the company but he was moreover looked on with great admiration   156.71667378597454
his family will care much about such a trifle as that   79.90392241264138
art thou dangerously wounded my dear mousqueton   102.61288069638466
now there remains the chevalier or the abbé d herblay as your majesty pleases   100.5431802116535
thanks my lord i will speak to him myself   127.01148700362147
but villefort raising his head bowed down by grief looked up at her with so sad a smile that her complaints died upon her lips   136.1267852561282
the blade of a dagger was buried up to the hilt in the left side of the executioner   25.261675712694284
that s lucky said athos shrugging his shoulders   66.26745644279997
he will answer you   41.684981366903514
she fancied this morning in her sleep that her soul was hovering above her body which she at the same time watched   124.01791146176498
oh oh said the brigadier who thoroughly understood the trick   86.49970013060272
it is quite enough to have those dissipated which i had formed of my fellow creatures   91.67129652149697
depend upon it the custom house people went rummaging about the ship in our absence and discovered poor dantès hidden treasures   58.695618120068936
when this was done eugénie opened a drawer of which she kept the key and took from it a wadded violet silk travelling cloak   176.76655874177828
gad he was not so proud then he was an under clerk to the good m   211.77807072277926
come i am a good sort of a prince added he and although i like not puritans i do them justice   118.28351694753768
will you dine with me   62.73148316261422
you see then that i speak to you in the queen s name   121.79738536628587
d artagnan approached the sovereign with every mark of profound respect and having fallen on his knees presented to her the cardinal s letter it was however merely a letter of introduction   59.09662785870634
it happens well that we are going there this evening said athos to the vicomte   152.0845995690788
go then and find them   80.14798249496448
thus far you have done nothing but show them your fist   49.470281844172895
porthos regretted that he had not at once made the lady of the red cushion a princess   128.52690512024176
the hostess as she entered saw d artagnan and uttered a little cry whereupon d artagnan judging that he had been recognized rose ran to her and embraced her tenderly   134.8416695602601
so owing to your popularity no   95.11523730769888
perhaps you are right said aramis thoughtfully   81.28741082254328
and remember that i am waiting for you   126.97544908041888
in the meantime dispose of my coachman my carriage and my servants   114.73104081139553
well before you leave tell him all   30.313980731677262
and at these words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the catalan who as if fascinated by it came slowly towards edmond and offered him his hand   82.37088119010127
continued albert   58.4412912380803
ah monsieur mazarin monsieur mazarin said rochefort leading off his curate who had not found an opportunity of uttering a single word during the foregoing dialogue you will see whether i am too old to be a man of action   108.84684510005295
there are no unimportant events in this world and we shall see that this apparently slight incident came near endangering the monarchy   145.0421375493302
yes tis given   114.68562944720512
well what do you propose to do   157.52930937804507
what time is it then   134.26471530583473
in the morning i shall rejoice in the prospect of your coming and in the evening dwell with delight on the happiness i have enjoyed in your presence   88.23558698250432
but the principal features of his character were ambition and pride   110.69516993021058
shall i go and offer her my services   105.99869121723742
and now that i reflect about it i am glad to leave paris at this moment   114.30085277530699
all that the heart of a woman could contain of haughty contempt and disdainful words i poured out upon this man   204.57119384756362
then collecting all her strength she took the head of the young man between her hands looked at him for an instant as if her whole soul passed into that look and with a sobbing cry pressed her lips to his   95.96988950221171
however continued monte cristo drawing a small phial from his pocket i have an infallible remedy   85.71039266302219
jean where state criminals were buried   110.19181442011319
when the two were ready to go out the latter made grimaud the sign of a man taking aim and the lackey immediately took down his musketoon and prepared to follow his master   44.38240089897249
yes said beauchamp   89.67726311542309
and you can tell me so without fearing to make me die of joy   146.8765548192267
dantès had not eaten since the preceding evening but he had not thought of hunger nor did he think of it now   16.208291292116954
danglars but as he was not especially interested in poetical ideas he had gone into the garden and was talking with major cavalcanti on the projected railway from leghorn to florence   172.64878882304575
and how did this despatch reach you   88.82304527955944
suddenly the sky seemed to him to become still darker and more dense and heavy clouds seemed to sweep down towards him   146.50747775024507
the secret cause of my presence within thy walls i have confided alone to him who only has had the power to read my heart   73.12739887917203
let us keep that paper carefully perhaps i have not thrown away my half pistole   32.430568722025015
what you tell me recalls to mind something about the name of fernand mondego   5.444008347650964
in five minutes they arrived at the spot whence the noise had proceeded and then restraining their horses they advanced cautiously   44.52060272328083
who will be waiting for me beyond the ditch   106.6023751367101
let us recall the exact facts   60.54694512139782
the queen on her part thus chided softened immediately and sat down and in an almost weeping voice letting her arms fall by her side said pardon me sir and attribute this violence to what i suffer   57.956351364324696
it was then richelieu s object not only to get rid of an enemy of france but to avenge himself on a rival   187.98355424828878
i have assumed the virtues that i had not   9.62075026136624
unfortunately however morrel had not only engagements with the house of thomson french who had shown themselves so considerate towards him   129.9603170706737
therefore you see me prepared to surrender my sword for after having accused my soldiers there can be no doubt that monsieur the cardinal will end by accusing me   75.13119312778345
for like most men of his age and generation he did not allow sentiment or sensibility to interfere with a repast   176.2716501069329
d artagnan approved with a movement of the head and porthos with his voice   6.615872545786715
sir replied haydée i have been led to take this step from a feeling of respect and grief   178.4330544966888
if not let him become bankrupt for the 250 000 livres and do as all bankrupts do disappear   117.3719871657553
the treasure will be no more mine than yours and neither of us will quit this prison   99.66337280071929
were you at the opera yesterday   127.7121275388781
we are four of us said d artagnan   191.89725927349008
why do you do so   146.26130153845781
chapter 98   149.89172837441896
eight or ten   146.0322515897751
one minute cried albert without giving monte cristo the time to reply   155.84225174641847
it will be easy for you as you have the philosophy of the one and the wit of the other   164.84609379923916
his eminence is not gone to bed and will not go to bed and wants you instantly   107.71355097191982
but porthos was not a man to abandon an old servant and when mousqueton rose above the water blind as a new born puppy he found he was supported by the large hand of porthos and that he was thus enabled without having occasion even to move to advance toward the cable with the dignity of a very triton   88.37652186752108
there it is all blood stained on the desk as a testimony of the crime   122.44898909700058
i know nothing about it my lord   104.39246220840036
do as you please   81.6796828323515
very likely said albert   185.70673315938893
he saw that he was on the highest point of the island a statue on this vast pedestal of granite nothing human appearing in sight while the blue ocean beat against the base of the island and covered it with a fringe of foam   128.66278922006768
in a very short time the noise of wheels was heard and the carriage stopped at the door   39.12037883354377
certainly at your first request   137.75328919846402
a shudder crept through the judges at the revelation of these unknown crimes   135.80328835739138
here you laugh   151.32891218556856
and yet said aramis i am somewhat of porthos s opinion   57.13169642938141
additional terms will be linked to the project gutenberg™ license for all works posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work   197.46041117494786
and with the exception of a file i have all that are necessary a chisel pincers and lever   126.91343073062916
why did you so awkwardly let it fall   31.43875153073681
everybody noticed that the king looked dull and preoccupied   87.72674938455032
but it happened that someone in the house called lubin so that planchet remained alone looking in all directions for the road where d artagnan had disappeared   195.07364010630715
perhaps we may take that meal at a later hour and in worse company   95.78493886828652
take care said madame de villefort the king s attorney is here   82.04862158326036
but the most fearful spectacle was noirtier being pushed towards the bed his face expressing all his meaning and his eyes supplying the want of every other faculty   135.46376841960074
though danglars could not see peppino the noise of his teeth allowed no doubt as to his occupation   113.3131254370026
gentlemen said athos my opinion is that it is not proper to allow lackeys to have anything to do in such an affair   64.13105664489363
what were you doing there   115.17690167195089
they were his friends and not mine   94.64181657104875
at the same time he saw they were about to lower the boat   138.53407646148918
ah said the count you have then not forgotten that i saved your life   29.83940706991018
de tréville listened to the young man s account with a seriousness which proved that he saw something else in this adventure besides a love affair   164.8144908818735
the bills signed by morrel were presented at his office with scrupulous exactitude and thanks to the delay granted by the englishman were paid by cocles with equal punctuality   140.31589351160764
the war cry of england is too often in the mouths of traitors   168.89776609833038
on arriving at the hotel de la chevrette they found the baron s equipage all ready and mousqueton on his saddle   164.41643869541204
alas sire answered athos your majesty has guessed aright   55.68020723735259
exclaimed andrea evidently charmed with the idea of his speedy departure   92.47430497723826
repeated morrel   52.595379387610166
he said to the postilion eh mio caro   255.9737410561233
the next following days were occupied in trivial movements which resulted only in the carrying off of a few herds of cattle and the burning of two or three houses   58.884318930840884
d artagnan smiled for he understood that athos was sure of his vengeance when he revealed such a secret   148.59664753495218
his remarkably noble and austere expression struck morrel who began his story with trembling   56.749572512543125
at this moment villefort returned followed by the lady s maid   123.14179957511887
yes really   162.25457293005033
place the object which i desire to see in the ray of light which shines there and retire while i examine it   118.29187169649376
she will enrich you and you will ennoble her   134.92406916367867
my first duty directly i had succeeded in recalling the babe to life was to restore it to its mother   135.86407372357863
you do not make raoul work so he takes his own way of employing himself   109.43966313007996
said the young woman placing her hand upon his lips   67.1624258657271
then d artagnan rushed out of his hiding place and arrived in time to see bazin turn down the rue de la juiverie and enter in the rue de la calandre a respectable looking house   52.15037991802544
sire they are but men and men are become both weak and wicked   104.34244410532516
my dear grimaud thou speakest seldom but when thou dost one must do thee justice thy words are words of gold   148.36952737937324
you are not exactly right m   147.72511503800595
they had long since passed to dessert and cigars   107.88025098716695
she felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to magnify her own and still guided by the valet de chambre who never lost sight of her for an instant she was introduced to the magistrate s study   75.91565957199165
and while he descended the stairs he heard the door closed and double locked   97.42382228606914
we will then terminate this conversation   77.86877006405305
i hear no balls whistle and i see nobody   158.16416626701366
why when all was arranged   136.31262482043792
i never speak to his excellency replied the concierge   119.65314124010709
it was the man he called his phantom   7.357098347104568
he only knows that the power confided to me has never been made subservient to my personal good or to any useless cause   98.28276016471258
cowardly fool   30.03369348336959
both inclination and positive necessity compel me to visit paris   121.81456645576533
the animal began to breathe again and as if he comprehended that they had come to his aid redoubled his efforts   56.70758045365197
well then your eminence said the queen becoming impatient what is your answer   60.41337739399252
but to convince you that i am really the bearer of a letter see here it is   93.65249421458205
we are then reconciled dear monsieur porthos   131.0966048822122
why he is made of iron   173.83855332379628
he is first a father then a judge   75.60661732008947
let me carry it out and we shall laugh   158.05572758125516
yes the porter   81.05967448528587
silence said the abbé   50.35011674785353
so much the better so much the better said caderousse   77.39270052864617
well have you any news   85.24938156188357
your eminence is right replied milady   125.42662167160141
speak then chevalier   109.90223908663062
noirtier towards his grandchild and that he disinherits her entirely of the fortune he would have left her   150.46361541642142
repeated the count who seemed to hear the voice of the abbé answering him in those very words through the wall when asked his name   114.7661990830758
what an abyss   118.28578103948722
the king replied that the words spoken in that interview had borne their fruit and that he desired another under the same conditions   126.01095913913954
not because his dungeon was so very disagreeable but because his uneasiness was so great   132.32151336074253
de tréville that s all very well   184.07603786920566
do so then but let it be the last   127.4116399452802
danglars smiled at the good natured pleasantry of the count   168.94190961394406
is it not a joke   152.01595936922212
but to his astonishment the room was suddenly illuminated   176.6320529005029
we will accept them the more readily since we have them not here   63.37972072270746
by that time we shall have returned   148.00143611714802
they were taking the part of a plebeian and in defending broussel they instinctively felt they were defending themselves   149.54702820676246
and that name of a town or village is written in her hand   115.73202688319873
as he could not leave his chamber it was necessary to charge us with this commission   129.77107175728312
teresa had yielded in spite of herself but when she looked at the agitated countenance of the young man she understood by his silence and trembling voice that something strange was passing within him   96.87067729696216
never mind what he says morcerf said debray do you marry her   138.02704756160588
you can t imagine how much this conversation interests me   129.37016509532762
the four young men heard the news a quarter of an hour after m   21.576875346329587
de villefort and the radiant face of mercédès   140.69263802565874
come come continued d arminges to dinner   135.18802190595932
i shall work doctor when i work i forget everything   117.11965365462297
in that case they would have met with more fitting reward   146.32868446886027
whilst raoul wrote on thus sir after a four hours march i stop to write to you for i miss you every moment and i am always on the point of turning my head as if to reply when you speak to me   78.5970713727965
as a matter of fact said monte cristo approaching i am much afraid that i am the involuntary cause of his absence   138.96931984324578
the beggar chapter 65   82.60335226520179
what is the meaning of that   123.79446829877105
the abbé rose and paced up and down pensively and then resumed his seat   133.49003943725347
if that is all it is easily done said porthos   213.2464018616334
but i was told he had four millions per annum   205.2326064506591
inquired the young man perceiving that valentine hesitated   80.32524937948216
well pray is there anything to be so surprised at   109.79337152330518
we have not a minute to lose   93.22234750120158
during this time the executioner had raised his mace and signed to them to get out of the way   87.44186493010987
i make a hasty resolution   106.36737563476709
said porthos to d artagnan   128.23648198407705
i hope it does not exceed she stopped   65.20889032730504
i doubt however said la ramee in sprightly allusion to the silence of his subordinate if he has said anything disagreeable to your highness   203.27146457748546
i hastened to the river sat down on the bank and with my knife forced open the lock of the box   141.484836251313
and you are far too exacting   152.97433200072584
he prayed and prayed aloud no longer terrified at the sound of his own voice for he fell into a sort of ecstasy   87.90577099931406
and how   79.00629903155493
could you comprehend how the romans stuffed their pheasants with assafœtida and the chinese eat swallows nests   60.13929410745511
she went to the palais replied the steward   95.30092776757418
d artagnan swam to it and held it suspending himself by this rope his head alone out of water   119.25448337722689
allow me to present you my sincere congratulations replied madame de villefort   35.269117855531334
one would think we had tipped the wink   97.22483513207564
de morcerf the other day   61.31001939211715
now my daughter learn from my lips how you may alleviate this misfortune so far as it will affect you   71.21828382383625
we bear witness to this said the two musketeers with one voice   62.18697442986887
i don t like mazarin any better than you do   70.69802163232023
ghosts chapter 63   141.68373347402454
again ali repeated his affirmative gesture   106.10345299572626
d artagnan pulled up his horse and whilst his musketeers continued to charge he returned and bent with drawn sword over the man he had knocked down   143.53521926062248
and the count pressed her hand in reply as he had done eleven years before on the staircase leading to morrel s study   207.5361758630121
if you plunge a dagger into your flesh if you insinuate a bullet into your brain which the least shock disorders then certainly you will suffer pain and you will repent quitting a life for a repose you have bought at so dear a price   164.3726529308406
said monte cristo with interest   125.90454372868207
danglars took the knife in one hand and the fork in the other and was about to cut up the fowl   82.64315047567328
lackeys who have the order to warn their masters when anyone passes are not lackeys they are sentinels   93.06256150637401
on the contrary i desire to stand high in her esteem   81.69238673704582
the judges proud of having a monarch to humiliate evidently prepared to enjoy the right they had arrogated to themselves and sent an officer to inform the king that it was customary for the accused to uncover his head   22.568298877287617
observing his indifference he shrugged his shoulders saying send on your business those who do theirs at the same time   84.47637751816828
milady kept him within the limits she had traced beforehand with her irresistible spirit and her iron will   72.70028532869246
no i shall not kill you   171.6342948101207
i thought i recognized him and i was not mistaken   164.63885526480274
sire notwithstanding monsieur duke at whatever price it may be i will have them   74.00035791984288
the mind can see as well as the body   66.53143744298112
oh you encourage me and something tells me there placing his hand on his heart that i ought to have no secret from you   49.63044351758905
from time to time a dull sound was heard like that of a rising tempest or a billow of the sea   108.74974017342892
bah said debray when she had left these are fine projects   142.7774718321126
said louise with regret   142.89709795287374
count you prolong my agony   62.539239808089185
let us sail before the wind and unless it changes we shall be drifted either to calais or boulogne   106.0058877934829
the whole population was on foot   168.88077693707442
is it absolutely necessary then to send the money to luigi vampa   124.76634250010802
he therefore resolved to descend not through the same chimney by which he had come up but by a similar one conducting to another room   65.11819398409713
rochefort bit his lips in order to prevent a smile   69.02731596073534
murmured julie   135.9695116304485
the house of thomson french   109.21915562533374
you do not like m   95.32763851288786
they have with them two corsican bandits   43.55646974451696
one plan occurred to me continued albert   40.63537005606027
as for my body it is lost   184.3060414861292
that is reasonable said the visitor   147.3619177916608
he again took in his strong arms the little girl whose pretty golden head and smiling face rested on his shoulder and placed her gently in the carriage   90.40307062312763
madame de chevreuse and madame de vendome have left their names at his door   113.11074811190807
the traveller descended and instead of sitting down at the stern of the boat which had been decorated with a blue carpet for his accommodation stood up with his arms crossed   127.43084751110484
force her door   34.206363047984624
men avenge them   185.56315396602926
at every noise he heard the simple puritan fancied he recognized the step and voice of milady coming to throw herself into his arms to accuse herself and die with him   114.30978489031304
and since your return to england   146.96851543962543
he had not so noble an air as athos and the commencement of their intimacy often rendered him unjust toward that gentleman whom he endeavored to eclipse by his splendid dress   92.15210697708503
an officer approached   190.89956853195787
de morcerf came he would find m   105.62409290165489
a knife which she would return to me through the grating of the door a minute after she had received it replied felton   161.88001144696568
oh monsieur athos was a noble gentleman said planchet was he not   86.64880095924192
that which i have to say is too long and above all too secret   139.2327401014365
may i go and ask them that i may have the opportunity of making my peace with you   4.336154518679564
from this moment i declare the vendetta against you so protect yourself as well as you can for the next time we meet your last hour has come   126.11484329166842
the cause was not in dantès but in providence who while limiting the power of man has filled him with boundless desires   87.79259697216544
all the rest is my business   163.06237747423222
married   87.7997373606857
the young woman looked at him furtively   84.12805075816942
indeed he was all honey monsieur   178.90783791840389
do you understand that my dear franz no horses   70.68187715662977
as for myself i neither have nor desire to have a mistress following in that respect the very judicious example of athos who has none any more than i have   82.20551453911632
you thought it a mercy then miserable wretch   132.14286523675494
have you mentioned this death in your paper   95.93778909036381
the duke waited until midnight turning on his mattress like st   112.05723353736448
the death of your prince   150.28716874955364
said athos astonished   200.11119822636107
covet the goods of your neighbor   165.91022803711172
because the count is doubtless aware that i accompanied you to the meeting this morning   78.81802921384786
then i have engaged as my cook the cook who lived with lafollone you know the man i mean   189.28170371363086
no she must have conceived some pathetic scene   90.45391523044795
said milady listening in her turn to the noise of felton s steps which withdrew in a direction opposite to those of lord de winter   206.309133694643
finally i call those third rate fortunes which are composed of a fluctuating capital dependent upon the will of others or upon chances which a bankruptcy involves or a false telegram shakes such as banks speculations of the day in fact all operations under the influence of greater or less mischances the whole bringing in a real or fictitious capital of about fifteen millions   136.11330888726798
bravo bravi brava   104.04611123962698
she had succeeded   148.04179757838943
no no continued danglars   123.50833577564968
very nearly replied planchet with a self satisfied air   108.14364286249287
jussac fell like a dead mass   113.52001927621572
my dear aramis you speak like theology personified   142.6362049171511
morrel son   107.04839682757594
and he let his head sink upon his hands while two large tears rolled down his cheeks   121.49154661138763
it was evident that he shared his master s apprehensions   117.06408154261783
he was one of those english tourists who consume a large fortune in travelling   128.1363967493245
de villefort arrived in a hired cabriolet at m   91.91125480136317
you may see matters differently d artagnan and think otherwise   158.0453252155721
inquired porthos   100.36176532924574
you haven t the heart to kill me   141.59847596098814
very well said porthos we will kill the sentinel and we shall have his arms   129.87877809617638
but the vehicle turned to one side leaving the barrier behind and danglars saw that it was one of the ramparts encircling rome   120.54129810056726
alas sir said he i can not but perceive how sadly i miss the letter of introduction which my father gave me to present to you   9.618475195949372
i shall remember old friends i can tell you that   160.40485931388292
no time was to be lost   124.99440762547414
without doubt porthos had reasons for not abandoning this part of his vestments for instead of quitting his hold on the flap in his hand he pulled it toward him so that d artagnan rolled himself up in the velvet by a movement of rotation explained by the persistency of porthos   101.52414717012442
asked the commissary with an air of doubt   58.437475886076335
de monte cristo is as good as money   119.38123665347197
set to   126.83558461934551
the criminal strove to rise but ere he had time the mace fell on his left temple   83.43442803503996
to make a lunatic asylum of it similar to that founded by the count of pisani at palermo   156.06646092179037
nothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of our early childhood and with the exception of the two scenes i have just described to you all my earliest reminiscences are fraught with deepest sadness   17.025698653142257
the next morning at daybreak valentine and morrel were walking arm in arm on the seashore valentine relating how monte cristo had appeared in her room explained everything revealed the crime and finally how he had saved her life by enabling her to simulate death   92.11692886888726
on entering the rue tiquetonne he heard a tremendous noise and found a dense crowd near the house   45.2693671948889
i wish them to be promulgated immediately   123.06092521888134
ah i have come now to what is most difficult   120.89221652099492
dantès asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another even if it were darker and deeper for a change however disadvantageous was still a change and would afford him some amusement   33.92413662702987
but i did not tell you there would be an answer stupid   63.469035578414044
what did he say to me   60.61989557886871
terror was so strongly painted on his face covered with a cold sweat that d artagnan took pity on him and casting upon him a look of contempt stop said he i will show you the difference between a man of courage and such a coward as you   110.8881876756809
aramis notwithstanding his self control could not refrain from a slight movement of surprise   196.52379951120838
while monte cristo unwilling by prolonging his stay to destroy the advantages he hoped to obtain made a farewell bow and departed leaving danglars to endure the angry reproaches of his wife   176.4920419025709
but replied madame danglars the count of monte cristo can know nothing or he would not seek our society as he does   139.32044758594816
aramis opened the paper and in a voice trembling with hate and vengeance read d artagnan   194.6192204667002
peppino remained breathless   130.38356335563478
but she had her son   174.54474793131652
oh it was cruel to us and dare i say it   141.5652264808071
villefort sprang into the room ran to valentine and took her in his arms   16.158820099832298
oh i was arranging a little surprise for you   110.13757937542103
then his dungeon seemed less sombre his prospects less desperate   126.07245819666741
ah yes i see said the cardinal   133.71686109562881
and a jailer is no man to a prisoner he is a living door a barrier of flesh and blood adding strength to restraints of oak and iron   50.69795341756356
continued d artagnan with his frank expression   76.3869537915414
it happened however that the second soldier was a swiss of gigantic proportions so save that some few of the seams split his uniform fitted porthos perfectly   94.07619247679285
each moment s delay is an eternity for me   148.2709634022647
when this species of summons was made the officer inquired aloud the point of the brig s departure its route its landings   57.04013514657093
but the sight of an old man clinging to life with so desperate a courage gave a fresh turn to his ideas and inspired him with new courage   156.09884989042212
chapter xxx   78.64201054205857
i will tell them to send her to you   147.3265513203919
since you say i am sold   174.23192489355233
villefort went immediately   59.348372245713605
d artagnan was acquainted with villars cotterets having gone thither with the court on several occasions   37.491678429589015
the first moments of her captivity were terrible   91.33817156151025
said milady who having entered this track and perceiving that falsehood succeeded was determined to follow it to the end   157.15566103200618
the hour of the banquet being come the two guards arrived took their places and the dishes were arranged on the table   110.33369467322133
i was observing you both when you were walking in the garden and on my honor without at all wishing to depreciate the beauty of mademoiselle danglars i can not understand how any man can really love her   114.91737909882185
it seemed to him as though he were in a madhouse and was becoming as mad as those he saw   55.25159610845466
the scotch camp seemed as if at last awakened   107.81746276268998
who was your liberator   194.67058484275685
leave me i pray you   95.00846764608661
that i may not be considered as your accomplice   76.17939286382358
what above all manifested the shrewdness of the steward and the profound science of the master the one in carrying out the ideas of the other was that this house which appeared only the night before so sad and gloomy impregnated with that sickly smell one can almost fancy to be the smell of time had in a single day acquired the aspect of life was scented with its master s favorite perfumes and had the very light regulated according to his wish   98.41631013051378
i know it said athos coolly since here it is   61.18522866239898
this woman gave all the requisite particulars and it was intrusted to her   148.42288025185024
and delighted with the success of his embassy friquet started off at the top of his speed   152.7788780143249
really my dear albert replied lucien lighting a manilla at a rose colored taper that burnt in a beautifully enamelled stand how happy you are to have nothing to do   111.5304005356611
but you are here my dear fellow let us speak of you   150.97642187675382
he could not bear solitude shared only by two corpses   79.31341196586845
how so if he loved her   72.83698453668727
they can even explain the marvellous by an algebraic calculation they have invented   128.20880919178177
speak said the duke   158.72181930950072
but this vessel which like the pharaon came from calcutta had been in for a fortnight while no intelligence had been received of the pharaon   140.77847588713027
danglars hidden behind a curtain watched the departure he had been waiting for   104.7232862290209
so no more delay no more hesitation   77.81214765748655
monte cristo rose and without making any answer for the tremulousness of his voice would have betrayed his emotion walked up and down the apartment with a slow step   92.31422768172084
for myself i want nothing   84.79201470979118
no upon honor and by the faith of a gentleman i bought it with the contents of my own purse answered he whom they designated by the name porthos   81.609094967218
nothing replied aramis nothing   90.73602622713904
believe me it is only the evil minded who deny friendship   127.41186993806733
he rode up a very quiet street looking to the right and the left to see if he could catch any vestige of his beautiful englishwoman when from the ground floor of a pretty house which according to the fashion of the time had no window toward the street he saw a face peep out with which he thought he was acquainted   196.05511494108777
on the contrary be off and quickly   158.82555513327105
their anxiety about their outfits had all disappeared and each countenance only preserved the expression of its own secret disquiet for behind all present happiness is concealed a fear for the future   134.95136772315374
what is this that m   169.99098384068887
i have therefore received a very good education and have been treated by these kidnappers very much as the slaves were treated in asia minor whose masters made them grammarians doctors and philosophers in order that they might fetch a higher price in the roman market   82.13210160731991
true replied franz   193.30221220861378
he was accompanied by two of the yacht s crew   114.94237942245245
the night was dark but still the town resounded with those noises that disclose a city in a state of siege   85.00490315098574
my mind was already made up   207.08089409299578
give me the pocket book la carconte and find a bag somewhere   164.79793928065303
the matter is that you have proposed to me what is impossible said rochefort shaking his head with an air of disappointment   172.5726022555839
we are not living in the time of cardinal richelieu who would have closed the ports on bare suspicion   39.79803024278121
you no longer seem to love any of us   122.80571353329663
doubtless she is in her bedroom   114.10353634605535
just now d artagnan continued you were disguised i mean to say attired as a murderer and now and now i look very much like a man who is going to be murdered   60.883692724399864
chapter 49   92.22057169704948
i can comprehend that the spy may have been deceived by the person   80.39929658935445
now go returned franz or i shall go myself and bargain with your affettatore who is mine also   104.62205030453727
siete italiano   114.24708874812124
still you must breakfast somewhere   89.66425453895856
we are sworn once for all to implicit confidence and devotedness against all proof   126.6756964272777
only of this i am sure i have dreamed he was dead and you know my dreams never deceive me   76.8906155736139
so blind were his contemporaries that they regarded the cardinal s death as a deliverance   131.14957063894377
let us go porthos but let us go well armed   108.09472713986634
as soon as societies in forming had invented any kind of police that police invented mousetraps   31.167153568065217
50195m he descended the little staircase with which we are acquainted and entered noirtier s room   87.29764263559973
for everything cried d artagnan who knew beforehand that he had not much to risk in engaging himself thus   129.33775309322587
you are unjust to a great poet it seems to me raoul ventured to say   141.3709302456709
that will spare me the troublesome and disagreeable task of coming to you for money myself   112.37612185576047
madame we are yours body and soul   141.78524548531408
what the devil are you doing there   98.91109238728458
then he added aloud did he make any resistance   151.4704376219451
we must trust in heaven   133.0154664139052
aramis dipped a cloth into some water and applied it to the gash   39.017053215247714
this portrait attracted the count of monte cristo s attention for he made three rapid steps in the chamber and stopped suddenly before it   100.58441768278118
and since then we have not seen the poor marquis three times   167.92849940693006
because said debray albert sent this morning to request us to come   50.98093493180419
and unless his near neighbor and would be friend the count of monte cristo possessed the ring of gyges and by its power was able to render himself invisible it was very certain he could not escape this time   75.44508733392344
as to the soldier he only smiled   110.98814386825227
i study the useful arts   82.49070831029796
you are right monsieur it is not with you that i have anything to do   10.92868087286368
you will then obtain the golden fleece if you are still in the ministry   118.22652868004272
then taking the glass with a firm hand she said drink   53.93041388115884
well i shall see   108.16089568257064
madame he said you have wished to conquer the prince your brother that is to say the greatest captain of the age   136.03190510694475
and his buff boots still slightly covered with dust indicated that he had been on horseback in the course of the day   104.98743531762375
signor pastrini did as he was desired and returning five minutes after he said the count awaits your excellency   25.02489562031556
but make no treaty you understand me   163.04845628050364
after this i will think of nothing but eating and drinking   115.78270155467779
you may well believe that we will not accept such steeds as these in exchange for those which had been promised to us   48.68221335107983
he went there to have his beard and hair cut   125.6569998554412
meanwhile fernand made his appearance poured out for himself a glass of water with a trembling hand   94.29577934318223
it almost seemed as if the return of this much loved boy had changed his fears to hopes   114.03367979764755
i am getting more and more seasick   132.85941115519847
mordaunt bowed humbly   50.87446059467237
athos placed his two hands on d artagnan s shoulders and gazed at him with his calm sad smile   168.3055487313952
she will however be in the salon in ten minutes   119.8334143934626
to promote your majesty s welfare madame replied mazarin fixing his penetrating eyes on the queen there is no sacrifice that i would not make   98.62219566368012
the cornet of a troop had in fact just raised the standard of the prince   61.84101751906727
said the major who seeing the object of his journey frustrated by the absence of the papers feared also that his forgetfulness might give rise to some difficulty concerning the 48 000 francs ah indeed that is a fortunate circumstance   46.719102355182386
i was no longer in the house where i had dwelt   121.5156076705889
your very devoted husband baron danglars   119.89314903851741
the host opened the door of a large room in which an old stove had just been replaced by a large and excellent chimney   121.30924754456028
is it really for us that you mean your attack   195.86602223030232
you will give your name to the captain who will bring you to me   119.17831563731268
of whom do you speak   15.093162592379699
athos believed that everyone should be left to his own free will   145.95382994897977
the acquaintances one makes in travelling have a sort of claim on one   134.15811359455705
she found milady with a smiling countenance   122.67417080866173
the king was closeted with the cardinal and m   58.294868743153884
well replied d artagnan bending his mouth to athos s ear and lowering his voice milady is marked with a fleur de lis upon her shoulder   143.97511872398997
mistrust porthos especially who to please the count whom he regards as god on earth will assist him in contriving mazarin s escape if mazarin has the wit to weep or play the chivalric   148.4032881928149
it might be called a magnificent prison   120.75977400818881
asked the count again   11.821293892063721
muttered he   103.8821389354302
he entered and on his way met the waiter   124.98764591481176
if he did not come the painful sensation became most intense   141.2171811241244
a mere matter of precaution answered the gascon   134.27003461496813
if i have committed an additional crime punish me but if you will allow that ever since the day of my birth my fate has been sad bitter and lamentable then pity me   39.955625047688784
perhaps you know all the earlier part of it   108.71494632130552
oh yes monsieur oh yes   49.91649713335994
i have met him i am contented   184.04190807501055
has bedeau been killed   143.18092661207046
merciful heavens   41.946828974698604
no misfortune has happened to the queen   52.400408177816104
he had made up his mind that he would go to the palais cardinal and that he would learn what his eminence had to say to him   197.96835886734596
this philosophic reflection thought he will make a great sensation at m   53.89524733332153
the bearers went on for twenty paces then stopped putting the bier down on the ground   117.52769478424028
must aramis do as much as i madame   98.08557206150958
you should recognize him among a thousand say you   157.44407518392939
will finish by shouting out down with all the people i have mentioned each in his turn   67.85004723600477
will you have the goodness sir should you receive news from blois to send me a few lines about my little friend mademoiselle de la valliere about whose health when we left so much anxiety was felt   98.63137205306606
saying which he resumed the proud and sombre bearing peculiar at that time to puritans   183.47017913535285
pardon monsieur   7.92071410816034
here you are home again raoul said the comte   144.1723940179913
you were very much frightened then   84.78499943817116
he redoubled his gayety and carelessness   20.033421909691683
d artagnan d artagnan cried aramis you are killing me   130.11011067224212
ask him sir if he recollects the words he uttered in the garden of this house on the night of madame de saint méran s death   132.6717030242997
what do you mean by having made a stiff   4.5812660835370025
exclaimed danglars calling to his assistance all his philosophy and dissimulation   70.65189826961975
by the way resumed de winter stopping at the threshold of the door you must not milady let this check take away your appetite   135.71055586294236
de villefort s in connection with his attachment for valentine   142.38247746623338
first and foremost dear d artagnan we have no title such as count here   169.03676484748004
higher much higher   184.3431829137941
my brother who made you his heir died in three hours of a strange disorder which left livid traces all over the body   163.04646702269346
if it is written yonder in heaven that the duc de beaufort is to escape he will escape   58.453521977235326
tell the truth the whole truth   66.6389356934708
but he had in the visit he had made to the cardinal and in the visits rochefort had made him ample subjects for reflection and as everybody knows nothing makes time pass more quickly than reflection   75.36963374824586
for my part said porthos i desire to be made a baron   139.6746051258366
then i did not kill him   52.691890382570364
meanwhile danglars repressing all emotion advanced to meet the receiver general   88.47581792155552
i will go there also for a few minutes said the duchess   95.34172031668905
i have both reflected and decided answered he   216.25303047102187
of what burden is she   120.06401907557373
and how did the thing happen   59.928140518927975
unless which would be far better you form the salutary resolution to quit the side of the rebels and come and drink with us to the health of the king of france   44.80632390813071
the notary solemnly took the pen flourished it above his head and said gentlemen we are about to sign the contract   189.91453063446625
and she beckoned him towards them   162.74832555870995
porthos cast his eyes over the commission and returned it to d artagnan to the great astonishment of the young man   32.76760724877886
troops   122.92449615900814
very well at ten o clock   106.78542609503893
a dull and dismal light was shed over the bedclothes and curtains surrounding the young girl   60.209319422794806
order   76.98871857928823
there were two doors   133.51025642556888
yes said aramis i saw her also at that time   93.08492368857212
said d artagnan getting into his saddle   87.91502765850184
mordaunt had found it out and was gazing on his dead relative with an expression of malignant hatred   164.96653786309025
is this carriage for me   111.13791398318342
that would be fair play   200.4978333088661
the host proved to be a worthy man as bald as a chinaman   111.14001617582073
the moon which was partially obscured by heavy clouds now and then lit up the muskets of the sentinels or silvered the walls the roofs and the spires of the town that charles i   174.98677402034593
added he   165.0456639394314
listen you know if i may be relied on   98.69833165036914
yes i did wait yes i did hope count and during this quarter of an hour we have been talking together you have unconsciously wounded tortured my heart for every word you have uttered proved that there was no hope for me   193.87048611767722
go to bed and sleep   97.9826358515988
d artagnan went to the window with his habitual composure   168.56643642763612
she rang the bell and kitty appeared   97.38540536764839
ah said the marquise de saint méran a woman with a stern forbidding eye though still noble and distinguished in appearance despite her fifty years ah these revolutionists who have driven us from those very possessions they afterwards purchased for a mere trifle during the reign of terror would be compelled to own were they here that all true devotion was on our side since we were content to follow the fortunes of a falling monarch while they on the contrary made their fortune by worshipping the rising sun   94.6905688086057
it is no use said the old man there is no wine   108.37501761812653
and now it is too late to have them pursued   97.3223831985278
without being so far advanced as that my dear countess returned franz i can not deny that we have abused his good nature all day   167.31804638949285
it was a cold day the eleventh of october there was no inn or chateau in the village and the homes of the peasants were poor and unattractive   128.05084294492923
mordaunt put his hand into the hat took out one of the three papers and disdainfully dropped it on the table without reading it   55.55222801951619
apprised by beauchamp of the circumstances he required no explanation from albert   85.98212863953424
the queen appeared and was followed by the king and the duke d anjou his brother   87.56461228865007
not monsieur d artagnan   38.58152532756115
then the three statues advanced towards him with looks of love and approached the couch on which he was reposing their feet hidden in their long white tunics their throats bare hair flowing like waves and assuming attitudes which the gods could not resist but which saints withstood and looks inflexible and ardent like those with which the serpent charms the bird   162.58904267932257
perhaps yes perhaps no   129.4978794408534
but thinking the opportunity a good one he begged him to have the diamond he put into his hand valued as he wished to turn it into money   111.77121389455594
why you know very well that you are reflecting on yourself valentine   16.52537506488069
the count soon mastered the mechanism the gate opened and he then found himself in a little garden about twenty feet long by twelve wide bounded on one side by part of the hedge which contained the ingenious contrivance we have called a gate and on the other by the old tower covered with ivy and studded with wall flowers   72.72583007904274
madame de chevreuse whose name appears so often in our story the three musketeers without her actually having appeared in any scene was still a beautiful woman   141.83878024793304
oh cried edmond to think that in half an hour i could join her did i not fear being questioned detected and conveyed back to marseilles   166.11378772362008
danglars alone was content and joyous he had got rid of an enemy and made his own situation on the pharaon secure   142.0240323786348
have you not hit upon any   98.51064517373042
caderousse and his wife started and looked aghast at each other   79.53404885356821
you received a second fortune money and tranquillity were restored to you and you who had been condemned to a felon s life might live as other men   79.68857814334513
my lord said comminges who irritated by his wounds wished for revenge and longed to give back blow for blow shall i fire off a ball to punish that jester and to warn him not to sing so much out of tune in the future   135.33295011147993
once there for greater security the young man barricaded the door   81.1623837265849
d artagnan at first took these weapons for foils and believed them to be buttoned   115.42805006497842
guillotin got the idea of his famous machine from witnessing an execution in italy   84.77045604554966
you will be well fed there if the hostess remains the same   144.963416670295
and has this man displayed a friendship for you albert   102.3815413526893
as to the rest the life of the four young friends was joyous enough   161.3692327592094
make less hubbub and think more deeply   107.456375939461
do you not see   83.96343943349939
i wish to be providence myself for i feel that the most beautiful noblest most sublime thing in the world is to recompense and punish   112.48603340669968
i am a very capricious being and i should tell you that sometimes when i rise or after my dinner or in the middle of the night i resolve on starting for some particular point and away i go   100.01137528180638
it is not worthwhile to wait for that said andrea   129.51223974721012
he drew back terrified   166.3967986761757
the pistol i had heard had doubtless been fired at her   13.858473117870915
now i tell you mercédès i must revenge myself   114.35383471841963
what queen a servant more ardent   142.19125151092237
cried he regaining strength by force of terror   162.90026383389386
at this sight and this voice charles was about to cry out when aramis placed his finger on his lips and bowed low to the king of england   130.66609102631202
for my part i am going to pay a second visit to this woman who i fear entertains sinister intentions upon her own life and i have received orders to watch her   165.24799449808987
you said just now that the sea was treacherous and he has been gone four months and during these four months there have been some terrible storms   112.06037863529468
but on our return he said aloud may we that is my friend and i depend on having he his barony and i my promotion   128.08170905756532
the count continued i have given him renewed life and hope in the assurance that you have the power of restoring the son whom he has vainly sought for fifteen years   145.09695648904045
questions and answers followed in a nonchalant manner that made dantès indignant for he felt that all the world should have for the poor abbé a love and respect equal to his own   155.3147365999698
well then let us all fly said athos and leave nobody here but planchet to bring us news   164.46083785226952
he would not have risked more if he had said twenty thousand   132.22009943861718
but added he with a bitter expression of countenance one is free to believe them or not as one pleases   141.8560000179163
and with what did you contrive to make that   68.8837393375018
cried the youth   57.702003917610696
good lord try one throw   103.5240867245204
come let us speak of your little affairs   25.947104212645627
is the doctor afraid that you may be recognized   81.3069199156225
and you will do right   68.17087868685543
listen to aramis said his three friends   54.19593483653037
by knocking at his door   91.9340062223719
continued villefort   42.92001539002081
from pure zeal and devotion then   124.853135793083
why vulcan and bayard cost me each about two hundred pistoles and putting phoebus at a hundred and fifty we should be pretty near the amount   151.8301088279283
that is rather too philosophical on my word morrel   25.210245006888144
then he began to search   95.90581885226706
he sent one of his servants to m   128.20482373606046
he replaced the lid as ignorant of what the cup contained as he was before he had looked at it and then casting his eyes towards his host he saw him smile at his disappointment   167.39280207722584
excuse my weakness   120.85523173593864
that s it friend   43.04313604755657
no but madame de morcerf saw me   91.45241302463515
you are always right said the music teacher seating herself by the side of her friend   173.20075668065508
the three musketeers passed behind his eminence who again enveloped his face in his cloak and put his horse in motion keeping from eight to ten paces in advance of his four companions   121.70794157078744
what is that news   29.774000889832053
he was not deceived   148.73919583701712
my husband in the bastille   178.95587716004678
danglars had not intended starting so late or he would have remained   128.31647356959542
cried albert in the midst of the general surprise   81.5222819141705
the winking of the eyes which answered this speech was most decided and terrible and expressed a feeling almost amounting to hatred   67.02775215802791
providence still murmured he   18.67927253503062
the death of m   63.91204722668175
no pity procureur   146.5066437834814
and how proceed   119.67516869189203
you will one or other of you perhaps both return it to me at paris   182.82274439345125
said winter it appears to me like a bar of red color   84.69453775363465
she opened it and seeing that the old man s eye was thoroughly fixed on its pages she ran her finger quickly up and down the columns   207.24444229169913
dessessart who were passing two came to the assistance of the four companions while the other ran toward the hôtel of m   155.52560364232968
she wore the picturesque costume of the catalan fisherwomen a red and black bodice and golden pins in her hair   126.55190786659409
he was absorbed entirely by the sensations of the moment   93.01751543173955
you really disturb the conversation   62.36560626725029
the doctor   101.98261287710288
can we account for instinct   154.84530254860218
when are you to be married   143.77010788059735
yes that is very true mercédès replied the young man yes you have been cruelly frank with me   128.58779835822025
you must yourself have remarked how much you have been considered in all the circumstances   111.19505305603057
to learn more about the project gutenberg literary archive foundation and how your efforts and donations can help see sections 3 and 4 and the foundation information page at www   72.76964842318826
all you were showing me   23.90164653249144
and then it was that won by his mild charity seeing that he was acquainted with all the habits and customs of my own country and considering also that pardon for the only crime of which i was really guilty might come with a double power from lips so benevolent and kind i besought him to receive my confession under the seal of which i recounted the auteuil affair in all its details as well as every other transaction of my life   107.53584211631514
but he like public rumor lived on this reputation for wealth   172.65256551376865
it is only five minutes past eight said he to morrel   73.74259838166816
well then the frenchman took off his mask   110.20796872006935
although it was impossible that valentine should see him hidden as he was he thought he heard the shadow at the window call him   143.52429433325645
if anyone could have looked into the room just then he would have noticed the hesitation with which madame de villefort approached the bed and looked fixedly on valentine   152.19994855625222
we can establish a communication between it and the capital with great facility   156.872845347406
you requested to see him   102.0417303077927
with his usual quickness he caught the anxious glance   86.70494957849783
monte cristo shuddered and arose   144.88085450711344
i shut my eyes and i can see you as you then were   85.08788363821668
has a young man such as i am gone through this morning then   177.05447187336966
then said aramis in his neighbor s ear the conferences are over   108.79368078902476
has not a fatal chance revealed all this   39.20482743846571
answered d artagnan i believe we must   149.76551100780338
the gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing majesty and seemed to dominate the scene   89.38452663438815
laporte in order to be reconducted to the louvre should be running about the streets of paris at half past eleven at night at the risk of being abducted a second time   103.92293296208983
athos allowed the cardinal to finish his sentence completely and bowed in sign of assent   171.87676253934436
everything considered you are very well off here   157.2272848604053
i only regret it because she was a woman   100.34147610905532
add that the king sleeps and that the queen begs that they will keep silence so as not to awaken him   111.24604188230826
a knot of rose colored ribbons fell from his shoulder almost to the ground   128.6470938503909
the repast was carried into effect that very day and the lackey waited at table   131.6538088262083
groslow is the man who broke parry s head and is now getting ready to break ours   7.363960527245155
he placed the young girl again on the chair her lips were scarcely discernible they were so pale and white as well as her whole face and remained motionless looking at noirtier who appeared to anticipate and commend all he did   89.33744745325492
can i be of any use to you   59.97792925695275
what my maid tells me   73.13079001834765
madame de villefort was overpowered   97.15469252185272
you are not willing that i should kill my body and you make yourself the agent of him who would kill my soul   79.88010588587137
read me her letter   146.29231819006728
the appearance of the third gendarme settled the matter for a crowd of curious loungers was extended before him effectually blocking the entrance to the hotel   123.7940233180348
cried the stupefied host some wine   88.42125394306161
this illustrious queen had fallen low as the least of her subjects fallen from her high estate   121.72828318572894
do not give yourselves the trouble excellency returned signor pastrini with the smile peculiar to the italian speculator when he confesses defeat   102.52484679834276
debray to ruin me   77.741763364237
faith franz whispered albert there is not much to find fault with here   68.57608566160636
the punishment of death replied the musketeers in a hollow voice   120.60062002424914
sir i should make a terrestrial paradise of it   57.125697793489024
what could be the good of that   117.47774093559393
you shall live and you shall be avenged   127.10656805479002
just heaven what have i read   125.83941512504701
that surely can not be denied to one who is accused   101.03964756442186
go and call upon him in order that he may give evidence of your having been with him at half past nine   143.485448285176
yes replied caderousse   150.08441818000733
full then of this conviction he pulled his cap down over his eyes and endeavoring to copy some of the court airs he had picked up in gascony among young traveling nobles he advanced with one hand on the hilt of his sword and the other resting on his hip   116.84253403480076
and you will find traces of poison   39.8394121037031
let d artagnan speak said athos   143.55382074664234
i can t leave you alone in this abominable country   66.90522321324096
when they were seated in the carriage the president reminded the general of his promise to allow his eyes to be bandaged to which he made no opposition   86.95183451344852
hearing the name of morrel who had left him only two hours before the count raised his head arose and sprang to meet him   91.69911697017054
this made him less uneasy it must be owned than if the new comer had proved to be a customs officer   84.66611346295913
morcerf and château renaud were amongst the first to avail themselves of this permission   43.38639988684977
see what good fortune i brought you   82.8273305670599
the ancona road replied the baron   127.7484154803775
choose tyburn madame   54.55134387016788
he has been fortifying you his beloved child against the fatal effects of the poison which has failed because your system was already impregnated with it   91.38836726012724
that is because i am not his friend said she sighing but his victim   146.02531983926713
but those of others that is quite another thing   173.97021598435165
but i what have i in the world   129.71926455481986
at this moment grimaud appeared at the door   145.3119798355434
you wring my heart   216.08000514364835
adieu my dear rochefort   54.29964187706267
he recognized louvieres at the head of a troop of about three or four thousand men   138.37397281159997
we were having a confidential conversation returned valentine   93.53701356813065
now as d artagnan had been the hero of these two fights it was upon him that all the felicitations fell which athos porthos and aramis abandoned to him not only as good comrades but as men who had so often had their turn that they could very well afford him his   136.87024089357323
is this corpse come to life already   162.68114772854287
pardon my dear aramis but i thought you carried your eyes higher   69.2884784066541
but dantès knew it and had often passed it situated twenty five miles from pianosa between corsica and the island of elba and had once touched there   110.68501397367166
it would be very easy if you much wished it   145.6346391787588
you are a hero my friend said mazarin gazing at the musketeer with admiration   75.06393326086229
your hand for perhaps we shall not see each other again   190.44819942663116
she will be restored to you when there is no longer occasion for her   135.4993194441358
i am dying   82.04853734858344
upon his return to the hotel franz found albert in his dressing gown and slippers listlessly extended on a sofa smoking a cigar   109.0270257917217
signed abbé busoni   97.31625013023624
it is so rarely i make such a request i am sure you can not grudge it to me   134.6731599100497
well madame it will be a laudable action on your part and i will thank you for it   59.23484364315076
yes it is i said d artagnan it is i whom god has sent to watch over you   92.01580245313933
we severed our fetters with a file the englishman had given us and swam away   133.55161426876754
would you like to hear the story sir   118.46362780350294
is he danglars   66.42059931964724
oh heavens exclaimed valentine wiping off the drops which ran down her forehead   81.56928707239538
very well what did i say to you   87.86489268543656
chatillon and flamarens looked at each other   117.5053076434216
you undertook to do so   189.18581096531298
i am glad they please you   210.1787325577658
but what are you looking for   149.67044187437403
in what   66.0677923593841
said athos and we will return to that subject later if such be your pleasure   103.90582903891743
i will leave him at the place i quit and he will conduct you to me   139.64734286992436
the opportunity was good   99.17646908737257
but he is dead   132.16672622875734
this time without knowing why d artagnan felt a cold shiver run through his veins   31.93172714957744
the first thing he perceived through the damp gray mist was honest planchet who with the two horses in hand awaited him at the door of a little blind cabaret before which d artagnan had passed without even a suspicion of its existence   95.16416373094033
well said porthos i will run to the hôtel and engage our comrades to hold themselves in readiness by eight o clock   176.66559892070995
i have all my pay to take nearly three months wages   119.67385212299295
the count descended to the door of his mansion and beheld his carriage drawn by the very pair of horses he had so much admired in the morning as the property of danglars   170.47829131063207
i have assassinated then and not executed   38.7788015664499
to day the third will be there also   180.79397515305115
but what help is there for it   106.59474007364945
that which i found at your feet and replaced in your pocket   134.46601774665987
of pale complexion and brown hair   192.65575000070118
and you have learned nothing from any other quarter   152.6640046646028
she is to dwell in this place without ever going more than three leagues from it   159.24290449569858
d artagnan held the bridle of athos s horse and porthos that of aramis   196.55257038510996
denounced him as the enemy both of the king and the state and ordered him to retire from the court that same day and from france within a week afterward   179.6554536589231
go edward and see   88.10026660506142
in about the space of a second a private door opened and ali appeared bringing two chibouques filled with excellent latakia   104.05428257951775
thus in all their dreams their wishes and their conversations vampa saw himself the captain of a vessel general of an army or governor of a province   29.588803335930365
the house at auteuil monte cristo noticed as they descended the staircase that bertuccio signed himself in the corsican manner   85.15281296128389
the something rose uttering an exclamation of astonishment and monte cristo found himself facing a man about fifty years old who was plucking strawberries which he was placing upon grape leaves   84.7108624841903
this chamber   147.45622704363626
the knowledge of all which you will agree is not to be acquired without extended labor   141.01181342361662
dantès must be crushed to gratify villefort s ambition   55.22698421681725
yes you may as well take mousqueton   78.70613738739868
let him give in his letter   85.47494084596649
the commissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice every blow seeming to dantès as if struck on his heart   127.84142036653472
four servants carried in two casks covered with aquatic plants and in each of which was breathing a fish similar to those on the table   94.42041498284841
the count of monte cristo s   101.8996659497208
then said the traveller take these two venetian sequins and give them to your bride to make herself a pair of earrings   125.79836960219868
besides it would not be unlikely that they would have an opportunity of playing either the cardinal or his people an ill turn and for such expeditions these worthy gentlemen were always ready   148.95875985454063
it was nine o clock in the evening   166.65964364427634
about fifteen men were ranged around him and awaited the charge of cromwell s cuirassiers   157.73051407167995
she believes that someone has written to the duke of buckingham in her name   147.15638183421123
asked blaisois sharply is that their true drink   72.08464864408332
but the third time which is the present you may succumb   196.65184628731254
and the other i am the hammer of god in order that the divine essence in both might be revealed   88.4066152570222
when you can find out a woman s age by her face it is useless to ask it   143.22178340740498
chapter 84   129.34574048463998
from the ends of these two wings extended the park   124.7303626254902
escape   163.20153728092987
bravo cried château renaud   170.45101488689107
well said beauchamp what still oppresses you my friend   122.50771392993276
there you must find the curate or if he is not at home go to the convent of the augustines which is the last house on the right and bring me one of the brothers   126.7664209577942
return to france with us   66.41087028020158
what are we going to do i faith   141.6644036478071
30241m lucien having left danglars took his place on the sofa closed the open book and placing himself in a dreadfully dictatorial attitude he began playing with the dog   168.1367022313159
say frankly what do you think of this business   48.3660876106114
so then the wedding is to take place immediately m   125.13941517310437
what good has it done me to mourn for you eternally in the secret recesses of my heart   161.59720946935943
ah said caderousse no   127.12266990334824
i knew the horse he rode   166.12781427822654
the world however is mistaken   103.08848611221134
the president resumed i was on the spot at the death of ali pasha   97.45172790374045
but only one of these two is about to die   84.83082348791777
the light streamed forth on the gilt mouldings and the silk hangings   71.75565515891455
the light no longer burns in yonder window   123.35511824534831
it is to pass the carnival at venice   103.98014525726177
your majesty is mistress said la meilleraie retreating a few steps   144.5539461699957
and monsieur porthos finding himself at the mercy of his adversary acknowledged himself conquered   107.05514518820398
your excellency does not require a permit for the island is uninhabited   143.57324927347946
some few minutes had elapsed and the stranger began to show manifest signs of impatience when a slight noise was heard outside the aperture in the roof and almost immediately a dark shadow seemed to obstruct the flood of light that had entered it and the figure of a man was clearly seen gazing with eager scrutiny on the immense space beneath him   106.62744886666809
then we are upon the fugitives   63.32538732189192
asked eugénie   74.08759780052793
ay   115.47250239343533
do you want a map   44.742241691323215
then he closed one eye in token of inquiry   141.4776791301414
that would be a far better life than i lead now   152.6560018350949
if you be not it is a different matter and i warn you in the name of courtesy of which you appear profoundly ignorant that i shall chastise you for your insolence   154.1307955200254
an indescribable ray of joy illumined that wretched countenance like the last ray of the sun before it disappears behind the clouds which bear the aspect not of a downy couch but of a tomb   54.90116244847036
i did not even wish to know her name nor do i know it   101.65604795621422
cried he in a hoarse voice come here   51.5150660962645
she is goddaughter to laporte the confidential valet of the queen   153.5867442717402
but nothing escaped the count s notice and he observed a little note passed with the facility that indicates frequent practice from the hand of madame danglars to that of the minister s secretary   118.39300861286368
to the cardinal   198.63827639344345
albert took beauchamp aside and communicated these ideas to him   94.76219052035182
bernouin introduced him   149.26297991398727
this vexes you   93.0607189385715
many of our readers may be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in the period at which our story is dated   143.93041606009373
yes yes poor captain leclere   145.84027089305727
the fact is i look to my turn for keeping guard with horror   39.86057402713223
that is to say you are for us   131.38033217283822
morrel was not insensible to that sensation of delight which is generally experienced in passing rapidly through the air and the wind which occasionally raised the hair from his forehead seemed on the point of dispelling momentarily the clouds collected there   73.29391462115085
said d artagnan giving his hand to the count   114.50414012927563
come upstairs with me and i will give it to you   81.0392233408261
the following day about three o clock a single blow struck on the gong summoned ali to the presence of the count   87.93344865053882
i can send to each of them leave of absence for fifteen days that is all to athos whose wound still makes him suffer to go to the waters of forges   210.35329201038593
silence was re established   48.06311910956269
they resumed their route   106.81217869841933
the doctor without shaking hands with villefort without adding a word to what he had said went out amid the tears and lamentations of the whole household   126.8381226560731
oh it s only a temporary postponement replied aramis   68.87046899620614
have no more concern about me   154.84138580034895
i won t hold my tongue   105.44605714602618
athos alone remained unmoved as if no danger hovered over him and as if he breathed his customary atmosphere   118.1593580599224
and this all knew so well that it was a double victory for the court a victory at home and abroad   64.16927731022575
what for philip   51.334365166615555
do you wish to assassinate a man who in the eyes of heaven is a brother   68.73487630170763
they were giovanni rospigliosi who held four of the highest dignities of the holy see and cæsar spada one of the noblest and richest of the roman nobility   177.54608037273312
his first visit was to aramis at whose residence he had not been since the famous evening on which he had followed mme   172.58004795872313
shivering for want of a fagot   131.4510557076403
sire replied the queen with a faltering voice because in the midst of such a crowd as this i feared some accident might happen to them   245.80790583294367
planchet and grimaud appeared in their turn leading their masters steeds   82.00406567567998
it is in poor taste to make a display of a challenge   145.84506750213205
poor woman   110.32115379897773
he added whirling his sword around him   125.34957091632101
go and tell lord de winter that his prisoner has fainted for this event not having been foreseen i don t know what to do   89.25788105593071
monsieur de tréville was but a younger son of a simple gascon family like me madame   83.45460193573868
well madame said porthos if he owed you more than five crowns your horsedealer is a thief   137.81047661190954
the footmen were hastening through the rooms with waiters loaded with ices   145.45036994113346
but i do not think it is his right one   78.59792662139802
and monte cristo placed the bonds in his pocket with one hand while with the other he held out the receipt to danglars   107.82150756724624
seventeen   218.1455607481273
i tell you   118.36445085074067
a fleur de lis said athos   74.44202601466215
buckingham left alone walked toward a mirror   129.83054624235905
but not so the lover who was to have married her   116.24197083908334
danglars in the same tone in which he would have said oh well what do i care   138.16383980844978
doubtless my dear viscount you will not be taken by force   81.02422723063854
but when will that be   213.5267027236892
noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort because she is going to marry a man whose father he detested he can not have the same cause of complaint against this dear edward   127.13764430930969
what can it mean   129.92277173576713
said aramis on seeing them arrive   150.7113700180315
i would not go at all said aramis   100.08496217300488
you are there sir   138.06191644837386
is anyone ill in the house   113.38840429637733
mousqueton was however somewhat consoled by d artagnan who the next day told him that in all probability war would always be carried on in the heart of paris and within reach of the chateau du vallon which was near corbeil or bracieux which was near melun and of pierrefonds which was between compiegne and villars cotterets   83.32839798793802
the king s children next arrived the princess charlotte a beautiful fair haired child with tears in her eyes and the duke of gloucester a boy eight or nine years old whose tearless eyes and curling lip revealed a growing pride   71.41225078558263
yes let the sermon be clear said the curate   82.03698869811745
the walls are double the thickness of the rest   73.63278490567228
great is truth muttered the count fire can not burn nor water drown it   89.49348337452889
agreeable   74.19887740650698
but you know better than i do that there are certain reasons why she can never abandon mazarin   83.97007100071883
well he will do more than he has promised   189.41500286786703
the citizen followed him   15.183577090583384
i thought they might be useful so i took them   117.47073152726227
hatred is blind rage carries you away   57.817443273863624
de tréville knows him and esteems him very highly and de tréville as you know is one of the queen s greatest friends   29.132777899152842
but perhaps you have never loved   113.29798194390175
he promised well as you see first a runaway then an assassin   66.63796781781622
but the count of monte cristo surrounds me with every paternal care and i am ignorant of nothing which passes in the world   177.39119403031347
before he could defend himself that arm struck him so violently in the back that he let go the ladder crying help   100.43887759165828
well do me the kindness to take my purse which i left on the mantelpiece   116.0767122310294
command sir   138.71782931673943
i am not by any means resigned   102.46439888543512
villefort made a violent effort and in a tone he strove to render firm sir said he i am no longer able as i had hoped to restore you immediately to liberty   52.548181005188226
well we will go by the corso   102.73571937398675
yes gentlemen in the king s room   72.68747743861003
they are coming to meet us   121.08153557940537
what mean you by that   193.57142261740714
the footman went out   85.41220357404265
idolized by edward who notwithstanding his fear of the count s large black eyes runs to meet him the moment he arrives and opens his hand in which he is sure to find some delightful present m   141.28552342161183
it was then striking half past ten by st   67.32335649809593
she made a violent effort to reply to this last attack but she fell upon a chair thinking of villefort of the dinner scene of the strange series of misfortunes which had taken place in her house during the last few days and changed the usual calm of her establishment to a scene of scandalous debate   157.94766382149817
thou knowest that mushrooms from the wood of vincennes are fatal to my family   152.84922736147573
the apparent reason at least said madame de villefort   193.56116018726163
fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air but did not say a word   150.2135819109987
noirtier s eye bade her stop   129.16610144293054
as to lord de winter he contented himself with calling the woman who waited on milady and when she was come he recommended the prisoner who was still fainting to her care and left them alone   163.33885886897545
caderousse took from his pocket a small case of black shagreen opened and gave it to the jeweller   120.77285623176817
my mass   137.00833120891835
there reigned a perfect stillness in the house   118.81811845820363
then upon the lowest landing place he passed tony leaning over the balustrade waiting only for a call from his master to mount to his room   60.14984570706082
and on what account   107.09850535628746
athos had been out since six o clock   167.8743716593098
are you then come from m   147.50559519507618
and as the latter had told me gave me a letter to carry on to a person in paris   25.406982649607173
chapter lxxxii   136.8617805179812
since i set my foot in france and knew the traitor lived in paris i have watched carefully   61.01406490882168
he almost believed in the tenderness of milady   93.29494382796585
it is the first time i ever saw her in this condition said valentine   127.09968953680917
by that means all our secrets will remain in the family   34.41225891838552
the same thing that happened to brutus the night before the battle of philippi   100.49387815483699
to ask me if i want money   152.90286397822229
porthos had six occasions and contrived in the same manner that his friends should partake of them   118.99552559895811
was there nothing to fear   148.81776711717637
and when again our attention is directed to them we are surprised at the progress they have made towards the proposed end   73.28149864039986
de morcerf and that of the whole house he proposed to defend by provoking a debate on personal questions which are always such painful themes of discussion   86.98892798710635
so you see our papers were quickly written out and certainly do not come very expensive   211.12947689349625
now i can move neither my right arm nor leg and my head seems uncomfortable which shows that there has been a suffusion of blood on the brain   159.88542453657777
now monsieur de chavigny is not amiable i allow but monsieur du tremblay is considerably worse   124.69413489615603
well then tell him this rochefort   95.78721828395038
yes yes war said anne of austria   85.93730222599551
try   143.5363147912069
what can the chancellor have to say to me that your majesty could not say yourself   88.30551464841115
you are about to see said mousqueton looking at blaisois with an expression of superiority which the latter did not even think of questioning you are about to see blaisois how we old soldiers drink when we are thirsty   90.63723631299881
the two friends rode rapidly down the declivity of the faubourg but on arriving at the bottom were surprised to find that the streets of paris had become rivers and the open places lakes   49.0306024491617
and what have i done dear grandpapa that you should be angry with me   106.72192702105286
he was polite to me and i was so to him   139.54610500358658
and after pressing the hand of athos d artagnan chose a moment when the ship rolled backward so that he had only to plunge into the water which was already up to his waist   181.84079874399555
d artagnan was waiting for a reply to his remark and said nothing   169.0130260329909
probably lord de winter perceived this emotion   125.73004529929125
noirtier whom you see here   185.82792857990847
i was obliged to brand the guilty one   92.42041380500103
raoul didn t wait to be told twice   82.67483787083788
the image of devastation and death as the ancient poet says reigned as over a field of battle   125.01073148415739
when shall we two walk together   115.77479225471845
each of the captains then led his company to the louvre where the king held his review   139.0495042992601
the valet left the room   8.792452320469437
it is not sufficient as in italy to go to the priest and say we love each other and want you to marry us   163.55334069581238
there is an enormous quantity of rats in that cellar   57.6162119342864
the count was of the highest nobility   99.3055665473043
he had only found the first grotto   116.9477932417556
but look is not your correspondent putting itself in motion   37.77011571406322
porthos comprehended that this chest although it did not correspond in shape with that which he had seen in his dreams must be the blessed coffer and he congratulated himself that the reality was several feet higher than the dream   84.69006472421304
the second time it was to demand who had sullied my name   171.68238816952285
he was then reconducted by the little staircase instead of passing through the ante chamber where d artagnan was waiting   153.54449901360894
wait till he is set out and then marry come up ask and find out   51.61735431102993
he exclaimed suddenly where is my son   93.85623983461318
it is very interesting he said but it must be very tedious for a lifetime   36.537576647300625
your never failing cheerfulness raises poor souls in affliction   78.14471591881292
i reached the lower door   90.37585721946489
are you ready sir   115.90095799415727
villefort looked at valentine as they said this   144.80895005268124
i do not know him returned monte cristo   82.30579439593569
oh the women the women   180.99667491888175
a general exclamation of surprise ran round the table with the exception of the elder dantès whose laugh displayed the still perfect beauty of his large white teeth   190.8494064396279
most fearlessly   113.19737805444093
at the expiration of a minute or two it appeared to d artagnan that m   173.25948972182826
overhead i could accurately distinguish every movement of the jeweller who after making the best arrangements in his power for passing a comfortable night threw himself on his bed and i could hear it creak and groan beneath his weight   101.72862612599094
blancmesnil and broussel seemed in the highest favor   126.49138809206305
the flag stone yielded and disclosed steps that descended until they were lost in the obscurity of a subterraneous grotto   113.74557523241582
i have the price   12.245278024051856
you will also see that the greek servants hold no communication with those of this country   90.58531948439997
maximilian emmanuel if we do but discover him he must believe in the gratitude of the heart   39.975755948914184
my own eyes have seen the enemy extend itself between myself and scotland   143.5507685544313
i disturb you perhaps my dear aramis continued d artagnan for by what i see i am led to believe that you are confessing to these gentlemen   172.398379791916
yes i know what you mean he said   145.92070288779996
earth has become distasteful to me and human voices distract me   124.99907089901859
well dear monsieur la ramee replied the cardinal let him prove a true and thankful keeper and we will shut our eyes upon his rural misdeeds and put on his back a uniform to make him respectable and in the pockets of that uniform some pistoles to drink to the king s health   38.10084143980764
there was a great murmur of voices which continued to draw near amid which she seemed to hear her own name pronounced   142.1050187007875
i was hipped to death   213.9033589094849
that continued the cardinal arose not only from a feeling of natural equity but likewise from a plan i have marked out with respect to you   100.46552483637473
la carconte on the contrary rose and going with a firm step towards the door opened it saying as she did so come in dear m   158.78806930768354
but where is franz   107.57316977537336
ah exclaimed madame danglars alarmed what is there more to hear   129.59993268525142
oh no certainly not   97.05570530342852
but in the meantime   82.08973427614796
the child dropped from his arms and rolled on the floor by the side of its mother   111.02881274315442
well here i am proving at once that i am really neither the one nor the other by entreating you to keep your promise on that score   48.34605630286555
but one fine day i learned that the mover of this telegraph was only a poor wretch hired for twelve hundred francs a year and employed all day not in studying the heavens like an astronomer or in gazing on the water like an angler or even in enjoying the privilege of observing the country around him but all his monotonous life was passed in watching his white bellied black clawed fellow insect four or five leagues distant from him   245.47850556951965
this modern place of entertainment stood on the left hand side of the post road and backed upon the rhône   154.97672198327072
his head becomes weaker   155.8568719733424
and what did the count do   13.079545765580875
her name   124.37727093804176
de villefort for you must be fatigued after so long a journey   97.82186584323695
you shall be free to defend yourself   144.81928506864395
morrel bounded to the door opened it and found valentine stretched out at the bottom of the stairs   21.23121018560866
i should only regret if the horse had not proved good   46.211393251302184
but with what motive have you learned all this   74.88705035295072
recollect that parisian gossip has spoken of a marriage between myself and mlle   114.79774798594434
certainly though valentine still labored under dreadful nervous excitement she was better   55.17365532272031
is it not a crime to bury a living child in a garden   134.4467009454962
could not contain himself and he made a step toward the queen s apartment with that pale and mute indignation which when it broke out led this prince to the commission of the most pitiless cruelty   186.79289388692874
the captain descended last or rather he did not descend he would not quit the vessel   115.08839609801802
and i doctor you know a man does not arrive at the post i occupy one has not been king s attorney twenty five years without having amassed a tolerable number of enemies   83.202805844692
d artagnan profited by this interval of calm to send away raoul whom he had great difficulty in keeping shut up during the riot and who wished positively to strike a blow for one party or the other   94.54141839038023
sell   71.33978458459268
are these persons then so rich and powerful   96.69539460447423
do you know any other counter poisons   85.23557806383872
callest thou thyself eloa or astarte   147.1577682223722
cried the abbé i i die i 0229m so sudden and violent was the fit that the unfortunate prisoner was unable to complete the sentence   89.14991871296849
i shall be back here by the first of march and on the second i give my real marriage feast   89.17450614884513
ah ma foi under any circumstances   91.40262930002906
interested man   97.3513176132598
ma foi my dear sir replied franz make no apologies   176.2314416546394
let us see your idea aramis said athos who felt much deference for the young musketeer   188.91867589886579
but she could not marry your brother being already married in france and having been d artagnan stopped as if seeking for the word and looked at athos   95.92717154347805
he sighed for the galleys with the infamous costume the chain and the brand on the shoulder   123.34732037522342
that you will go and fetch me the letter your comrade has in his pocket   129.48178496670442
no sir i assure you muttered raoul it is not   46.1738774612116
i am very tired and as i have not eaten so good a dinner as you i can scarcely stand   76.072908814053
villefort fell on his knees   128.6410418907225
a terrible inclination seized d artagnan to grasp the mercer by the throat and strangle him   51.8580331871501
will it last long   98.92971167087184
this athos then was a very extraordinary man   85.32863949807518
and you have no way to get news of them   68.2670095922362
said he she is asleep   70.35181693423064
both orleans and montargis are ours   19.969233700265406
she exclaimed let him come in   144.971067393588
the count followed them with his eyes his hands resting on the shoulders of the youth whose height was almost equal to his own   117.31328514101571
eugénie danglars said monte cristo   84.80500093807049
be silent you simpleton   63.94329969522765
yes for his eminence will give you all that you want land money and titles   56.20076370202314
you sir   141.81853989608962
before the entrance of the magistrates and indeed frequently afterwards a court of justice on days when some especial trial is to take place resembles a drawing room where many persons recognize each other and converse if they can do so without losing their seats   163.1488595573981
i was trying on my wedding suit   111.80412148723202
one two three four five said monte cristo   108.53577590332463
let us be the avant guard said he to porthos and find good quarters at saint germain   46.611220799429915
suddenly   147.78805570533007
back people   125.33441279607455
the second was the crime of which you were accused when you asked for a confessor and the abbé busoni came to visit you at your request in the prison at nîmes   89.44235249260747
it is not so much the loss of the money that vexes me said villefort though after all 900 000 francs are worth regretting   70.65277366233552
and where do the servants sleep   53.07389578539889
there exists a man who has received me in this island entertained me right royally and has departed while i was asleep   179.3048758601591
but when it is not there are fifty others in the world who would do better than he   89.6172828222734
but we are no longer in the city sir said she   103.69509390057472
raoul had offered some opposition at first   102.71737572465726
what were you doing in the battle my friend   83.76152140308928
these citizens are dreadfully ridiculous observed d artagnan to porthos and went on his way   60.88771363818837
not one of these glances nor one sigh was lost on her   66.6322849634467
ah you philosophize replied villefort after a moment s silence during which like a wrestler who encounters a powerful opponent he took breath   132.15792257218723
50085m m   125.85284344786004
he beat a retreat toward the market but there he met planchet with his halberdiers   125.58186657250832
whenever monseigneur wishes i am always at at his eminence s orders   155.1825569817577
monsieur de morcerf replied the count your offer far from surprising me is precisely what i expected from you and i accept it in the same spirit of hearty sincerity with which it is made   130.51476305156785
villefort s dusty garb his costume which was not of courtly cut excited the susceptibility of m   142.0405600752821
de tréville on receiving it assured him that by two o clock in the morning the four leaves of absence should be at the respective domiciles of the travelers   188.5332014141827
you have been to london   123.10848481284967
thy master was in the wrong   116.15387624068343
but it is beginning again i say   57.714096453984325
will there be any mass   52.677727658478275
it was the island of tiboulen   117.32376294070974
d artagnan in order that there might be no time lost had saddled his horse himself   65.94733824905104
the first card struck off was taken according to your orders to the baron danglars rue de la chaussée d antin no   77.79778789835731
any why not this evening   72.88206810970436
if that does not suit you you can point out what other hours you prefer and in this respect your wishes will be complied with   49.05180054115365
vampa smiled disdainfully at this precaution on the part of the bandit went before teresa and continued to advance with the same firm and easy step as before   44.77590053480908
she stopped on the threshold breathed a sigh and addressing the queen why then do you always weep mother when i am away from you   137.83645863725206
it is a misfortune and government owes nothing to his family   123.77204666454075
he had almost forgotten his name and face but at the mention of the name he recalled his person as he used to see it the face encircled by a beard wearing the brown jacket the bunch of keys the jingling of which he still seemed to hear   101.43834369368949
when the young man on board saw this person approach he left his station by the pilot and hat in hand leaned over the ship s bulwarks   74.43633760032598
it is not worthwhile   97.18616662899699
he fancied he heard the sound of a piece of furniture being removed   151.81491525760418
at beauvais they stopped two hours as well to breathe their horses a little as to wait for porthos   152.3422195954082
very inconvenient upon my word   109.49554410302945
she is to correspond with nobody   136.47510248057492
because then i knew not who you were   86.52912371342748
that is had formed the sign of the cross in the air with his thumb and as he seated himself in the carriage muttered a short prayer   159.88351409320114
these two words greatly amused the men to whom they were addressed   75.97050912039333
meanwhile m   47.55515788908667
very well let us go said caderousse   140.5441026304933
my wife adores me and there is yet time   43.412812672621655
you know very well the wine from the hills of anjou   180.2338075028102
but feigning not to perceive either he immediately resumed the narrative begun by his wife   232.96152781656178
on reaching the jetty athos and aramis stopped to look at a little boat made fast to a pile and ready rigged as if waiting to start   5.648585892118589
nothing therefore was settled that day as emery s head was not steady enough for business after such an occurrence   92.67885498733663
keep your money keep it i say   203.24318380358477
you lose ground you are turning   127.01053888810694
said the sentry you may now go on   120.74765750486961
you have ample proof to the contrary if you look opposite said the baroness as she laughingly pointed to the beautiful greek   149.93113589432758
is it only the guilty whose honor is at the sport of others sir   18.6962922691646
i am sure i have and you shall judge for yourself   79.31509695041464
for i am a man and have suffered like yourself and also contemplated suicide   54.98649866964033
if we had been five   69.74977148169734
he staggered and his voice was almost choked   186.6508027112926
nay that he can almost work a miracle   71.26323450860929
you are right sir said athos   149.9551126244507
an overhanging rock offered him a temporary shelter and scarcely had he availed himself of it when the tempest burst forth in all its fury   140.49956950427503
what was the other day a crime is today a title to favor   99.0690264004629
d artagnan examined the countenances of his companions which like that of athos wore an impression of deep anxiety   59.84734926373982
i am much obliged by your kind intentions towards me said monte cristo   121.6058772405503
athos uttered a cry of joy and admiration ran to a closet and drew forth workmen s clothes which the four friends immediately put on   95.67395378582293
i stabbed to the heart the headsman of bethune without mercy or pity and he was the least guilty of you all   101.60389322635203
at the other end of the room under a white sheet which covered it lay the corpse still more alarming to morrel since the account he had so unexpectedly overheard   82.85643603310392
besides i am the person punished as that rascally horsedealer has robbed me of fifty louis at least   75.86393115254091
she also recollected the furious and imprudent attack she had made upon d artagnan when he spared the life of her brother   118.78895139728375
well i know of ten such men   160.73986395444243
well i was but four years old when one night i was suddenly awakened by my mother   130.11473034387183
but the particulars are still unknown to me   96.66138772434576
but do not touch with the tip of your finger a single hair of d artagnan who is a faithful friend whom i love and defend or i swear to you by the head of my father the crime which you shall have endeavored to commit or shall have committed shall be the last   151.9072452162264
he had moreover sandals bound on his feet by cords   72.63863169907486
replied the count frowning   139.38206920078562
ali had indeed given proof of this   153.77617197910268
she will take me for one of those wretches with whom the palace swarms and who are placed about her as spies   126.42259419229612
at length athos after serious reflection and becoming more pale than usual made a sign of assent to d artagnan who by it understood he was at liberty to speak   116.00746965361196
you spoke to me athos resumed of porthos   104.81089415403954
haydée dried her eyes and continued by this time our eyes habituated to the darkness had recognized the messenger of the pasha it was a friend   114.30426005799536
besides he had the cardinal s hundred pistoles in his pocket so he went into the hotel without a word   233.3675507786088
well i will go to england a second time   85.19031609656432

nothing my lord except that he is tormented with remorse   67.59761794581132
said morrel you dead   128.84359322662507
quick as a flash he raised her in his arms and placed her in a chair   70.72991490341073
but how could he risk the question   134.2802887843659
is it your father   91.03932493914655
the leghorn barber said nothing and went to work   90.95814837119374
at length the reading of the indictment was ended   115.6101734526661
then added in a low whisper you understand that on account of your uncle m   59.599040093151785

one hundred thousand francs for a loaf   182.95845058515766
also a letter of introduction to the count of monte cristo on whom i give you a draft of 48 000 francs   128.52084977684083
i neglected it and on the morrow a serious misfortune happened to me constance disappeared   257.76309382919163
as he entered his bedroom a man was getting in by the window   242.42399127849774
said mordaunt with a sneer there s one who is afraid   109.06771160757891
they withdrew to a private house and as they had reason every moment to fear for their safety they occupied but one room and provided an exit which might be useful in case of an attack   178.88301013142723
traitorous monsieur   104.93681676683309
i will be accountable for her said athos   122.28510567294265

what has become of him then   79.57708302851617
but you are rich valentine   51.64890595291247
the cardinal then was seeking to preserve him from some misfortune which threatened him   75.45587797724005
did he name no one in his passion   142.0297481650198
his vengeance therefore consisted in coining curses on the head of mazarin   155.24717767177358
then gentlemen you will not oppose our executing the orders we have received   145.61981777748625

comminges villequier and guitant were behind her and the women again were behind the men   157.7465535987973
the carriage continued to roll on with rapidity   118.1219040279231
resolved to seek an explanation on all these points on the following day d artagnan in spite of his fatigue prepared for an attack and determined that it should take place after breakfast   93.96898905331112
said he to ali who came immediately take that to my solicitor   119.19662937905107
he the support the liberator the father of the people   175.19800907478543
the count leaned over her and raised her in his arms   74.47941640805118
he desired me to tell your grace replied felton that he very much regretted not having that honor but that he was prevented by the guard he is obliged to keep at the castle   68.41977641058011
yes he has entered   92.183313135762
de beaufort had he not affected to brave the cardinal despise princes and walk alone without adherents or disciples would either have regained his liberty or made partisans   151.65287305432062
what lord ruthven do you mean   170.50052667611854
what do you say to that   181.64294765499722
shouted the duke   171.57500542487094
de villefort formed the idea of uniting in the bonds of affection the two children of these inveterate enemies   94.74550772019045
deschamps place beauveau faubourg saint honoré and you have my authority to inspect those deeds   87.93015843415886
upon arriving at her hotel franz perceived that she had deceived him when she spoke of expecting company   184.8678070455942
and let us drink   83.72087584527695
this began to be annoying   137.3396242258503
was she dead   28.70118301882127
dantès   159.02587454545684
monte cristo was for an instant alone   158.7398193151863
but your father died in your arms happy respected rich and full of years   89.05644442498578
well then sire continued d artagnan listen to the noise of the people   118.5560875350833
we are consequently not friends   31.647156310994987
while reading this letter d artagnan felt his heart dilated and compressed by that delicious spasm which tortures and caresses the hearts of lovers   182.14503402776862
you were   88.659376549948
for when you go to auteuil and take your servants the house is left unprotected   7.545347219064354
the king s musketeers and the cardinal s guards d artagnan was acquainted with nobody in paris   86.30469549794003
come said caderousse wiping his large knife on his apron if i did not like you do you think i should endure the wretched life you lead me   113.0287167327115
and she is one of the greatest in her country too   161.93318444822623
they everywhere expect to receive the same attention which you once paid them by chance as though the civilities of a passing hour were likely to awaken any lasting interest in favor of the man in whose society you may happen to be thrown in the course of your journey   128.7707735268705
sir i obey with pleasure if her majesty will permit me to depart   244.26052866204435
athos replied the musketeer   45.12667460253543
the little apartment was charming for its taste and neatness   26.964560447856513
monsieur porthos   169.20991834565118
fortunately you won t be laid up more than a fortnight   8.158655374007125
am i to put this construction on your visit   137.41081851960539
no i do not hesitate   139.572869317683
where then sir   177.90002806261145
and even then all that could be obtained from the celebrated dappled grays now changed into a couple of dull sluggish stupid brutes was a slow pottering pace kept up with so much difficulty that madame de villefort was more than two hours returning to her residence in the faubourg saint honoré   131.7132701797663
danglars was balancing his monthly accounts and it was perhaps not the most favorable moment for finding him in his best humor   142.23413959764673
sometimes he was delirious and fancied he saw an old man stretched on a pallet   132.3191641703633
d artagnan passed through the iron gate and arrived in front of the chateau   155.31314379711802
well said she you see he refuses   31.310520134210122
that is to say i am in the king s service and that knowing he wanted to send some one to england i solicited the appointment so great was my desire to know the man of genius who now governs the three kingdoms   85.0798666192904
embrace with all your heart the vicomte for your devoted friend athos   140.95020996129307
but d artagnan again shook his head   54.23496746732032
and if anything can be done well we will make it our business   79.6381767623547
lord winter was seated near an aperture arranged as a window to let in the night air his eyes mechanically following the course of the moon intermittently veiled as we before observed by heavy clouds   125.52457472734825
at this moment winter s voice was raised with the cry of forward   130.29439049642346
he has deceived her in her love humbled her in her pride thwarted her in her ambition   53.697203463516345
but all this eager attention might have been useless if the doctor so loudly called for had not chanced to be in the hôtel   171.35690637380662
the marechal de la meilleraie added that in case the coadjutor should appear on the field of battle it would be a pity that he should not be distinguished in the melee by wearing a red hat as henry iv   139.5774932997638
you will present my excuses to the marquise and mademoiselle renée whom i leave on such a day with great regret   58.597932375232894
she could not get out and had heard all   132.22219792613444
let me now endeavor to make you forget this temporary unpleasantness and offer you what no doubt you did not expect to find here that is to say a tolerable supper and pretty comfortable beds   146.3564174965258
upon the gospel said d artagnan throwing himself down by the dying man i swear to you that the wine was poisoned and that i was going to drink of it as you did   101.09004161632232
asked the owner   46.40224009427811
monseigneur said athos haughtily we are gentlemen and to save our heads we would not be guilty of a falsehood   128.2092503222654
their joy was great   27.30561183562206
important and urgent said he   133.48430917843797
the jailer went out and returned in an instant with a corporal and four soldiers   131.5671855774149
no not if i can use more activity than my enemies   80.94003521131887
the young man s words sounded to him like metal and he thought he could hear the rushing of cascades of louis   135.79784346750205
we will not venture to say whether it was from terror created by the threats or from tenderness at seeing four friends so closely united   104.17752848732718
how is that my friend   81.49510033902577
think for a moment   74.30044311764694
but the light of the torch revealed their true worth   143.42049088305413
cousin german   170.55821054573852
we are going to the greenhouse that you see at the other end of the grove   143.52132171195848
do you really mean you would go to his house   136.93211246752526
night came and at ten o clock they anchored   83.45959329661099
and that unfortunate on coming to himself found ten guineas that the french gentleman had slipped into his pocket   53.38079226302568
three days since you were with him in normandy   127.58573811122271
asked the young man surprised   156.94775359080364
morrel seized the count s hand and kissed it   145.59462881888464
life for life man for man   128.51656353205138
ah said dantès you might well endure the tedious delay   186.24987355285447
dear constance   185.88357926680789
the count made a sign to haydée to address his visitor   201.34162782729075
repeated caderousse fixing his haggard gaze on the count   136.07228962665818
i too said the young man am a musician at least my masters used to tell me so   123.40629238269689
by the aid of ancient greek i learned modern greek i don t speak it so well as i could wish but i am still trying to improve myself   184.76243812343853
ah very well replied the cardinal quickly   199.6341636987069
the great cardinal   87.56115097520669
d artagnan it is for you to accuse her first   145.09689073073432
my dear count said he i fear one thing and that is that the fare of the rue du helder is not so much to your taste as that of the piazza di spagna   140.76453695453563
you don t know them   117.4750886837962
he never spoke of women   93.74106570966771
are you a man of imagination a poet   100.87898183924527
without bowing at the feet of satan you will be king and master of all the kingdoms of the earth   117.63727103155588
the count took into his hands the papers which danglars had so proudly presented to him and read to the governor of the bank   140.45435188123326
my dear dame said d artagnan springing from his horse and throwing the bridle to planchet you restore me to life   159.01763252908967
take it   100.65677065420259
but tomorrow today it is time to return   66.9122097856403
of what companion are you speaking dear constance   106.00009460258248
no sir replied monte cristo   139.6717715734447
i can only say how sincerely i ask pardon for having grieved you   81.4447556864086
a bad relapse that will lead you if i mistake not to the place de grève   73.66076167704801
come hermine he said after a short time answer candidly something vexes you is it not so   117.71007951183756
it was aramis who broke the silence   152.66151551866363
said the prince laughing i thought we should come to that   169.52711047254834
your excellency is safe and sound   76.18854417128188
well then i will buy it of you   134.29353859952002
d artagnan was not less exact to his appointment and at half past nine o clock he entered the ante room   133.95884562196622
on the walls over the doors on the ceiling were swords daggers malay creeses maces battle axes   113.78523922913675
ah no madame that could not be   149.51391747771572
the balance would come to about that sum   121.00849646962219
i had one sir and thank god such as i could wish cried d artagnan   70.23828628998584
inquired the other   119.79500602812038
we shall see monsieur cardinal we shall see said the king who in his joy at finding the queen guilty of a crime which he cared little about and innocent of a fault of which he had great dread was ready to make up all differences with her we shall see but upon my honor you are too indulgent toward her   93.4599346737464
i know the house where you heard it or one very similar to it   111.69059014163419
you ve killed him i think   117.55680077046068
and what brought you here   187.9259952668521

andrea who had often stayed there in his rides about paris recollected the bell and bottle inn   136.15181157245019
pray let us come more to the point and endeavor thoroughly to understand each other   100.13891070703662
here is what i am looking for thought d artagnan   201.9599467183749
we have had great annoyances there   108.38335547956834
because that which she does is part of a plan concerted between you of an infernal plan   133.22131531537914
a moment afterwards julie saw him go upstairs carrying two or three heavy ledgers a portfolio and a bag of money   85.84308752706389
very well mordaunt exclaimed cromwell pleased at having his opinion of the young man raised once more   92.42418104027712
i then recollected you gave a breakfast this morning and here i am   46.53138503607184
well said the jeweller as he placed himself at table all i can say is so much the worse for those who are abroad   88.66713313229889
said d artagnan stooping in his turn on the neck of his horse and answering on his side through the carriage window   127.8414736607506
how did you obtain these details   140.50195096022054
monsieur bertuccio said the count did you never tell me that you had travelled in france   39.30801266600318
but come what is this about   122.04211995658494
i prefer complete histories   179.97136390068297
seeing a stranger escorted by two turnkeys holding torches and accompanied by two soldiers and to whom the governor spoke bareheaded dantès who guessed the truth and that the moment to address himself to the superior authorities was come sprang forward with clasped hands   107.43078729096146
let us try first to save the victim before we think of revenging her said d avrigny   64.6849497050875
but know that if you had even hidden your irregularities from your husband who has but the commencement of the art for generally husbands will not see you would then have been but a faint imitation of most of your friends among the women of the world   109.38661027996305
yes yes said de guiche a strange face   187.45606030061884
they quitted paris beholding it abandoned to extreme want bordering on famine   112.3221187232519
i have both seen and heard her   140.09796708916286
the jeweller took the ring and drawing from his pocket a pair of steel pliers and a small set of copper scales he took the stone out of its setting and weighed it carefully   43.72666831907782
de nargonne your first husband being neither a philosopher nor a banker or perhaps being both and seeing there was nothing to be got out of a king s attorney died of grief or anger at finding after an absence of nine months that you had been enceinte six   142.80175210512752
besides you must have seen that the person to whom i spoke was a woman   57.82760139234534
are you so kind so good so unsuspicious of ill that you can not understand valentine   172.04407062202546
there he would inquire concerning the bracieux estate and go to the right or to the left according to the information obtained   86.73361792114588
madame replied villefort with a mournful smile i have already had the honor to observe that my father has at least i hope so abjured his past errors and that he is at the present moment a firm and zealous friend to religion and order a better royalist possibly than his son   154.50427504083646
danglars thought for ten minutes about his wife in paris   160.77417103399495
how should i know   86.54143893036223
twenty four years ago i returned proud and joyful to my country   135.07463451185208

de tréville and walking with him toward the embrasure of a window well monsieur continued he you say it is his eminence s guards who have sought a quarrel with your musketeers   104.4440219136432

suppose her majesty refuses   107.37711480760701
to know what   100.85109103525275
and all this all this because my heart which i thought dead was only sleeping   154.40584887491227
mazarin wished to call out but porthos held him tight and passed him to d artagnan who seized him by the neck and made him sit down by him   95.57004889181925
report to the king the condition of affairs   100.11362564824024
avow freely that you accuse him   54.15827407476455
i will supply you with the means of supporting your accusation for i know the fact well   84.34233353640568
it is in truth monsieur le coadjuteur s carriage said d artagnan   71.3183919393978
the count stopped on seeing the young man   126.01521332116982
and you have been here since about a quarter of an hour said d artagnan motioning to porthos not to contradict him   106.65552287723123
you are decidedly right and we may reach the palazzo by two o clock   199.5941881643438
cried grimaud and i will remain beside him here   94.46063312725249
and rely upon it if the letter is found he will not be likely to be trusted abroad again unless he goes forth under the especial protection of the headsman   138.38302472563834
then as she had done the evening before she fell on her knees and repeated her prayers aloud   93.35461354189205
lord de winter took a chair drew it toward her and sat down close beside her   184.00067723765832
i sought out the best fencing master in paris i made an agreement with him to take a lesson every day and every day for a year i took that lesson   181.44190574335568

athos is so cool so brave and handles his sword so skillfully   94.58341038062306
he immediately therefore took to his heels and ran toward the camp with the swiftness of the young men of his country so renowned for their agility   113.31325945439843
there was nothing but felicitations pressures of the hand and embraces   122.49383839057415

i extended my hand and was about to pledge myself by any promise he would dictate but he stopped me   42.74772308213804
but passion or thirst as the reader pleases   101.39775068342789
chapter 85   57.80819780673344
i have no fear of that   126.36867967221936

yes i recognize it   141.36625222360317
monsieur the comte de la fere whose family is allied to the montmorency and the rohan is easily the equal of monsieur de mazarin   129.04057332688313
it was almost a triumphal procession   95.32629748937512
something was at work on the other side of the wall   198.8770536686836
what say you to that   32.88406425436938
promise me that and i will die with that hope   139.26314838721876
but why did she return to tours without telling me anything   71.80217384935699

i have passed a considerable part of my life in the east madame and you are doubtless aware that the orientals value only two things the fine breeding of their horses and the beauty of their women   177.33310012655753
ah said the major taking a second biscuit that consummation of my happiness was indeed wanting   26.175459635754024
ah you are only one and twenty and can forget the past   185.33448965279422
i have sent for one replied the abbé   42.93691391669826
for you hear that instead of becoming calmer the noise increases   84.99577817202191
in the course of the day madame de lannoy in her quality of tire woman of the queen looked for this casket appeared uneasy at not finding it and at length asked information of the queen   233.70507292524377
napoleon would doubtless have deprived villefort of his office had it not been for noirtier who was all powerful at court and thus the girondin of 93 and the senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had been his protector   157.10873532189692
then i forgive you said the man dropping his cloak and advancing to the light   210.47959419880277
i see your features regain their calmness your countenance recovers its assurance   105.00895287046686
that s well said athos let us go home and read it   133.70043367362362
the second night the door opened   175.26876340847338
two strokes took the bark on twenty fathoms further   50.63204901987875
the same as yesterday   178.0800076065172
it was the queen   122.59368562318411
two hours passed thus during which i imagined i heard moans repeatedly   165.3350711233756
villefort from his study heard the successive noises which accompany the life of a house the opening and shutting of doors the ringing of madame de villefort s bell to summon the waiting maid mingled with the first shouts of the child who rose full of the enjoyment of his age   141.02867527391805
be assured that i am devoted to both these all powerful masters and that my earnest endeavors have no other aim than the service of the king and also the cardinal one of the most illustrious geniuses that france has ever produced   26.825610309187326
and monsieur and the other nobles were dressed like him   127.51310681370772
false   74.38168474454224
the name of d artagnan was not altogether new to mazarin who although he did not arrive in france before the year 1634 or 1635 that is to say about eight or nine years after the events which we have related in a preceding narrative fancied he had heard it pronounced as that of one who was said to be a model of courage address and loyalty   111.10247657891448
daggers and swords were just about to shine when suddenly the door was thrown open and harrison appeared in the doorway accompanied by a man enveloped in a large cloak   131.15365836128743
when we arrive at the summit of our wishes success has usually the power to drive away sleep on the first night after the fulfilment of long cherished hopes   165.69298287133478
i the offspring of a noble family who placed reliance upon your friendship i was near dying of my wounds at first and of hunger afterward in a beggarly inn at chantilly without you ever deigning once to reply to the burning letters i addressed to you   74.8287147664912
d artagnan turned round as if a serpent had stung him and fixed his eyes intensely upon the guardsman who had just made this insolent speech   4.457244691975561
unhappy man you named no one i hope   97.57097249306233
you have them   108.58618520608569
one single solitary light was burning there and it appeared like a star set in a heaven of blackness   96.18820409270249
the queen though occupied by a thousand details tried to catch the gascon s eye   107.77469968867058
andrea arose   88.20001953814565
and do you call a man your friend whom you have only known for eight or ten days   144.64830101745216
manage the matter as well as you can my good man   54.636472788937
noirtier looked upon morrel with one of those melancholy smiles which had so often made valentine happy and thus fixed his attention   108.38389572432175
but as she was prudent and strong minded she concealed both her sorrows and her fears   145.98197341849053
come and sit down close to me said milady   100.9491780719617
are you certain of it sir   67.55506499011861
excuse my not coming to meet you   114.48541044846084
were i but a frenchman   95.97440407153296
the explosion would have done what the axe had failed to do   102.37286599914627
canimus surdis replied the king continuing the annotations in his horace   111.48833029685878
a handkerchief tied at the four corners is to be the signal   32.96593990316187
then you would have killed monsieur de marsillac if he had come alone to attack you instead of at the head of twenty men   59.62598944804767
never again to see the face never again to hear the voice of the only human being who united him to earth   107.01584735955959
the door opened gently   98.67892668895719
toward paris   91.96853233196106
the cardinal has said several things which have agitated me therefore i will not speak more fully now   181.6374761976076
it is a small place i have purchased quite lately   207.8481181619864
from whom have you learned of the abduction of your wife   140.05402886285302
yes my dear count i heard it   81.22147692844493
is it possible that rochefort has become a better man than i am   57.656731807398266
the baron might possibly have perceived it but attributing it to a caprice feigned ignorance   19.925277151766508
i am almost inclined to ask you as though you had experienced death is it painful to die   64.03783024403802
send the guards to take their meal in the canteen of monsieur de chavigny   135.4194810730854
this count of monte cristo is a strange man said emmanuel   144.31136473512802
de morcerf does not know these pistols you may readily believe that your word will be quite sufficient   150.79168940838045
madame said villefort you must lay aside these exalted ideas which almost assume the appearance of madness   101.82338911030895
the count withdrew for a moment   72.86470985626971
the young man returned home and waited all the evening and all the next day without getting any message   118.88471088502048
as for andrea he began by way of showing off to scold his groom who instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house had taken it to the outer door thus giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps to reach it   87.64998899203071
soon nothing was to be seen except his long floating hair   183.91733611151466
in what year you ask me in what year   123.208543542536
that is to say stammered milady i am not really very intimate with any of them   138.4657717577243
said monte cristo in the tone which a father would use towards a son   81.35085676096914
franz who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to albert s request but at once accompanied him to the desired spot and after a short delay the count joined them in the salon   70.18214327145529
that no letters were found upon him it is true but that torture may make him tell much of what he knows and even what he does not know   69.73530613907184
queer though   86.1062873837212
never had she appeared more beautiful   125.46069084519857
oh i made no allusion of that kind replied morrel   139.0671529554233
why i have only had the honor of being in her society and conversing with her three or four times in my life   145.00919300372908
the count laid his hand on franz s shoulder   64.3916088387448
felt instinctively that he ought not to reply to this question the queen having put it in an almost dying voice   94.8282663050089
and you will protect us who are your children against the will of my father   88.56551314560579
i give you my word   171.32410649825977
playing the day before   40.414837584598146
the noise of the waves dashing against the rocks on which the château is built reached dantès ear distinctly as they went forward   2.5679067652094716
if there are two let parry kill one and you the other   171.88051496720524
it is charming let them finish one moment   20.199481181652075
so too was the door of athos s chamber and that of the park   46.1850449770203
de monte cristo yields his right of using his   105.89698435546819
muttered albert   98.52718311331493
well said she returning the knife to the young officer this is fine and good steel   185.096956955791
they reached the building ornamented with magnificent fruits which ripen at the beginning of july in the artificial temperature which takes the place of the sun so frequently absent in our climate   150.66181288708435
and how the devil did you escape   96.65234547129462
then taking a paper out of his pocket he unfolded it slowly   120.363554123379
his coat closely buttoned up and constantly taking out his pencil   70.75934667915493
chapter 95   148.5436779352682
one of the grand causes of this prejudice was the friendship of anne of austria for mme   71.38385608396791
the signs just now and the holy water   113.33405553235686
on chairs were laid elegant masquerade costumes of blue and white satin   100.08329152928881
de morcerf continued beauchamp looked at this woman with surprise and terror   147.1155061820512
o reilly said the duke leading him into the chapel look at these diamond studs and tell me what they are worth apiece   145.87923883851576
then replied d artagnan though i shall not have you athos at all events i shall have that dear fair haired head by me   95.63127992457655
at the cry jesus seigneur we go out upset all that stands in our way run to our horses jump into our saddles spur them   76.91499441529741
they galloped away and took the road they had come by in the morning namely in the direction toward scotland   120.80361400541132
if you have forgotten as he is still living i can write to him and he will send me information on the subject   107.94499802439562
see they are following us both in white dresses one with a bouquet of camellias the other with one of myosotis   86.23039546289594
and these reasons howsoever excellent in producing sleep would avail us but very little before a tribunal when we were tried for our lives   130.61374765213554
a louis on account for a fowl   72.20409951450048
he had a heavy hand dear old athos after drinking   110.8658310204391
i love retirement and silence because i can live with my thoughts and recollections of past days   112.39624612495932
so that you understand monsieur but   135.46805072160458
well when i was a clerk morcerf was a mere fisherman   101.41935429433558
it was plain by a paleness still greater than usual and by those traces which loss of sleep leaves on the face that he must have passed almost the whole of the night without sleeping   123.89961220292754
he was accompanied by another man who carried in his hand something long and flexible rolled up resembling a washing line   122.0956727313629
monte cristo called the owner who immediately rowed up to him with the eagerness of a boatman hoping for a good fare   65.6072075377864
but these two words would bring about my condemnation divorce exile   186.63450420960083
the queen advanced a few steps to meet him and then stopped cold severe unmoved with her lower lip scornfully protruded   138.93726096744834
in royal antechambers it is worth more to be viewed with an angry eye than not to be seen at all   120.30509823034743
i would not lose this opportunity of proving to m   120.73692355387286
with the hundred pistoles we can live well to the end of the month   127.78992052761079
the cardinal will remember that these are the same men who have often crossed his path   115.18664813779186
the king made vitry marechal of france for an assassination while i have left in obscurity in poverty the noble d artagnan who saved me   71.12265173187512
of aramis yes since he has become an abbé   196.72683751415752
look d artagnan   97.6384350224497
president i can furnish the committee of inquiry into the conduct of the lieutenant general the count of morcerf in epirus and in macedonia with important particulars   188.86071635675847
a mass of straight black hair defying all attempts to train or curl it fell over his projecting forehead and hung down to his shoulders giving increased vivacity to eyes already sparkling with a youthful love of mischief and fondness for every forbidden enjoyment   86.54612013151836
my lord asks of what country you are said the young man in the purest castilian   130.57492055267005
the above mentioned purchase was made on his highness s account whose mandate i had for the sum of four hundred thousand francs   57.96702906961488
in that case you would do better to keep it to yourself   118.98939009378071
let us talk of something else if you please   174.38989769302805
not a step further said the man who appeared to be the captain or i will hamstring your horses   63.15012229358798
d artagnan alone was calm at least in appearance   98.32297103633071
his assistant broke his leg last night beneath your majesty s window the cry we heard was his and there is no executioner nearer at hand than bristol   186.00363576057921
but in the first place i should like to be certain of one thing   49.03690908323631
you shall take half the sum that will be advanced upon it or i will throw it into the seine   143.42981191202048
but you did not come   83.96939909786192
had she betrayed him   70.58922441591506
when shall you send your invitations   96.46154113667579
the three young men bowed to each other courteously if not affably   153.05311488391158
we sent you wine   128.38272235257085
you do not know these ultramontane millionaires   109.54710342449431
at first he had been followed through astonishment then with derisive shouts then the porters had insulted him then children had thrown stones at him and finally he was obliged to run to escape the missiles   66.02622955808755
the four sailors fixed their eyes on him while they got out their oars and held themselves in readiness to row away which thanks to the darkness would not be difficult   132.52113307058903
moreover do not alarm yourself morrel   155.1718281647052
i was forced then to combat the fast of the evening with the nourishment of the morning   93.79981122215428
they were only fit for a young man   32.42907446914472
i cover mine said d artagnan   160.4967855728017
toward four o clock in the morning the doctor arrived   117.23630523316517
he calls that being as poor as job   102.78722792951767
asked a porter advancing to the new arrival   144.73137641280758
it is for you replied a gendarme   45.42881946936872
proceed she said   95.84402747638352
he looked at his watch like a man who has forgotten the hour said a few hurried words to madame herbault and pressing the hands of emmanuel and maximilian madame said he i trust you will allow me to visit you occasionally   174.50410619904187
monte cristo and haydée took the beverage in the original arabian manner that is to say without sugar   163.39995060299486
why that i may be dangerously wounded killed even   93.37933577355133
i guess what brings you here   165.8251114127406
you have heard what i said   80.86257267914306
stand here don t stir turn your back to the road and wait for me   79.20288528588691
de villefort in this simple way madame replied monte cristo   82.48331245184156
the palace of the louvre contains two things the king who must die and royalty which never dies   185.22434301759554
repeated the baroness   167.53563748099648
well can i see porthos   93.0089158610169
that reply led to several questions about the king s capture and athos gave details so precise and positive that if the gatekeepers had any suspicions they vanished completely   126.67513064441826
but i m afraid entre nous that his liking for wine has aged and degraded him   69.98274210411131
you said you could give me advice what is it   165.47589739142666
50201m maximilian said the count without appearing to notice the different impressions which his presence produced on the little circle i come to seek you   73.76123209970822
there are then 40 000 francs for your share besides the 100 000 you furnished me to begin with making in all 1 340 000 francs for your portion   139.41082775391098
they entered the bedroom   120.71412340006822
to call edward he must reawaken the echo of that room which now appeared like a sepulchre   127.4220985308175
on the contrary replied aramis your opinion will be very valuable   129.8313457357863
mazarin bit his lips   117.8794812214438
de chevreuse had been in paris but still further that the queen had renewed with her one of those mysterious correspondences which at that time was named a cabal   177.3188226349184
he had taken revenge on mazarin and had aided in his father s deliverance from prison   70.09094203895941
he repaired then instantly to the office of the lieutenant criminel   133.11334211912887
gaspard gaspard   148.01827686947877
but it is one of the principal military appointments in the king s household   181.58150263803793
other turnkeys came and then was heard the regular tramp of soldiers   95.10415407504073
are you wounded   73.94196093441626
d artagnan had not been deceived   160.90411105001968
a scar on his temple   124.42997837152163
after ten minutes labor the wall gave way and a hole large enough to insert the arm was opened   166.55235456467193
at a shout from the boat the chain that closes the mouth of the port was lowered and in a second they were as dantès knew in the frioul and outside the inner harbor   77.06609256287754
now on taking prisoners this morning two frenchmen who seemed to me of high birth in short two knights of the garter i said to myself my fortune is made   132.3727086130353
again the timid girl found courage to return to the gate saying as she did so and why do you come so late today   83.33646729973552
does not his appearance speak for him   148.3633693577099
your honors said he that woman had a child   129.46851745159913
40284m your daughter   90.94108328666348
well said a voice which vibrated in too terrible a manner in my ear not to be recognized well   62.526446198845306
but formerly it appears began mousqueton timidly   97.22854922373148
yes he is young and youth is invariably self confident   56.19474120251609
here goes the barony   118.36456611101468
you wish to make me believe something too dreadful   215.12181591602365
continued mme   101.4081813688966
so distinguished an individual as yourself cried albert could scarcely have required an introduction   97.38811012059239
that will insure his confidence   99.38378231912152
here is monsieur de bragelonne who determined at all risks to aid the arrest of broussel and whom i had great difficulty to prevent defending monsieur de comminges   123.31774875246401
you have conspired with your wife with madame de chevreuse and with my lord duke of buckingham   83.05284552024006
felton would see all   166.2705656744616
c est bien prouvé par le déluge   25.054417814187843
said porthos astonished at his friend s deception   114.31788850303272
danglars bit his lips   116.40729305727176
said the officer who covered a part of his face with his cloak   13.69932162760577
does he desire to play the part in france that cromwell plays in england   109.78887976278111
ah your honor how can you say so   90.42225579019401
porthos men like us can t go out from here purely and simply   50.54605416792627
so much the worse for them   130.83942631861697
yes monsieur said planchet and i will go as soon as you please   149.79941070444193
de villefort staggered and buried his head in the bed   97.42924123212903
said d artagnan filling two glasses with the beaugency wine which he had obtained from the liberality of m   60.50656620563093
why if you ever make use of the details i am about to give you that you will never let anyone know that it was i who supplied them   169.9579348304266
whither are you going count   140.26799613638744
the young men first approached the dead man   105.94130198949826
now begone said the count pointing to the window   96.83118281852241
he was evidently watching for someone but his search ended in disappointment   70.1486797852705
by the bonapartists   85.07203604358784
you are right said monte cristo   57.98104151230925
now this is the moment to consecrate your existence to the king of kings said d artagnan if you persist in offering him a civility   92.34766935877342
but they are only civilians very bad marksmen who will be sure not to hit me   170.57600002537515
repeated mazarin in terror   67.89425257253698
the dangerous and mad prisoners are in the dungeons   120.94366296605403
the dogs became in their turn silent   136.78484159465805
the count told baptistin to leave the plate within reach of his guest who began by sipping the alicante with an expression of great satisfaction and then delicately steeped his biscuit in the wine   84.90687767552693
i swear to you on my honor said he to await your decision respecting the course i am to pursue with m   98.09844374640282
and d artagnan obliging athos to look in the direction he pointed showed him the body of mordaunt floating on its back which sometimes submerged sometimes rising seemed still to pursue the four friends with looks of insult and mortal hatred   175.02480498939215
i introduce no one and certainly not m   192.14178294150418
yes but the son has done us no harm   107.79854176647298
the vessel was in as good condition as i am and as i hope you are m   204.98095779188623
good very good said porthos   121.94661028241595
on the contrary i have a most important engagement   187.0245108983853
gimblou a glass of wine   80.5436140320146
cried the monk   129.25626534257754
de morcerf said the president do you recognize this lady as the daughter of ali tepelini pasha of yanina   100.34141884123208
i should have been pleased to see her for i like her very much   143.9144779541159
the first time i saw him he appeared to me like an old lieutenant who had grown mouldy under his epaulets   55.05332151503374
and without any other complaint passive and obedient either from true devotion to his master or from the example set by blaisois mousqueton leaped into the sea headforemost   143.7909532471748
the cabinet of m   143.66461844290316
this instant duke   94.3261690551894
pardon me monsieur but you are not my lord the duke of buckingham said mme   94.66311205897048
the dark space frightened her   65.83949207244797
he was thought to be dead   88.6830802873345
their fasts make them pale the blows of the discipline make them hypocrites and their eyes become inflamed through weeping for the good things of this life we common folk enjoy but they have lost   169.33901691483544
there is nothing more easy said mousqueton with a modest air   164.42612507324364
aramis assumed that perilous charge   131.3516909768678
let him come in then   177.67761584709692
forsooth   122.85025771303772
i did not think that was the way of your people   63.33391632990646
a man advanced to the door with a kind of scythe in his hand   83.73444299641868
after the execution   181.87431945125283
once a soldier what would you do with me a poor orphan forlorn without fortune with nothing but a half ruined hut and a few ragged nets the miserable inheritance left by my father to my mother and by my mother to me   144.77448328008893
or that the sea should become dry as in the days of pharaoh and even then my vessels would become caravans   78.83070669256342
i should prefer that being altered beyond all recognition   125.35309856498773
but i know you only as an adventurer sewn up in gold and jewellery   124.57143942898804
and albert handed over the paper to the count who read as follows a correspondent at yanina informs us of a fact of which until now we had remained in ignorance   77.21953854856514
help me gentlemen cried d artagnan we must break in this door   203.5228233173689
for fear the letter might be some day lost or stolen he compelled dantès to learn it by heart   90.83962645311347
at length they arrived at the cemetery   80.09832509048782
the master   66.8104924279948
d artagnan on his part had gained the summit of all his wishes   111.17161523724783
no i slept as i generally do when i am weary without having the courage to amuse myself or when i am hungry without feeling inclined to eat   214.5226819048643
when he was completely dressed he said send hither monsieur d artagnan   133.70780945541043
he has been travelling with a very severe tutor and had never been to paris before   166.4571946203242
whose is the sand upon which we were reclining   103.39381681693243
milady made her a sign to sit down opposite poured her a small glass of spanish wine and helped her to the wing of a chicken   166.25854052027262
danglars ask these gentlemen where they are caught   76.59896338494511
placed as he was between two possible sources of danger he kept his eye on the crew and his gun in his hand   84.31121874721649
and who is beppo   83.9111928992718
well a day   115.63013300977667
simply that having ascertained that the piece of ground on which i stand was to let i made application for it was readily accepted by the proprietor and am now master of this fine crop of lucern   75.9423423772082
d artagnan saw those tears and much disturbed softened he threw himself at her feet   117.44783808222171
sure of being killed by athos it may easily be understood that the young man was not very uneasy about porthos   149.04369457892216
andrea who was in an adjoining room had shared in the sensation caused by the arrival of monte cristo and now came forward to pay his respects to the count   89.39774153819006
yes continued the queen i think myself as much honored to have received you this evening as if you had been a prince and i wish to know your name   153.6038584860062
i trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish remarks we used to make about him   155.26942523237187
oh heavens i forgot that it awaits me also   83.51160425449181
the rock already shaken by the explosion tottered on its base   100.72128296969353
yes madame i expected nothing less from the justice of your majesty   103.05104655196175
did you recognize   19.41567113606321
well transfer it to me at the price it cost you   175.3786977865449
listen friend said monte cristo   142.26311860896126
the latter bent on his knee and kissed it   167.34263906200982
i was going to ask you replied the baroness with a beating heart   129.29358158118947
inactive my dear fellow   44.347020575213705
his forced politeness sat awkwardly upon him and approached almost to impertinence   104.28759856180159
the major looked at the count with an indescribable expression of anxiety   154.61607558209244
she is called milady but she may be french   166.65004367763737
stop let me show you the way   69.14629400059599
he began to reflect upon the events that had passed   154.6840349701343
in short he had reached that supreme moment when the bravest feel a shudder in their veins when suddenly in the direction of the rue de l arbre sec the crowd opened crying long live the coadjutor   118.51403726547603
de boville was in his private room and the englishman on perceiving him made a gesture of surprise which seemed to indicate that it was not the first time he had been in his presence   160.58170030247538
gone   165.96152482628
the magistrate harassed and fatigued had descended to the garden of his house and in a gloomy mood similar to that in which tarquin lopped off the tallest poppies he began knocking off with his cane the long and dying branches of the rose trees which placed along the avenue seemed like the spectres of the brilliant flowers which had bloomed in the past season   83.58364773424982
i would say that i know this great lady   110.672803463915
porthos pretended that this occupation was proof of a reflective and contemplative organization and he had brought him away without any other recommendation   169.19977638999106
so that now   102.61298416460218
look attentively then at this gentleman   60.53053812355209
yes tréville yes said the king in a melancholy tone   25.45209098535703
there was another thing that planchet had no liking for and that was starting on a journey with a hungry stomach   121.03979518819398
he will give you a horse all saddled and will point out to you the road you ought to take   205.82869071775661
have you never heard that queen anne of austria was once saved from the greatest danger ever incurred by a queen   40.40393215669744
the latter anxious about his master and curious to know what had happened to him had taken advantage of the opportunity and brought the garments himself   166.83267059535075
20064m and with a smile expressive of supreme content he left his hiding place and without being observed descended one of the flights of steps provided for debarkation and hailing three times shouted jacopo jacopo jacopo   97.69266279714562
but in going out he put the knife into his bosom   130.2442244159021
but tell me now count exclaimed albert delighted at the idea of having to chaperon so distinguished a person as monte cristo   162.08666894362585
well then porthos shall show him how to knock down an ox with a blow of the fist and i how to trip up a bull by taking him by the horns   94.78495452270568
and you baron pursued the count addressing franz do you also depart tomorrow   66.8188066819363
no one will come said she   91.92312995515908
d artagnan flew to his hole laid himself down on the floor at full length and listened   118.24292569619504
said monte cristo with the same indomitable coolness   105.22962570503333
he was a strong minded upright young man   53.7569858707128
bonacieux in her power   85.97850635179392
ay but said aramis that young fellow is decidedly a spy   165.8420441531736
has the gascon been indiscreet   28.879446014181454
if she said there is one among you who knows the king let him approach and say whether it is really his majesty lying there   182.8840562613831
mademoiselle was holding flowers in her hand the interesting boy was chasing a beautiful peacock in a garden and you madame were under the trellis of some arbor   85.78367842358118
with a man like you i fear nothing   140.85721399338658
and do you undertake to reform it   128.1450785768629
it was evident that every precaution had been taken   47.19179674001846
thought porthos the man aramis wants me to strangle   154.4215817129839
and you you d artagnan a man sprung from the ancient nobility of france bearing an honorable name carrying a good sword have helped to give up a king to beersellers shopkeepers and wagoners   70.99005930224608
d avrigny i beseech you do something for her   116.9053934306793
they are sinking   161.06306936491882
as a further precaution they had bound his hands   134.1419538924801
emmanuel followed her and in the antechamber were visible the rough faces of seven or eight half naked sailors   165.4031894978636
asked the notary of villefort   166.34994160277407
my letter is private and confidential and for that reason i send it to you by a man who shares my most intimate counsels   46.849868993915706
dantès could not understand a man risking his life for such matters   186.0709949914567
but as we have said he was active strong and full of presence of mind   130.64289074618836
do as you like with your own but do not fill or empty mine   133.40813555469504
for what you have just said   159.6818131326831
that would not be endurable in any case and is still less so on the part of those who came to bring the queen the message of a liar   83.76673789601418
then i need not tell you what kind of service he requires of you   115.42982510449178
and does the husband of this frightful creature still live   147.42556502566123
a pallor that suits you admirably mother but which did not the less alarm my father and myself   97.75503503652487
we will give the fifty pistoles to the hostess for our expenses said d artagnan and share the three hundred   153.04183891522644
the officer conversed a few instants with the captain gave him several papers of which he was the bearer to read and upon the order of the merchant captain the whole crew of the vessel both passengers and sailors were called upon deck   153.23287511041346
but at least tell me where he is that i may know whether he is alive or dead said she   99.99822003340631
yes first and then to go to paris   63.49354237184902
monsieur de beaufort was at supper but he rose quickly on hearing the two friends announced   127.75734822742488
chapter 50   107.47833938607896
both were addressed to king charles   151.72272717412778
see the fatal example on the vendomois road d artagnan you so brave and you porthos so valiant and so strong you were beaten   119.97841498781412
it is very kind of you to trouble yourself about me   158.77727841277732
why he must be a nabob   154.9267894056755
he then began pacing the room with a pensive and gloomy air glancing from time to time at the jeweller who stood reeking with the steam from his wet clothes and merely changing his place on the warm hearth to enable the whole of his garments to be dried   72.92126597169533
for an active ambitious nature like that of milady days not spent in climbing are inauspicious days   117.80209051447835
besides athos was very easy and a noble to his fingers ends   64.12613704438596
trust me i am fully grateful for such unparalleled conduct and if as i told you i can be of any service to you i believe you monsieur i believe you   156.37816222135632
it is a veritable army   76.3491314513769
then said danglars pale with anger which was not at all due to offended paternal love then mademoiselle you persist in your determination to accelerate my ruin   117.14517702910298
obey said noirtier s intelligent eye   96.47515909303226
villefort opened the door and escaped for the idea had entered his mind to stifle the little remaining life in the heart of this terrible old man   168.09517694665826
but what has happened then since last evening count   208.5779281917045
adieu your holiness said the mendicant opening the door and bending low before the prelate   104.77218908865615
all is well i thank you   26.324332613925634
ings have been made in these caves   148.46896966678193
what do you say of that young man   116.87826779374001
you think he is tracked pursued captured   127.89438368568428
i accept it said she   50.999447891743
at the end of another two hours the horses had gone twelve leagues without stopping   154.30001446959474
but where the devil were you gadding last night my young master   168.34130926287264
to present our respects to the cardinal   105.74048206230219
aramis answered d artagnan who did not wish to undeceive porthos aramis fancy has become a monk and a jesuit and lives like a bear   84.30413800972443
fortune has been kind to you then   146.4400951829569
that is the most direct line to london   84.98053071968869
that would have been another motive for sympathy between us   156.03536014545477
the keeper relaxed his hold   56.02549671903702
you jest i presume   107.84610949430603
i know myself father   121.01701416441031
he cried by jove   88.85806951231814
since his first arrival at paris he had had constant occasion to honor this excellent man whom he had always found worthy loyal and great   91.27175667447321
forsooth i don t know   125.80007038615071
it is the enemy who have made a sortie from newcastle and are surrounding us   113.50707019217654
at length you are mine   113.29203975187345
well then i repeat you are wrong   120.12080161387608
and paris   166.69713970413966
milady continued one day our doors will ope with god come our desire   101.56841653355298
if i were betrayed as he was i would console myself   95.10194949628524
i no longer understand anything   157.88550511842638
god will punish you hereafter but i will punish you here   101.8779989458986
the door at last opened   76.35349596889057
50249m danglars suddenly felt a strong inclination to see the person who kept watch over him   128.4252018830924
with difficulty but he can speak   65.7994459278686
to enter the room he must again see the body of his unfortunate wife   72.10359072715113
or at least that i had had no hand in it   170.4234267432621
perhaps they are penitent and preparing to march   47.44416467845335
it was the most simple thing in the world   113.24641228184382
one with a letter and the other put it in the post   143.88931204454184
she intoxicated   62.088353650682215
admirable   61.35982646926758
a deathlike silence oppressed all nature   203.09671635393943
no fine lady ever trained and watered her geraniums her cacti and her rhododendrons in her porcelain jardinière with more pains than this hitherto unseen gardener bestowed upon his little enclosure   149.56683739418932
the proofs   172.6973650798593
and the stranger muttering to himself directed his steps toward the kitchen   137.19740485002026
twas not your right place i think as you were not equipped for an engagement   180.74182635533052
the world will think you abandoned and poor for the wife of a bankrupt would never be forgiven were she to keep up an appearance of opulence   147.0956715566307
the other who was safe and sound continued his way toward the camp   164.75873340681798
i have brought you another said d artagnan   92.84643527451107
you met a monk did you not   113.2583976492104
he could not contemplate the future with the indifference of the hardened criminal who merely faces a contingency already familiar   148.59598604306066
morrel had indeed placed a cross over the spot but it had fallen down and the grave digger had burnt it as he did all the old wood in the churchyard   73.61059898069568
unquestionably   130.55039738613863
monsieur continued the prisoner i am the abbé faria born at rome   62.84438218418626
so you suppose i have need of an escort   109.55282194659443
or an ex emperor but his majesty the emperor and king driven from france which is his kingdom by violence and treason   54.78987883422876
a strasbourg pie   165.09360690794048
this execution quieted the ill disposed who resolved to allow themselves to die of hunger this death always appearing to them more slow and less sure than strangulation   182.0371285524251
i want the album   62.18213523381115
their toilet finished they descended   186.60828000884595
only ten days after the flight of her daughter and three days from the bankruptcy of her husband   113.30583688053152
as soon as he arrives inform me   221.599968137171
shall you go then albert   113.56459920889043
he cried athos   107.99885947277558
wherefore sir   104.24340535347584
on rising he went to his window which opened on a terrace having the sea in front and at the back a pretty park bounded by a small forest   155.6443285228849
cried d artagnan in his stentorian voice   118.85479692441962
that will not prevent me replied d artagnan if ever i find him   62.80039314839291
let him bear his share of the loss and we will go on as before   122.08120925961104
wretch cried d artagnan speak quickly   93.14173921746823
you are fifty five years old   136.29771595591387
as for me it made me tremble   44.63187199861423
the tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been scarcely married a week   90.1331637388076
all hope of flight was gone   68.52017957475059
but you said that your name was d artagnan   131.40288243486143
morrel was mad   154.42549518964057
i have but one promise and but one heart to give   79.13071255778628
it s worth eighty   86.2356978855894
mordaunt hesitated   75.80018989183776
some few words passed between them in that sonorous language in which homer makes his gods converse   210.79268020891618
and a pair of oxen   114.94638615136924
he said to the sergeant i believe you are impudent to me   102.32092474081641
may it not be about that cursed affair   86.76493065887581
monte cristo rang   158.85168900045727
for i now recollect you   148.17388444716423
he exposed himself freely to danger and while charging at the head of his company he received a ball through the chest which laid him prostrate on the field of battle   118.77693601343633
asked valentine clasping her hands   37.49809306841318
cried the queen with a broken and trembling voice   177.224044289103
i am a royalist replied the general   164.4214043066703
at five o clock replied the count   74.75555990479108
the man who abducted my wife   90.46457124961108
50169m what i do not wish madame is that you should perish on the scaffold   31.93601519319695
tis true replied d artagnan   190.91107830569362
cried buckingham forgetting everything in thinking from whom that letter came   96.62704415279985
it was evident that he brought the answer of the emperor and that it was favorable   177.03947567685782
oh monsieur   135.89087721787004
a moment after a carriage stopped before the door and the servant announced m   126.54990600916592
as to dantès he had passed it on his voyage to and from the levant but never touched at it   111.45478645965247
but let us be quick the king may change his mind in an hour   225.72544221789255
he will see us if we go out   83.99655034695138
oh that i could instead of taking up this defence shed my last drop of blood to prove to my noble colleagues that i am their equal in worth   143.47020991188208
well he asked that will do will it not   116.78819243494375
she stopped astonished then the voice reached her ear more distinctly and she recognized it to be that of maximilian   72.57553598031498
the fittings of the room were simple but in excellent taste   139.27879160574523
you will be drowned if you seek to escape and your strength has not been properly exercised and prepared for exertion   142.85620617641356
all this was achieved in much less time than is occupied in the recital   34.036062676964306
madame said he you are about to receive a visit from the chancellor who will communicate certain matters to you with which i have charged him   114.16869202084338
where is that   115.46954980210975
now said the king give the word and let us start   28.183670203743418
put the oars into it so that it may follow in the track and there will be nothing to do except to cut the cord   124.88632664226188
morrel left on old dantès chimney piece and which you tell me is still in your hands   121.19313081750515
around the schooner lay a number of small fishing boats belonging to the fishermen of the neighboring village like humble subjects awaiting orders from their queen   103.46614217528636
three quarters of an hour   51.29688550022148
well yes you are right   136.5663708474051
and it conveyed me from nice to genoa from genoa to turin from turin to chambéry from chambéry to pont de beauvoisin and from pont de beauvoisin to paris   128.1023299565634
you have promised to be secret my good monsieur   131.89782982510343
the officers perceived that they had not to deal with a gentleman and they treated him like a very peasant   119.86564048661226
if you would permit me said d artagnan with timidity   138.17169038231364
lend it to us and go into your house again   153.93370676983943
continued he addressing raoul   145.84419182155258
it is a lovely night and a walk without rome will do us both good   39.75365977922647
he walked straight into the midst of the guards who on seeing him were silent   76.59287822960331
the house of the duke of bracciano is one of the most delightful in rome the duchess one of the last heiresses of the colonnas does its honors with the most consummate grace and thus their fêtes have a european celebrity   138.79382567229172
to dantès if what he says is true what hinders his staying with us   149.83781483911065
if his excellency will recollect if he will think ah true observed monte cristo   44.684456226893445
you look dull   125.41865429599335
a glance at the king after this discreet and subtle exordium assured villefort of the benignity of his august auditor and he went on sire i have come as rapidly to paris as possible to inform your majesty that i have discovered in the exercise of my duties not a commonplace and insignificant plot such as is every day got up in the lower ranks of the people and in the army but an actual conspiracy a storm which menaces no less than your majesty s throne   164.0368125587334
a man who will not tell his name but who comes from the cardinal   153.90095335189028
her words were rapid incoherent unintelligible for the burning weight of grief almost stopped her utterance   184.93198724017876
admired by my father who says he has never before heard such sublime ideas so eloquently expressed   229.64995347205868
and will that be the first time you ever took that journey   87.40272641950467
ah to be sure cried porthos there is a diamond   109.72862792297245
this manner of acting roused much respect for d artagnan s policy among the musketeers   139.858291168263
you have some plan then   77.78876298172703
she worries me everywhere said d artagnan   91.82680844106349
but if in spite of all my precautions i am at last obliged to fight will you not be my second   68.38900473788863
a musketeer for a time my friend as the cardinal says a musketeer against my will but a churchman at heart believe me   108.50336651108506
it resulted from this that the real stake in this game which two most powerful kingdoms played for the good pleasure of two amorous men was simply a kind look from anne of austria   116.70202904152114
captivity has brought my mental faculties to a focus   128.8606190429359
another attack of giddiness said morrel clasping his hands   123.59185775599038
noirtier is spared because nothing is expected from him   177.84566673265823
stammered caderousse   69.92860429028163
said lord de winter after having played comedy after having played tragedy we are now playing melancholy   144.8475611731031
if he is here this is what the other man said let s see decidedly what to do with him   24.732431613226197
then my dear sir   101.4974997638869
alas said milady i know it is so   93.53104563109271
then it is not justice which is pursuing me   128.71399087286287
for this envious person is a real enemy   133.44884430089
when left alone the two friends at first kept an embarrassed silence   76.16368054813273
you have no money coming in on which you can rely   75.53706541894144
but are you really the executioner of bethune as these people say   200.86973496460922
ah comte de la fere said a calm voice though hoarse with running is it your habit to calumniate the absent   144.05928053905328
everything was in order laces dresses jewels linen money all were arranged in the drawers and the countess was carefully collecting the keys   83.29641774322357
and one for aramis   38.72860363080959
some minutes after the superior of the convent sent to inform the musketeers that the burial would take place at midday   42.22211093762992
what do you think of that interrogator   186.68444177633603
both as this double precaution indicated had an interest in not being recognized   94.75765761112064
half of the work was done   149.13882181279985
they are coming then   115.95280355404682
especially when this young prince was scarcely thirty years of age   117.74709763427072
whilst porthos still in bed was hooking on his cloak for him a second knock at the door was heard   99.31518116073522
because insensible to all my sufferings you persist in remaining in a city where by remaining you run the risk of your life and make me run the risk of my honor   90.73084476023575
i not only approve of what he has done but i congratulate him upon it   47.321406590500374
madame danglars had listened to this recital with a sigh a tear or a shriek for every detail   202.18141985681177
but i guessed what these bundles were and that he sold by degrees what he had to pay for his subsistence   113.26505860253488
but it kept on in the middle of the road and those who saw it pass uttered cries of terror   190.05258011098672
no madame no   103.40436887500616
albert led his guest into the salon   123.28036749172256
on his side the prince sounded a rappel and all the officers of the royalist army mingling momentarily with the parisian troops ran to him   164.66882818011095
sire the duke is right and i believe your majesty will think it equally important   45.01070308669554
boisrenard   16.615664997098065
count count   91.30463835831893
we must first extract the steel from the side said he shaking his head in a significant manner   60.83010434595404
my gratitude is already due   103.87147347184948
the devil take you said aramis   128.18606696362815
and then the queen   150.45805445980596
one by one he undid the buttons of his doublet took it off and deposited it by the side of his hat   76.32139242283847
now one of two things must happen either matters will not be arranged or they will be arranged in which last case i shall be relieved of my command and we shall still meet again   101.41049303157959
said beauchamp mildly   153.7274309384241
oh valentine you who have so much influence over your grandpapa try to make him answer soon   46.66011536095833
another long live the prince de conde   109.75201906160946
but the masks were visible behind the windows the carriages and the doors   86.72517022687268
d artagnan obeyed and mazarin ascertained that the seal was intact   116.26067567851047
he was a man of forty to forty five years but he seemed at least fifty and his black moustache and eyebrows contrasted strangely with his almost white hair which was cut short in the military fashion   73.71535529265867
but above all things i am a marvel to you   123.99988521350551
say the devil   119.33510054649994
and what does he say   119.68806796886149
this being understood let us proceed with our history   149.64269782753544
it is my lord i have not named her   162.69251497201418
scarcely had ali disappeared when the valet entered the chamber   40.725283468077876
for mademoiselle de villefort is in spite of all we can do to rouse her of a melancholy disposition and taciturn habit which frequently injure the effect of her beauty   162.6745522429792
how sprightly you are said caderousse   207.58203005520778
well yes replied raoul   68.82986300204757
observed franz   134.51038166922237
he had to contend against a strong wrist but his agility was superior to all force   158.94590142689057
it is over aramis had said   106.78127649307685
adieu abbé said the coadjutor i am to preach to morrow and have twenty texts to examine this evening   151.10351661783358
do you hear that   97.71866015981072
d artagnan on his part entered boldly at the principal gate   8.72733831208653
you have a good memory   63.24442365312407
bonacieux in a tone of perfect good fellowship what has become of you all these days   176.6079588431678
edmond at the approach of his patron respectfully placed the arm of his affianced bride within that of m   195.27041006488975
put to catherine de medici after the massacre of saint bartholomew how have i played my little part   67.86523632466034
you will then have our swords with which i can assure you my friend and i can play tolerably well   21.83607473219388
the prisoner s first feeling was of joy at again breathing the pure air for air is freedom   91.60664887005242
during the first act the countess g entered   173.14553893171302
will that satisfy you   131.149312133408
he drew kitty to him   99.57524180631637
in the meantime they filled the place with their golden and silky reflections   100.79767869867707
he intended taking advantage of the opportunity to make fresh inquiries of the new conductor   131.16607986733078
do you understand the meaning of my words   193.39146015195377
i really believe you are a man and a violent one too   48.615288822347445
we are looking for the house of monsieur de la fere said d artagnan   154.82136966542413
it was those very terrible old days that made the present so excessively delightful and the blow was so great he rushed out overcome and forgot to shut the door   20.23075310445421
oh i am free then i am saved   97.98040840196991
dantès struck with the beauty and capability of the little vessel applied to its owner to transfer it to him offering sixty thousand francs upon condition that he should be allowed to take immediate possession   105.03752763428673
but why are you so sure of his being the winner of the jockey club prize   89.06534408059473
said porthos with a gesture fierce enough to have frightened an army   139.95410072788675
almost immediately bertuccio entered the apartment   105.04654304306798
i have therefore as you see great need of hearing from you   113.38703683868803
come said athos here s another good servant   92.13007370729969
i make no doubt a glass of good wine would be acceptable this dreadfully hot day   102.53263718146911
well that will do charmingly said the count   71.05569406338316
the attendant confirmed to the cardinal what the two musketeers had already said with respect to athos   78.39010606340081
that instant the arm of porthos fell   136.60400994751078
and were you my son or my brother i would refuse you in the same way   21.846119798177995
all this is very strange   80.14684050200938
speak my child speak said d artagnan   188.05900503453526
as to athos his face aflame his fists clinched his lips bitten till they bled he sat there foaming with rage at that endless parliamentary insult and that long enduring royal patience   96.21802279508448
here said she you see i have thought of everything   14.338814085959626
villefort s eyes were filled with tears of joy and pride   173.79756681674436
stay here if you like but i warn you twill be rather too warm presently   131.6815692883397
say albert my friend do you wish it   96.71394064840753
chapter 77   50.66293157935258
and the words which had accompanied the present were above all price   115.35910819401953
nobody   201.5225848793234
but to return to our duchess   101.84004824432198
this action is somewhat too sublime to be natural   136.15498462873555
monte cristo raised his eyes but he could not see the heavens   108.06267877062933
he is gone   91.32323434605506
but monsieur porthos replied that my house being the best he should remain where he was   93.84704311763016
two minutes a man makes four minutes   162.85111968217694
most likely said d artagnan   115.39875064063928
morrel looked attentively on villefort   73.6975689932903
he then took his hat from his head and threw it on the ground   70.98625728123875
now the very morning of which we speak was that of his quarter day payment and scarron as usual had sent his servant to get his money at the pension office but the man had returned and said that the government had no more money to give monsieur scarron   142.4473650663295
art thou happy friend   113.2801512960488
i take it said m   139.81722756966704
he was not rich although the wealth of his family had passed into a proverb and i heard the phrase very often as rich as a spada   93.05016815945794
and if by chance you receive no news of me three months hence tell him to open a packet which he will find addressed to him in my bronze casket at blois of which i send you now the key   191.18010962790214
the heroine of the bouquet kept her word   128.56975145916215
no he was no longer here   98.89375941944277
well mercédès beloved by you i would tempt fortune   121.83371141184983
after his wife the banker descended as pale as though he had issued from his tomb instead of his carriage   91.19993743964119
de villefort is a poison that the prisoner is not acquainted with one that has no known antidote quick as thought rapid as lightning mortal as the thunderbolt   150.399422880201
half a million is it   130.02432488438512
and the two friends began to laugh   196.84387642037348
none i swear to you   47.26621407173768
the prisoners transported the previous evening from the carceri nuove to the little church of santa maria del popolo had passed the night each accompanied by two priests in a chapel closed by a grating before which were two sentinels who were relieved at intervals   103.80439071765844
and does he ever expect to be happy   164.10875801000634
but i deal in certainties   68.46175829201559
levasseur who had been suffering under severe illness made his reappearance in the character of bertram and as usual the announcement of the most admired production of the favorite composer of the day had attracted a brilliant and fashionable audience   131.27159836693542
around him and within him the flight of thought seemed to have stopped   85.35314623299584
why he said does he enter without first asking for an audience   149.43479661488988
this timidity which might proceed from the astonishment of innocence as well as the shame of guilt conciliated some in his favor   141.20094192877585
he looked at d artagnan with an expression of gratitude and then bestowed on raoul one of those strange smiles of which children are so proud when they receive them   55.466026234310064
mercédès is not yet your wife   81.26864883836635
enough i think to fulfill your highness s wishes on this occasion   168.11110879922563
whom do you expect to find with me at this hour   56.411768799588
they searched   92.54084906927268
d artagnan had been a hundred times in the same room with the queen since he had become lieutenant of the musketeers but her majesty had never once spoken to him   127.20994083264557
the count of morcerf was not a person to excite either interest or curiosity in a place of public amusement   148.86002655202938
it is reported your political opinions are extreme said villefort who had never heard anything of the kind but was not sorry to make this inquiry as if it were an accusation   57.00529639022564
we may go then   85.60580637940278
my young man said d artagnan drawing his sword that is an order sooner given than executed   140.9888764177553
precept something but example more   88.95839143660993
the king seeing that he did not reply repeated his question   137.15768031009563
athos gave raoul some of the holy water   101.45493819404155
you re right   53.93746324851728
raoul handed the letter to the prince   86.48842002892296
what is he going to do   156.01520709991584
a son ought not to submit to such a stain on his father s honor   10.293085504541807
the calash contained mademoiselle danglars and mademoiselle d armilly   139.35175568779408
yet i had read i had even written a precise history of the borgia family for the sole purpose of assuring myself whether any increase of fortune had occurred to them on the death of the cardinal cæsar spada   111.52231560483604
little by little the shadow rose higher and seemed to drive before it the last rays of the expiring day   120.54686472969618
because i alone know what   50.324657459750334
and you are going alone   159.8604937027641
said morcerf turning pale with anger   30.64211909118511
i remembered him well   121.36856652532637
and your excellency wants something to eat   83.89356797897291
in fact about four o clock they were all concentrated about the palais royal the courts and ground floors of which were filled with musketeers and swiss guards and there awaited the outcome of all this disturbance   178.7127951753513
but it must be acknowledged this response was but momentary   83.843833142829
mark   98.6045492372256
in a word said mercédès it was a way of assuring me that his abstinence was intended   99.1810467957046
go but to portsmouth or southampton and you will find the harbors crowded with the yachts belonging to such of the english as can afford the expense and have the same liking for this amusement   170.08694809292982
d artagnan believed it right to say that vengeance is the pleasure of the gods   86.34751770119217
a presentation   103.98755704596802
d artagnan in his turn sprang to the ground and just at the moment when the coachman alarmed at not seeing his master fell back a step he seized him by his collar with the left whilst with the right hand he placed the muzzle of a pistol at his breast   27.39889836243748
are you prepared   115.5012102683178
the general was there surrounded by the more prominent chiefs   44.70046017624264
three is just my number   113.0643336515286
and as what i say and do is merely in jest and i amongst the first and foremost should be sorry if anything happened to dantès the worthy dantès look here   126.79648054721082
but you know things impress us differently according to the mood of our minds   112.81561252590312
well amiable corsican let us suppose it is providence   141.19154310224886
the three men brought the carriage up quietly and took out of it a little man stout short elderly and commonly dressed in clothes of a dark color who ascended the ladder very carefully looked suspiciously in at the window of the pavilion came down as quietly as he had gone up and whispered it is she   76.24399988185613
nevertheless d artagnan was struck by the appearance of this new personage   135.76327198558945
said monte cristo taking the young man s hand affectionately in his   54.757102398902774
i fancied continually that i saw the figure of the corsican between the branches   100.22317409502627

exclaimed d artagnan stopping the carriage   110.51477242589777
de villefort said renée becoming more and more terrified   126.91164173564518

he cast one lingering look on all the luxuries which had rendered life so easy and so happy since his infancy   95.48063186921325
the duc de blacas assures me you have some interesting information to communicate   85.05397786344078

besides you compensate for your mistakes in so gentlemanly a way that one almost feels obliged to you for having committed them   65.77909811145587
you know that i care nothing for my title   157.13528836246644
i will suffer without complaint the pecuniary deprivation to which he has subjected me   149.32656834135514
why didn t you say so   142.365984268485
ah monsieur said d artagnan as if to sum up in a word all that conversation if only his eminence would relent and grant to monsieur de la fere our liberty   148.46420114687746
yes three on horseback and three who have dismounted   136.29512897732027
noirtier acknowledged by a look of extreme kindness and benevolence the thanks which morrel lavished on him for his timely intervention on behalf of valentine and himself an intervention which had saved them from despair   92.44584986749469
i on the contrary am a staunch royalist and style myself de villefort   123.51399835747264
a gentleman and a diplomatist   121.889827183965
madame danglars turned very pale then exclaimed i can not believe it   139.07991793689342
then at the other extremity he heard the footsteps of those who were pursuing him   60.437339540816346
yes if my friends agree   127.54885659771065
two shots were the reply to this threat   228.77122757371575
beauchamp looked at albert with the smile which was so peculiar to him and which in its numerous modifications served to express every varied emotion of his mind   206.29618371800038

i bought two thirds of the shares of that company   86.83914511441512

not exactly it is the wine that was sent by your order   113.89865498760591
the ladies screamed and two or three prepared to faint   148.9733464014244
i have seen his servant said one and that applies very well to me   169.86070420590153
the monk turned pale wiped his brow and went and bolted the door   162.30269092404177

my dear little love   94.06424612468415
melancholy in a capitalist like the appearance of a comet presages some misfortune to the world   67.60389237419322
but by this movement he left a passage free to the bandit who darted off toward the bastion   93.21458861323654
while singing milady listened   126.17678407692509
what do you want with me   119.61647013594705
i may sacrifice my soul but what matters it   84.65314257450041
i hope said d artagnan bowing that you give it my lord without hesitation and with the conviction that i am worthy of it   189.6334616707266
most undoubtedly   161.98153745098324
charles stuart you are our prisoner   45.5468167243407
but the wound remains and will reopen at the first loss   8.140288541520334

madame danglars with tearless eyes but with her breast heaving with concealed emotion placed the bank notes in her bag put the certificate and check into her pocket book and then standing pale and mute awaited one kind word of consolation   148.73272627090378
but in the first place this woman i have described must be found who is desirous of avenging herself upon the duke   74.02661528771645
they opened it and found 900 000 francs in bank scrip   121.78086749326168
all this was of such incredible immodesty of such monstrous effrontery that d artagnan could scarcely believe what he saw or what he heard   73.86802414277484
morrel held out his hand to her   56.41430916857029
she had already been an hour in this apartment   93.17623411280113
on perceiving the cavaliers d artagnan had stopped and charged his pistol afresh   72.66170495364773
do you know me madame   62.491583814841015
have with you for one throw   136.7328860847744
why said albert he was talked about for a week   127.77763694482063
inquired the count who seemed to become somewhat interested in bertuccio s story   109.22425386643616
it was not the executioner but the surgeon who wished to withdraw the honor of danglars from ignominious association with the disgraced young man they had presented to the world as their son in law   109.11445767611133
his second the almost miraculous preservation of madame de villefort s life   110.78312306822642
in exchange for his silence athos drank enough for four and without appearing to be otherwise affected by wine than by a more marked constriction of the brow and by a deeper sadness   149.09957773862885
you see they are going to send a whole regiment against us said athos   86.45639255862109
all my hopes are blighted my heart is broken my life a burden everything around me is sad and mournful   145.6770724953075
and she threw herself into his arms holding in her extended hand a red netted silk purse   139.90234155269937
who calls richelieu calls satan   169.59595675286218
the man remained in the village   155.42215465189565

the room was neatly comfortably furnished   113.10179811994855
my poor child replied monte cristo that is merely because your father and myself are the only men who have ever talked to you   80.31903827557545
replied aramis becoming as pale as death   153.45221904329654
i should my dear d artagnan have been so but nature said no   77.14355885198496
at the sight of d artagnan who entered the courtyard on horseback bernouin rubbed his eyes and thought he must be mistaken   110.03373748997971
and i my lord said d artagnan accept it as it is given   99.278152860451
i leave behind me as a pledge this pin worth ten times the amount   148.90344595249695
and then anne of austria had so often deserted her friends that her support seemed most precarious   156.81662127382515
it was he who gave us so much trouble and kept us on the road so much   190.18434190228737
i suppose that is not all   35.9936437307684
and your friend still longs to be made a baron   131.77277546308395

the return also of the conqueror of lens was the pretext for giving a grand banquet   141.88425473440506

i am almost a prisoner   89.64972195186465
as for me replied aramis i have in my pocket the very programme of the conditions which the deputation of which i formed one went yesterday to saint germain to impose on you   52.653618446890995
an instant afterwards the door opened she felt two arms encircle her and a mouth pressed her forehead   53.35194027089673
andrea surrounded by his friends complimented flattered beginning to believe in the reality of his dream was almost bewildered   234.6802738167362
then proposals from any quarter will be agreeable to you since for the moment you have no master but god   158.85467149715348
thought the gascon where has he heard it   66.22383279076935

monte cristo with moistened eye heaving breast and lips half open extended to albert a hand which the latter pressed with a sentiment resembling respectful fear   85.02704455247427
he was now fairly launched in that parisian society which gives such ready access to foreigners and treats them not as they really are but as they wish to be considered   76.07880065972569
and thus they parted the best possible friends and m   51.898151063652804
her reputation would be lost it is true   152.1818170367048
could you have imagined this scene château renaud when we saw her at the most three weeks ago about to sign that contract   63.00463009722182
on the contrary he was very kind to me   89.1029862239952
so you defend him   106.136907292822
more especially since your wishes coincide with mine and as soon as m   124.82296679891863
the house as i said is between the court and the garden   154.57369705786755
your eminence it concerns the war which the king my husband is now sustaining against his rebellious subjects   94.69941599062537
franz dressed himself and went out telling his host that he was going to pass the night at the duke of bracciano s   109.76861466032445
d artagnan examined her with a rapid glance   100.54859361927795
i read the advertisement in one of the papers and was tempted by the false title a country house   55.94313918674563
reverend sir murmured caderousse seeking to regain the window which the count pitilessly blocked reverend sir i don t know believe me i take my oath a pane of glass out continued the count a dark lantern a bunch of false keys a secretaire half forced it is tolerably evident caderousse was choking   209.73181306236535
franz was the excellency the vehicle was the carriage and the hôtel de londres was the palace   80.50118882926608
let him escape inaction is a pardonable offence   198.38271991892924
something better still mouston   40.53651688935149
it is she   137.7200672158004
the priest had a writing teacher at rome make three alphabets one large one middling and one small   95.38963522380227
monte cristo is the name of an island and he has a family name   139.38150465288658
again that accusation   148.63302156111476
you take it however   134.2863117563167
from this moment vampa devoted all his leisure time to perfecting himself in the use of his precious weapon   138.79671720879216
just now i told you it was of m   113.6013910906578
while fighting and retreating as i have told monseigneur he found the door of the cellar stairs behind him and as the door was open he took out the key and barricaded himself inside   76.18878385415191
speak or no absolution   42.25167455775802
one step farther into rest two perhaps into silence   95.49404751641937
oh my heart   57.20586394947528
the coachman perceived at once by the expression of the man who thus addressed him that he had fallen into a trap and he remained with his mouth wide open and his eyes portentously staring   92.06724480444828
how dear sister   116.03418044874822
alas my dear mother some have suffered so much and yet live and have raised a new fortune on the ruin of all the promises of happiness which heaven had made them on the fragments of all the hope which god had given them   52.47506019751697
valentine witnessed this scene with a sentiment of stupefaction   92.29996549624303
asked madame danglars shuddering   80.65554508960045
therefore said monte cristo feigning to mistake his meaning therefore i will not for another instant retard the pleasure of your meeting   197.77550161161037
a cloud of dust mounted toward the sky and all was over   115.44766999992315
i bought my experience dearly particularly fair women   116.30732531598976
the rapier had pierced his bosom   168.06103466185655
of what did he die   138.07157068429444
we shall know be assured   131.59288874009727
sire i have every reason to believe that a storm is brewing in the south   95.18595860276689
but a recompense was in store for him   178.08581706966288
advance gentlemen said the cardinal   154.32020943713516
till then then   106.84084039776523
50167m no no no i tell you   132.18256358315372
his piercing look was fixed in vain on the satirical face of the gascon and the unchanging countenance of porthos   78.19249471462678
god may seem sometimes to forget for a time while his justice reposes but there always comes a moment when he remembers and behold a proof   121.2766012315882
the moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed it and morrel saw villefort come out upon the steps followed by a gentleman in black   160.9530099075794
and what is this condition   140.4792279560201
ah said he you have remarked i must have been blind not to have seen   141.59992177299534
shall we return together   113.36911254400485
tis i really i   148.48291802223676
but every simpleton would not be able to understand your heroism and sooner or later you will find yourself compelled to explain it to them more energetically than would be convenient to your bodily health and the duration of your life   165.70709255565694
it is horrible indeed but no one assassinates   110.97421100811461
two duels which he had already found the means of fighting in spite of the edicts against them and more especially in spite of his tutor s vigilance these things excited the greatest curiosity in raoul   79.91345482923896
well the english like good wine as you may know monsieur   163.89589611722758
athos was looking on attentively when some one touched him softly on the shoulder   172.9294069234075
i do not mean that for you blacas continued louis xviii   58.1703281994289
i must take care   178.4380287154004
but without taking any heed of the sword milady endeavored to get near enough to him to stab him and did not stop till she felt the sharp point at her throat   82.22352507348015
cried the king   173.2905992401951
from a distance they perceived aramis seated in a melancholy manner at his window looking out like sister anne at the dust in the horizon   86.57341014166002
i have had little to do with it for i am at variance both with the father in law and the young man   62.31229842653401
and did your superior order you to treat me in this way   62.48912820830638
we have parted company this long time   96.5301290410901
the next day at the appointed hour they went to see athos and found him and aramis in traveling costume   95.599876584154
who knew that he had several thousand francs in his belt and who had often examined his weapons which were very beautiful if not with envy at least with curiosity   94.08932724915374
touching unanimity   149.28073197836244
but i wish to see the governor   149.46666846921875
but i should not have recollected it if you had not reminded me   144.12340402677364
tomorrow morning i start for paris   100.23603412450373
here are two hundred said andrea   31.451517444595865
pray learn monsieur olivain that people like us are not to be served by cowards   100.48770180075131
men may subdue men they can not overcome the elements   106.53202095850236
the poor girl was so sad that she did not even notice milady s condescension   116.06930717458647
but as i can not and you will not quit this place it becomes necessary to fill up the excavation beneath the soldier s gallery   139.20911263171132
the superior and mme   96.16636231480504
were you stopped   212.31683703759026
under orders from general cromwell   87.75961666529899
then unfastening the diamond ornament which the queen had sent him he placed it in the hands of the priest who accompanied juxon   166.80220075029754
and the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter   146.6698185151082
all four were to meet the next day at eleven o clock   156.94556354363075
tis capital   146.84516308680273
cried aramis i may have done some good   39.368541300022414
as to my arms it is useless to trouble you about them   85.58330111919372
merri you begin   157.1523681345474
i have almost given them away as it is   78.56174285166946
i repeat it d artagnan you are the best one among us   148.28682089238907
bonacieux opened the door of a closet which was entirely dark and led d artagnan into it   74.20903211317142
the object then was to examine the place near enough to verify the reports   118.38567607514877
for i do not forget that i owe to that unpleasant circumstance the good fortune of having made your acquaintance   42.71902468015777
i desire that these horses with completely new harness may be at the door with my carriage   85.24435079312829
the remains of luxury prevented him from sinking into his actual position   79.22070663832872
felton continued to descend   138.30529710457165
dantès was then guilty and now he is innocent and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn him   113.56380467078344
it is evident that you wish to avoid her   147.88490290241134
i am grateful to you for the sacrifice said aramis   154.74918487508978
now said tréville lowering his voice and looking into every corner of the apartment to see if they were alone now let us talk about yourself my young friend   112.8254614723694
i think he must have made an agreement with death to outlive all his heirs and he appears likely to succeed   100.64276632437611
are you disposed to obey count de rochefort   77.53986211479807
there is a will   117.34273195205434
and i can answer for his having been up these two hours   127.91768078224813
he felt that in returning to camp he should re enter slavery   110.94096553645305
we must pierce through the corridor by forming a side opening about the middle as it were the top part of a cross   119.0938687245561
the tears so long rebellious gushed from his eyes   91.20234754880539
do you permit me to return   128.07064268433106
and he suffered almost as much as poor kitty who at that very moment was crying in the next chamber   129.5448276598489
still continued the procureur looking at the doctor with uneasiness if you wish it if you demand it why then it shall be done   107.8159781299377
he began   86.10512388736419
athos asked uneasily   157.2325502927013
what you have just said induces me to hope that you intend breakfasting with me   97.3806350323896
choose one of us to replace the comte de la fere   164.83516228226063
but it nevertheless appears to me that the dress of a musketeer i wore an enormous cloak said aramis   138.1033184573811
said andrea my servant s coat and my hat   141.54940971159763
then suddenly struck with an idea i am saved   79.30532429233742
alas were it only for my own sake i should prefer to die   110.56868921978655
the officer alone went on board where he was received with all the deference inspired by the uniform   125.44480471534285
monsieur cardinal you know that i do not like worldly pleasures   99.68788654271127
how convenient that there s a bench here   154.75848007067722
i promise you that   125.25774524499415
but he stopped doubtless to reflect   115.57872205671939
it is his way and you must take him as you find him   28.733577925351128
my friend said my mother when your master s orders arrive if it is the poniard which he sends instead of despatching us by that horrible death which we both so much dread you will mercifully kill us with this same poniard will you not   98.23479646333224
my dear friend all those things i have but i am a hermit in the midst of superfluity   133.3672925443168
he s posted there   117.412325760515
bonacieux and the duke entered the louvre without difficulty   176.29294372098147
do you consider her no one   100.8699417462099
a joyous smile lighted porthos s face   165.31989575529022
d artagnan felt a strong inclination to embrace planchet as he had embraced him on his departure   130.4258732674112
noirtier looked at valentine to impose silence but she did not notice him   79.50196427877123
and instantly grimaud sitting upon the board as if on horseback commenced his perilous descent   132.38646047986612
he opened the door of the room in which the musketeers were and found porthos playing an earnest game of dice with aramis   118.80502575635347
where was she   91.42693384543215
danglars is a money lover and those who love money you know think too much of what they risk to be easily induced to fight a duel   114.37026070551558
a whole bottle if you will drink my health   83.5578745545177
according to the care we bestow upon it death is either a friend who rocks us gently as a nurse or an enemy who violently drags the soul from the body   155.58337462845589
cried buckingham making a step toward the door   62.430882991260724
he looked at the queen with anxiety   121.49753020524848
night came   92.93939717479006
instead of the spectacle of gloomy and silent death the piazza del popolo presented a spectacle of gay and noisy mirth and revelry   74.34772570867162
there s a reason   140.24688897010614
and these two living statues whose hearts beat so violently under their marble aspect separated from each other by the whole length of the room forgot themselves for a moment or rather forgot the world in their mutual contemplation   61.38636290023782
it was really very good of you to recognize me so quickly and still more so to bestow your first visit on me   78.83830780879333
porthos turned to look at his sword which was hanging on the wall   85.30775271558328
i admire i love him for i know his former adventures but i shall not speak to him until the day after to morrow   54.43497702147159
in heaven s name my dear athos do not make a useless sacrifice   109.07807978561996
you will not have long to wait said the landlord   90.56998101861046
d artagnan came again on the morrow and was still better received than on the evening before   142.69275819710356
until then you will not see me   126.39195153964323
near the pan he also placed a pretty little basket of villetri grapes and a flask of orvieto   114.71039228307532
juxon was waiting for him impatiently   60.39260275384916
as for franz he remained at florence and after having passed a few days in exploring the paradise of the cascine and spending two or three evenings at the houses of the florentine nobility he took a fancy into his head having already visited corsica the cradle of bonaparte to visit elba the waiting place of napoleon   75.00814440007176
you understand my dear girl continued d artagnan she is the wife of that frightful baboon you saw at the door as you came in   62.24260828614837
villefort s astonishment redoubled at this second thrust so forcibly made by his strange adversary   15.005970064494846
do you suppose that the real savant addresses himself stupidly to the mere individual   110.58277747079748
to which you attach more value it seems than i do to mine   160.88022831694386
it was agreed that the three millions should be intrusted to danglars to invest   183.84788022264715
i will teach you how to laugh to morrow but in another manner   172.20527076059278
and as he declared he was too ignorant of the game to play it regularly they only continued giving balls to one another without counting   139.42685025840922
return as soon as you can florentin   111.60407083238867
i should think we would see him   108.03821301486155
sir you have distracted me   83.19035653935936
he decided then to tell all   154.9409503778988
and your presence you must be aware would compromise the cardinal   133.92367934438846
murmured cromwell   103.93792944020036
how was such a thing possible   79.14278233160712
you procure your mistresses from the opera the vaudeville or the variétés   130.8694375307402
in all probability we shall never see him   96.95677632780749
but my dear fellow replied m   109.26373150725713
this   107.48610250360768
coquenard poured from a very small stone bottle the third of a glass for each of the young men served himself in about the same proportion and passed the bottle to porthos and mme   91.78779685337155
i thank your majesty said aramis but under these robes i have a coat of mail a pistol and a dagger   87.55849705918962
stop exclaimed villequier so mazarin was here   115.35479562597888
he opened the case and offered them to the queen with deep and silent anguish   92.25938990851529
oh you may make sure of him   51.810616039321275
still sir   70.30161684990023
that is all i wished to know   209.64651534315402
timidly asked the old soldier   54.99710301228072
you hear sir said d artagnan turning to mordaunt   129.9352749487804
i was forced to go out of my road to obtain some information near nîmes so that i was somewhat late and therefore i did not choose to stop   12.80973357753895
it is mere want of occupation   191.34386817475863
were heard above all the noise deafening as it was   117.96959079435922
and in exchange for all that not even a scratch   156.2842936253245
but perhaps they have killed him   91.13990899478246
the four friends looked at one another and a cloud came over the brows which but lately had been so cheerful   193.92538524635944
yes sir replied the coachman   135.42049995142676
these active beings flitted here and there like so many demons completing some unknown labor   153.95495265484905
he saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law and perfectly well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate decked with his official scarf as to address a petition to some cold marble effigy   146.30345805466774
milady changed the conversation without any appearance of affectation and asked d artagnan in the most careless manner possible if he had ever been in england   59.26024600078087
it proves you have a good memory for it must be about ten years since we last met   171.28708871918482
when he had fixed his piercing look on this modern babylon which equally engages the contemplation of the religious enthusiast the materialist and the scoffer great city murmured he inclining his head and joining his hands as if in prayer less than six months have elapsed since first i entered thy gates   22.082957984715847
and did he invite you to dine   79.05382290030343
the son of that good merchant of marseilles whom you doubtless recollect   6.253107638845634
he hoped that the weight of earth would not be so great that he could not overcome it   123.66378878171716
morrel called her and she ran to the gate   98.63848655197582
if i once went up those stairs   142.09918496739468
that s a snare said athos   102.7853511036175
from this moment i become your friend and since you are engaged in my affairs i ought to occupy myself in yours   186.95499209359943
he would not die by what seemed an infamous death   81.81353762313461
but as though in a dream he was transfixed to the spot his eyes glared as though they were starting through the sockets   41.1958504238269
there followed between these two personages a strange silence during which the sound of a slow and regular step was heard approaching   73.99769541529929
will your excellency give your name or remain incognito   168.86482986036017
he is one of the most extraordinary men i ever saw in my life   88.84456111042914
grimaud appeared   137.85719704704798
sheathe your swords gentlemen sheathe your swords   81.98441234565428
which interrupted the duchess is now brought up against her as a great crime   158.20208448001222
the first row seeing their sergeant stop stopped in their turn and so on to the very last   67.0307296340044
wasn t his name faria   82.90820700295303
enough sir said morcerf we will speak no more on the subject   78.36545665660185
d artagnan placed the ring on his finger and again waited   130.8893311017157
this voice startled her   22.810264985658335
have you finished grimaud   83.49973006634765
i obey my captain s orders   66.07786549017078
30079m how kind you are   18.840316035937775
bonacieux ate a few mouthfuls mechanically and just touched the glass with her lips   174.47753365462148
if the emissaries of the cardinal arrive he will take no notice   106.52189934389345
sire it was really impossible to learn secrets which that man concealed from all the world   112.47532509801091
yes sir replied raoul with slight hesitation   144.58550333840017
the two friends as we see were worthy of and understood one another   171.92930502375907
five millions why what a crœsus you are   66.05865988601987
excuse me gentlemen said the general   142.0297462312925
many others said he would not appear   53.552791895190055
milady will tell you   102.94763382368176
both sir he has both fortune and position both   120.51241587492774
how have you spent this 250 000 francs   175.9427254910939
spur your horses   70.27723314215113
i don t wish to see anybody but you   163.80205955767008
you have been spoken of in a promising quarter and you will soon i hope have news that will be agreeable to you   92.27319283745086
wait here for me   94.24749928882947
but if he doesn t return   127.62834781008215
did i ever say to you when you were fulfilling your character as a royalist and cut off the head of one of my party my son you have committed a murder   96.43976546068417
it appears too you kept him waiting a long time at boulogne   12.322517593967234
at least keep him there till my daughter be married   82.4752494617397
0079m certainly not   128.3686620082652
of perugino of raphael of manners customs of the famous aqua tofana of which they had told you i think you said that certain individuals in perugia had preserved the secret   41.90086487192002
but continued the queen you have doubtless come for some important purpose   53.94685624721261
anne of austria stretched forth her hand closing her eyes and leaning with the other upon estafania for she felt that her strength was about to fail her   128.86394506706688
now she thought they could not long delay coming to clear the table and that felton would then reappear   169.8750051748339
sir said she i perfectly understand my grandfather s meaning at all times   178.26955068604838
my dear groslow answered mordaunt you know the french proverb nothing one does not do one s self is ever well done   192.1042254620091
d artagnan reassured her as well as he could and promised to remain insensible to the seductions of milady   104.77396939870326
the waiter did as he was desired   90.96963442335311
athos surmised what had taken place and smiled   161.09750890451838
ah i believe noblemen marry amongst themselves do they not   111.19127019359114
he was sixty years old but to me he was handsomer than all the fine youths i saw   141.1264129489009
porthos said nothing but he handled in his pocket the fifty pistoles he had gained from groslow with a degree of satisfaction which betrayed itself in his whole bearing   95.61749662711634
i was at rome during the last carnival   152.52681701747883
i shall require your services to see that all be properly arranged   197.71405943344342
that s true said the procurator s wife groaning that unfortunate outfit   89.94661769646319
the woman who was outside the window turned round and passed within four steps of d artagnan pulling down the hood of her mantle   110.52678960112895
so little that it is not worth reckoning with the general stock   126.52303576600856
a faint cry of mingled pleasure and surprise escaped from the lips of valentine who almost instantly said in a saddened tone as though some envious cloud darkened the joy which illumined her heart alas no maximilian this must not be for many reasons   166.5016175772696
at length about the hour the governor had appointed footsteps were heard on the stairs   84.28514078112104
in the corridor he again met the pretty kitty   38.605049731517425
if we die for him it will be grand   92.73170467582773
have i guards   153.628258771054
what is it grimaud   84.52538365748552
pardon me monseigneur for saying such things but they form my excuse   43.452637015572606
i know you even better now   37.17609296546088
now said athos sleep or try to sleep my friends and i will watch   70.96933358752662
whither are you taking me   161.8590798033877
then taking him aside he whispered to him thou hast done right   94.95750993961386
no one then longer needs my useless life   169.08857524823796
the latter a pretty girl of about twenty or twenty two years active and lively the true soubrette of a great lady jumped from the step upon which according to the custom of the time she was seated and took her way toward the terrace upon which d artagnan had perceived lubin   107.7976313952793
he fixed his eyes on that window he distinguished a shadow in the darkness   117.79123035499052
another possessed all mercédès heart   136.3666431770356
dried lizards shone like emeralds set in great squares of black wood and bunches of wild odoriferous herbs doubtless possessed of virtues unknown to common men were fastened to the ceiling and hung down in the corners of the apartment   97.00949303312889
you know not then anything of your birth you have never seen your mother   60.275326855761655
what has become of the minister   119.88931903799417
i have already told you it is a fancy you have taken in your head   136.53546318758399
yes i will not deny it i do await and i do love him of whom you speak   127.63653192903197
the fresh air and the shame he felt at having exposed himself before his servants partly recalled his senses but the ride was short and as he drew near his house all his wretchedness revived   160.7682911936888
they both dismounted consigned their horses to the lackey who had opened the door and disappeared in the garden   78.08402976670953
then i shall be free i shall have an independent fortune and and what   85.31127759630175
family joys have no charm for me   130.99300352083873
why do we love   114.20028398815069
i hope he whispered to him that you will follow his majesty s example and not get killed for your folly in this den   95.7675269355631
could you allow me a few words in private   261.43120763265193
take mousqueton   78.97438527341879
and you have heard his fortune mentioned   95.18575544970626
it was very polite of you   125.22827454275313
the footsteps they were double paused at the door and dantès guessed that the two grave diggers had come to seek him this idea was soon converted into certainty when he heard the noise they made in putting down the hand bier   207.1366783480219
and do you believe he knew you again kitty   108.53746659984951
50279m an hour had nearly passed during which valentine breathless and motionless watched steadfastly over morrel   140.03309389751107
where then are you going   175.6013148111146
then as i believed my husband would be at home i hastened hither   32.292590044460695
thanks said the latter closing the register with a slam i have all i want   221.96140752464333
he had expected this declaration for the last two or three days and when at last it came his eyes glistened as much as they had lowered on listening to morcerf   65.12138896203302
to tell you that you are free your excellency   155.1075024771988
well i would secure for myself a fortune independent of him even if i acquired it by placing my interests in hands unknown to him   104.50088923286296
my dear athos i wish as your health absolutely requires it that you should rest for a fortnight   112.22351571675111
it s a misfortune to which his friend the devil treats us said aramis   150.58983358181612
i will not sleep where i must scorn   162.87464485388483
by bacchus   55.18314738326109
then cried planchet joyously i see well that it is the same comte de la fere whom we seek   125.34504041854626
his excellency is not perhaps aware that m   131.9961435391742
and it was the sight of his odious blood flowing beneath the ax of the headsman which spread that charming smile upon her lips   166.05444395180382
let him come and he will find a change i will answer for it   73.1866246212787
40132m andrea went as she directed him and on the third floor he found a hare s paw which by the hasty ringing of the bell it was evident he pulled with considerable ill temper   179.39577079919817
cried the old soldier   98.83305576818837
and turning with that fury which made him so formidable he rushed toward the chief of the insurgents a man who with a huge sword in his hand was trying to hew a passage to the coach door through the musketeers   181.35229369382128
the sailors did not require much urging   272.49587112674055
he knew he must call assistance   151.02992588224862
shall i ring   52.15655451043608
on the eleventh the queen in going to mass at notre dame as she always did on saturdays was followed by more than two hundred women demanding justice   101.39699562120744
who wrote for particulars concerning my father   171.74752220436991
from them i learned it all   129.72004165903036
the longboat is yonder lashed to the felucca   125.35044392694425
i wait and listen   84.72431123536589
tell them this athos resumed d artagnan   110.66002626729431
tell the captain we are coming   83.79207400794155
her eyes started with terror her hands trembled and she rapidly drew the bedclothes closer to her   174.58190100123932
but as they drew near in order to cast anchor a little cutter looking like a coastguard formidably armed approached the merchant vessel and dropped into the sea a boat which directed its course to the ladder   204.79498718109645
but before six months you with your music and i with my voice we shall double our capital   80.31280395014724
the carriage stopped at the left side of the portico two men presented themselves at the carriage window   101.71247099938286
upon fifty soldiers   198.78766800398057
yes said aramis we have promised   30.18774184111065
it was brought to me   194.72292222071798
it would be a difficult matter to arrange said monte cristo   68.75875887794072
i believe she is detained in france by some love affair   91.86005042678059
d artagnan then remembered the injunction if you value your own life or that of those who love you remain motionless and as if you had seen nothing   89.16183665835017
the duke had followed with anxiety la ramee s unspoken soliloquy reading it from point to point upon his face   40.448313941000094
listen my dear my adored valentine said he in his melodious and grave tone   37.49705991147039
d artagnan comprehended their irresolution   132.65440417796927
at last he uttered a sigh of satisfaction and paused as if he had partially appeased his hunger   50.94810480091775
albert with his eyes closed was standing grasping the window curtains   108.81818283521369
now since d artagnan did not constitute a body of horsemen since he was alone since he was not going away from rueil and was going to saint germain no one paid any attention to him and his journey was not obstructed in any way   146.51473460196084
i am obliged to you guitant although your intention was perhaps not very favorable to me for such an opportunity   134.70394351981514
the cannonade of the isle of ré presaged to him the dragonnades of the cévennes   105.16916543410728
as soon as lord de winter saw buckingham was dead he ran to felton whom the soldiers still guarded on the terrace of the palace   45.87148516697408
there are the fifty louis i faith said aramis emptying the purse on the table all bearing the effigy of louis xiii   67.72561195778506
to day monsieur   86.66749102764733
he gave accurate descriptions of naples and malta which he knew as well as marseilles and held stoutly to his first story   175.19413693457085
here is a pardon for one of the prisoners   116.42430258259775
albert in his turn sat behind   103.79057896621272
it appears to me said d artagnan with that prudence which allied itself in him so naturally with excessive bravery that we could have found some retired place on the downs or the seashore   111.91466823115272
we will give them money   80.71003660240632
how can such enormous jars have been manufactured   92.01390328925477
is the abbé at home   158.15671153525503
he entered the chamber and closed the door behind him   160.03494052722453
enter gentlemen and be kind enough to wait for me   30.89006548068714
you will send him to me   109.00289744056516
we are going to return to the service mouston replied porthos still trying to restore his mustache to the military curl it had long lost   119.83667324256822
he called it using his advantages   69.40102965622667
indeed that doubtless would have happened if his credentials had not been so favorable   135.70598307363798
i only wish he would let me take his place   93.52426513497463
he fancied that they buried the dead at the château d if and imagining they would not expend much labor on the grave of a prisoner he calculated on raising the earth with his shoulders but unfortunately their arrangements at the château frustrated his projects   16.382954262900583
in five minutes three were slightly wounded one on the hand another on the ear by the defender of the stair who himself remained intact a piece of skill which was worth to him according to the rules agreed upon three turns of favor   153.78835438637577
most willingly   184.5475989879738
said beauchamp in a calm tone   196.4204108359242
a carriage had been sent to meet him and the gigantic porthos who stood a head above the entire rabble soon announced that he saw the royal equipage approaching   68.18688628336253
the blood mounted instantly to the temples of d artagnan who arose and replied i consider it worthy conduct of a pupil of jesuits   68.20975071717908
porthos looked at d artagnan in astonishment   136.72703100816085
he turned round as if to give an order to cahusac and houdinière   121.01408473160714
this time however his address although polite was cooler than usual   172.0468923148503
and if i lose   117.23792485361535
upon my word said albert i deserve no credit for what i could not help namely a determination to take everything as i found it and to let those bandits see that although men get into troublesome scrapes all over the world there is no nation but the french that can smile even in the face of grim death himself   105.7986611369516
your pardon sir said milady with mildness   100.4329936980409
for you have never seemed to me so grand as you are to day   98.64723134537905
franz untied it and in the midst of the most profound silence read 40038m extract of the report of a meeting of the bonapartist club in the rue saint jacques held february 5th 1815   61.53181122970958
has your majesty forgotten that the king expects your reply and awaits it in agony   108.85511429893187
do you know what has become of athos   193.08662570133475
i had been told that you had endeavored to escape   79.63779990375261
then inviting albert to take the vacant seat beside her she recommended franz to take the next best if he wished to view the ballet and pointed to the one behind her own chair   23.029793036863353
he is an excellent person   66.01023030067788
if they continue to advance we must fire again   48.44180942167304
come monsieur   139.86443355079788
well i was not hot headed then well but what else could you play for   96.53232901740475
yet in spite of his earnest prayers dantès remained a prisoner   209.13906587438615
but i tell you monsieur commissary cried bonacieux in his turn there is not the least doubt about the matter   68.96314188187456
well sir asked franz what do you wish me to do with this paper   80.57552974553303
the interior of the musketeers when d artagnan was out of the louvre and consulted his friends upon the use he had best make of his share of the forty pistoles athos advised him to order a good repast at the pomme de pin porthos to engage a lackey and aramis to provide himself with a suitable mistress   46.15661574044999
you are not a man   184.71956701128948
he stepped forward and touching the young man s shoulder said i was looking for you my friend   142.91598793785818
nothing at least personally said monte cristo   58.09465747556267
and he pointed to a magnificent hotel situated on the very spot whereon the vaudeville now stands   101.3169410350319
and continued he significantly with a hand on his breast and shaking his head that is more than everyone can say nowadays   141.0824818334754
from that glass door the pale faced man went to the count s bedroom and raised with a constricted hand the curtain of a window overlooking the courtyard   111.12484032015583
on my word replied the count not more than another   164.2910775756556
a thousand thanks for your honorable company which has saved me from all the dangers to which alone i was exposed   123.60703373439488
now gascons are always poor are they not   70.10374906961053
de la trémouille reflected for an instant   45.087176895294476
two hours and a quarter that is nothing   152.85966275166612
one of these two men was a woman disguised as a cavalier   74.44482409990418
and it is well i can chevalier said milady for do you know what is going on here   113.33397713578482
hey friend   21.71224093573042
mercédès seized fernand s hands with a transport which he took for love but which was only joy at being no longer alone in the world and seeing at last a friend after long hours of solitary sorrow   122.6419269430988
besides i don t prevent you from listening but i must be gone   172.868329595051
never sir said raoul as long as i possess the happiness of having you for a protector shall i deem i have the right of freeing myself from a guardianship so valuable to me   118.55682250014502
a lesson   125.386713095234
the king s procureur alone was deprived of his office being suspected of royalism   119.30952749095624
and now what do you want   3.808824331897327
you your command and i my title   19.19671270369564
you see i have not these necessary papers   156.14304990802947
but instead of finding sympathy in the eyes of the doctor and his father he only saw an expression as inflexible as that of maximilian   60.72612852408642
if i live interest would be converted into doubt pity into hostility   116.20648111059948
your relative left la rochelle for england during the night   22.4718215484056
benedetto the count s son   144.74572578005942
make all your arrangements and tell me where i shall be able to find you this evening at ten o clock   123.53428242264778
if you do not go sir said de guiche remember that we have two steeds able to catch your mule and the power of having you seized wherever you may be   103.48882620287128
and your guardian sir asked the queen who could not help feeling some interest in the handsome young man before her what is his name   217.43347343017115
i return to my convent   227.06160159206013
will you not see my sister once more   132.55646012413956
d épinay she would be all the more likely to listen to any other proposition   58.975119376994336
one day in a moment of despair like yours since it led to a similar resolution i also wished to kill myself   86.41544764278461
de richelieu   65.19442299759515
yes dear monsieur porthos   73.92030912922911
my dear porthos you are really a man of most superior understanding said d artagnan with a look as if he spoke against his conviction   97.6606046017639
i do not know said the servant but the housemaid is in mademoiselle valentine s room perhaps she has emptied them   163.21254232727722
his first cry was for his father   217.80392607169657
touch nothing my little friend cried the count eagerly   116.80064141376458
danglars trembled too   139.71451070625727
the paralytic closed his eyes in token of assent   176.14996020841335
we have made considerable advances   200.4512315624254
plenty   37.52328086353798
certainly it is wrong said monte cristo but you should take into consideration the youth and greediness of the delinquent   125.15101614813717
it sounds like the cry of one who is being murdered murmured the host   38.33268830229089
and then shut out from friendship having but one affection which could not be mixed up with her ordinary pursuits she thought of herself of no one but herself   153.8102687061308
five minutes after the new telegram reached the minister debray had the horses put to his carriage and drove to danglars house   88.39755991947746
the count withdrew his foot   206.09949963030968
still further he had seldom seen the young musketeer   70.68023303355758
it is very natural   73.01725623350603
his long dark hair softly powdered here and there with silver tendrils fell elegantly over his shoulders in wavy curls   120.931870920559
there go three or four limping away   101.86406613252385
he is quite sure that his wishes will be held sacred by me   125.32434259353938
sit down and let us talk it over   117.25794722580514
and she again tried to think what it could be   35.76285347863596
said he raising himself on his elbow is it you comte de la fere   126.14050423530365
then you were about to tell me all the isolation of your life the griefs of your heart   10.211680030179977
said madame de villefort in a harsh and constrained tone   20.801972454911237
the proposition had been made and received with enthusiasm when fortunately eleven o clock struck   79.54180302859751
the honor of no one will have cause to complain of what i have to tell   94.44261148097127
i am innocent   19.664891048060824
expiation notwithstanding the density of the crowd m   59.6550583293566
the corvette must now i think be on her way to fécamp must she not   71.2642377821591
oh more than i can say kitty   69.3644038612915
he approached her and said in a low voice has your majesty still confidence in me   66.49492115247654
our passport   191.29438730876052
i can still do much for you   161.4365784756439
then you must have something on your mind   123.29840402137177
interrupted the stranger   122.78432459270932
laugh as much as you will replied albert i am in love   86.03087771725657
tell him they warned lord de winter of my journey to england   40.86440323749834
do not deceive yourself   28.54397583474301
it was evident that the abbé limited himself to objects of strict necessity   78.68499687587615
athos may always be found replied tréville ready to answer when it shall please the gownsmen to interrogate him   74.56919311827289
the count of monte cristo had just entered   136.98890806831747
d artagnan thus felt himself humiliated in having only procured one meal and a half for his companions as the breakfast at the priest s could only be counted as half a repast in return for the feasts which athos porthos and aramis had procured him   89.69343109618222
sometimes when the cardinal always on horseback like the lowest gendarme of the army cast a pensive glance over those works so slowly keeping pace with his wishes which the engineers brought from all the corners of france were executing under his orders if he met a musketeer of the company of tréville he drew near and looked at him in a peculiar manner and not recognizing in him one of our four companions he turned his penetrating look and profound thoughts in another direction   119.12464874232532
noirtier could not be persuaded to quit his grandchild   59.60909330894778
the sword   99.28681828519196
it gave me pain and it was an ungracious part to play but i have said nothing either to the one or to the other   139.27655908068274
replied monte cristo astonished in his turn   48.63172858601162
while he was listening to this recital delivered with the greatest simplicity the duke looked from time to time at the young man with astonishment as if he could not comprehend how so much prudence courage and devotedness could be allied with a countenance which indicated not more than twenty years   112.94528824363742
the doctor turned pale   155.51718291046586
for a man is above that sort of thing   105.27045360936691
why for him and not for me   54.71278618159911
yes yes that is true   138.10999974916513
after shutting the gate behind them i pretended to return to the house but i immediately went out a back door and stealing along in the shade of the hedge i gained yonder clump of elder from which i could hear and see everything   162.17167370115516
you may perceive madame by my uniform that i am an officer in the english navy replied the young man   171.46679344923348
really madame he said did i alarm you much   114.58364457572654
d artagnan it is wrong thus to neglect your friends particularly at the moment you are about to leave them for so long a time   123.1126704997488
oh now i may say so   115.2759340505394
at length after waiting a quarter of an hour and just as twilight was beginning to thicken a carriage appeared coming at a quick pace on the road of sèvres   89.46625730636008
the first person that struck him on his entrance was aramis planted near a great chair on castors very large covered with a canopy of tapestry under which there moved enveloped in a quilt of brocade a little face youngish very merry somewhat pallid whilst its eyes never ceased to express a sentiment at once lively intellectual and amiable   101.09918411913867
the porter was drawing the cord at the moment milady cried from her window don t open   100.6258917992946
exclaimed raoul ashamed of so much attention   144.5271053978267
this time it was a great matter that was under discussion connected with a vessel laden with turkey carpets stuffs of the levant and cashmeres   168.55788769955626
he had not seen morrel   99.31021966112316
but the travelers declared they would sleep in the common chamber each on a mattress which might be thrown upon the ground   147.7162620441046
he caused me to be arrested had me conducted hither and placed me under your guard   125.22341556081534
through the ingenuousness of her age beamed an ardent mind not of the woman but of the poet   129.65289428465485
the junction of the bodice and drawers was entirely concealed by one of the many colored scarves whose brilliant hues and rich silken fringe have rendered them so precious in the eyes of parisian belles   118.66534830955773
i have been in ill luck for several days said danglars and i have heard nothing but bad news   128.1703233092543
d artagnan heard the door close   154.07049086648544
he came to request his master to return to his lodgings where his presence was urgent as he piteously said   91.47237020760957
never till then had i placed any confidence in presentiments but now i can not help believing them valentine   82.45139576581101
he believed having triumphed over me in my sleep that all was completed   155.31353684859914
ali as my model   31.396460713863263
a strange thing is the mind and it is wonderful what revolutions may be wrought in it by a sign a word a hope   181.4265759090492
and she fell on her knees at the same time holding me up towards heaven as if she desired while praying to god in my behalf to raise me actually to his presence   113.24144528626138
that when once the order was signed by buckingham and buckingham would sign it the more readily from its bearing a false name and he could not therefore recognize the woman in question once this order was signed we say the baron would make her embark immediately and she knew very well that women condemned to exile employ arms much less powerful in their seductions than the pretendedly virtuous woman whose beauty is lighted by the sun of the world whose style the voice of fashion lauds and whom a halo of aristocracy gilds with enchanting splendors   87.22493224412838
d artagnan and athos took the nags of planchet and grimaud and the two lackeys started on foot carrying the saddles on their heads   103.88286564722095
five and twenty thousand francs is not a large sum however replied monte cristo with a tone so sweet and gentle that it went to maximilian s heart like the voice of a father   35.06266858084324
exclaimed madame danglars   111.62540874404003
peppino nodded and taking a rosary from his pocket began to mutter a few prayers while the clerk disappeared through the same door by which danglars and the attendant had gone out   100.5345919149486
the accusation chapter 81   48.571070119384046
a dead horse   12.591283839825394
i have brought my receipt   114.72985670419104
good answered harrison   141.57026168085113
mazarin disappeared as they rose from table   145.27368975115044
magloire a little frequented passage enclosed with a turnstile at each end   116.39382778826956
we need not add that the goldsmith o reilly and his assistant were prohibited from going out under any pretext   170.01232716323835
not of my own   5.5701648244717745
here were not as in other tombs ignoble drawers one above another where thrift bestows its dead and labels them like specimens in a museum   82.64016400824454
besides the manner in which beauchamp had closed the conference left a bitter recollection in his heart   128.92000511615046
this was a blow to d artagnan   102.34603035547907
i said sire that four hundred thousand pounds are owing to the scottish army   58.50375503864355
danglars observed that during the whole conversation morcerf had never once dared to ask if it was on his own account that danglars recalled his word   65.70945414599453
almost immediately bazin came downstairs   233.34732942832778
then three or four shots were fired   112.39881024514932
have you ever noticed how much a thing is heightened in value when we obtain possession of it   157.21778821525837
and instead of four musketoons and twelve balls we shall have fifteen guns and a hundred charges to fire   88.37839216068606
can it not be put off till to morrow   103.16045623026903
yes excellency returned the steward   112.71491545096382
andrea had taken the precaution to leave no traces of his feet in the ashes but still it was an outlet and in this light was not to be passed over without serious investigation   58.48411728964177
and by whom were they recommended to you   12.324091723071916
we have asked him for money   166.13295222666102
but dear friend if you ever need me you know that i am entirely devoted to you   126.95420602116783
i am your prisoner said aramis giving up his sword to porthos   156.3461278786752
but there were three races were there not   65.42278494876847
he cried with his gascon accent   103.70198756186487
the two young men he announced were indeed approaching   96.9594488335649
request him to come here directly   213.39670513897897
ah my mother my poor mother   202.69277005996986
it is agreed is it not   155.41079746436233
we met in the place royale egad   182.35497480126227
i reflected long for a gnawing ambition had long preyed upon me and then i replied listen i have always heard of providence and yet i have never seen him or anything that resembles him or which can make me believe that he exists   77.02778034721021
the swiss received two wounds and was not aware of it by reason of the cold   125.22311421002185
fool   87.14101759674193
what s the matter now planchet   146.8864686577939
it is very hot said athos drawing his sword in its turn and yet i can not take off my doublet   117.47691224714924
that the count has never been willing to partake of food under the roof of m   83.9093826052089
is it possible to find a more submissive slave than myself   106.79810716234952
if she is a cardinalist she has no fanaticism at least   98.65300762081306
but first of all pray have a servant father   169.08521498952422
he is following me   132.26679171795215
i am going alone   122.80617084379442
but i betrayed sacrificed buried have risen from my tomb by the grace of god to punish that man   182.97250555205034
i shall meet them there and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview   118.10468239213697
m repeated franz   28.95468310885522
come hither and let us talk   120.8722857183171
happily for him he has ceased to bear that name   88.01613634392868
sir said milady is your presence an indispensable accessory of my captivity   56.445179582673155
give me a draft for 4 998 louis on these gentlemen and our banker shall take it   87.04930410828469
monte cristo slowly left the house and turned towards the quay   74.18400781127605
unfortunately he is more nimble than his master   122.57948904623424
he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight   104.74245934548465
suddenly exclaimed debray   111.55240316056025
lord a mercy my lord   133.82554875609495
the astonished president looked at the jury who in turn looked at villefort   104.39371601208772
furnished by two years of premature meditation and a long sojourn among the puritans   95.78727679266046
and i even i opposed the designs of the great man who held the destinies of france within the hollow of his hand   53.08902417642712
a portion of the troops had already arrived and the remainder was expected from moment to moment   37.380248472858156
yes egad   39.42035803051115
it surprises me that two such heroes as porthos and d artagnan should have allowed themselves to be arrested by eight men   108.92017396132898
i was at school at the time and the adventure appeared to me to be cruel for the king   162.32458960155765
but asked madame danglars looking at her husband with uneasiness how could that prevent m   81.60496634878449
she made him a sign to dismount and come to her   109.28132691094314
at this sight alone franz felt his legs tremble under him   52.02816225513878
and how does france appear in your eyes accustomed as they have been to gaze on such enchanted scenes   75.29406963647403
yes yes i understand said danglars and then in a low tone he added to paris no doubt to deliver the letter which the grand marshal gave him   50.38865113881057
whom shall i announce   115.85661292036356
in the donjon of vincennes   116.7186605032536
she that was enceinte she who was walking while she waited for bertuccio stood at the open door with his eyes starting and his hair on end   114.2294931420028
how they must be asking where is the cardinal   77.97985138986294
it is his son   149.6364196410828
avenged yourself said the baron   230.42646278307603
his early refinement of character was not only not lost it grew even greater than ever   121.57718372285534
they are only four   30.554775950810964
had you known this edmond dantès of whom they spoke   99.44514266385785
you will then submit to what fate decrees for you without even attempting to contend with it   108.66829755265088
i think you wished to do so of your own accord   67.70611397254994
mouston cried porthos   84.22447369214109
wrote in a hand as small as possible another note on the margin of his horace and then looking at the duke with the air of a man who thinks he has an idea of his own while he is only commenting upon the idea of another said go on my dear duke go on i listen   133.9988994659424
then more helpless than an infant and colder and paler than marble more crushed and broken than a reed trampled under foot he fell back doubled up in one last convulsion and became as rigid as a corpse   99.29243242715629
he was at that period of intoxication in which vulgar drinkers fall on the floor and go to sleep   116.1089082716451
if you go on so his eminence will be forced to renew his company in three weeks and i to put the edicts in force in all their rigor   143.33027498979357
for heaven s sake madame said villefort with a firmness of expression not altogether free from harshness for heaven s sake do not ask pardon of me for a guilty wretch   167.5522389108516
meanwhile ali had procured the arms the count required namely a short carbine and a pair of double barrelled pistols with which as sure an aim might be taken as with a single barrelled one   27.88125422455535
gendarmes said the president lead in the accused   101.58641607593168
there i will indicate to you the best place and time   88.44877986293994
i am sure of it they would prefer dying on the spot to being arrested or taking back a step   124.03997381386827
oh said albert with all the cajolery of which he was capable   163.8742486589518
the pope is the successor of st   66.14468466466212
but as soon as the stranger had completed his repast the agitated innkeeper went eagerly to the door and opened it   95.61152274750864
you can never have so much as i wish you   110.05768828093672
for believe me but for you i should have ceased to live on the day i doubted my father and renounced his name   127.160031737708
instead of that air of life of comfort and of happiness that permeates a flourishing and prosperous business establishment instead of merry faces at the windows busy clerks hurrying to and fro in the long corridors instead of the court filled with bales of goods re echoing with the cries and the jokes of porters one would have immediately perceived all aspect of sadness and gloom   107.89300041635761
keep your journey a secret   34.850533285214624
but this sufficed for jacopo who instinctively felt that edmond had a right to superiority of position a superiority which edmond had concealed from all others   195.92502995016002
sheathe then if you please and follow us   27.022209863883774
50113m well i must confess these are scruples   44.9465367123839
he had about two hundred men in the courtyards and stables and he placed them at the queen s disposal   134.15378528228106
do as you like with them   0.8454194919388129
i wished to make my adieux to you but time does not permit   211.8237060403988
at this moment the tapestry moved aside and a nubian black as ebony and dressed in a plain white tunic made a sign to his master that all was prepared in the dining room   66.70959131012532
my story will be accepted for there is no one left to contradict me   168.6322255584069
this contest at length exhausted jussac s patience   155.49651151926963
no replied the countess it was certainly empty during the first act   51.934916440792605
he therefore dined very silently in spite of the officious attention of his host who presented himself two or three times to inquire if he wanted anything   80.06763973682499
in a moment thanks to her habit of conversing with her grandfather she understood that he asked for a key   52.890065868442505
d artagnan knows that terrible secret which she has sworn no one shall know without dying   94.92884783512073
during that time he had many moments of despair   76.16430175282034
d artagnan had heard the door shut and the shutters barred   23.66935514141167
the stranger smiled a melancholy smile   56.774738587997405
so curious that i think you are running a great risk of a prosecution for defamation of character   160.60849319622147
land might resemble a cloud but the fire was not a meteor   151.8381702304972
grimaud in fact was not only the accountant but the armorer of the party   65.86555727041338
yes indeed my dear duke   166.01141739291992
then another error seized me on seeing you in company with these gentlemen i was afraid you were dangerously ill   77.29796171280933
i believe he is a lutheran   92.43371043048889
porthos bowed   163.12042178891684
there terminates at least to the present moment the duty i had to fulfill toward you   85.2782681204178
no i remain replied athos with a threatening gesture that promised no good to whomsoever it was addressed   47.52522347728467
as to what you say about not seeing you again i believe not a word of it   130.80871059342766
de tréville in a feeble yet perfectly calm voice you have sent for me as my comrades inform me and i have hastened to receive your orders   112.52734782201888
so much the better so much the better   196.6219028563848
the host and his wife were standing on the steps whilst the unhappy man seemed to suffer dreadful pain and yet to be concerned only to know if he was followed by the monk   0.6417162288296225
and he convulsively grasped the hand of d avrigny   63.50815978610649
these two women held each other for an instant in a close embrace   142.8262724133138
as for grimaud his hair stood on end and drops of sweat ran down his brow   158.9478353498787
we are going to rejoin that good fellow porthos   103.27284894142366
eh how can i tell   96.57938878940239
everybody is ignorant that you are the bearer of a letter from the island of elba and addressed to m   80.2502500307551
the count left his box and a moment later was saluting the baronne danglars who could not restrain a cry of mingled pleasure and surprise   110.78345037790648
and should you see one whom you could prefer i would not be so unjust i have never seen anyone i preferred to you and i have never loved anyone but you and my father   74.3432695983905
but no news arrived that was not annoying and threatening   56.86072558460036
you know it was agreed you should put in there   164.31602721519522
providence has declared for us since i have found this brave man again in so miraculous a manner   45.597967010571864
porthos was snoring most musically when some one touched him on the shoulder   90.24448458207058
he entered third and aramis who shut the gate after him last   108.6739061528906
when you have cherished a wish and have charged me with its fulfillment have i ever replied it is impossible   100.63400022820119
but as they were preparing to escape together they were both arrested   150.8324555982199
thought d artagnan it is very little to offset the unexpected tribulations i am bringing to this poor devil who has so warmly welcomed me   113.75221378556188
the duke exchanged a signal with them   32.45693218293893
yes said the count yes   93.69728277646479
at this very moment friquet passed mounted on raoul s horse waving his parti colored cap and crying broussel   139.93904093149507
dancers players talkers all uttered an exclamation of joy everyone inhaled with delight the breeze that floated in   57.89855827051175
a country clown said anne of austria people will laugh   174.79021563872314
i rang for a light but as no one came i determined to find one for myself   120.04287191108692
he too ten years ago had piously sought out a tomb and sought it vainly   122.9890646952295
when all had gone out and the door was closed m   148.2953122434318
obey that person implicitly   87.6670677540904
bonacieux what is it   164.13951221260635
well fernand i must say said caderousse beginning the conversation with that brutality of the common people in which curiosity destroys all diplomacy you look uncommonly like a rejected lover   150.49804282173267
make your complaints known   103.86350701481663
and if you come another fathom nearer i ll stave your wicked head in with this oar   195.0939271119869
ah how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman should be so avaricious   89.97770290114187
i shall want you this evening he said return in two hours   166.0534303363624
andrea had fled   71.9718630050009
i set out three days ago passing miraculously through the puritan army and i took post horses with my servant tony   48.874609504467365
come said d artagnan let us inquire further   192.11040159144932
the matter is replied d artagnan that i can see upon this pier neither inspector nor sentinel nor exciseman   129.32997892017744
he extended a hand to raoul and said my young friend all the praises that are given me should be passed on to the count here   143.4099021617225
everyone who surrounds me is free to quit me and when they leave me will no longer have any need of me or anyone else   69.35272396487014
but my mother as a child saw her   44.34113818019924
and when shall i be avenged   118.27266406550909
and when i am gone you can open to him   128.31366535869194
perhaps she was even writing a letter imploring forgiveness from her virtuous husband a forgiveness she was purchasing with her death   88.46760979605499
at last it became aramis s turn who performed it with a good grace and who succeeded as he said by selling some theological books in procuring a few pistoles   94.15945524109136
gad i should be very happy but i have my companion monsieur du vallon and the two prisoners whom i can not leave   91.3449228826692
carmela was precisely the age and figure of teresa and teresa was as handsome as carmela   206.12161324926865
willingly said albert   166.52368723992382
ah cried d artagnan really carried away by the passion this woman had the power to kindle in his heart ah that is because my happiness appears so impossible to me   118.27450547698555
he shall be both blind and deaf replied the young man with an air of determination that made his companion shudder   132.97126200842308
and monsieur d artagnan of whom you spoke just now monsieur d herblay   106.42957928425731

i should have taken four reefs in the topsails and furled the spanker   101.50800862597696
has the loss of memory rendered it impossible for you to weep   103.05856480584644
you have not forgotten st   163.4206549953612
then he added in spanish anne are you mad   91.55396001482842

yes said felton   160.79363759131257

chapter 3   143.81939479033608
now if i had taken the veil all this fortune would have descended to my father and in reversion to his son   137.05575505351368
it was mordaunt   117.8041285620204
remember this is no affair of mine said the trembling voice of la carconte as though through the flooring of her chamber she viewed the scene that was enacting below   149.03704867854793
besides should you find your income insufficient you can for the sake of the past madame make use of mine   125.81872479248285
who has consoled me in my sorrow but he   88.05514208945716
i will compensate thee for the loss of thy place   86.82421329157896

from her majesty as i think   109.80179480259704
speak sir   84.44755531217629
and continued he casting a side glance at lucien who was turning over the leaves of an album mademoiselle eugénie is pretty i think i remember that to be her name   43.80119251113503
they may serve us   142.5686543255492
a sword en pale on an oval shield like all the italian armorial bearings and surmounted by a cardinal s hat   88.69469643576582
if we see a close carriage at all suspicious in appearance come out let us fall upon it   100.29671390014425
for that might be broken or deranged in its movements while the sun and earth never vary in their appointed paths   135.77237058466073
very young i presume   96.58179927412324
and now said athos unless monsieur cardinal should form the ingenious idea of ripping up grimaud i think we may be pretty much at our ease respecting the letter   187.54059726068334
consequently morrel having left the rue meslay at half past eight by his timepiece entered the clover field while the clock of saint philippe du roule was striking eight   71.98448912593716
what have i done then   133.13497800677314
the second i heard his name by chance   92.27239839600254
one day when i was reproaching him for his unavailing searches and deploring the prostration of mind that followed them he looked at me and smiling bitterly opened a volume relating to the history of the city of rome   155.23333938609923
and raoul what shall you do with him   135.68019928967283
madame de villefort on the contrary is burning with the desire of seeing this extraordinary nabob in his own house therefore she has with great difficulty prevailed on my father to accompany her   134.1899365044612
the host had reckoned upon eleven days of confinement at a crown a day but he had reckoned without his guest   180.41945833059756
how could i know what i was the bearer of   172.75148385681746
young edward   171.51807119684742
on y va coming exclaimed peppino who from frequenting the house of signor pastrini understood french perfectly in all its idioms   104.02887024331912
want one   61.503879864818465
i defy you to find him who executed it   65.14719883052717
repeated i   129.39765659032764
i shall no sooner be out of prison than i shall be master of paris   103.89888573869246
on the way we escaped   160.82968939382735
however i am rather too old and tough to be very good eating   51.62460082948528
so franz must wait   41.473851701287145
morrel overpowered turned around in the armchair   65.26750906740853
exclaimed franz the peasant girl who snatched his mocoletto from him was a lad of fifteen replied peppino   128.22313916202359
though answered in the negative he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on the fifth floor that in despite of the oft repeated assurance of the concierge that they were occupied dantès succeeded in inducing the man to go up to the tenants and ask permission for a gentleman to be allowed to look at them   152.43357517424027
merciful goodness   204.57580833442893
i do not believe there is a god howled caderousse   57.06921469977039
shall you be able to pay m   72.00731765207316
another valet was engaged for himself a new servant for noirtier two women had entered madame de villefort s service in fact everywhere to the concierge and coachmen new faces were presented to the different masters of the house thus widening the division which had always existed between the members of the same family   117.55500843427646
i leave him with you my friend   90.00223894481874
but i tell you that the favor of a minister is ephemeral and that a man must be mad to attach himself to a minister   101.42506817734571
the fact is that i do not doubt your eminence s genius will repair the blunders of his agent is that it   129.74835582501572
i am not in love with mademoiselle mercédès   89.07024843535785
then this young man escaped with you   137.69779989867172
because no one knows not even the assassin that for the last twelve months i have given m   125.62374366939851
d artagnan had already opened the door of the second room and from the expression of his face it was clear that he there beheld some extraordinary object   184.12450490535235
but how long might this exile last   131.2871288814548
we hear from yanina chapter 79   61.3786262107602
it was she whom he sought   19.441185148890483
plague on t i will guard the king and porthos shall guard the cardinal   58.88472422377607
deposited with the justice   85.29389940870577
the secret entrance was open   82.33914524739222
i do not know who could if i could not said caderousse   21.770070107601953
he approached the dying man and leaning over him with a calm and melancholy look he whispered i am i am and his almost closed lips uttered a name so low that the count himself appeared afraid to hear it   71.46957852733681
at which hour he rose in order to repair to the residence of m   86.44243025759269
you understand then comte de la fere you understand chevalier d herblay that i am altogether and always at your service   92.84872818105691
here he said here is a draft at sight   74.0820610505072
with a single glance the prisoner took in the apartment in its minutest details   129.9102529644283
mordaunt replied grimaud   158.91723965521066
valentine had solved the problem and was able easily to understand his thoughts and to convey her own in return and through her untiring and devoted assiduity it was seldom that in the ordinary transactions of every day life she failed to anticipate the wishes of the living thinking mind or the wants of the almost inanimate body   110.86988414787461
alas said edmond smiling these are the treasures the cardinal has left   133.9461116797548
they expected to hear some mention made of d artagnan or of porthos but every one was engrossed by articles and reforms   193.43761165388116
repeated porthos and aramis   63.829943314130595
a quarter of an hour to go to the tent a quarter of an hour to return   28.70772223403138
now am i at liberty to retire   29.241850167150744
how lofty how magnificent monsieur athos was that day when he said to his adversary you have insisted on knowing my name sir   87.52944573540927
when he had mounted his phaeton monte cristo turned and seeing bertuccio what news   55.7668788602393
well so be it said d artagnan   79.68376499359866
where are we to go my lord   53.7607894917879
franz could not forbear breaking in upon the apparently interesting conversation passing between the countess and albert to inquire of the former if she knew who was the fair albanian opposite since beauty such as hers was well worthy of being observed by either sex   121.71544101780829
let us walk in the park answered porthos for the sake of digestion   120.59288656467567
you must stop at the little village of eccuis in which there is but one tavern the shield of france   61.353292238126755
we also informed monsieur porthos of what was going on   142.33541997300463
he knows that it has not yet been sent to its address   49.26797397072114
what for five years he had been wanting a faithful servant a friend a helping hand seemed to have fallen from heaven just when he expected it the least   23.05834479046362
the peasant the gardener was rochefort whom he believed to be in the bastile   49.23153624674939
i ve a great desire to drink the king s health said athos   90.55916480152773
felton offered the weapon to milady who examined the temper of it attentively and who tried the point on the tip of her finger   50.38457688050377
by daybreak we shall have reached our retreat and nobody can guess where we are   110.45126634255466
well do you know if the persons you see there are rich or poor if their sacks of wheat are not rubies or diamonds   159.9677696988229
athos followed comminges without saying a single word   171.69907314571088
therefore when i cough stretch out your arm   33.00342083009659
he consented   31.459106247295708
dantès is my friend and i won t have him ill used   106.871036248084
my faith it appears so   121.26737488576784
a groom was rubbing them down   42.49228369699502
raoul learn how to distinguish the king from royalty   107.54874559100644
the queen at last asked him if he had anything to add to the fine discourse he had just made to her   63.67566679406836
jackson said he go instantly to the lord chancellor and tell him that i charge him with the execution of these orders   171.63916509127347
you told me to give them to him   46.38789365196263
silence is the last joy of the unhappy   80.22290027698813
the gallery on the sea side which had long been in ruins was rebuilt   166.82017490271187
his natural prudence however never forsook him for a single instant   167.69626619517197
i think i have some clew   221.42312754486017
he placed the cloak on his shoulders and the hat on his head whilst the musketeer got off the box   100.14188025040264
till then god preserve your majesty   36.51231966234609
my dear albert said debray what you tell us is so extraordinary   120.62939400782078
they hang behead and impale their criminals in the most agreeable possible manner   91.25602054255259
he was placed before a large glass which reflected the whole apartment and so without any attempt to move which would have been impossible he could see all who entered the room and everything which was going on around him   155.90717836994563
ah it is you peppino said the count   123.11123162104775
what is the use of following the alleys   161.14655842086717
said franz reseating himself   59.78803348405064
possibly possibly said beauchamp immediately   112.00140180821333
yesterday i undertook to employ that cord which you see hanging against the wall but pain prevented my continuing the pious exercise   39.37460644916821
i should think so indeed   7.493716384798148
will you invite young m   75.40766706578599
but like the aurora which guides the navigator in northern latitudes opened new vistas to the inquiring mind of the listener and gave fantastic glimpses of new horizons enabling him justly to estimate the delight an intellectual mind would have in following one so richly gifted as faria along the heights of truth where he was so much at home   109.73465605268963
next morning faithful to his promise he sent the prescription requested   67.21111490259739
it is very strange said albert to hear such words proceed from the mouth of anyone but an actress on the stage and one needs constantly to be saying to one s self this is no fiction it is all reality in order to believe it   82.81822199536299
i live there during my leave of absence continued maximilian   93.51671662637715
i would realize how would you realize   129.9020532985987
you have done right lieutenant said the soldier   54.27858133130209
let me look at you   120.30724080552639
but you have been silent for twenty years sir   92.39117253216197
i would buy with the proceeds certain lands around my father s chateau which is a pretty place well enough but with no land to it at all except a garden about the size of the cemetery des innocents   138.94467660938557
their officers wish to see you sir   115.22252922582575
it is not to abandon them that we have separated but to avoid compromising them   167.53781204963403
the solicitors arrived at this moment and arranged their scrawled papers on the velvet cloth embroidered with gold which covered the table prepared for the signature   154.4854969683088
it need not be said that planchet in resuming his former functions resumed also his former humility and was not ashamed to make his breakfast on what was left by d artagnan   107.04329887193681
they will be much less likely to   149.30381608537672
monte cristo then drew a lighted taper from a closet and when the thief was deeply engaged with his lock silently opened the door taking care that the light should shine directly on his face   40.42077105737799
it may be supposed that dantès did not now think of his dinner but he insisted that his comrades who had not his reasons for fasting should have their meal   119.10633190311533
and her husband found out that she had a fleur de lis on her shoulder   40.656424701815865
yes but it is too late said danglars i have honored their bills   212.20263196006908
the guards were under arms and d artagnan took his place in the midst of his comrades   138.72171172207712
mademoiselle danglars had that morning requested an interview with her father and had fixed on the gilded drawing room as the spot   151.24199340916834
you monseigneur   120.75776473394039
what is the king doing   145.93697694779004
come nearer said the magistrate with a patronizing wave of the hand and tell me to what circumstance i owe the honor of this visit   113.41054306970864
asked the man in the cloak   63.53505724270319
the daily renewed promise of the young man that the moment would not long be delayed had alone kept him in the service of a musketeer a service in which he said his soul was in constant jeopardy   103.8526350481926
the countenance of poor ali recovered its serenity   114.96834897553462
to the sword sir   54.089454074573624
milady was not deceived   146.75173566126918
he accepted therefore with delight an offer made to him by his friend the steward of the duc de grammont to give him a substitute   123.67615791414487
was that affair hot   78.66268280783153
tis you then my dear count cried gondy offering his hand   101.51488861878916
you hear me at a quarter past midnight in fact in twenty minutes   119.65266461729753
i am saved   184.57181577888923
the comte de la fere inhabits the castle of bragelonne in the environs of that city   87.65662714152478
eustache church watching carefully to ascertain the popular feeling   100.43740141331166
to sleep after the manner i speak of absolute calm and silence are necessary and then a certain preparation i know the famous hashish   95.39127661125214
soon a torrent of vivid sparks fell around them then at last the volcano was extinguished then all was dark and still the floating bark and heaving ocean   143.5679349388257
you shall shut the door that you may be certain i contemplate no injury to you   88.04889200054217
the lady with the red cushion produced a great effect for she was very handsome upon the lady with the black hood who saw in her a rival really to be dreaded   98.52800171636972
directly afterwards the door was opened wide enough to admit her and when she had passed through it was again shut   125.14804653065295
nevertheless aramis was in a good situation and able to defend himself   118.70860251399557
though you suffer   23.377044010022175
the four frenchmen of whom two were sent by the queen to her husband and two by mazarin to me   22.443334002077677
dantès was one of the latter a ball having touched him in the left shoulder   117.62502492585766
said villefort while d avrigny advanced to lead morrel out   94.83487161945708
to tell you all i know was the reply   34.96344424330192
during this time danglars fixed his piercing glance on the young man on whose heart caderousse s words fell like molten lead   71.05958369581293
enter and ask for monsieur bernouin said the porter opening the door of the third room   116.74881836221692
oh things take their course without our assistance   110.76154858412403
then they undressed him as they had done the first laid him on their bed and bound him with the straps which composed the bed the bedstead being of oak   145.44874250073386
besides even you didn t recognize me   101.96749646844745
sir said the young man will you be so good as to tell me if it be true that cardinal mazarin is no longer minister   193.62900720313692
then said athos woe to de winter for the child had done no harm   132.66970772771037
my lord madame i ask a hundred pardons   70.00673404024515
then by one of those wild caprices which made her so adorable and at the same time so dangerous she had suddenly put her arm around his neck and kissed his forehead saying vicomte may my good wishes and this kiss bring you good fortune   71.22186028108237
we have a minister who governs france as he would govern a great farm that is to say intent only on turning out all the gold he can by the exercise of italian cunning and invention   64.31768367716006
he found the prisoner in the same position as if fixed there his eyes swollen with weeping   127.37545135019005
after some search i found that the floor gave a hollow sound near the head of the bed and at the hearth   150.53276282683527
seizing a pen he drew a paper from a secret drawer in his desk and wrote at the bottom of the document which was no other than his will made since his arrival in paris a sort of codicil clearly explaining the nature of his death   97.04230558069061
i know her very well   176.95239318522823
well this is what you have to say said d artagnan my lord your sister in law is an infamous woman who wished to have you killed that she might inherit your wealth   153.98588327461175
shouted mordaunt as his horse plunged and darted off at full gallop   100.37830575656626
something must have happened   131.86245910958675
the change that had come over villefort during the examination the destruction of the letter the exacted promise the almost supplicating tones of the magistrate who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce punishment all returned with a stunning force to his memory   94.55577720015677
rest yourself first my lord and we we will reflect   79.22824687811118
no the coachman ali and baptistin will go   139.60975445791584
pooh said caderousse   193.48893005168966
how lovely the blue heavens and star enameled sky   144.29953939784843
then you have nothing more to do here   90.20870327674199
and she looked at d artagnan who embraced her tenderly with eyes which seemed to burn themselves away   112.5283883544974
sire said athos perhaps a king should act thus but not a husband and a father   106.73695303276433
can we have the honor of seeing his highness   129.01745698453163
calmed by appearances he ventured to walk on through the rue notre dame   67.87907799781556
but porthos for his part had done his work as conscientiously as d artagnan   67.1700155480809
but does your grace mean to give me the studs without the casket   148.9889876081283
morrel i didn t dare to say maximilian had been made an officer of the legion of honor   85.37399597732798
there there said la carconte   182.475049752458
much obliged to you monsieur dulaurier   161.6905512264042
blaisois seeing bazin in clerical guise was a little discomposed at his denials and wanted to pass at all risks believing too that the man with whom he had to do was endowed with the virtues of his cloth namely patience and christian charity   93.48864047961857
answered the cavalier   53.59016789471867
d artagnan his eye moist with gratitude though beaming with joy went back to athos whom he found still at table contemplating the charms of his last glass of malaga by the light of his lamp   108.84184255805023
i also i love you   67.10515887037394
nothing could be more agreeable to the duke however he had presence of mind enough to exclaim to the devil with your grimaud   70.73782537089124
i don t know anything about that replied renée   142.66096342852802
yes sir five or six months ago last february   102.9956602717694
i shall tell them madame and those who accompany me will say the same thing   121.22118086539544
d artagnan darted a look into the obscurity of the place   65.47915416357816
but god our courage and the remembrance of our friendship sustain us   171.2435332362183
friend said he for athos this is too much   117.67922872735866
there was a moment of frozen silence between these two   68.8648195111546
we are about to leave this evening continued mazarin   119.2755199906097
in a moment he had passed through them and could see the house distinctly   136.64475397435865
the english are almost of one mind in contending against the tyranny of charles and his adherents   119.62012317307946
returned home with athos aramis and porthos inquired eagerly the cause of the strange interview   37.98813588768486
to cross the tyne reach scotland and rejoin lord montrose who will not sell you   82.37750089057836
it is true sir and i beg his pardon for he has always been very good to me but i was mad   170.565198050629
in the house in which the judicial inquiry was made continued the impassive cardinal there lodges i believe a young béarnais a friend of the musketeer   75.75105204640428
the family began to get accustomed to their obscurity   156.76998562029627
added porthos   64.1883574509313
morrel was announced   122.69644003648831
at the end of a quarter of an hour vampa quitted the grotto   92.41106054511316
no the son s   162.90233389816913
but i have judges quite ready who will quickly dispose of a woman so shameless as to glide a bigamist into the bed of lord de winter my brother   73.67834539462257
to day it s a sort of diplomatic arrangement   123.97980799745895
your ignorance on the subject therefore is easily accounted for   137.05320814174516
exclaimed mousqueton   128.50470489953884
said athos to aramis we were to have slept here but we can not we must push on   201.39113152784807
not morcerf   96.53517392006506
and the man after throwing two or three silver pieces at the foot of mine host galloped after his master   50.24024896014783
d artagnan slipped into the wardrobe   176.61920459650952
my attendants obey my slightest wish   88.79756879577144
i was going to tell you   81.43523754931894
some particulars doubtless but that is seven or eight years ago and i have forgotten them   74.315865346003
at these words she passed her arm under that of d artagnan and urged him forward eagerly   89.05415589373212
bicarat was one of those iron men who never fell dead   198.76829020397315
that knife give it to me for a minute only for mercy s for pity s sake   169.7323040874915
three companies presented themselves each offering equal securities   154.97758840692154
maximilian you know i have no relation in the world   141.60036756100953
it was evident that the servants who waited in the antechamber were warned for as soon as d artagnan appeared before even he had asked if milady were visible one of them ran to announce him   169.79699156707653
hence that immense fortune which in lord wilmore s opinion possibly amounted to one or two millions per annum a precarious fortune which might be momentarily lost by the failure of the mine   105.13101480377665
and besides said the countess accustomed as he is to burning climates possibly he does not feel the heat as we do   111.77549484901404
from the top of an eminence d artagnan perceived a group of people collected on the other side of the moat in front of that part of the donjon which looks toward saint maur   84.1152079798078
well i will tell you what i did not like to mention on my return from yanina   111.85825928147855
answered the boy the thing is done   97.39521505836998
tomorrow you will go   59.26842471366891
d artagnan related everything with that simple and ingenuous air which he knew how to assume on occasions   118.38277975966345
and that is all a prisoner can wish for   167.9878067305679
she would invoke the past recall old recollections   153.5072542578402
they may if they like but we will not   151.6881908389029
as for planchet he had been lifted from his horse as stiff as a rush   134.12084702394472
our charming gascon has just proved himself as brave and faithful as ever   140.15149094208186
i may go where i please   67.50013487407492
what shall i do   132.6214099943792
but which requires a profound study of both the scriptures and the fathers   117.2137291024528
i am rather late in claiming this gracious promise but here is my friend whose character for veracity you well know and he will assure you the delay arose from no fault of mine   102.08580692964257
you need give yourselves no more uneasiness about this   148.73372641854104
no my lord duke replied la ramee in the fullness of his heart   170.1911053102733
by no means replied the young lady quickly   138.55351442320529
he recalled all at once the warnings of lord de winter the seductions of milady her first attempts after her arrival   103.96296222728232
we will save your soul said the young man   79.06958479532935
the king could not give that order since at that time he was hardly four years old   79.64712824729668
she had laid that down the preceding evening   28.00652990632217
then why do you apply to me   90.18407164866966
thank you replied the jeweller it must be getting late and i must return to beaucaire my wife will be getting uneasy   118.77478324396792
they saw monsieur de vendome that is to say the son of henry iv   135.4837715441609
humph said morcerf this is the second time you have refused to dine with my mother   137.8255083083548
diplomat or not i don t know   117.52189258217243
he went to find aramis   76.92979314336456
breathe not a word of that or the comte de la fere will be furious   92.48080129100842
you mistrust me then said dantès   75.08857057950853
a carriage was waiting at the end of the via macello   113.87323427010467
there is a popular proverb to the effect that it is only mountains that never meet   118.4694669986022
the two gentlemen then went into the church   119.64680919085768
rochefort and d artagnan coolly greeted each other with their lips   101.68512442615523
buckingham could not under any pretense be admitted into france as an ambassador   188.8103892261268
our young friend will be extremely well received   144.1358178330174
it would add greatly to the effect if the countess would join us in the costume of a peasant from puzzoli or sorrento   113.0167359336811
and then continued mme   66.9051672868948
madame and i were there two years ago   111.37625746461752
mazarin smiled sarcastically at this speech which showed that she had taken the minister s proposal seriously   101.5344111961928
on his return to the cathedral d artagnan saw bazin who was conversing with the sacristan   148.38448901822147
porthos made a most significant grimace   85.57953886745068
and even then he had rather the air and manner of a person who was himself introduced than that of being the presenter of another his reception being cordial or frigid in proportion as the person who accompanied him chanced to please or displease the baroness   199.86521611306796
do you wish for a proof   146.8214868719867
i hope so was the reply   107.63149917683027
has he eaten anything lately   161.33513885906888
was he so sweet then   98.66844859680928
why did you not say all this before you took action sir   134.8493621210346
where my god   140.29743892586697
good night my friends   71.37900841969142
a town house and a country house   77.46380061371643
when you had betrayed your friend god began not to strike but to warn you   62.8646041548373
did he reflect before he insulted my father   72.93486119887623
she is under the big chestnut tree replied the spoiled brat as he gave in spite of his mother s commands live flies to the parrot which seemed keenly to relish such fare   154.53169604075183
i will go straight to the louvre   90.99447125897629
well then continued emmanuel we have not fifteen thousand francs in the house   67.39315580353917
he was inquired after but no one had seen him   122.90805080685772
at vincennes tis true one lives faster my lord replied la ramee my lord or dies sooner for it comes to the same thing   84.95211482240458
every one is naturally more or less devout certainly   121.52150294536189
not even to athos or porthos   7.115555715499781
the daughter of ali pasha   148.36880126365338
you are the first man i ever met sufficiently courageous to preach egotism   141.35582454027744
the four friends exchanged glances   42.208564072885125
open the door i beg of you   67.78814220565513
i told you i did not wish to be behind my time   24.276313188395577
the friends embraced   28.504244381319154
morrel and then ran on to mercédès   137.62197761927405
however he toiled on all the night without being discouraged   61.02813675545045
it is woman who has ruined us still ruins us and will ruin us as long as the world stands   62.472753135677124
and to what penalty do you think the king will be condemned   171.95536611167512
where the devil didst thou learn it   75.48337380849088
no my guardian replied raoul blushing   150.43238658703712
that is best said the king   108.37279389308429
i only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of whoever wrought it   79.54271467656584
then all his suspicions were confirmed   80.73925340620752
when one is eating ideas flow easily   165.71807258777773
and did the mercer rejoined athos tell you d artagnan that the queen thought that buckingham had been brought over by a forged letter   116.01308022060478
nobody but i know it   121.31656656498559
no one who had seen the magistrate at this moment so thoroughly unnerved by the recent inauspicious combination of circumstances would have supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the annoyance   105.79366492407563
i ascended into the red room and waited for night   108.48038380341576
do you take any interest in politics   130.72559259311186
but that which completed the almost masculine look morcerf found so little to his taste was a dark mole of much larger dimensions than these freaks of nature generally are placed just at the corner of her mouth   106.34356924743977
madame replied bonacieux your august mistress is a perfidious spaniard and what the cardinal does is well done   93.40292719245838
the queen then began to read and after conversing with her affectionately for a few minutes dismissed her   213.80610588117477
bassompierre and schomberg from deserting the army a separate command had to be given to each   27.070755686208017
the boat at this moment turned around and the dying man was by that turn brought nearer athos   195.83828617572817
do you think yourself more guilty in making the attempt since you have encountered me   105.99619691813152
and the coxcomb arrested de beaufort and banished madame de chevreuse   106.29600308105952
30271m when daylight dawned i went down again   171.37682888999927
said d artagnan we can t be overtaken   127.45109110024049
my brother in law and myself expected you yesterday and the day before but in vain   100.74756239603957
but i explained to him the cause of my refusal replied dantès and i hope he fully understood it   119.02861723241926
pearls fell drop by drop as subterranean waters filter in their caves   137.30412089130357
oh my god no   106.31112315814723
an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth as the orientalists say our masters in everything those favored creatures who have formed for themselves a life of dreams and a paradise of realities   126.45808801383336
more than half an hour passed before any one could make himself heard   211.42757459467595
aramis mumbled verses to himself and porthos from time to time pulled a hair or two from his mustache in sign of despair   143.64499870762418
de tréville never jested in matters relating to discipline   29.956554670057827
i have not yet had time to see him again   198.1346225964232
madame de villefort stretched out her hand to ring intending to direct her waiting maid to the spot where she would find valentine when the young lady herself entered the apartment   91.20626969975436
italy seems fated to misfortune   103.67616510771946
how a gardener may get rid of the dormice chapter 62   43.49441485842323
incendiary   151.9807363655776
oh i do not mean her fortune only   63.26897703034052
d épinay and his family   49.4058752949671
in every respect   98.9085948356681
five hundred paces   33.44187078219176
flying through an army sire said athos in all countries in the world is called charging   158.5612780698064
my father is king s attorney replied andrea calmly   107.46402926028517
go to go to   154.2361195893397
selim selim   157.95565295603586
morcerf thanked him with a smile and pushed open the door above which were his arms and which as we have said opened into the salon   73.78886464222585
i have not that honor   114.85082203539218
an ironical smile passed over albert s lips   76.64087193264663
spanish policy and austrian policy would have their representatives in the cabinet of the louvre where they had as yet but partisans   127.38475990469809
morbleu monsieur   130.40509073803454
when do you propose going thither   51.59276968349034
oh if you refuse my advice what do you advise   193.14355309048608
you said then by the word of bonacieux   124.0119339043628
but when i reflect that we have killed english rochellais spaniards nay even french who never did us any other harm but to aim at and to miss us whose only fault was to cross swords with us and to be unable to ward off our blows i can on my honor find an excuse for my share in the murder of that woman   118.38144434793986
after which all four disappeared in the bastion whither grimaud had preceded them   43.77156131835142
dunce cried milady dunce   78.60113535540282
they were yours you disposed of them according to your fancy and i asked no questions   113.4614756012748
and thou hast left him noble honored powerful for the ruin of us all   115.86410777633068
why upon my soul my dear fellow it strikes me that our elegant and attentive neighbor must either be some successful stock jobber who has speculated in the fall of the spanish funds or some prince travelling incog   47.49610377140871
my head feels actually cold said porthos   37.41201684672258
it is not so we should evince our resignation to the will of heaven   151.23578942811045
well i too could keep a servant   80.71858544426176
it must be a very irksome office to be the father of a grown up daughter   88.5414802188784
you yourself presented him to us   86.1650689657825
tis true that he came the next morning to my house thinking that he had to do with an abbé like all other abbés   79.12319195427105
in his pride he fancied that every one must know the chateau du vallon   135.95341884273662
ah true said debray you did fight some time ago   96.7882603927439
nobody knows who she is or where she comes from   99.66577538609344
he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that was about to strike ten and taking up a whistle of silver gilt that stood upon the table near him he shrilled it twice   138.75532667611017
upon my soul i am ready to die for your majesty   66.2656262110207
when you eat use every precaution   101.93670377911891
you thoroughly understand me sir   83.76539358132214
de tréville approved of the resolution he had adopted and assured him that if on the morrow he did not appear he himself would undertake to find him let him be where he might   158.64640746468095
then he fixed his eyes on mercédès   154.30287653693412
be civil or i shall beat you   172.55562264362393
after five and twenty years of labor after having acquired a most honorable name in the trade of marseilles m   177.17071451256163
thought the lieutenant tis to general cromwell that our dispatches are addressed   175.89722826152376
you know well replied de comminges that there are no prisoners at rueil because there is no prison   18.750033476154996
to which of us   181.05313059287286

they still laugh at them in france and yet always wear them for all that   116.52780432092622
he had turned round to play with milady s favorite monkey which had pulled him by the doublet   139.46354454673497
ah you will tell all i have said will you not reverend sir   141.33486854991534
how long must you have served to claim the pension   151.13941648872583
were we not to keep the rendezvous they would declare we were afraid   152.90781994565648
you asked me just now if i was in funds said d artagnan placing some twenty pistoles upon the table   179.71002469856626
d avrigny who ran to valentine and raised her in his arms   114.8794966514801
i must have lost it said the young man maliciously pretending to search for it   180.92836767486068
that is to say you don t believe what i have told you   95.13993063302908
the moon would not rise till midnight   15.828119709794336

to the bar publicly cried   148.04480041404256
in all probability he has replied the valet for i saw the horses harnessed to his eminence s carriage this morning and when i asked where he was going they told me to st   51.54324704494023
how he had returned   86.75821219983271
he has served your majesty longer than we have   118.35571454765358
instead of having watered his cabbage with arsenic he had watered it this time with a solution of salts having their basis in strychnine strychnos colubrina as the learned term it   176.1697053649512
well monsieur i am at your service   105.12993288388273
he did as he said   60.69421660228764
edward said villefort fixing an imperious glance on the child go and play in the drawing room my dear   164.15533675324423
ha ha   109.02437879728282

this moment sir   139.3655823427635
while today we have a splendid lawn bordered by trees which appear to be a hundred years old   102.17797749083769
come come my little fellow don t be angry   189.51755018204392
however slowly the stranger had walked he was gone on his way or perhaps had entered some house   104.84385140547575
often he awoke in the night suddenly dreaming that he had been robbed of monsieur de beaufort   116.7225619177309

just then the count felt his arm pressed   137.08634172261517
my mother had been crying all the night and was very wretched   156.12341299805257
it may therefore be easily imagined there is no scarcity of guides at the colosseum that wonder of all ages which martial thus eulogizes let memphis cease to boast the barbarous miracles of her pyramids and the wonders of babylon be talked of no more among us   133.4264266408738

i offer you a beggar my lord   127.71781427616081
he cast himself on the ground weeping bitterly and asking himself what crime he had committed that he was thus punished   134.04568350753033
really i like him extremely   59.489201711456985
his eyes were closed and the mouth was distorted   61.38353284978237
into what room did you take him   87.33265588028962
and on my word he would be bad company in going either to heaven or to hell   166.71451362704545
said the novice   174.17179518318727
dantès half feared that such valuable jewels in the hands of a poor sailor like himself might excite suspicion   149.68785175082735
but you madame you appear to be free continued the novice   45.69892169386006

i believe so replied the secretary with slight uneasiness   137.3275389001747
i will answer for it her resentment will not hold out against such an attention   200.08144835171345
d artagnan then looked around attentively   81.84995034117574
charles was perceived through the door lying dressed upon his bed at the head of which parry was seated reading in a low voice a chapter from the bible   115.83246757330305
but some of these like clever rogues have contrived to escape human justice and succeed in their fraudulent enterprises by cunning stratagems   112.32237693348303
in short it seems to me that nature herself wears a holiday garb and that the trees instead of leaves and flowers are covered with red and green ribbons as on gala days   107.88685875505024
the first carriage which arrived after that of the queen was that of the prince de condé with the princess and dowager princess   107.76979830916156
a thunderbolt falling in the midst of these good people so peacefully assembled there would not have produced a more appalling effect   182.83505558586037
i turned towards my grandfather as though to question him as to the cause of his emotion   117.72869723431337
those with whom i will be in a passion are those who eat my dinners mount my horses and exhaust my fortune   125.79722668321678

that person is here madame said the officer leaving the entrance open and drawing himself up in an attitude of respect   74.57226066670724
she uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of a stranger and maximilian began to laugh   134.54244819739347
life is full of humiliations and sorrows continued he becoming still more melancholy   30.07808165658598

and instead of making any answer he inquired if signor pastrini could procure him a tailor   176.35622959747732
there he had a chair made on his own plan and one day visiting anne of austria in this chair she asked him charmed as she was with his wit if he did not wish for a title   116.60080752252848
well blacas what think you of this   131.7883503605234
gondy gazed on these deeds of darkness on these nocturnal laborers with a kind of fear   130.07625670565005
then what would happen   163.243259517914
monsieur de mazarin held us in prison monsieur du vallon and myself because we could not believe that he had sent us to england to quietly look on while they cut off the head of charles i   151.57239690798517
will your excellency visit saint peter s   160.28819484123204

monte cristo was not deceived   58.660148453568766
twenty five   112.33730796557846
the features of the spectators on the third and fourth stories were visible   117.9277679484213
i request then that planchet may be chosen more particularly as he has already been to london with me and knows how to speak correctly london sir if you please and my master lord d artagnan   35.073601917701026
there is no occasion to make such a fuss since i give myself up   85.02385883339778
if i were sole owner we d shake hands on it now my dear dantès and call it settled   122.21603601797582
the black horses of the musketeers their martial carriage with the regimental step of these noble companions of the soldier would have betrayed the most strict incognito   72.13573296374705
for me the grave opens when i pass the threshold of this house   94.00443476197151
now monsieur de vallon said mazarin what service do you prefer in the town or in the country   124.80704816897097
presently by a change in the atmosphere he knew that they were entering a cave   77.5137592005432
for all even for myself among the rest replied villefort   36.4084728325187
from two o clock till five franz and albert followed in the fête exchanging handfuls of confetti with the other carriages and the pedestrians who crowded amongst the horses feet and the carriage wheels without a single accident a single dispute or a single fight   47.93333901120637
you will help me to recover my spirits   85.44328394574504
at last he arrived at the adventure of the preceding night and the embarrassment in which he found himself placed by not having sufficient cash by six or seven hundred piastres to make up the sum required and finally of his application to the count and the picturesque and satisfactory result that followed   127.51662466888499
that doubles the offense said porthos disengaging his arm from that of the procurator s wife   95.88124054043246
the day was employed in preparations for the execution   77.13079603930251
not quite twenty six   109.77431251041094
in the passage she saw a retreating shadow   157.58679304550122
i fully believed that when he went out in the night he would be forced to traverse the whole of the garden alone   133.89943940569705
an hour passed two hours passed and no sound was heard from the wall all was silent there   195.7025725275779
why should i stand in a comrade s way   102.52586440793979
said d artagnan deeply piqued   118.77410359256798
as to d artagnan he will go by what route he thinks is best in planchet s clothes while planchet will follow us like d artagnan in the uniform of the guards   186.06282451121913
the commissary was seated in the chair and was writing at the table   107.59022699527883
have you never seen anyone enter your room at night   22.89965713968094
when i went to ask m   58.21322251603418

and to sign the contract in three days   51.98298005423809
i make the first advances   155.27553159503339
still more must be done   154.17870577032366
d artagnan then remained majestic and intact in his susceptibility till he came to this unlucky city of meung   111.13959148015955
murmured the young woman ought i to confide such a secret to you monsieur   122.66495671714782
de morcerf as he is a peer of france and we are of the opposition   176.82094750848668
you would fight only by broad daylight warn your foe before an attack and never attempt anything by night lest you should be accused of taking advantage of the darkness   123.15302002328343
after the pope s death and his son s exile it was supposed that the spada family would resume the splendid position they had held before the cardinal s time   142.03234724727656
monsieur said the young woman i know you to be cowardly avaricious and foolish but i never till now believed you infamous   207.60737219094364
the inquiry chapter 70   110.18493763113308
patrick said the duke bring me the casket in which the diamond studs were kept   138.88190274285031
keep quiet while my master is being arrested   106.07296522977379
at the door she found the valet de chambre who told her that the doctor was waiting in the dining room   125.7909228257656
add your own to it if it be not sufficient   117.39136831742648
you have committed a piece of folly said athos but it can t be helped   111.97606661876732
go dear friend but promise me if you meet with any obstacle to remember that i have some power in this world that i am happy to use that power in the behalf of those i love and that i love you morrel   84.20083835461895
well well rejoined the leader there s no doubt tis a gascon who is speaking and therefore not the man we are looking for   76.74062226454704
it was the king who was passing through the streets which led from the louvre to the hôtel de ville and which were all illuminated with colored lanterns   216.69806746605883
are we threatened with a fresh reign of terror   110.61658559718532
to embark with you   75.49867939126865
my fair friend said athos allow me to tell you that everybody is tired of war   78.34916752636529
the review over the guards set forward alone on their march the musketeers waiting for the king which allowed porthos time to go and take a turn in his superb equipment in the rue aux ours   133.7396003234876
i loved my brother tenderly as i told your excellency and i resolved not to send the money but to take it to him myself   132.7013009973739
he will follow you   185.7623230752506
d artagnan reflecting on his future amours addressing himself to the beautiful night and smiling at the stars ascended the rue cherish midi or chase midi as it was then called   140.02937734705444
morrel said he it is a happy day for me to feel that i am beloved by such a man as you   160.72840910269736
then the idea seized him that he had read incorrectly and that the appointment was for eleven o clock   161.85402781967917
yes and at the same time making a hole in the wall   102.15282978622237
i will stop at the first posting house said danglars to himself   163.71809476417985
eh rascal   129.5586284986399
he resumed the undersigned louis jacques beaurepaire lieutenant colonel of artillery étienne duchampy general of brigade and claude lecharpal keeper of woods and forests declare that on the 4th of february a letter arrived from the island of elba recommending to the kindness and the confidence of the bonapartist club general flavien de quesnel who having served the emperor from 1804 to 1814 was supposed to be devoted to the interests of the napoleon dynasty notwithstanding the title of baron which louis xviii   185.1919464534885
it seems that some days since councillor bachaumont remarked at the palace that rebels and agitators reminded him of schoolboys slinging qui frondent stones from the moats round paris young urchins who run off the moment the constable appears only to return to their diversion the instant his back is turned   86.42736850181872
indeed said the cardinal whatever repugnance i may have to directing my mind to such a treason your majesty compels me to think of it   129.38921790208454
they thought it was mousqueton and went up to him   90.19343687251137
her own hands were moist and icy cold   158.11401529502717
but as we have said he waited in vain for his son to come to his apartment with the account of his triumph   151.32210324142264
the old father and mercédès remained for some time apart each absorbed in grief   86.4912688421518
how yes and no   72.62220859371924
the devil he does   92.68055232254923
because as they say in the opera of thisbe the whole world conspires to break our bonds   99.40128537418626
this did not seem sufficient   140.78818431228467
but out of the regard i have for you i have taken the resolution to tell you so   73.59409600986967
oh women   155.92440184528638
then she tapped in a peculiar manner at a door which after being opened to admit her was again fastened and curiosity penetrated no farther   9.070780851883086
he did not hear them enter and remained in the same attitude till he felt a hand upon his shoulder   137.0872790251932
two large slabs of marble on which were inscribed their names were placed on either side of a little enclosure railed in and shaded by four cypress trees   150.57701872828585
come said mazarin conducting d artagnan into the queen s oratory and desiring him to wait there   49.11718264007571
eight o clock found franz up and dressed while albert who had not the same motives for early rising was still soundly asleep   138.25006739045114
luigi vampa comes to take us and we take him we bring him back to rome and present him to his holiness the pope who asks how he can repay so great a service   155.34412591530042
and yet it appears to me sir that if i had met you anywhere the recollection of you must have been imprinted on my memory   140.89553462623982
and you do not wish me to go away without fulfilling your original intentions   58.76792886453536
if i could die he said i should go where he goes and should assuredly find him again   123.41567013595923
why the grottos caves of the island   32.111863394693756
was this love a simple political affair or was it naturally one of those profound passions which anne of austria inspired in those who approached her   146.92114725235552
d artagnan looked attentively at friquet and recognized the little chorister of the rue de la calandre   81.57975377377332
his eye was calm and even brilliant   232.15263868953747
athos recognized his comrade and phlegmatic as he was he burst into a laugh which was quite excused by the strange masquerade before his eyes petticoats falling over his shoes sleeves tucked up and mustaches stiff with agitation   140.77377717548828
de villefort replied the doctor with increased vehemence there are occasions when i dispense with all foolish human circumspection   57.604518138044256
if my father had offended him why did he not attack him personally   90.96628192308086
giving him to understand that the police would deal with him pretty severely for having sought a quarrel with a great lord for in the opinion of the host the stranger could be nothing less than a great lord he insisted that notwithstanding his weakness d artagnan should get up and depart as quickly as possible   179.0620558549146
and you said truly   100.92720447107654
why i was here only ten or twelve days ago   121.87080519316262
allow me to ask you a question where are the plenipotentiaries   98.513002057745
she did not therefore even attempt the least resistance and went out of the cottage   78.18145126803714
by the tower of montlhéry you mean   46.21709036127986
30055m it is true said valentine as she passed the end of her slender fingers through a small opening in the planks and permitted maximilian to press his lips to them and you are a true and faithful friend   128.64049493302204
have men loved me   118.05006103615055
you have been served as you desire monsieur for you were warned just now and i now again warn you   98.6606318826671
vampa gazed on him for a moment without betraying the slightest emotion   96.07296179170267
you promise that   170.37119605577575
you wish to speak with me alone do you not   155.26523640761292
consult some politician of the period of which you speak and if you pay well for it you will certainly get to know all you want   127.24034105235694
said valentine i see that i have given you pain   60.75943414020604
you think then that i may rely on the count s promises   21.809520361488126
we ll search paris all day long said athos and if we have no news this evening we will return to the road to picardy   151.70910282196593
you may get into trouble by what has taken place   80.34604717296676
it is very fortunate said d artagnan to himself   60.786580474549616
although it certainly never had occurred to him that his father would carry candor or rather rudeness so far as to relate such a history   201.71083349629055
old dantès however sprang forward   87.03551313388158
you will find your horses in bad condition from the results of this accident   149.5489526179656
and what the devil are we going to do in london   100.97768458488885
and it is very sad believe me to see thus two parties in france two heads to royalty   95.18854765173903
this would cause inquiries it would be found that i left toulon without giving due notice and i should then be escorted back to the shores of the mediterranean   129.90423005304345
but the prisoners were in their saddles and lost no time hastening to the nearest gate   166.76791869522052
she was owning to me her repugnance to the marriage with m   58.57265000329543
but it seems to me said monte cristo and i must begin by asking your pardon for what i am about to say that if m   64.68552424503477
and that is that their swords may never leave their scabbards but in your majesty s service   175.05932156357153
as i had expected i found some difficulty in obtaining access to the grand marshal   116.57140446100425
since god himself dictated those words to his prophet why should i seek to make myself better than god   100.63677239875618
what can you expect   121.12817209608261
now young man regulate your conduct accordingly   152.982317413465
but continued morcerf à propos of danglars we have strangely wandered from the subject   131.66154620598152
and you wish to interest your jailers and your hangmen against me   93.63085532464694
but i thought he said that your eminence knew that circumstance better than any one i   91.11388701104568
and kitty who had not let go the hand of d artagnan led him up a little dark winding staircase and after ascending about fifteen steps opened a door   151.9133573206473
that same evening m   169.46645014825543
how do you explain the influence the count evidently possessed over those ruffians   106.18529445076167
so saying gaetano pointed in a direction in which a small vessel was making sail towards the southern point of corsica   72.51741038947142
the hostess who knew d artagnan s skill with the sword began to weep and tear her hair   100.17777912995311
then ali brought on the dessert or rather took the baskets from the hands of the statues and placed them on the table   92.10828331307265
50273m friend he cried i feel that i am dying   86.91424980790462
answered the prince   118.62713571274794
he threw them on the table without looking at them so sure was he of victory   85.67991003804325
the young men congratulated themselves on having arrived so opportunely   146.63834400139123
and by the aid of these two languages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others so that at the end of six months he began to speak spanish english and german   119.57488410165922
yes it is indeed he who has so long pursued my father with jealous hatred   68.5339226340534
milady made no reply but became as pale as a corpse   135.04001887725596
do what you please monsieur chevalier   119.60715119371767
d artagnan opened the letter and read as follows this is the third time i have written to you to tell you that i love you   132.51726749475026
the history of athos s imprisonment was then related to them   116.69079566833045
listen then   121.44549631125493
and where did you get so much money   115.44750384218266
i see returned the englishman that a fresh and unmerited misfortune has overwhelmed you and this only increases my desire to serve you   154.65436886464207
you see said he calling d artagnan s attention to the fact that they had come back to the chateau after an hour s walk we have made a tour of my domains   102.99544780381034
you can not at least deny that you are very harsh judges of each other   91.09633891921803
that is the hour when i am expected   130.72080267798296
there certainly is one said m   126.50394850873323
and if this person be not a smuggler who is he   90.98488300788988
de villefort who had remorselessly brought misfortune into her family as though they had been strangers   31.805234639325832
five millions a pretty sum eh peppino   200.43838366907528
but another thing   147.64629482474655
and thanks to that interest for which i am very grateful they send me all the robbers of paris and the neighborhood under pretence of their being caderousse s murderers so that in three months if this continues every robber and assassin in france will have the plan of my house at his fingers ends   89.25750789027833
thus i have told your eminence that you had but to question us and we are ready to reply   101.19487727098983
the old man s eyes remained fixed on the door   67.995957850774
have you persuaded him to seek his fortune   109.88464973055973
what without chastising this insolent boy   54.29127889527675
indeed madame you believe me too credulous   115.25939123048396
his heart was oppressed by a horrible anguish   162.81437662326223
these horses are equipped for the field   173.9939873777936
yes a chief   143.61130589897596
because you can and ought to return to france   134.24809055424709
creating the works from print editions not protected by u   102.81774477574884
sometimes he feared she had had an intrigue with another who in a jealous fit had surprised her and carried her off   79.97997614595012
and you leave us said julie at a moment s warning   159.7013525500032
both men entered monte cristo s carriage which in the course of a few minutes deposited them safely at no   86.19957635989982
athos and d artagnan said nothing but their silence seemed to imply consent   98.67969577968896
on the same day the treaty of paris was signed and it was everywhere announced that the cardinal had shut himself up for three days in order to draw it up with the greatest care   95.36710040033175
this man had seen valentine and spoken to her   46.559296448854596
at the first word you dared to utter at the first freedom to which i had to reply i called for help   158.63826518073466
in that case my dear friend if you are resolved to accompany me there is no time to lose   140.62487508586716
on the other side of the dungeon he perceived an inscription the white letters of which were still visible on the green wall oh god   122.68237501918374
in one second athos joined him   124.3385858989493
do one thing   15.05601052258713
this was an awkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were waiting   179.71854192214334
so that i should be a great fool to run such a risk for three hundred   83.51156534454262
it is i who lose my cause and it is ill luck obstinacy and folly which have caused it to be decided against me   202.04076706223395
the answer pleased him and he laughed   151.26277182755695
i do not even know them under their true names   205.28890761107246
paul s   53.22527596635548
these 900 000 francs will go out of the family in order to enrich some hospital   143.91207672692929
but tonight you neither can nor shall   159.4083371610369
i don t know what you mean nor do i even desire to know what you mean replied the cardinal   109.55063793015681
when we have peace we shall regain paris   70.98159924757758
renée shuddered at the word cut for the growth in question had a head   90.29876092615012
but you can t go out so said kitty   112.58928900970633
it is you monsieur d artagnan she said smiling graciously   99.65901784127112
unfortunately edmond s brain was still so feeble that he could not bend his thoughts to anything in particular   74.0917850784252
and besides you see if they put us on trial if they cut off our heads they must meanwhile either keep us here or transfer us elsewhere   216.10286156064183
as for franz he examined his arms with the utmost coolness   85.92855550377273
valentine had raised herself upon her elbow and had scarcely time to throw herself down on the bed and shade her eyes with her arm   83.69982777355841
or perchance faithless   147.37008030972146
on perceiving mazarin he bowed   0.43814586941576295
edmond inserted his lever in the ring and exerted all his strength   77.73248530621234
beauchamp is a worthy fellow said monte cristo when the journalist was gone   236.84852605299926
added the young man turning to the two guards whom he introduced to his friends   85.48680651314862
but reflect albert you owe her more than your poor noble heart can pay her   184.53572520167896
you understand then that if it were so said he rising in his turn and approaching the baroness to speak to her in a lower tone we are lost   102.79801358597125
the old man nodded   133.03947813329808
he approached paid her some well merited compliments on her toilet and offered his arm to conduct her to a seat   99.44170607299532
exclaimed guitant with a burst of laughter   108.49976432535591
you would cross your catalan knife with his dirk   128.66853540486167
and here is your recompense said the traveller offering the young herdsman some small pieces of money   101.73195822304555
the third attack will either carry me off or leave me paralyzed for life   149.3677975762953
valentine rose and saluting the count left the apartment without speaking   175.02782910413148
the abbess introduced them to each other   125.4749783879658
and both again left the room   113.0697818646424
d avrigny had communicated in his nocturnal walk to m   116.33937457939295
it is quite regular and explicit said the governor   115.04925946934276
do you want me to commit a robbery to spoil all my good fortune and yours with mine and both of us to be dragged down there again   109.73607098381258
they re after me   157.1855062075915
we will arm our four lackeys with pistols and musketoons   61.96917251490377
d artagnan drew from his pocket a paper   94.90696146889218
and you would have flattered him for certainly as you say he has no manner   59.50308288538508
the duchess could not restrain a cry of joy on seeing so handsome a young cavalier so far surpassing all that her maternal pride had been able to conceive   72.66413835923544
send tomorrow at twelve and the bank shall be notified   139.76537033653216
the masks could not appear   119.54732914766132
faith i ve half a mind to do it   144.79268385654325
monte cristo pointed towards the door with the most commanding dignity   123.05458070727576
bonacieux addressing this epithet to her husband   37.05701872275091
his treasure was just as he had left it   65.06683838590732
yes monsieur the handsomest in the inn a chamber that i could have let ten times over   60.700424761814624
and athos set forward toward charenton followed closely by aramis   99.5135409282576
we can not leave you here so and yet we can not stay   113.28768033369411
well then if you obtain the reprieve   116.57166747220093
milady however saw that this sort of narrative amused her very much and kept at it   156.55298113272937
exclaimed mercédès if it were so if i possessed free will but without the power to render that will efficacious it would drive me to despair   120.45823156744319
porthos breathed a sigh   58.85593155309293
cavalcanti moved a step forward and albert turned towards him   98.89069783748272
no but they mean to make a fronde as they call it said guitant   70.49673575944738
now is my time to make peace with this gallant man said d artagnan to himself having stood on one side during the whole of the latter part of the conversation   94.84834420042161
the donjon being taken i should be obliged to let them hang you at which i should be most unhappy certainly   106.64141008139572
it would be impossible to make use of a diligence equally so to engage post horses   85.99313113622033
excuse me excellency but these details are necessary and you promised to be patient   173.3342024527787
do you live in this way always   94.26062760207209
in your place i would stake the furniture against the horse   72.3360330695968
you know i am not familiar with the french language which you monsieur le coadjuteur both speak and write so well   137.47331468883502
you say you have nothing to do with my cash box   57.68346160197585
when were you arrested then   159.46896403548038
but at a tremendous discount of course   139.20801584044509
de monte cristo that you must demand an explanation   176.2525855198097
but do you think that we ve got them this time   68.69155167199625
the house of thomson french is the only one who from humanity or it may be selfishness it is not for me to read men s hearts has had any pity for me   108.09979232711076
the history is ended   25.08314761593134
then when they were opposite the fire he steered to the centre of the circle singing a fishing song of which his companions sung the chorus   150.36766371286606
raoul seeing that he could not arrive in time to cross the ferry with the travelers halted to wait for olivain   132.56186418295277
d artagnan threw the dice with a trembling hand and turned up the number three   172.544651793414
vain and indiscreet it was as easy to see through him as through a crystal   81.89944759403119
i shall die of it   87.68808276246881
sit down madame and let us talk as the cardinal said   122.13435470594447
signor pastrini turned toward franz who seemed to him the more reasonable of the two   135.5524080055708
this night i am determined to be free   183.0622776550664
i could never get such a man as that   119.03650420228456
at the same time the door was opened   84.76282258271198
this news was brought to us   133.2136446336714
d artagnan wrote the child s name in his tablets   96.14989883286509
at last however we succeeded and worked up to arles   134.79380094024106
but upon one condition   125.64215314655752
one of them went away and dantès heard his shoes striking on the pavement   126.34516294053815
at that unhappy period it was an important consideration to be surrounded by such men as tréville   52.47129417479623
so the master of monte cristo gives himself airs befitting a great millionaire or a capricious beauty   87.1652648886834
during twenty he had been lieutenant their captain since the night before   71.74000746479581
a bottle perhaps   174.83490283221695
well monsieur   107.31572160841371
sir cried she be kind be clement listen to my prayer   137.98620758810247
a certain monsieur grimaud my lord   63.32055822294992
the king signed the order for release and tréville carried it away without delay   118.18577083442902
yes signed the old man   150.56077870635292
locusta chapter 102   85.73764257366058
adieu my lord   182.69483636330168
my poor mother   219.66422606819714
and fear much that he finds our home but a dull one   94.30211807649368
one opposite to me the other with his back to me   22.216278788530474
there is a way of detecting its presence   70.47234631875146
cried she throwing back her veil yours which i alone perhaps have not forgotten   157.67478469797152
well monsieur has only to take the right hand staircase in the courtyard and knock at number five on the second floor   62.920195630229
the imprudent young man expected a surprise mixed with shame a slight storm which would resolve itself into tears   170.58940599138086
sometimes we don t go to bed at all   95.99141227812575
asked debray of beauchamp   128.6652513239218
and who thus designated it   85.85309757867316
the moment the little troop passed goskal and were approaching the post a man sheltered beneath a tree detached himself from the trunk with which he had been confounded in the darkness and advanced into the middle of the road putting his finger on his lips   188.86170789139948
well i will go and take a turn in the champs élysées and at ten o clock i will return here   150.92795615356323
and i tell you that i will save you yet   190.1271315494712
this arm is paralyzed   98.41083310349059
his horse bounded to one side losing its footing and fell entangling raoul s leg under its body   101.31620970298268
and the king putting spurs to his horse set off to the tent of lord leven   184.86555514718754
why you told me he was a young man   76.5782108861601
if i had any money said d artagnan to himself i would go away   88.64619414017884
or spent the money   68.66620591597587
come now that we are alone said athos let us talk of yourself   106.47601470652837
the deputies bowed and left the room   182.78391397271196
can the end which i proposed be a mistaken end   50.000382231112425
bernouin alone knew a little more than the others   69.85554215012336
return whence you came   151.65997608710626
i have but exchanged with him one look yet that look convinced me that we were doomed   61.015283629589675
this fourth murder is apparent to all and if thy father abandon thee valentine it is i and i swear it that shall pursue the assassin   50.38915419564797
that has weakened my purse   135.98977082105927
no the third was brought to me this very morning by a groom out of livery who would not tell me in whose service he was and who said he had received orders from his master   197.82272391496463
well then three months said penelon   164.32244246986744
your companions are no doubt messieurs porthos and aramis   93.39035491560901
a handful of confetti that came from a neighboring carriage and which while it covered morcerf and his two companions with dust pricked his neck and that portion of his face uncovered by his mask like a hundred pins incited him to join in the general combat in which all the masks around him were engaged   88.3727430539171
the cardinal won t allow it   142.97082208060436
the face of the commissary grew still darker   158.25476686249107
as for me i feel anxious to preach a sermon said d artagnan   99.13105812252017
he restores to you more than he takes away and it was time i should die   79.18971503122265
certainly said d artagnan   161.99303058154754
the sheath at his belt was empty   187.11506740823427
is the spot far from here   41.03700115414698
as he descended the staircase morrel met penelon who was going up   129.9536162026882
yes madame the comte de la fere   62.063954923810115
he threw some dust over the topcoat which he had found time to unhook from the antechamber and button over his ball costume and going to chapelle en serval he knocked loudly at the door of the only inn in the place   102.1028789144566
stuart bradshaw was saying listen to the roll call of your judges and address to the court any observations you may have to make   133.3578145141373
asked la ramee giving more serious attention to the duke s words   168.4328792693244
oh leave me   121.4056835176523
i don t see that at all answered porthos   95.7418214864035
what proofs do you require   143.1598707746579
you went to sleep full of thoughts of vengeance   129.8878320465925
i will have my eye upon you for i shall be there replied the cardinal pointing with his finger to a magnificent suit of armor he was to wear and on our return well we will settle our account   107.27147658952096
it is when one is lowest on the wheel of fortune that the merry go round wheels and rewards us   56.01289676834975
aramis shuddered in spite of himself   93.95738704717454
i was present during his last moments   94.68461462477678
if you refuse at least to tell mercédès i am here i will some day hide myself behind the door and when you enter i will dash out your brains with this stool   156.73816773718002
then you hope the poison will take no effect on valentine   121.7093619216734
that s unfortunate   73.28715088557422
it is your new master my good fellow said the footman   98.10119209793456
he meditates   64.70879709672482
and the friends spurring on their horses rode to the hotel the arms of england   33.5304970468931
i assure you cried danglars with a confidence and security proceeding less from fear than from the interest he really felt for the young man i solemnly declare to you that i should never have thought of writing to yanina did i know anything of ali pasha s misfortunes   168.2573424289063
on approaching the hotel of the roe he found however that it was in front of the next house the mob was collected   117.76411333248153
i have not been earnest enough   112.91973158756913
you at last   179.4414717692035
this did not take long   96.81425768706615
but this is the hour when we usually give m   108.70223202671787
no news had been received of them   84.27739354255444
athos and aramis remembered that this was the name by which de winter had called the man they had found in the passage of the king s tent   147.14818699438487
one might think you really suspected us monseigneur and we were undergoing a real interrogatory   141.1615536876472
as he had prophesied would be the case he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left leg and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself   116.25850703388602
charles glanced a moment at the insolent creature who uttered this but did not recognize him   116.42039013241327
while affecting to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder the mind of dantès was in fact busily occupied by the idea that a person so intelligent ingenious and clear sighted as the abbé might probably be able to solve the dark mystery of his own misfortunes where he himself could see nothing   86.68248515468814
a woman accompanied by a servant   104.64764068733389
that is admirable   106.15955678998381
replied bonacieux in a sepulchral tone   58.56047933841936
i want to know if you were left alone and nobody interrupted you   74.32321698422427
he began to laugh i threatened to strike him and he made two steps backwards   128.4297981659849
the last attack i had said he lasted but half an hour and after it i was hungry and got up without help   91.94806435785183
he endeavored to cheer him up in his solitude   82.60871931385708
four men of good will who will risk being killed with me   133.6837023320278
what i have always wished for desired and coveted is the life of an artist free and independent relying only on my own resources and accountable only to myself   127.65047344789055
that is all very well and enough for today   133.98040008204572
return instantly   109.86260970200667
but gentlemen i warn you unless you kill me your victory will be of very short duration   8.186482338435766
i should have thought her too reasonable to be led by imagination   90.25506131294597
a gentleman   59.95406126538564
your spanish wine is excellent   73.40823905775417
does the house approve that the examination should take place today   78.03848173491576
at the end of a passage paved with bricks was a little garden bathed in sunshine and rich in warmth and light   97.22221510044639
while d artagnan turned the two horses into a lane went round the house and came back to watch the conference from behind a hedge of filberts   74.87202576936366
in three days we shall be delivered from this creature and where i shall send her she can harm nobody   72.2015513777862
the religion i serve the god i adore were blasphemed because i called upon that religion and that god but still i resisted   174.58958074382426
how long have you been here   105.20619174458255
but even if you had caused me to wait a little while i should have felt quite sure that the delay was not occasioned by any fault of yours   91.20229654204991
he concluded by calling for an investigation which might dispose of the calumnious report before it had time to spread and restore m   137.1511672185821
let me also ask you a question   165.62647873094443
but an imperious glance from the stranger stopped him short   121.4154392015349
however he continued to take the left hand   148.12305953445917
and a magnificent one   115.11553925531427
monsieur does me wrong said planchet   95.23258043235299
in that case felton would escape her for in order to secure success the magic of a continuous seduction was necessary   48.62421439241162
i do not thus betray my enjoyments to the vulgar   97.37254107895299
ah well   108.58988737665506
he dismounted and entered   113.87499669040999
the same smile returned   120.93527056947866
he tried says richelieu in his memoirs to conceal it from them as long as possible closing all the ports of his kingdom and carefully keeping watch that no vessel should sail until the army which buckingham was getting together had gone taking upon himself in default of buckingham to superintend the departure   102.49125979628005
what have you discovered   85.15611442107863
monte cristo who so rarely opened his lips was about to speak   120.87314499669655
we were almost agreed on those replied mazarin   160.69621122273387
but my head ached and i got up to have a ride for an hour   114.1858736593788
i am replied dantès in bad italian a maltese sailor   149.95756374341
i shall take a cutlet on my way to the chamber   134.9246103977631
to so good a marksman as you are i may say what would appear absurd to another   49.48394639026653
you see them whenever god pleases to allow them to assume a material form   106.37086181211994
when quite a child the little vampa displayed a most extraordinary precocity   102.41840128186098
what injury has fernand mondego done you in betraying ali tepelini   70.32094650379057
and la ramee found him so pale and fatigued that he inquired whether he was ill   98.31118904805525
and the following afternoon at half past five o clock the young men parted   88.24158496844504
with a little more heart he might have been contented with this new conquest   55.0816040919045
and who are you   85.57745381214595
now sir i have but one question more to ask and i charge you in the name of honor of humanity and of religion to answer me candidly   73.92859743607784
3 knocked on the head   80.76789791164819
perhaps what i am about to say may seem strange to you who are socialists and vaunt humanity and your duty to your neighbor but i never seek to protect a society which does not protect me and which i will even say generally occupies itself about me only to injure me   121.56895023019852
one day when they were talking over their plans for the future they heard two or three reports of firearms and then suddenly a man came out of the wood near which the two young persons used to graze their flocks and hurried towards them   228.7662564965881
villefort again groaned with anguish and despair   163.43804847776957
monsieur d artagnan shall die   105.29123401516075
but milady with her ear on the watch had heard the noise d artagnan had made and opening the door said come in   46.3064458989667
what do you demand   47.56989739614117
so let the matter end   162.93691368534036
but what is it   137.64712581804207
but this i know that i had but to write to her and she would have sent me fifteen hundred   62.83842266381309
for look the sentinels are being reinforced   79.38673592274564
athos was at home emptying sadly a bottle of the famous spanish wine he had brought back with him from his journey into picardy   97.80387336606418
d artagnan and porthos then found themselves in the centre of a large circle   157.24589003012662
it is not necessary for milady to be seen by this fellow continued the stranger   64.67239957925773
these important advantages d artagnan found to his own taste in the rue tiquetonne at the sign of the roe   105.58127506635229
in fact i will know him i will   115.3284478823898
said the major at the same time slipping the money into the inner pocket of his coat   109.27896727683614
but do not keep raoul with you   47.84654698114663
eight days my lord   143.6413024429794
do you know the count of monte cristo   129.4847741958151
exclaimed the duke who from time to time looked at the clock the fingers of which seemed to move with sickening slowness   82.54888347291414
monsieur de mazarin had thought that we had rendered service to general cromwell instead of king charles which would have been a disgrace rebounding from us to him and from him to your majesty a dishonor which would have tainted the royalty of your illustrious son   6.300477042576048
richest my dear fellow   100.3268330989256
monte cristo took her hand and imprinted a kiss on it   70.82073949597878
debray lives some distance from here   84.61257528588237
monsieur aramis become a poet i beg of you   102.90204336159788
said lord de winter with apparent good nature   106.00915095880407
his eye took in at a glance the plump cheerful countenance of the mistress of the place and he at once perceived there was no occasion for dissembling with her or of fearing anything from one blessed with such a joyous physiognomy   99.78215044758542
to save the king   28.95586234215186
behind the event that had overwhelmed him he saw the hand of god   32.58194766327992
he had gone to the rendezvous had encountered there the adversary indicated whose name he had never known had given him a pretty sword stroke on the arm then had gone toward aramis who at the same time came to meet him having already finished his affair   158.6751191597826
look well at me   61.49729134808461
let us know when breakfast is ready   146.42042242966878
we will be with you at six o clock my lord   78.95710566346693
i did not come to rome to see said danglars aloud   125.96670521250934
at that moment d artagnan passed in pursuit of milady   63.844583749426036
the room was whitewashed as is the custom in prisons but it looked quite brilliant to a prisoner though a stove a bed a chair and a table formed the whole of its sumptuous furniture   97.12190455285585
yes ali himself my nubian mute whom you saw i think at rome   105.94056874429587
i understand said the duke   19.90166705651295
you may retire said milady   125.22764668002121
yes i see for the young man raoul said d artagnan   37.62228643135032
you have ill understood wrongly interpreted   104.42706590963034
here i am my friend dear athos   66.51257556676075
their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell and the unhappy young man was no longer called edmond dantès he was now number 34   171.7445077902189
but the face i had a large hat said aramis   121.75612705493002
it is humiliating said he thus to receive money given grudgingly an uncertain supply which may soon fail   100.86839465379757
let us see what more does athos say   189.42818744936153
bravo d artagnan your opinion is mine cried athos besides we must be consistent   156.76410354157372
is it because my opinions differ from yours   105.13179815036534
at the saint gervais bastion said porthos   141.98584674187498
grimaud had indeed during twenty two years of service seen his master extricate himself from so many difficulties that nothing less than athos s imminent death was likely to make him uneasy   142.82516387084212
i should give up broussel said porthos   66.78600153903363
really m   159.13954874621953
if we lay hands on this fortune we may enjoy it without remorse   203.12266115670172
cried the four young men calling their lackeys clean my boots and fetch the horses from the hôtel   73.25120087068981
this time however due precautions were taken to prevent any attempt at escape   67.88089776683681
i shall still have my place   121.4189129304252
man as you know said aramis is a strange animal made up of contradictions   48.28355089858981
and i have an excuse for mine would not be the first hand of a man that has been placed upon you i imagine   78.01759865699304
and why did you refuse my son   78.51634184677161
with some gentleman who was traveling this way to whom he proposed a game of lansquenet   111.7216788738779
he was a man as must have been already perceived who made but little noise and yet was much sought after   171.01198995143832
i am now on my road   14.6302821325352
that name has still its charms and this is the first time for a long period that i have pronounced it so distinctly   104.37221577544317
madeleine said the gascon give me your apartment on the first floor   226.7868224534161
everybody had remarked that something had passed between the king and queen   51.88193681751557
danglars instantly descended   161.6197097357347
monsieur de chatillon cried aramis taking from his saddle bags a second pistol i think if your pistols have been discharged you are a dead man   57.786822067633345
d épinay consented to our all living together   54.59891833971603
i have my carriage here said the president   182.2610773254364
an englishman visited toulon who had vowed to rescue two men from infamy and his choice fell on you and your companion   130.96109437538246
yes yes said albert and may there remain only the eternal friendship which i promised to my deliverer which shall be transmitted to our children s children and shall always remind me that i owe my life and the honor of my name to you for had this been known oh beauchamp i should have destroyed myself   77.09638925410204
comminges seized the servant around the waist and would have dragged her from her post   141.97864918956466
danglars coming out of his cabin who will furnish you with every particular   109.1449695237722
if the four friends were assembled at one of these moments a word thrown forth occasionally with a violent effort was the share athos furnished to the conversation   144.49879188229863
no monsieur he is as well as a man can be with four sword wounds in his body   109.7309940801155
and morrel was right for he returned home crushed by the humiliation of a refusal   122.60464490372894
are you sure in her conversation with you that your wife mentioned no names   77.80747185065549
as you will valentine   135.45306075366082
i recognize you there my brave d artagnan replied athos   86.1930721628121
in the daytime nobody was seen there but mendicants devouring their crusts and children at play   89.89754085147668
examined the cupboards and placed the key in each   108.83874600733657
50095m i rave   139.18601729612104
i must visit him he said and obtain some pious grant from him   99.43662971200727
for you must know monsieur that all our provisions are in the cellar   99.5928159654834
while yet young unfortunately handsome i was dragged into a snare   80.76695441406973
yes i have something of the highest importance to tell you   178.85009533764398
he said nothing   67.83100028418623
the means we might have used which we in our blindness could not see then seem simple and easy and we say why did i not do this instead of that   83.62177555508065
the return d artagnan was astounded by the terrible confidence of athos   127.89313284560757
and she is not to be despised in my opinion   5.612273181197253
it was the end of november all the verdure of the garden had disappeared the trees were nothing more than skeletons with their long bony arms and the dead leaves sounded on the gravel under my feet   216.488553843577
but of ten three only remained the rest having been broken by the waves   183.34998469801232
and where is it decided to transfer him   94.32726282448485
yes and the queen too   135.92776995038753
i heard it with my own ears   18.055393820850682
nobody ever came into milady s apartment before nine o clock and it would require three hours to go from the castle to london   142.50223168442471
but with regard to the present the cardinal is always telling me there is no more money in the royal coffers   120.24122903221165
i have no money to build ships with penelon said the poor owner mournfully so i can not accept your kind offer   143.41743081068026
the company clapped their hands   70.68845702161542
madame de saint méran was in a feverish sleep and the notary had arrived   188.08942859062267
most people start at our website which has the main pg search facility www   134.54510134655706
magendie or m   108.1232239781211
then answered the elder prisoner the will of god be done   36.60517165081407
drink to his health he added filling caderousse s glass and do not interfere with us   60.099830993134475
again you drive me to despair maximilian said valentine again you plunge the dagger into the wound   40.83605270874831
goose grease is kood with basdry   95.79529239072464
he had my love   103.66549503535983
i have just been with him   72.79116309468316
now said aramis we know how the matter stands   213.11289058915014
they are those of monsieur le coadjuteur he said   126.90906428686507
here they are monseigneur   109.7426248761129
you know there are different sorts   126.4173938066308
i regret now said he having helped you in your late inquiries or having given you the information i did   151.394344122888
you have several lawsuits and no attorney   117.67495945689592
asked the young woman with a coquettish smile whose somewhat bantering character resumed its influence and with whom all fear had disappeared from the moment in which she recognized a friend in one she had taken for an enemy   163.33619463291922
of which we each of us ate a slice with a hearty appetite   118.32929765719236
there was the prize given by the jockey club a gold cup you know and a very singular circumstance occurred about that race   76.91628492615835
this precipitation this unusual appointment   161.88764163206062
the poor exile frequently beguiles a weary hour in playing over to me the airs of her native land   128.4292659032716
he tells me he served your illustrious father and that he owes his fortune to him   87.3583326140594
you are the master and i could not have the least word to say   106.17132214402301
but fortunately you are not mine   85.46324442300045
they brought me that book   73.87176199210077
will you promise me   158.87653004143425
oh no monsieur said villefort with a bitter smile   144.84685482677094
then i saw that they took me for the assassin   118.45269862204776
but his piercing eyes could by no means penetrate the sombre depths of cromwell s   81.84526028796233
but to day is not the proper time   80.50710942393957
unfortunately i had not above 1 500   189.15230396260722
certainly you give a most commonplace air to your explanation but it is not the less true that you ah but what do i hear   141.21674720439148
it is not a matter of royal etiquette this evening but of the king s safety   140.7161287673377
oh i assure you sir it was a touching spectacle to see these young creatures destined by their talents for higher stations toiling together and through their unwillingness to change any of the customs of their paternal house taking six years to accomplish what less scrupulous people would have effected in two or three   101.03348545550223
i have seen that mother   164.84815415521882
he must wait   154.01409190662744
the salon downstairs was only an algerian divan for the use of smokers   54.161008615135046
as the police minister related this to the king villefort who looked as if his very life hung on the speaker s lips turned alternately red and pale   193.18296462755836
after having failed in poetry monsieur de beaufort tried drawing   98.23791889913366
she sighed as she looked at him   43.67942534720639
if i had them i should think myself as rich as croesus   122.02197731409093
sir replied comminges it seems that it is impossible   44.932334967423515
a death without agony a death which allows me to fade away while pronouncing valentine s name and pressing your hand   133.3236257327377
why does not he go about his business   72.81020695982694
one of the seconds went for a lantern in a coal barge near and by its light they examined the weapons   48.79226809366589
so much the worse for those who fear wine for it is because they have bad thoughts which they are afraid the liquor will extract from their hearts   149.04058140612824
albert smiled   151.7903234369674
at about half past eight o clock they reached the first houses in noisy   202.61418827219336
why said groslow that is just what we are taking him to london for   61.44102098679079
the cut of his clothes would have made him pass for an elegant man if those clothes had not been torn to shreds   159.8268152464148
for long   82.67091432677606
de schomberg on the south from perigny to angoutin   143.7412995288158
groaned porthos i am a widower and have forty thousand francs a year   62.01911429161867
decidedly this is a clever fellow murmured athos   27.53606877014529
but the honest servant could say no more so much was he overcome by this unexpected interview   97.02293855909615
afraid of making any inquiries at this house d artagnan entered a small tavern at the corner of the street and asked for a cup of hypocras   176.98388688441966
he is a perfect nobleman very polite modest and agreeable such as may be found constantly in italy descendants of very ancient families   84.21022589388575
yes keep it keep it   124.55015852723827
oh sir what are you proposing   38.673190612223934
and drew from amid his rags a hundred and fifty spanish double pistoles which he laid down on the table   135.5920408376288
i am not begging my fine fellow said the unknown to the servant with so ironical an expression of the eye and so frightful a smile that he withdrew   55.56234281246825
leave him to build up the future for you and i venture to say you will confide it to safe hands   100.8640953764568
you know you have staked the harnesses against the horse or a hundred pistoles at your choice   116.23228477364651
his agitated features presented the appearance of pale and hideous terror   83.39146990912732
arriving at the faubourg st   171.08146063894068
caderousse then was as usual at his place of observation before the door his eyes glancing listlessly from a piece of closely shaven grass on which some fowls were industriously though fruitlessly endeavoring to turn up some grain or insect suited to their palate to the deserted road which led away to the north and south when he was aroused by the shrill voice of his wife and grumbling to himself as he went he mounted to her chamber first taking care however to set the entrance door wide open as an invitation to any chance traveller who might be passing   164.76295077408182
it was aramis   175.19399336767523
that s all right my dear aramis take care of yourself said he   200.02853345888622
why it seems that i crushed for him a parliament councillor   157.24617304161086
said athos at the end of ten minutes   84.38467482430431
it is needless to say that this transformation was visible only to the prisoner s feverish imagination   148.23532277499385
never replied the count who was by this time perfectly master of himself again   84.01620689378332
asmodeus that diabolical personage who would have been created by every fertile imagination if le sage had not acquired the priority in his great masterpiece would have enjoyed a singular spectacle if he had lifted up the roof of the little house in the rue saint germain des prés while debray was casting up his figures   102.02390100524401
i have assuaged the natural ferocity of those who shed blood   136.52880194352096
madame de villefort left and valentine remained alone beside the bed for the procureur overcome with astonishment at the unexpected death had followed his wife   158.0410638086169
but who will distribute these things   148.81559972814506
he need not sail   127.26018713725757
my senses are confused and during the last hour the most extravagant thoughts have passed through my brain   59.05668937432096
as there is a diamond let us sell it   93.35615421940318
villefort for a declaration to be available should be made before the competent authorities   98.23071921835398
undoubtedly madame said d artagnan taking the document and bowing this is a noble reward   147.59365367310068
that s the place milady s own residence   159.04709193612882
what matters it about broussel it is a name not a thing   136.7977375233611
how much were they worth   96.79405269419443
aramis at this movement drew his sword   88.95144270580744
the arrest produced no sensation indeed was almost unknown and scarcely interrupted the course of events   129.12357145723047
and brisemont which was the name of the convalescent poured the wine which was a little shaken by its journey carefully into decanters   92.73120145866946
leave me to my death   144.333905337237
i reflected for a long time and with the hope of averting some impending misfortune i resolved that benedetto should accompany me   133.12074109116443
pardon you monseigneur   65.73667561687068
then let him come in if you please   70.33611461303695
except your signature and your partner s m   59.01209629496209
in the anteroom valentine met barrois and looked despairingly at the old servant   52.740678191158395
d avrigny said he believed they both proceeded from poison   183.49359092553522
i had the honor of saying to your eminence that there had been some mistake   98.73603771075467
saddle your horses put your pistols in your saddle bags take out the horses and lead them to the street below this so that there will be nothing to do but mount them   208.4663343767818
i know it is very bitter said valentine   75.85115352211702
then turning toward the door and seeing that the young officer was waiting for his last orders he said   125.82026642977502
she moved with the light free step of an arlesienne or an andalusian   80.72289358432437
as sterne said   87.52633126434847
d artagnan employed himself in arranging a little plan of which we shall hereafter see the execution and which promised him some agreeable adventure as might be seen by the smiles which from time to time passed over his countenance whose thoughtfulness they animated   113.56484031843739
yes that is true   66.93393131328672
but i must return to paris   171.82115669649255
d artagnan therefore thanked the man and gave him a crown piece to drink to general cromwell s health   101.60435639282021
their agony formed part of their merit if they were not seen alive they were despised when dead   106.35927608663785
milady was there as it were where you sit   158.21602689025022
we have some hours before us it is now just a quarter past twelve o clock   100.0723267632898
then replied grimaud you wish me to allow monsieur le comte to be killed   133.15096826172856
and we start in his carriage then   73.56596400785429
bonacieux who waited for him and who with the same precautions and the same good luck conducted him out of the louvre   136.775112886052
that he was living on a small estate but where   105.75320717363356
yes but to be captain one must do a little flattery to one s patrons   128.2186221210742
only a few men remained   102.32580727776411
he inquired how they were fed and if they had any request to make   78.10053606751524
and he touched his mule   180.26519387543217
till tomorrow rash youth said the jesuit   56.50398637570558
he seized monte cristo s hand   92.49165360989107
dantès declared however that he would rather die where he was than undergo the agony which the slightest movement cost him   100.49935775381576
the four friends took leave of him and asked if they could deliver any message for him to his brother   96.36001918588062
why what can have happened   131.88147560650629
the latter did not appear to arouse from his lethargy   82.09875588913748
when i go back to france i must suggest some such convenient course to cardinal mazarin and the coadjutor   153.29620589175553
fernand agreed to do so deserted his post and followed the general   65.6526468217231
you were the tool of those cowards who dared not kill her themselves   134.4208108276003
coquenard they arose slowly from the table folded their napkins more slowly still bowed and retired   90.37734520663207
stop said albert here he comes   32.34554945809019
and is the written report of the gownsmen to be placed in comparison with the word of honor of a swordsman   71.62660006973564
i was there too and i never shall forget the old man s smile at this prescription   171.4108071977059
wonderful   76.65464128489126
oh do not fear my friend said morrel raising his head and smiling with a sweet expression on the count   101.11813552808727
i doubt that replied d artagnan for they are advancing very resolutely   111.01162173960091
what do you intend doing with me   86.99884032721093
you said so yourself   138.160238274626
you only acquired my protection after the influence and fortune of your father had been ascertained   105.74968138177728
said aramis it was only this i had a dream and i related it to her   127.23585700788138
and as i am just now excessively annoyed i shall go from home   60.717072679996335
he was at the louvre with his company   122.17290634838014
i have told you twenty times that if you wish to die on that day i will assist you   116.13399297119663
our landlord s to be sure   92.67277102944878
and what was most frightful continued milady her voice altered as if she still experienced the same agony as at that awful minute was that at this time i retained a consciousness of the danger that threatened me   104.71527118910475
war had made her a queen   122.2047066325659
it is probable stammered out villefort trying to smile   84.7595862846762
he felt almost inclined to cross himself when one of these beings happened to approach him   182.75082819291907
i shall be brought home   130.02974083758568
it is no news to you added d avrigny to tell you that an attempt has been made to poison her   127.7235112410145
yes count it is a strange thing and one which might astonish you but i feel an indescribable horror at the sight of yonder man   183.26949481919937
fate is not more powerful than they   131.22769348992924
but at the same instant the crowd of guests rushed in alarm into the principal salon as if some frightful monster had entered the apartments quærens quem devoret   68.72309692637387
the host stood at the door   147.28884981316185
now the scripture says positively make a sacrifice unto the lord   108.424236975602
and with that white teeth a piercing eye dark complexion black hair and haughty carriage why that s my man of meung   129.29285119555195
this voice made everyone bow before it resembling in its effect the wind passing over a field of wheat by its superior strength forcing every ear to yield obeisance   121.74213313402603
morrel i am not angry quite the contrary and i do not send you away   113.91806285111255
speak command i will obey   52.01469430871351
he begs you to believe that at a gesture of your majesty everything will be possible to him   174.8960161742537
the avenger was conquered   151.68434761849554
d artagnan approached him and seeing him stare so fixedly said well friend   94.21369502222467
the abbé saw he had overshot the mark and he added quickly no one   165.80329282725893
no i do not replied monte cristo   60.14511076912287
i will put another case to you continued the count   24.247807839566562
his spurs jingled his cuirass glittered his sword knocked proudly against his ample limbs   118.88026575831955
now this rock it has met has been a long and narrow boat manned by six or eight men who have surprised and plundered it some dark and stormy night near some desert and gloomy island as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses of a forest   101.80014211537099
you shall have as much again if you are back within six days and have executed your commission well   95.99621945629809
ah like the charming journey the other day when it rained bullets and produced a crop of steel traps   157.75179399775283
the white lips no longer quivered the eyes were suffused with a bluish vapor and the long black lashes rested on a cheek white as wax   191.9444860736137
madame de villefort was slowly ascending the steps which led to her room   92.61023983263506
he occupies the second floor when he works and descends to the first to take his meals   62.6262420017425
maximilian had scarcely finished his story during which the count s heart had swelled within him when emmanuel entered wearing a hat and coat   122.94927293281185
on the honor of a rochefort   181.00551692130017
the first opportunity you have undeceive him i beg and tell him i am nothing of the kind   81.61789518667035
at this moment a soldier entered to inform them that groslow was waiting for them   136.75680105716663
keep watch from seven to nine   103.67983400527045
but that gigantic body guard replied to the look with his great bass voice be tranquil my lord and mazarin became more and more composed   53.05682526835077
the young man uttered a cry and fell by the side of his mistress as pale and as icy as herself   52.93802646139654
this time he fell on his knees and clasping his hands convulsively uttered a prayer intelligible to god alone   158.04099815326552
d artagnan at the moment of quitting milady felt only the liveliest regret at the parting   181.52116960972
his ears had perceived sounds without comprehending them   20.257401878013965
the count inquired of albert de morcerf   206.4340087801084
and you too charlotte   66.26038541410122
he spoke of it as a thing already decided   176.87204182554757
be satisfied all who are named in that letter shall be punished as they deserve even the queen herself   193.21052277728893
this affair does not then weigh upon your conscience   137.8045090930894
waiting below in my carriage   105.3768883761343
signor luigi continued albert is there any formality to fulfil before i take leave of your excellency   115.24645117752581
the swiss was six feet high d artagnan was hardly more than five   146.8717160294848
well speak if it depends on me   174.95806536232112
yes to be sure   174.82885909273406
before his death had placed in the hands of aramis   55.0321622286963
has he then owned all to you   126.4418950358757
athos rose walked toward his friend with a slow and solemn step embraced him tenderly and as he burst into violent sobs he said to him with his noble and persuasive voice friend be a man   114.65506652497801
you think of starting at once then   111.07368420222393
as dantès spoke villefort gazed at his ingenuous and open countenance and recollected the words of renée who without knowing who the culprit was had besought his indulgence for him   152.06568726500166
without reckoning the value of that diamond he cast a complacent look at the ring which he had kept instead of restoring to d artagnan which is worth at least ten thousand francs   129.4634030671236
the king rose immediately took his book closed it and went to lay it down on the table near which he continued standing in order that mazarin might be obliged to stand also   123.22017115559737
there came a sound like a whirlwind at the same time two troops of horsemen each composed of ten men sallied forth from each of the lanes which encompassed the house and surrounded d artagnan and planchet   72.55531768213505
you too then are unhappy   152.59036440344994
athos drew a sharp poniard from his belt and cut the cord   75.07906028578164
thank you no sir   120.84145502289944
ah said monte cristo it seems to me this was nothing but murder and robbery   89.23728550060275
but they believe i am shut up alone here   30.043975285887313
you have guessed rightly madame replied monte cristo smiling   175.04505472324345
now i am alone my dear athos said d artagnan   85.00086628043604
felton believed he heard the singing of the angel who consoled the three hebrews in the furnace   156.11005336731068
raoul trembled lest he should laugh among the rest at madame de chevreuse for whom he entertained deep and genuine sympathy but either instinctively or from affection for the duchess he said everything in her favor   70.57500880534181
true the planks were not so closely adjusted but that a hasty peep might be obtained through their interstices   146.04818894702302
do you hear it   127.79339730962336
in the other he announces that he is about to transport his prisoners to melun since rueil seemed to him not sufficiently secure   102.6525662087458
her beauty serves as a bait to her victims   107.92311551613864
if i call come said he   79.95122434125886
humph said the major   140.57597055736915
listen d artagnan   140.72473382233363
is he at liberty   95.94029962450828
shall further inquiries be made   144.59381900624106
the coachman stooped down for his orders   18.266087923310494
four times two makes eight then said aramis   103.5431117065026
take out the horses quickly and come up to me said andrea to his groom   159.88230092095472
when he came home he formed his handkerchief into a loop   99.0057316299971
well here for example said richelieu when in 1610 for a cause similar to that which moves the duke king henry iv   83.51774789658207
mousqueton collected a store of crusts   171.64792166867343
horses nowadays are not what they were formerly observed porthos   57.89757590943965
oh cried madame danglars it was enough to drive you mad   67.99326352532302
with the first dawn of day the jailer returned with orders to leave dantès where he was   45.44788902213814
i will not continued he after a moment s silence conceal from you that while your probity and exactitude up to this moment are universally acknowledged yet the report is current in marseilles that you are not able to meet your liabilities   90.00802502337316
where does your highness wish to go   64.20795020770746
d artagnan replied in such a manner that kitty remained in her great delusion   186.44377565599316
having been brought up on the banks of the loire he might have been said to have been cradled on its waves   57.7118156679831
they are regular misers   133.00678136628324
ah yes it is indeed strange   54.480468529955765
i mean that i feel it impossible to struggle against this deadly weight which crushes me   168.94496929045798
at the third he fell again   48.00818347671418
but because you have paid the price of a slave do you imagine that i have ceased to be your king   153.84777744954985
i do not know you for one of us   92.43035964090785
tis you monsieur de chatillon cried the chevalier   53.89798746269293
because i am not willing to die   49.532478592123944
for the examination of our cash takes place tomorrow   131.09478008128173
and since i found means to enter this enclosure to exchange a few words with you through this gate to be close to you without really seeing you have i ever asked so much as to touch the hem of your gown or tried to pass this barrier which is but a trifle to one of my youth and strength   38.242904260270436
but added he drawing out his watch in an hour and a half she will be   163.5474576268537
go on with your recital sirs said the queen turning to the duc de chatillon   55.8895176059546
reverend sir said caderousse drawing still nearer   116.2865653393164
but at daybreak he awoke   188.84040621110643
there is something so awe inspiring in great afflictions that even in the worst times the first emotion of a crowd has generally been to sympathize with the sufferer in a great catastrophe   137.45045444416638
the bodies were not plundered were they   130.98185469439164
and imperceptibly d artagnan always in the camp always on horseback always in garrison became i know not how in the present age one would express it a typical trooper   173.9186185837298
i have then five minutes said monte cristo to himself   195.5752267951575
certainly said peppino   192.43609539990942
i will have whatever costumes you choose brought to us and you can dress there   76.6487052352711
noirtier is desirous of making his will   90.82606295861422
it is so rare for them to leave the lions den for any other place than the barrier saint jacques the galleys   131.2812307246493
good said he   120.65939901257734
besides i care not for his displeasure   67.8483392721875
my father meant me for the navy and i have some vague notions about navigation   74.96693545332425
have you your sword athos   125.705011049239
i did not know but i had better remain where i was seated   110.15967862870194
do you believe in apparitions   84.34693772148958
she soon whispered to her husband i think it would be better for me to retire with your permission for the sight of me appears still to afflict your mother in law   104.94079487170127
but the animal not liking him as well as debray and attempting to bite him danglars seized him by the skin of his neck and threw him upon a couch on the other side of the room   194.53680250383832
noirtier left the room when he had finished with the same calmness that had characterized him during the whole of this remarkable and trying conversation   107.1788700881556
today the old noirtier or young valentine   108.17870668684968
my dear landlady said d artagnan i beg to introduce to you your brother who is arrived from flanders and whom i am going to take into my service   114.11640325168761
sir replied the englishman laughing i am like my house and do not do such things no the commission i ask is quite different   163.28318577631524
i will go by the way of boulogne to clear the way   44.414732309091264
you see i am perfectly composed said albert   138.12092513091574
let us go then said franz since you wish it   127.92351741320178
she will buy heavily and she will certainly lose when beauchamp announces the following day in his gazette the report circulated by some usually well informed persons that the king was seen yesterday at gabrielle s house is totally without foundation   95.41897151061667
true to his custom of never passing anything over that it was within his power to know d artagnan looked out of the window and perceived the close red coat and brown hair of raoul   133.37705103705048
so make the best of it   92.73729347442416
and gaspard caderousse unable to appear abroad in his pristine splendor had given up any further participation in the pomps and vanities both for himself and wife although a bitter feeling of envious discontent filled his mind as the sound of mirth and merry music from the joyous revellers reached even the miserable hostelry to which he still clung more for the shelter than the profit it afforded   127.11058625182737
whole days have i passed in these titanic efforts considering my labor well repaid if by night time i had contrived to carry away a square inch of this hard bound cement changed by ages into a substance unyielding as the stones themselves   118.18509883534375
he had made some difficulties about going under pretext that he still suffered from his wound but d artagnan had said to him remain if you like my dear monsieur mouston but i warn you that paris will be burnt down to night   171.0261781948514
the noise came nearer and nearer   187.49797552995847
but during the last two or three days i have obtained proof to the contrary for which i thank god for it would have cost me very dear to think she had forgotten me   38.312778333439695
no count he replied i am the only victim in this case   194.94425545130196
come on then said athos for unless i am mistaken in my calculations we have only eight or ten leagues to go   97.65450357849053
the day before franz had been presented to madame de saint méran who had left her bed to receive him but had been obliged to return to it immediately after   54.75697617723553
have the kindness to keep it safely for me until i quit my prison   74.32340613373279
you thought yourselves alone and talked about that tragical death and the fatality you mentioned then is the same which has caused the murder of valentine   159.89226178032897
well monsieur le comte said the duchess smiling does one leave so solemnly his old friends   67.43337141765738
you should give the father a hint you are so intimate with the family   24.48318048685185
my lord said la ramee now we are quite at our ease and enjoying ourselves pray tell me one of those forty ways invented by your highness   112.1388572958387
asked the latter   68.97232001293551
i don t even know their names   140.72067694133565
very good said the count   242.7964489173914
monsieur porthos du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds   108.25433121968719
a woman of intrigue who wanted to keep up against me the spirit of cabal she had raised against m   112.46414250108626
a child who will be of age in four years   177.75903034588026
athos waved his hand he dared not trust himself to speak and raoul went away his head uncovered   158.43813525216484
but only to take a little rosewood casket with her cipher upon it and went out again immediately   120.06128135635666
i would wish to know if the misfortunes which have happened to you misfortunes entirely beyond your control and which in no degree diminish my regard for you i would wish to know if they have not in some measure contributed to render you a stranger to the world in which your fortune and your name entitle you to make a conspicuous figure   42.91905629143905
at the same time the door opened   100.79923577126111
some of your people have committed the strangest mistake they have just arrested edmond dantès mate of my vessel   133.85496788671776
and they continued their way crossing the barricades getting the chains about their legs pushed about questioning and questioned   112.11203660105197
i see answered dantès   146.98984870222685
why that which dantès left at porto ferrajo   95.58520286696057
said he to caderousse   187.73186179031183
your majesty probably refers to god said m   63.06159029248498
as for patience you have abundantly proved yours you shall now see me prove mine   38.878182935539385
you see i am as exact as you are   67.72705213463178
emmanuel and reciprocally as they say at the polytechnic school   32.21222796937444
said chatillon   221.78043249459188
my good fellow you must have lost your senses to think it possible i could act with such cold blooded policy   124.25313909380047
but at the moment he opened his mouth d artagnan who had heard all precipitated himself over the threshold of the door   65.83233073282778
anne frowned slightly when mazarin in taking leave kissed her hand   100.31189598007496
i sell them to those of my cloth who wish to become great orators   97.45071976519716
you must have much to tell me since you have come to seek me   107.10486766176871
but you can easily conceive that surrounded as i am by influences i can only muzzle by discretion i desire your presence in paris to be unknown   37.87376029128431
good quite right   153.4081759938772
it was necessary therefore to dig above or under it   157.02234451578494
said the king i should not have been rescued   87.44471275529386
shall i see you again soon   91.93669869246948
valentine with a color still heightened by emotion entered the room just after her parents had quitted it   154.92270384013267
afterward   95.89819308734485
an instant after they were on the deck   86.83235318401918
said d artagnan raising his sword   67.1617680481956
i know father you are the most honorable man i have ever known   145.438742627977
besides the eyes of the gascons have as it is asserted like those of cats the faculty of seeing in the dark   51.313695450730286
since i have this i will keep it   95.72706920588188
then he said aloud you met him i dare say in the park hunting perhaps   131.84952671362444
in the meantime the king finished his toilet   128.19461731402916
is your excellency really in earnest   193.254723560359
come said d artagnan let us go   134.33384581199311
who does not love you   3.3453339995276394
pistoles have no name young man and that ring has a terrible one which may betray him who wears it   151.65215573734636
la ramee cast an inquiring look around him and observing the same signs of antipathy between the prisoner and his guardian he smiled in token of his inward satisfaction   126.56233494741406
the young girl rose instantly but the man lay on the earth struggling in the agonies of death   120.45393433684188
they all asked   155.58428418031266
de tréville s clock three quarters of an hour but i thought as it was yet only twenty five minutes past nine it was not too late to wait upon you   84.46116822238216
can you have lost them my lord or do you think they have been stolen   114.25280168540453
this concerns your head i warn you   149.69943733668555
he struggled to conceal his emotion and bowed to franz   85.64568008674948
another way of getting hanged   104.05149571153272
yes assuredly replied the minister   81.17400795971058
do you see said caderousse all my happiness is marred by one thought   100.41124153590263
monte cristo took the delicate hand of the young girl in his and was about to raise it to his lips when the simple child of nature hastily withdrew it and presented her cheek   134.47696252192958
continued the mercer with a trifling alteration in his voice so trifling indeed that d artagnan did not perceive it any more than he had the momentary shade which an instant before had darkened the countenance of the worthy man   176.1519447836531
the youth brought a small loaf   149.34289246405257
she cried wringing her beautiful hands what   59.69911683790819
monsieur de chevreuse had not been appointed governor of a province and if the queen should consent to be godmother it could be only of her grandson or granddaughter   144.64885710965476
enlighten me and i will then communicate my information to her   182.6324079048226
the abbé took the note   91.5175383405584
caderousse entered hastily   107.63151747481753
porthos take yours from your holsters   123.54023506708384
i wished to leave you still to enjoy some moments of sleep my child   107.31891607135594
return at five o clock and i will tell you   41.23706042261455
we have been in this place nearly eighty three hours   100.96504674470043
besides the conferences implied a truce and to arrest two gentlemen even frondeurs at this time would have been an attack on the rights of the people   61.74231297470034
have i the honor of addressing the abbé busoni   78.28285042665314
a lamp placed at the base of a pillar lighted up with its pale and flickering flame the singular scene which presented itself to the eyes of the two visitors concealed in the shadow   92.98795942281907
a carriage awaited him at the door   138.7080368574944
let us only speak of the promise you wished me to make said franz   68.20971593634573
i do not   210.00220618541852
his cheeks and temples became purple as though he was struck with epilepsy   176.15894978652062
rita lay between them   81.9485737141458
and will your grace sign that order without remorse   133.5219173646192
but all my fortune is in england   83.81883295867114
franz had been to announce the ceremony and madame de villefort had also written to beg the count to excuse her not inviting him   69.46333854843141
and like every other reflection passing in a mind that entertained none but noble thoughts this feeling was expressed in his eyes   56.10028617268931
why did he not tell them his name   121.3804852204693
but in all probability i should have performed so important so necessary a duty as that of making myself acquainted with the wonders and beauties of your justly celebrated capital had i known any person who would have introduced me into the fashionable world but unfortunately i possessed no acquaintance there and of necessity was compelled to abandon the idea   128.8421048087197
they exclaimed as all rose in bewilderment   154.44637565075544
the most extraordinary traits of ferocious daring and brutality were related of him   62.56809870381429
why you know my dear fellow when one has been accustomed to malibran and sontag such singers as these don t make the same impression on you they perhaps do on others   59.123746433278185
madame say that you would love me then   118.4122277949386
john felton i put faith in your loyalty   92.13409665338436
you have told me as yet but one of them let me hear the other   120.45218781391475
a moment gentlemen a moment   155.6305801760619
but he met here m   94.12029794730408
or having delivered you make you sign a flaming parchment surrendering your soul to him as esau did his birth right   112.76915875357902
this time you shall not escape me   120.75160584504225
do you not know him   92.12796078344574
the report of firearms was heard near the rue saint denis and occasionally church bells began to ring indiscriminately and at the caprice of the populace   30.872164389639522
it is true that the indulgence of his foster mother encouraged him   134.13242652925524
said milady lifting hers to her mouth do as i do   147.077619756042
let us rather kill them   118.26137467113558
d artagnan pouted out his lower lip in a most extraordinary manner   81.82114929244975
they immediately sent their lackeys for porthos and aramis and on their arrival made them acquainted with the situation   78.57930624318932
it is not fernand mondego s treachery towards ali pasha which induces me so readily to excuse you but the treachery of the fisherman fernand towards you and the almost unheard of miseries which were its consequences   179.5558217067986
why should i do so   85.73000350363071
no i feel that i have reached the goal and i will go no farther   72.18376219672317
from that moment she watched all his actions all his words from the simplest glance of his eyes to his gestures even to a breath that could be interpreted as a sigh   138.24145910616062
they are soldiers though resumed de bragelonne   156.83934103349065
come dress yourselves gentlemen dress yourselves   79.0791467178769
his opinion of me is altered for the better then   103.93778097743396
that s no doubt very fine said porthos   39.501117948975775
no i have good luck that is all   212.06082391614132
cried she clasping her hands and raising her eyes to heaven   71.11435242926699
at st   115.26232151095871
then outrages were heaped upon me and as my soul was not subdued they wished to defile my body forever   72.86700282896729
but go on signing said monte cristo   113.99555915332091
interposed the old nobleman who had proposed the toast let the young people alone   75.3920241536465
it is fair to assume that dantès was on board a smuggler   94.38413205222888
still argued caderousse i would give a great deal if nothing of the kind had happened   135.48038244006497
the mob had insulted him on account of the ostentatious luxury of his wife whose house was hung with red velvet edged with gold fringe   76.58040251930882
when this crisis was past when milady appeared to have resumed her self possession which she had never lost   127.58194635468452
then he came to the corridor all the doors of which he found open   114.33749178628354
repeated by the shrill voices of a thousand vendors two or three stars began to burn among the crowd   109.17579808327847
and i again repeat you shall not commit suicide   83.48573836836383
under his assumed name in order that he might be appointed to the post he subsequently held   69.5823501839539
peppino put out the torch   35.525001160184914
come then and take a turn with me and i will explain   87.60562275233536
the swiss considered himself on his own ground and regarded d artagnan as an intruder   175.43143818866355
stephen and who would not have taken the trouble had i not been told that when you travel much it is necessary   123.11057503870317
and when he had bound the scarf around his waist and when his hat placed coquettishly on one side let fall on his shoulder a stream of ribbons franz was forced to confess that costume has much to do with the physical superiority we accord to certain nations   130.21671456339465
planchet took the crossroad and by seven o clock in the morning he was at armentières   182.78680714140756
and that you may be quite sure i am not mistaken this time listen well to what i am going to say m   159.507292164676
on one s death bed the crimes of others appear very small in comparison with one s own said the executioner   148.0662213543671
that cousin of aramis that marie michon that needlewoman notwithstanding her low condition had acquaintances in the highest rank   68.79756501365188
as we have already said milady was admirably acquainted with this part of france   96.3115214805928
replied mercédès with a mournful smile   126.32680121816762
well said la carconte after a moment s pause you are not a man   156.4835171149797
besides he is an englishman   160.84382797337022
a duel in which i hope you will take your part   146.3970790801463
speak to the master madame said felton   106.39742073477817
condescend to listen to me and you shall know all   73.64285226899558
cromwell is stout and short and this man thin and lanky rather tall than otherwise   68.12403069686673
the grooms polished their arms   114.47394566697258
oh rely on me said villefort   178.58763539957408
yes and my poor grandmother fancies that her husband whom she never left has called her and that she must go and join him   99.22373538225767
i would triumph over her and supplant my rival   99.84899502382264
sometimes a chief is wanted but when a chief presents himself he rarely has to wait long for a band of followers   89.1949990214128
the notary looked at the count with astonishment   139.20760907060105
does he not dislike the idea of marrying the granddaughter of a jacobin   138.14920156517087
bear witness that we have done all that we could   99.66234787770802
but there is one thing i wish to know   77.55731496640158
with a single glance villefort s eye ran through the room   114.35227952854011
this is simple enough said the count   78.07612479154268
de bernet were exiled and laporte did not conceal from his mistress that he expected to be arrested every instant   86.50235559168523
while you sacrificing the baron would still remain the millionaire   27.97249407583604
cried milady suffocated by terror her hair loosening itself and rising above her livid countenance as if alive   131.76707759978052
the sweat streamed down his marble forehead and his hand under his coat tore his breast   145.1039829654413
in the first place you will sup with me will you not   122.45846424925975
five months after he had been separated from his son and almost at the hour of his arrest he breathed his last in mercédès arms   61.976954415401494
porthos seemed to breathe more freely   160.27880212463444
why replied dantès i see nothing but broken lines and unconnected words which are rendered illegible by fire   115.05198777980914
i am giving them the slip said eugénie   32.43332691288313
he seated himself upon a log of wood   104.35605104731248
yes replied porthos it is the one that ought to have been sent to me at first   122.78531929862814
morrel obeyed   130.69702127977644
he has not been unreasonably exacting it seems to me   106.60296550561452
this mysterious shade spread over his whole person rendered still more interesting the man whose eyes or mouth even in the most complete intoxication had never revealed anything however skillfully questions had been put to him   127.31068204462156
i had no intention of fighting to day sir   79.35649399687836
in the name of heaven said maximilian if you know anything of him tell us what it is   147.38071816799336
athos looked at his watch   140.37492744891694
de tréville feigning the most profound astonishment   159.3850089943668
and why presently   96.18347147302268
but notwithstanding this request notwithstanding the tone of anguish in which it was uttered the door remained closed   62.66095711582544
and this is what i said to my worthy adelmonte   139.27480015450658
because she had been branded continued d artagnan   154.26761149174988
and to think that i couldn t find that out said porthos scratching his head   152.79158729185573
said groslow sighing   115.14177395588823
if you do not receive it in ten days you can leave   190.03231027742473
yes yes madame   134.05462075669158
tis well said the abbé convinced by his manner and tone that caderousse spoke the truth   131.68159092964996
this night i have had a fearful sleep   72.71104855854213
well yes   107.65745345803211
martin and the fort of la prée   120.76979410143711
it was that another partook of his punishment that another partook of his anguish that another was to die before him   92.12845439406547
to the king the queen and to the cardinal   104.6479373536481
nor was he sorry that through planchet and the situation which he held in rue des lombards a connection with the bourgeoisie might be commenced at that critical period when that class were preparing to make war with the court party   84.54225878865068
the king took it with a trembling hand looked for the address which was wanting became very pale opened it slowly then seeing by the first words that it was addressed to the king of spain he read it rapidly   148.53472710120738
he saw a corpse at his feet   90.19065334184455
what letters were marked on the linen   146.07767358575853
i can do something better than that sir i can speak flemish   92.67903780342803
here you can get anything you want   125.91457611583868
it was the will of god that this should happen blessed be his name   103.89471092955434
he converted his chamber into an observatory   187.50888414285475
my dear fellow replied danglars you are three parts drunk   131.5191161690812
this thread like that of ariadne when once unraveled will conduct one through a labyrinth of thought in which one loses one s self in endeavoring to follow that phantom of the past which is called recollection   171.88596267267036
we put the helm up to run before the tempest   147.9840736440553
and shall you dine there   130.70762420464482
i can feel that the paroxysm is fast approaching   71.83745885804947
and how did he look   98.78410654792532
the vulture may not see the fowl or may fall a hundred yards from the fish pond   108.81155813507898
that is in strict accordance with the spanish character   109.38454672978635
but wait a minute   93.84983380648775
40248m sir said maximilian you are not perhaps aware that i am m   123.37095014804908
i don t know such a place   133.78954738047054
easels palettes brushes pencils for music had been succeeded by painting   101.32703614030093
i had seen him conversing that morning with grimaud and grimaud had told me that he had made him proposals to enter into his service   124.05291676921618
emmanuel of this gentleman s visit and maximilian will conduct him to the salon   129.54581852509418
a rapid change took place in the young man s feelings   218.94858851984077
you know the history of the pasha of yanina do you not   129.6242957383837
if i should follow the two fugitives to the end of their journey   120.18367789425822
said monte cristo with well feigned interest   146.6642414847105
the shipowner smiling followed him with his eyes until he saw him spring out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng which from five o clock in the morning until nine o clock at night swarms in the famous street of la canebière a street of which the modern phocéens are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world and with that accent which gives so much character to what is said if paris had la canebière paris would be a second marseilles   112.32995522659574
i think so also replied albert   189.31322202814454
i was informed that i was prisoner until i paid the sum of 4 000 roman crowns about 24 000 francs   156.31831993623354
we went by bologna perugia and rome   119.1523813176458
you have no idea my dear fellow how one acquires bad habits in these cursed convents or what evil ways all these men of the church have with whom i am obliged to live   74.89225018501617
at charenton in the second house on the right on entering from the direction of paris   53.55060101039717
she is some emissary of the cardinal   87.27634573742041
however perfect master he was over himself my persecutor allowed a movement of anger to escape him   108.47987748559137
you told me to open the door if i heard anyone cry out said the soldier   77.25304870323212
quite sufficient replied the count as taking out his tablets he wrote down no   107.43205878856166
haitians are the écarté of french stock jobbing   123.90510073242692
he was evidently suffering the tortures of the damned   40.89404175560172
how did you know about it   5.704096760484944
a cold perspiration burst from every pore and his hair stood on end   187.67971531114085
friquet and nanette continued to shout   140.2691181041204
you hear madame   148.6006976618123
and why separate   108.43308556676307
they follow him on the waters and he is on the open sea   132.90464895170675
it is an old man s caprice   144.00498188458482
then he added aloud yes sir i am hungry very hungry   117.179633755968
charles returned in silence to his chair rested his elbow on the table bowed his head upon his hand and reflected   83.23129313856298
are you mad to talk to me thus   87.49156344812911
but d artagnan made use of the comte de la fere s name and after paying a visit to madame de chevreuse raoul started to rejoin the army   121.41124245894297
oh said he is it you captain   118.72089899160376
yes monsieur said d artagnan bowing we have had that honor   106.17473298026492
i shall be expecting you and if you fail to come i shall think for how do i know to the contrary   183.89464808525776
but no she must not die   113.26271398937727
that neutrality consists simply in excluding king charles from the territory of france and in refraining from helping him a stranger to your country with arms with money or with troops   55.45019629286932
d artagnan and i   100.35112601839418
what are their names   116.40746287890043
he is at the siege of la rochelle with the cardinal   67.26786234978445
at eleven o clock kitty came to him   80.03051246975966
really sir he observed i see that in spite of the reputation which you have acquired as a superior man you look at everything from the material and vulgar view of society beginning with man and ending with man that is to say in the most restricted most narrow view which it is possible for human understanding to embrace   118.32791598295198
is that all monseigneur   125.55617916106125
but we will return to my lord duke presently   99.72530416420554
or it might be some personal remembrance of suffering and regeneration buried in the night of this mysterious personage s past life   93.99754579709406
morrel could not resist this   70.74474860646573
that is the night my lord i answered   141.26361095375717
you may call on the notary m   78.26883449179185
someone is coming   73.1642074792762
on the third the cabbage began to droop and turn yellow   163.46382902431748
i have committed no crime   141.4537087459541
then seeing that the musketeers had cleared the quai from the pont neuf to the quai saint michael he raised his sword for them to double their speed   90.2701289514242
a feeling of faintness came over villefort   40.82186826874067
asked mousqueton with a serene and glowing countenance   132.47594319818126
the bitter cup of adversity has been drained by me to the very dregs and i feel that the grave is not far distant   97.9217092836622
in passing before d artagnan he recognized his former master   72.45806476341733
notwithstanding all the pains he took d artagnan was unable to learn any more concerning his three new made friends   96.25346629309928
yellow boys   105.21287056118246
shake hands i crave your friendship   71.65070642258738
come said danglars you appear to me a good sort of fellow and hang me i should like to help you but yes said caderousse but how   74.34369933260456
and he drew nearer to her   61.36554307354357
the emperor is no longer on the throne then   179.6511010167436
cried mademoiselle d armilly whose pity returned as her fears diminished   32.85380872191587
however it does not signify   169.41663533970922
but perhaps i may be more honorable in my shame than you under your pompous coverings   70.03410463170592
ah my heart clung to the count when he mentioned the dear spoil found beneath the flowers   160.17862194781327
the rest of the start will rejoin us later   49.343654630704286
you know they are buried in the garden of the little house in the allées de meilhan at marseilles   165.44328408171972
well i take you with me   168.8107936936454
he looked expressively at the newspaper i had been reading   175.22054515778774
no said fernand   142.45931414156246
in that case he must either have paid his debts a russian do that   116.42727190981053
after which he smiled and turned towards the young man in question   181.19644217595956
indeed said julie might we not almost fancy emmanuel that those people so rich so happy but yesterday had forgotten in their prosperity that an evil genius like the wicked fairies in perrault s stories who present themselves unbidden at a wedding or baptism hovered over them and appeared all at once to revenge himself for their fatal neglect   148.2167076540704
villefort s first impression was favorable   54.370161003099746
but let us talk of this plot m   134.5988668760304
the prisoner glanced at the windows they were grated   91.07832070331668
the lungs are attacked my friend   86.70652854415373
be quite at ease said porthos holding out his hand which d artagnan took and shook in his   112.06312012631226
twenty men   89.60141305474288
you will start in the morning for the army of monsieur le prince   108.69761447332735
he found athos reclining upon a large sofa where he was waiting as he said for his outfit to come and find him   161.0783293878984
well then said the gascon take care of yourself for i am not a bad hand at the rapier   50.17464773531137
i mean a young man whom you patronize monsieur de tréville   155.6015819366152
the count s tutor a man of the world and a bon vivant up to his eyes in learning as his pupil described him often recalled the profound erudition the witty and caustic satire of athos to raoul   18.216510375101578
30259m and if you should hear of anything very scandalous i will communicate it to you   118.55693067515412
d artagnan came as usual he should be immediately admitted   90.1513475047616
he will ask you what you want and you will answer by these two words tours and bruxelles   8.244350518264909
at the first words of the count de guiche the prince having in mind the direction whence came the sound of cannon had understood everything   46.75299632336717
terror had had such an effect upon the poor girl that she had never ceased walking from paris till she reached burgundy her native place   174.90671107500899
but suppose we all go said d artagnan   95.96272450809344
you came seeking me to make to me certain proposals but did you make them   106.62142134649613
i am seized with a terrible perhaps mortal illness   138.5253886401277
i will hasten replied franz   102.33945435639313
a lost and adored son   132.99082086784878
dantès approached the upper rock which now without any support leaned towards the sea   118.01401734063926
said aramis but you forget the officer   161.4560708242286
on the contrary olivain is to stay and i am to go   118.6752869022825
chapter 117   172.42042792265394
well then come here my dear said d artagnan establishing himself in an easy chair   163.9644720989146
then aloud are you ambitious   134.6672005876354
but he was no longer there having withdrawn on the previous evening to la bassee misled by false intelligence of the enemy s movements   175.7479657491348
the prince bowed low   69.05092085162045
what will come out of those three elements when i am no longer present to combine them   127.08542405682113
the musketeer thinking that his lieutenant had just arrested some prince in disguise bowed and drawing his sword signified that he was ready   146.69562480100842
you will be deceived just the same said athos who was an optimist when things were concerned and a pessimist when men were in question   76.04350442767785
this event might have three causes the first and the most natural was that it might be an ambuscade of the rochellais who might not be sorry to kill one of his majesty s guards because it would be an enemy the less and this enemy might have a well furnished purse in his pocket   66.23839885204936
well then this noise of thunder however much your majesty may have wished to continue playing has said go in sire   104.21613983825618
a month since he boasted of them   109.10417461203005
a noise was heard like that the instrument of death would make if moved upon the block   132.55754525270586
i was taken to versailles   96.1985147541395
our position is truly a strange one continued athos laughing   145.09074891520822
tell her grace replied athos that the viscount has just mounted his horse to proceed to the hotel de luynes   201.17698885190651
how much do you suppose he possesses   135.73124266991363
you said anne de bueil did you not   98.68989251708318
caderousse climbed the ladder slowly and looked over the coping to see if the street was quiet   83.5168625471234
se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani alla sette il conte alberto avrà cessato di vivere   97.86969802898284
i hear my brother   121.2497188455672
you ve missed me cried aramis but i swear to heaven   136.84058274788438
it is a style of language i never heard in the house of my parents or in that of my first husband   114.97170204126884
you ll see that that queer fellow will be a sheriff before i shall be a captain   63.70955414760212
a practice he has carried on for six years on the steps of st   125.88381353525082
beauchamp albert was wrong i acknowledge to betray so much anger and i come on my own account to apologize for him   113.83554602893517
is it so   111.93920667691164
monsieur d artagnan will enjoy our conversation better   126.08305090010629
the young girl smiled   101.5251944842876
that contemptible mazarin has stopped poor scarron s pension   33.39810124483789
it seemed to all three that they knew him   150.1334090730884
and so they descended the private stair mazarin leaning on the arm of d artagnan a hand the musketeer felt trembling   49.578815203803806
andrea as we can see was surrounded by misfortune   99.215091927839
three days ago   202.31983790431468
cavalcanti looked at danglars with a stupefied air and the latter making an effort arose and stepped between the two young men   22.625933931226427
let him know   130.22403669901954
is monsieur d artagnan there   101.77340777049626
in that case said he i should lose her and by my own fault   70.85430854611099
porthos sighed   41.701411051759905
i love to see you thus   184.41541986478268
nevertheless reserve my old room on the fifth story for me   104.3634783052594
approach sir said the cardinal   152.93392828335766
bertuccio glanced through the door which was ajar   106.13386003315702
remain sir he added to aramis who had moved to leave the room   68.3227208279892
but this time d artagnan was better informed than she was   122.51346803557998
continued milady in the tone of a woman accusing herself of a crime   84.46276750608226
0207m it does   115.64546148141757
all his furniture consisted of a bed a chair a table a pail and a jug   129.72388243019938
we two are worth a dozen   109.58260024214464
the noise became louder   130.5870583409002
the gale had given way   127.9171641416273
you understand no more delay   131.5209486473568
they ask for broussel and are only too happy if you release him to them to live under your government   119.71217685022901
d artagnan sighed deeply for this voice responded to a secret voice of his soul which told him that great misfortunes awaited him   149.106116299934
de villefort s garden   78.81070319701358
i want to know the route i am to follow said d artagnan   49.26464406829587
you have one at heart aramis one deeper and more painful a wound made by a woman   146.4404481550472
he could not detach his eyes from that disordered bed and the pale corpse of the young girl who was lying on it   48.30399171581287
and younger members of families brought up to hate and execrate the man whom five years of exile would convert into a martyr and fifteen of restoration elevate to the rank of a god   180.35368583582368
let us leave these facts alone and reason coolly   141.58496839284476
you who never interest yourself in politics   110.97503134634347
go on go on sir replied the king   66.6573710015441
at all events answered d artagnan with a smile almost as crafty as the cardinal s they beat them when they draw their swords   146.4111128244552
he forgot the necessary slowness of navigation   92.0832212852641
come murmured athos if she is not proud of him she must be hard to please   122.15733495745519
de la trémouille who had nothing to do with the matter with the loss of his hôtel   114.35116984289039
into these pavilions he admitted the elect and there says marco polo gave them to eat a certain herb which transported them to paradise in the midst of ever blooming shrubs ever ripe fruit and ever lovely virgins   58.34538234913163
the carriage stopped near the meta sudans   67.71047928578437
and stay close to me he added in a low tone   99.23190039889282
and with a light step an eye on the watch observing the movements of the enemy and taking advantage of the accidents of the ground d artagnan succeeded in reaching the second soldier   101.07606499281673
did you not see his face   125.21776082052806
and now said the youths we have done all we can for you   76.16356201435491
the jailer saw by his tone he would be happy to die   75.47184460629171
had it been possible to save you i should have considered it another proof of god s mercy and i would again have endeavored to restore you i swear by my father s tomb   163.57997889059726
bonacieux whom the boatman had noticed   134.8493247197939
replied d artagnan you are well named gentlemen   123.91846016302193
i wish you to write from time to time to the captains in charge of the two vessels so as to keep them on the alert   89.65781623800358
oh no replied aramis i should much prefer blaisois   120.75275878976475
mouston breathed a sigh   29.69988184614425
villefort was about to retire but m   117.26428324432204
an ironical smile curled the lip of eugénie   87.75288294902451
then for the odd cash making i think about 110 000 francs here is a check upon my banker who not being m   86.36089224762692
one would have said that his gaze could pierce the branches of trees which limited his horizon   213.94748798166347
it is you your honor he said advancing toward d artagnan   101.11193363412742
his leg was inert and he could no longer make use of one arm   61.00306115009523
i will strangle him and upon my honor if that is made a condition i will return to prison   66.42600030414567
i thought you somewhat corsican a great deal smuggler and an excellent steward   135.9101030316796
two men to the astonishment of d artagnan appeared shortly   163.2809858762471
the past the count departed with a sad heart from the house in which he had left mercédès probably never to behold her again   120.00228265350809
am i to accompany you your excellency   160.22189154061022
thanks for those sweet words   110.7996415590546
he exclaimed jumping off his horse   128.22967532461075
she would have questioned him as he passed by her but the worthy creature hastened down the staircase with unusual precipitation and only raised his hands to heaven and exclaimed oh mademoiselle mademoiselle what a dreadful misfortune   109.25118376358333
well what has this bandit to do with the order i have given the coachman to leave the city by the porta del popolo and to re enter by the porta san giovanni   48.005391545523494
that is the reason that by the side of my misfortunes yours appear to me mere mischances   182.36705006443893
you would have done what i did   168.96616988414814
now try and aid us with the remedy   73.55192042061967
it is not yet too late cried bertuccio eagerly   154.9100102997204
well gentlemen said the brave captain i hope you have been well amused during your excursion   121.2972671689056
well at the end of ten days you would have taken a centigramme at the end of twenty days increasing another milligramme you would have taken three hundred centigrammes   121.58685866679659
behind the executioner came in the order in which they were to die first peppino and then andrea   147.43812606389181
sire continued m   159.86123294337784
move monsieur move away i entreat you   118.86553129005681
porthos observed a last struggle between love and avarice   94.46064592794025
and she has ten or twelve days as lord de winter her fraternal and terrible jailer has told her   104.17812219218324
but they who so assiduously try to buy things cheap ought to permit others to seek more generous friends   71.75191515167207
you perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your dungeon   101.2813347026296
you will no longer have half a dead body tied to you as a drag to all your movements   133.91993952001351
take care my worthy host said albert better is a sure enemy to well   90.12887374661499
understanding however that in the present state of things the laugh would decidedly be against him he turned from the door towards which he had been directing his steps and again confronted the banker   104.15068452261991
i am one of his most faithful servants   154.8843182526736
madame will await my return   159.7939463582019
this threat brought no reply   111.98016938304751
do not overwhelm me with happiness cried d artagnan throwing himself on his knees and covering with kisses the hands abandoned to him   35.908646291152735
and d artagnan threw the bag upon the table   75.33236645127049
are you sure of what you assert   47.86940182520432
you will exact   124.35852081009006
well asked the president what do you say to this letter general   145.6244549314569
bonacieux would run of meeting at the convent of béthune with milady her mortal enemy   174.4361720329715
begone then on your part and i will depart as quickly on mine   88.32493865323949
grimaud put his basket on the ground and sat down with a shake of the head   32.93762435601957
the steward obeyed in silence but it was easy to see from the manner in which the hand that held the light trembled how much it cost him to obey   90.55063759322067
i know not who can have uttered the cry said the king but the noise is easily understood   33.85010899370721
i do not see him   129.7925400052295
give me then that letter madame   71.20613487102578
england needs tranquillity at home in order to consummate the expulsion of her king   198.68264428078808
my first sentiment was horror the second indifference the third curiosity   49.7611005065798
what s the matter at the château d if   79.79171010834841
you accept this young lady as your interpreter m   85.32395665222295
what was the abbé s name   77.28953545207116
from eight in the evening until six in the morning come in by the window   71.11537457329247
at length he one day received a letter stating that the abductors of his son now offered to restore him or at least to give notice where he might be found on condition of receiving a large sum of money by way of ransom   21.82572187134643
at least there can be no harm in myself and party being in readiness in case your excellency should fail   152.2996174464792
and he did tell her so much and so well that the poor girl who asked nothing better than to believe him did believe him   115.67732000287779
in the interim it pleased providence to cause the apprehension of caderousse who was discovered in some distant country and brought back to france where he made a full confession refusing to make the fact of his wife s having suggested and arranged the murder any excuse for his own guilt   75.16347704542211
it appeared to her that the sounds spread to a distance beneath the vaulted roofs and carried with them a magic charm to soften the hearts of her jailers   111.72018149464213
planchet and bazin shall go   125.96374900233545
one hardly a young man   131.47586053464113
eugénie concealed louise in an angle of the gateway so that if the porter chanced to awake he might see but one person   123.61745082444693
and four and twenty hours afterward i will answer for its being carried into execution   108.46016093605424
humanity in a battle   160.37246089012586
or no my poor mother   74.20529284610862
come do not affect indifference but confess you were pleased to have it   85.28897769339389
go said the count deliberately   92.64644283769391
the gendarme smiled   112.84462639098406
he then rolled them separately and put them in a hat which he handed to mordaunt   108.83402426093478
yes but let us understand each other returned athos seriously   159.81521463697968
teresa followed him with her eyes into the darkness as long as she could and when he had quite disappeared she went into the house with a sigh   105.5523009956857
or to speak in plain terms do you really think that what you do deserves being called anything   38.10622643381399
it is really as if i were prescribing for you   63.282778408508364
see it is on fire yet with his hot blood for it is not thirty hours since it was drawn from the wound   111.31844430499233
the tumult at length became so great that the cardinal fancied there must be some riot and sent la houdinière his captain of the guards to inquire what was going on   34.682998352000425
this is how you have lived during the last four nights valentine said the count   129.14924575724368
said he courage   98.52451186951201
for i put it in execution that very minute   144.40917909659186
never sir replied the jailer never   113.67198149752228
not a bad idea   87.57507268476888
the clock of the invalides struck a quarter to twelve   93.79449252896252
i have related it but once and that was to the abbé busoni   143.01044608140862
so let us fix the stake   126.79444816264146
i offered you your liberty continued the minister   98.57389640945223
thank you morrel   137.97984244253146
if the king appeared to be the first gentleman of his kingdom the queen was without doubt the most beautiful woman in france   118.2203526587912
a knife was plunged up to the hilt in rita s left breast   66.02584136506783
then i went out of the house   112.31217145909105
indeed said porthos looking complacently at his old lackey as he went away you are right d artagnan   73.00101893979163
i should bombard the troops till not one grain of gunpowder was unexploded   103.89631383081213
my study   82.60880484721125
it was now nine o clock   11.755122328716169
i will apprise my mother of my intention and return to you   145.22243205086048
the friend of madame de villefort   47.15555588787919
and for me   135.71389552421002
madame he said kneeling look upon the unhappy man at your feet   154.08777442801392
unlock the door antoine   41.92131690287667
call him then   191.09843017062923
he has some but he is very avaricious   63.836992760276644
ah said villefort with a startling accent   61.08326032764117
and he drew out the handkerchief   102.36561613543994
asked rochefort eagerly   77.91751563203451
it was his father   148.17313365453035
i wish he said with his cunning smile to prevent them from being ungrateful to me   61.74555950735262
but i think it would be still better said aramis to inform the queen and lord de winter at the same time   126.87171131435278
a rich englishman continued the abbé who had been his companion in misfortune but had been released from prison during the second restoration was possessed of a diamond of immense value   171.85546770381046
it was the cannon which announced the closing of the port   62.03693014383619
be easy my dear boy   147.15486640119144
penelon replied julie go and inform m   51.703981207448656
it is only a loss of money which i have sustained nothing worth mentioning i assure you   144.48474169846003
go and see   91.63586865046659
and why then have they not laid hands on him   198.92940686719027
conspiracy danglars followed edmond and mercédès with his eyes until the two lovers disappeared behind one of the angles of fort saint nicolas   77.11374258291455
he believed they were come to conduct him to the scaffold   118.08653918409352
and because i am only twenty   171.96265614971176
so i should suppose by her dress   90.42818967259126
just then a piercing cry ending in a sob burst from the centre of the crowd who encircled the lady who had before fainted and who now fell into a violent fit of hysterics   144.0036778521306
why do you wish to know   77.29486670717881
that is the cause for which she was branded   150.278085453992
here it is said athos   137.56399785768343
at first indeed they were doubtful whether the king s visit to the parliament had been in order to lighten or increase their burdens   117.82203113324373
had a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of dantès or hell opened its yawning gulf before him he could not have been more completely transfixed with horror than he was at the sound of these unexpected words   73.15145614056837
château renaud and beauchamp looked at each other   173.2607599628331
50   4.49002845001948
it is all in beginning   138.2601228344051
then he opened the door bowed and went out before the young man stupefied by his letter had ventured to address a word to him   129.4030846101794
our cargo was to be landed in the gulf of lyons and this was a difficult thing to do because it was then the year 1829   142.88517325105724
madame danglars blushed in spite of all her efforts   122.72230927491754
then his master having admitted him barricaded the door afresh and ordered us to remain quietly in our own bar   96.17872929643195
parisians and frondeurs as they were the two friends expected to find the same misery the same fears the same intrigue in the enemy s camp   56.383115835774845
well my dear father in the shipwreck of life for life is an eternal shipwreck of our hopes i cast into the sea my useless encumbrance that is all and i remain with my own will disposed to live perfectly alone and consequently perfectly free   130.01791405536648
de tréville mine   145.1481918734123
yes but understand me   112.1968421156998
put it up again my friend said d artagnan   147.59585552084144
de tréville grasped the situation   91.19756654569593
look here   131.5978667926159
and aramis contended that a master should never attend to anything but the civilities paid to him   118.29169742842136
bonacieux having left his house at seven o clock in the evening to go to the louvre never appeared again in the rue des fossoyeurs   187.4508742570299
cornélie obeyed and the next minute madame danglars left her room in a charming loose dress and came and sat down close to debray   116.46072291604048
he even turned inside the bevel of the magnificent diamond ring the brilliancy of which drew every eye upon his hand which indeed was white and handsome   106.78313334214458
here are our three leaves of absence which came from monsieur de tréville and here are three hundred pistoles which came from i don t know where   113.14530226456968
here are two hundred pistoles which you can dispose of as you wish and return to me when opportunity occurs   129.79651058595468
noirtier who never cared for the opinion of his son on any subject had always omitted to explain the affair to villefort so that he had all his life entertained the belief that general de quesnel or the baron d épinay as he was alternately styled according as the speaker wished to identify him by his own family name or by the title which had been conferred on him fell the victim of assassination and not that he was killed fairly in a duel   104.37062060752352
milady does not know me   145.26214374537878
albert albert said madame de morcerf in a tone of mild reproof what are you saying   198.04999293071145
dantès waited only to get breath and then dived in order to avoid being seen   155.94860153927726
oh continued she placing her hand modestly over her beautiful eyes never   117.770647734525
porthos went away after having appointed a meeting with the procurator s wife in the cloister of st   124.23860773082112
d artagnan shows himself as athos and porthos had foreseen at the expiration of a half hour d artagnan returned   93.84453695497959
having reached the summit of a rock he saw a thousand feet beneath him his companions whom jacopo had rejoined and who were all busy preparing the repast which edmond s skill as a marksman had augmented with a capital dish   129.2482680261245
as i told you everything can be attained porthos women and doors by proceeding with gentleness   134.07247414012792
the door groaned upon its hinges   104.30787639042106
d artagnan therefore returned to the rue férou   48.45957415801777
i am a soldier madame and fulfill the orders i have received   61.32384531963133
ah yes it was just after this that you spoiled everything   10.24259667393521
she seemed however by certain signs to recognize a door and approaching that door and now monsieur said she it is here i have business   36.74331435253161
a hundred leagues   42.61105298692925
do not give yourself the trouble my lord said d artagnan with his right foot forward his beaver in his hand a smile on his face we have followed your eminence step by step and here we are   92.15200813565285
a good mother can not depart without her son   156.7877959184665
the third attack now that this treasure which had so long been the object of the abbé s meditations could insure the future happiness of him whom faria really loved as a son it had doubled its value in his eyes and every day he expatiated on the amount explaining to dantès all the good which with thirteen or fourteen millions of francs a man could do in these days to his friends   110.50641504150394
is m   95.0963034175782
repeat it   61.527262307105865
i have an order to give you   98.73940799348601
the continual silence of the spot oppressed her   212.8536428191479
that is well understood   96.19404513288407
what musketeers are now within the palace   166.06473979479972
philosophers may well say and practical men will always support the opinion that money mitigates many trials   144.29549201998793
has he not seen monsieur d artagnan at my house   172.0971291012818
king s musketeers said athos more and more convinced that he who interrogated them had the right to do so   157.46787231256155
so this gentleman is an academician   114.48416659696163
said athos rising upon his elbow and transfixing grimaud with his flaming look   128.78097586611833
50275m oh thank me again   157.61546917957799
without you i was a dead man thrice dead   110.18234272397652
the will chapter 60   121.949240289186
well said athos that only makes four   211.54518532337528
and executed in our presence   85.34475840292994
come in your excellency said vampa   64.20831133101888
we are all mortal   72.99823038792894
but my orders   163.8155443958889
the interests of the french crown endangered at this moment are to discountenance rebellion in a neighboring nation   146.2173397223834
observe this is one of her peculiarities to get rid thus after one fashion or another of all the people who bother her   145.47205594893956
then by degrees the reality broke upon me full of chaste terrors   157.75560718355393
he took you for the devil my dear fellow and hastened to warn me of the danger that threatened my soul if i should meet again a companion so wicked as an officer of musketeers   114.08167545484444
franz and albert bowed   159.9845145807709
bonacieux blushed   52.047878831874904
very little without you mother   196.83886280014133
here s an envious fellow making himself boozy on wine when he ought to be nursing his wrath and here is a fool who sees the woman he loves stolen from under his nose and takes on like a big baby   115.33744210910774
the other three were occupied in opening an enormous flagon of collicure wine   192.74209840998057
the confusion of his mind the terror which spurred him on the cries of some of the patrol who started in pursuit of him and the hooting of the people who notwithstanding the early hour were going to their work only made him precipitate his course   192.59133641445413
i do not recollect now all the various subjects of which we discoursed madame continued the count with perfect calmness   139.0498552382486
but i must see him instantly   84.15266661584928
40074m haydée looked up abruptly as if the sonorous tones of monte cristo s voice had awakened her from a dream   164.26504652609248
where shall we lodge this new guest in our great capital   74.64643873034208
and the young lady s eyes swam with tears   136.47056765037527
true said beauchamp   112.7407398951648
i will accompany you a portion of the way said athos   121.98135064225555
doctor every son of woman is born to suffer and to die   90.06357492680982
nothing shall be done without the full approbation of albert de morcerf   112.99706922501606
but i wish to please you and see nothing out of the way in giving you what you demand with respect to so infamous a creature the more so as you tell me this d artagnan is a libertine a duelist and a traitor   108.44445970925274
you will tell him in order that he may not doubt that he came there in the costume of the great mogul which the chevalier de guise was to have worn and that he purchased this exchange for the sum of three thousand pistoles   111.51696291675825
franz and albert were opposite the via delle muratte   127.64078428524364
so that if one of us had the misfortune to lose her treasure the other would still have hers left   149.9685693562631
you must nevertheless have committed a crime since you are here and are accused of high treason   89.11500158739113
morrel back   74.25263835164623
he is an excellent fellow and we must not leave him   83.08115867003147
by a movement for which he could scarcely account to himself the young catalan placed his hand on the knife at his belt   57.76003216929523
that you had been thrown alive from the top of the château d if and that the cry you uttered as you dashed upon the rocks first revealed to your jailers that they were your murderers   129.95121315011977
but why not porthos   150.98417733982816
fifty pistoles at most   86.87088054669056
that is the most happy and brilliant evening of my life   118.00013966886851
yes you have guessed rightly morrel said the count that is what i intended   116.00187808315626
i embrace you   69.94969219905826
pray do people get into a passion at random at noisy   122.63308554564313
first madame who are you   137.67388710680746
then all at once starting she cried my god   61.54605290534863
oh it is well enough as the production of a human composer sung by featherless bipeds to quote the late diogenes   54.988304112740394
he said to the prisoner   75.14475118221125
i hope at the same time to procure you amusement and glory gentlemen said athos   5.1926182062152435
richelieu in fact said aramis it is an absolution according to rule   149.94630413145907
at your command lieutenant replied the musketeer who saw the business was a serious one   160.4746037964948
nine days after leaving the charente pale with fatigue and vexation milady saw only the blue coasts of finisterre appear   165.3914023182108
it is a resolution which my father has taken and i know he never alters his mind   89.17288668440298
is there a house in the neighborhood   119.41923128673795
i need you no longer   44.988355579213305
i invent nothing madame   125.71968249070801
you can understand that one of two things must have happened   97.44945800590389
we were too devoted servants to refuse him a request of that sort   42.22928373649792
a horse stumbles and breaks his knees to the bone   134.05081640311502
there are no bandits cried debray   117.07717540752208
fine looking men upon my word   154.06925248208967
the host was at his door and everything was prepared bed bandages and lint   108.44722746470859
of what kind in the name of wonder   131.46030996255206
what are you waiting for   110.15697408597926
as for the ink said faria i told you how i managed to obtain that and i only just make it from time to time as i require it   108.92716367044446
for like all galley slaves you said i may escape from prison i can not from the grave   148.30415080549608
since there is no harm said athos in my knowing that d artagnan is here i presume there will be none in his knowing that i am here   137.48960135125995
he then drew the pin from his cravat and placed it on the paper   56.789386639882885
that you had taken the place of another prisoner   141.31353213750896
true said andrea   169.35338601200834
sixteen years ago she was deemed not only the prettiest but the most graceful woman in france   89.83887735139783
parry odious as was this sight to him sought for those among some eight or ten workmen who were making the most noise   126.10936788577577
your arrest is known that of your friends will soon be known   125.53770613780094
you have paid two louis in advance   91.7982253706271
dantès told them that all hands might turn in and he would take the helm   159.53573761254393
you asked for candor and you have it   114.60999832082051
i am ready said he   85.65313919087879
as long as i live   131.99296819285036
i made myself some excellent ones which would be universally preferred to all others if once known   139.59506313509874
at once if you please   111.82395202235115
i ll circulate that saying be assured my dear fellow   173.6783381333312
de villefort spoke of it to me a paralysis i think   116.95218764719411
caderousse who had raised himself on his knees and stretched out his arm tried to draw back then clasping his hands and raising them with a desperate effort oh my god my god   18.56153627636577
20 the performance of the civil marriage   182.63947022044573
i am as sure now that the king will be saved as i am sure that i clasp the most loyal hand in the world   146.63178161262397
we must have felt what it is to die morrel that we may appreciate the enjoyments of living   140.35917008611838
a thousand francs   154.83880237711392
gondy looked at mazarin astonished and mazarin approached the queen to speak to her but at this moment a frightful tumult arose from the square of the palais royal   101.06708956232104
cried the gascon who reckoned upon this letter for making his way at court   137.26851935446575
she is in safety in a convent   23.763466850721528
she sat down took edward on her knees and from time to time pressed this child on whom her affections appeared centred almost convulsively to her bosom   57.763722891557265
yes to you my friend who read them for the first time   183.24716278027267
from madame de chevreuse s chambermaid perhaps who was obliged to return to tours with her mistress and who in order to appear smart and attractive stole some perfumed paper and sealed her letter with a duchess s coronet   119.70205196555379
perhaps never in her life had this woman who had experienced so many opposite and powerful emotions felt her heart beat so violently   137.51383147686278
but what has become of m   124.26768605465274
you wish to see blois again   58.15371409273884
a fortnight after i was at rogliano and i said to assunta console thyself sister   1.626900368507492
a friend said monte cristo in the same language   116.12654227481974
the baron came forward   111.30627711573301
her yes   200.82118443560887
tis not civil war that disunites us   79.87607233983852
with all his millions he will not have enough to pay for his shroud   139.54803750155526
and that is a mousetrap   133.68127844192725
i do not send you away but you have had the small pox and i am afraid that sitting up late may tire you   70.51055554607655
grimaud in a swoon was tied securely to a horse   40.99201895621344
the towers though solid and as if built yesterday were open and broken   94.71085382730988
the young count s conversation was most interesting to raoul therefore he listened much whilst the count talked well and long   150.75834585845445
this time it was mordaunt who smiled   114.74598611166934
debray who was slightly disturbed at this visit recovered himself when he saw the calmness of the baroness and took up a book marked by a mother of pearl knife inlaid with gold   134.290862164128
this is the reason that instead of the sixteen i had last year i have this year you see eleven already plucked twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen   115.38590707997434
grimaud nodded the third time   63.10825918370453
it is not your fault my good ali said the count in the arabic language and with a gentleness none would have thought him capable of showing either in voice or face it is not your fault   192.19149281302032
we were working at saint mandrier near toulon   141.9312110033317
had he remained with you his life must have become a hateful burden nor would he have participated in your griefs   90.80514501583491
noirtier wishes to speak   48.147413336925354
these have asked for the best   149.04016031637738
and did the eccentric person commit any new originality   170.57383391728752
and now resumed buckingham looking earnestly at the young man how shall i ever acquit myself of the debt i owe you   54.73638664551433
perhaps it was some one in that occupation said cromwell   88.63356796230755
don t let that disturb you   84.71153816565956
inquired the first speaker   72.75604303004985
albert saw all these preparations and understood them and exclaiming my mother   103.15244471486825
and how do you know there is a young woman whom i love and that i believed that woman dead   99.82150659512932
his calm noble gaze forced the man to turn away his head   177.66785174625517
now as i have never known any sinbad with the exception of the one celebrated in the thousand and one nights well it is one of his descendants and a great friend of mine   136.2228237820093
but as against the side of this pony rattled a sword of respectable length and as over this sword gleamed an eye rather ferocious than haughty these passers by repressed their hilarity or if hilarity prevailed over prudence they endeavored to laugh only on one side like the masks of the ancients   151.25341467819683
bertuccio sprang out and offered his shoulder to the count who this time leaned upon it as he descended the three steps of the carriage   53.8870019544638
50179m king s attorney   93.36053616941317
no replied noirtier eagerly   172.31248984621283
do not leave me   141.73648790846875
in fact at that moment a second neighing was borne to them on the night wind   86.9279193124924
true he replied and my protector is very kind   44.95092939338089
fernand s eye darted lightning   110.38778796512376
the guards retired   103.71735944491309
milady knew she might be watched so she continued her prayers to the end   182.51372425634264
said julie remembering valentine but whom with a delicacy natural to women she did not name before her brother   109.72346436773353
alas said monte cristo it is the infirmity of our nature always to believe ourselves much more unhappy than those who groan by our sides   193.09396236622553
at the same time four of the band who were concealed on the banks of the almo surrounded the carriage   104.55025176779087
i do not suppose you will have the presumption to set it to rights that would be to accuse her majesty queen anne of falsehood   95.53697761528605
at least according to pistache   107.4662404087436
finally at lilliers i lost all trace of her   115.19972342719305
the newly introduced personage followed bonacieux impatiently with his eyes till he had gone out   110.9829459922436
you will be lost said the curate shaking his head sorrowfully   169.02328866096812
yes your majesty   112.1757319436467
well beneath this uniform beats one of the bravest and noblest hearts in the whole army   204.69375582806805
no it is the name of the island he has purchased   114.18801222074086
as he was in the deepest of his strategic meditations the door opened and rochefort returned   43.04448699005475
he then began to visit his friends of both sexes in that strange costume   48.1663646062011
replied d artagnan bursting into a laugh   183.0484702480255
yes and a fine opportunity you have chosen   148.7502582503889
have you seen madame de chevreuse   171.76767614051371
then one of the panes became quite opaque as if a sheet of paper were stuck on the outside then the square cracked without falling   160.00752152203597
deceived by this intelligence he had concentrated his forces between vieille chapelle and la venthie   239.489466644115
signed beaurepaire duchampy and lecharpal   106.37442988430497
signor pastrini drew from his fob a magnificent bréguet bearing the name of its maker of parisian manufacture and a count s coronet   84.81619934948421
a quarter of an hour later he was with the marshal   119.78960580591016
a procurator s dinner chapter xxxiii   163.49736285503676
he came he said on the part of his eminence who wished you well and to beg you to follow him to the palais royal   56.00386685776349
the mercer s pretty wife had disappeared   40.204158121298235
he rose to conceal his emotion and took a turn around the smoky tavern where all the languages of the known world were jumbled in a lingua franca   86.5886678276421
asked andrea with some uneasiness   93.60024821207273
do you understand   122.93650018387311
this is a magnificent emerald and the largest i have ever seen said château renaud although my mother has some remarkable family jewels   67.52588918053083
and as to aramis to tell you the truth i have never been seriously uneasy on his account   95.97144415338126
well louis said anne why do you not kiss me   139.859083154556
do you hear anything   64.91537592499571
surely said albert as the door of a box on the first circle opened that must be the countess g   173.78062445266065
i am unlucky   121.26725153792054
what does this mean monsieur cardinal   119.81176316250995
20227m what time is it now   101.65956244358154
the interests of the prince de conti or of the ducs de beaufort de bouillon and d elbeuf and of the coadjutor are herein consulted   134.3569411488849
mousqueton ran thither hearing the noise   177.49876965577084
but said beauchamp who as became a journalist was very incredulous you always carry this drug about you   81.12010678157031
eugénie she said to herself is lost and so are we   64.16516094920003
but there should be at the end of one s devotion something to gain   214.73236907954487
aramis appeared to make a strong inward effort like a man who in the full relation of a falsehood finds himself stopped by some unforeseen obstacle   111.40337103125033
well but we should be taken out of prison   52.19346686647579
but the presence of this woman did not prevent milady from thinking   133.53923567239946
after a wild youth he had retired into a convent there to expiate at least for some time the follies of adolescence   142.9988292598975
bonacieux moved by a double sentiment love and curiosity   126.37999424443692
under the name of major black you run thoroughbreds ridden by tiny urchins not larger than marmots   87.38211510493214
have i any need to tell you so   54.431079223836775
oh i am dying   125.09061552223743
and now i believe you are right and that you have really saved my life   88.37929742560922
come come what then   95.31441456776065
de tréville did not return went away very uneasy as to what was going to happen   149.43867091116977
that dear friend is because nobody is more worthy than yourself   101.83939300831398
it was a magnificent sapphire encircled with brilliants   142.59767128983438
the count was seated between madame de villefort and danglars   117.39125263566905
dantès rose dispersed the fragments with the same precaution as before and pushed his bed back against the wall   131.08567882297586
indeed monseigneur responded the mercer i have heard her pronounce all those names   194.71635245460914
then he had a moment s hesitation   113.8534307566294
he opened his eyes and looked through the window expecting to find himself in the midst of some town or at least village   181.11618448819945
happy rogue said caderousse   124.33355925893336
in an hour you shall be obeyed   95.62667755928592
he was a clever man   117.89555544334
and you know women don t like to be kept waiting   125.89913559637475
the affair at armentieres whispered d artagnan   104.19102579482666
you will be very kind to me will you not morrel to make me forget my sorrow in leaving her thus   185.85454078499555
what nonsense   147.62443267757476
it is a folly i admit but still it is the fashion   96.19041876522013
what do you think he is paying his addresses   124.961679415703
father replied the child i swear to you that they shall kill me sooner than make me king   139.77268404257524
they all set off swift as the wind   54.84548921954286
we are very comfortable in those we wear   70.33473295166307
this same waiting maid seems to have an agreeable style said the messenger carelessly   82.0638265545823
it is incredible   184.84413454117743
here is my passport   6.890919426088459
your eminence might be recognized   125.9187972736899
then as they were only a day s journey from surgères whither the cardinal was to come to meet the king he resolved to follow the advice of athos and go with them   46.79948604910204
i gave her a few lines for the director of the valle theatre who is under some obligation to me   102.15667823009514
she heard the count s sentence pronounced without betraying an expression of joy or pity   77.27700341926638
she is going to have him killed said d artagnan to porthos but at all events it shall not be by me   170.40186829372766
neither is it my intention monsieur for this time i was seeking you   194.29382563262283
but at two o clock she had not returned   11.796089770393436
te deums were chanted in camp and afterward throughout france   93.36406260360911
she calculated that the repose of a few hours would not only refresh her head and her ideas but still further her complexion   101.38381374846168
i will come myself   106.34554078605893
stuff and nonsense   83.41081656367959
i love a young girl count   135.68578099633282
i confess myself conquered   150.01469629374128
this dinner consisted of meats nicely dressed choice wines and superb fruit   201.22639202041472
i have always said to you i love you as a brother   133.57294460874914
and you did not tell him that you came from me   59.82965834619464
but i was impatiently waiting for your arrival that i might send for your father   123.58374092801013
certainly in the eyes of an artist the exact and strict costume of teresa had a very different character from that of carmela and her companions   166.38370700235714
porthos an ass   147.14230733936162
i do not hold life dear enough to be afraid of death   64.42966274606887
dantès cried at the top of his voice to warn them of their danger but they saw it themselves   89.31540427004768
danglars his intention of only staying a year in paris during which time he proposed to spend six millions   125.39682400636617
there is to be war in flanders   174.0280118369563
broussel was seated at the table with his family having his wife opposite to him his two daughters by his side and his son louvieres whom we have already seen when the accident happened to the councillor an accident from which he had quite recovered at the bottom of the table   53.679969836067116
he offered him 1 000 francs for a mouthful of bread   93.278698886568
but who who   151.61370095761455
whether porthos understood him or did not understand him giving way to his anger monsieur said he you stand a chance of getting chastised if you rub musketeers in this fashion   24.943541982273203
the room of the retired baker chapter 82   152.18777401731833
through the grating however dantès saw they were passing through the rue caisserie and by the rue saint laurent and the rue taramis to the quay   152.17165517768862
he found him kneeling before a priedieu with his head leaning on an open prayer book   153.84748186195898
it appeared to him as if there was something supernaturally gloomy and terrible in the expression which gleamed from the brilliant eyes of haydée at this moment   84.1979492700576
26 a cruel operation which consists in cuffing a comrade who may have fallen into disgrace not with an old shoe but with an iron heeled one   111.06790177786523
it was therefore at the third door that those who solicited or were bidden to an audience underwent their formal interrogatory   185.5993112028697
but the man instead of dissolving like a shadow again approached her and said in an agitated voice now you may drink   45.22515878289269
valentine and villefort were dumb   100.71734525738118
there do you hear   151.96735744067058
if they are arrested they will only be put in the bastile   123.04094876518289
replied morrel with another struggle which like the first failed in releasing him from the count s iron grasp   47.0064850410251
20312m at the same moment and in the midst of the terrifying silence which usually follows a clap of thunder they heard a knocking at the door   153.6446059061006
princes must be knocked on the head   151.97489187813918
and by whom was he arrested   140.63499021475747
i tell you marquis my fortune is made if i only reach the tuileries the first for the king will not forget the service i do him   94.58423110211767
nevertheless replied mordaunt i could compel you   87.83288556907925
it was dark and silent as the tomb   172.3729694782925
i do not allude to you my boy   177.8486602706175
i have plenty of money i am at béthune   97.75881317838021
shut up there   24.671220245425715
i wish the troublesome fellow were at the devil   1.3712847630767868
my dear bazin you ought to perceive said d artagnan from the place in which you find me that i am greatly changed in everything   99.12272490643483
the major will bring his son with him this evening the contino as we say in italy   108.45611065397763
it is always an event at marseilles for a ship to come into port especially when this ship like the pharaon has been built rigged and laden at the old phocee docks and belongs to an owner of the city   122.57347221293544
he held a book in his hand   10.774941794438789
what your majesty is pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity is simply owing to chance and i have profited by that chance like a good and devoted servant that s all   108.38692617632498
here take this purse of a hundred pistoles and pardon me   102.46376919457087
they were indispensable   214.28240364205857
tell it to me   77.64881509494865
the notary who was at the door immediately entered   117.23887646003121
she had formerly been suspected of an intimacy of too tender a nature with coligny who for her sake had been killed in a duel in the place royale by the duc de guise   145.38116267298986
sir said d artagnan you will go and release your companion who is guarding the coachman   151.2956338009481
indeed indeed i did not   179.98101540102158
and the vicomte raoul de bragelonne   120.69968794021551
but address yourself to the keeper of the seals   120.25582132568138
let us leave to night we have nothing more to do here   69.90830766419239
well morrel let us both examine the depths of your heart   55.32956707442993
they all went out and on the stairs met madame morrel who had been afraid to go up into the study   167.09027147827254
but that is of no consequence i can take one of monsieur de tréville s   130.66753885812315
unfortunately madame answered villefort the strong arm of the law is not called upon to interfere until the evil has taken place   200.4653539894268
for i had seen you aramis with the king and you count i knew would be under the scaffold and for that reason i forgive you he added offering athos his hand for you must have suffered much   94.21015088134848
a tall dark man with black mustaches dark eyes and the air of a gentleman   127.23131634218711
the young man himself is acting blindfolded and knows not the true cause which is known only to god and to me   18.175539158721037
but meantime send for monsieur the keeper of the seals   179.23049662877133
but in what force was the enemy   149.62482463171742
his life is dependent on the information he has given us   164.57385142602158
ah madame he said why did you not make that request of me   138.27041570392612
although i had not seen villefort s face i recognized him by the beating of my heart   136.62303386162986
yes in a single day he had accomplished what his more serious minded companion would have taken weeks to effect   106.38396307553741
sleep as soundly as you can tonight and tomorrow if you can we will take our departure together   96.80100529656329
i beseech you   55.99530317031039
debray perhaps as it was once proposed   79.10149577486982
be ready then at the first signal   36.52092452176949
yes when the house where he fraternizes is suspected   101.88413560492216
jesu   106.99597994445824
i have no influence with any one   124.47359662162036
chapter 107   134.55735232389577
you say truly the gift of poor edmond was not meant for such traitors as fernand and danglars   61.87224764472132
if you know no more than that everyone here is as well informed as yourself   141.22220030635572
what to do   140.19300463347838
d artagnan took off the ring giving it again to athos   134.17902391569785
the young girl uttered a joyful cry raised her eyes looked round to question the messenger but he had disappeared   42.88500882986723
it is more than ever a settled thing said lucien and considering that this remark was all that he was at that time called upon to make he adjusted the glass to his eye and biting the top of his gold headed cane began to make the tour of the apartment examining the arms and the pictures   165.46759809241888
those who remain in paris in july must be true parisians   147.48794456941835
a great prince said aramis with whom mazarin sought an alliance was invited by him to send him a list of the conditions on which he would do him the honor to negotiate with him   91.36257837829633
yes i have seen him but i don t know what he calls himself   113.3859481806522
all that could be required of me   16.406502596096146
in a moment the whole party was assembled   129.6156076937549
we shall get out into the gallery you have described   144.436567548717
he went into her room and has not been downstairs since   22.170717232871567
said mazarin looking with astonishment at those two men   100.44107966222832
you see it s evident where the count got the name   97.37709012838616
but he had not time to address any question to him a cry of admiration burst from every mouth   128.15067172816222
madame de villefort closed the door carefully after the child the count appearing not to notice her   126.04332799850206
porthos did not feel the ridicule of this and took it for a piece of simplicity at which he laughed in his large mustache   165.20993800364187
what granted me   185.96099574821068
what made you choose a house at the gates of paris m   124.22715314027158
without reckoning objected porthos that the queen would save monsieur de buckingham but would take no heed of us   71.0635314301955
hold your tongue replied aramis   109.44980129980027
it was the governor who returned followed by the doctor and other attendants   20.767422463429867
de villefort who examined him attentively and who no doubt practiced upon him all the psychological studies he was accustomed to use in vain endeavored to make him lower his eyes notwithstanding the depth and profundity of his gaze   134.5963512570755
this room was occupied by dantès father   170.47008216695053
it was impossible   74.42121796825967
who was he   119.7873970457332
but hark hark   98.59724758088115
well cried he with that benevolent politeness which distinguished his salutation from the common civilities of the world my cavalier has attained his object   54.443848093251034
now to horse that i may see you depart   104.65801961146873
the two lower rooms consisted of a dining room with a table chairs and side board of walnut and a wainscoted parlor without ornaments carpet or timepiece   45.91477365731214
he insisted on being introduced saying that although he was not a deputy from monsieur de conti or monsieur de beaufort or monsieur de bouillon or monsieur d elbeuf or the coadjutor or madame de longueville or broussel or the parliament and although he had come on his own private account he nevertheless had things to say to her majesty of the utmost importance   126.467010464969
two aces   88.8031385461868
but as planchet said people do not eat at once for all time even when they eat a good deal   146.79103811794576
the man in the mantle quitted the wall and advanced into the middle of the street   70.48249619418505
oh never fear   81.05216129830737
to me she seems overloaded observed eugénie   155.673831389632
his voice was still youthful as if belonging to a hercules of twenty five and his magnificent teeth which he had preserved white and sound gave an indescribable charm to his smile   94.83402811433494
he arrived at this end by his persistence in accusation   53.011972177058915
faith i would give a good deal if she is young and pretty   29.408494493900065
ecco   120.58309604185267
we beg them to take one step backward and to transport themselves the morning of that day of great catastrophes into the showy gilded salon we have before shown them and which was the pride of its owner baron danglars   141.10974909485387
they led me away masked   96.68094139709747
i did not reckon upon hunger and infidelity   111.4500449291657
the marechal de la meilleraie was caught between two fires but he was brave and made up his mind to die where he was   155.36008853513653
well said the young man let us demand hospitality of these smugglers and bandits   43.93995413915172
recall the scene for the words you thought were only given to silence and solitude fell into my ears   45.89795188382894
kill myself   75.96454555942465
the tall man had scarcely read these lines seen the signature and recognized the seal when he bowed to denote that he had no longer any objection to make and that he was ready to obey   135.789643122568
this is not my weakness i tell you at once   112.16121885103513
on the contrary gentlemen we would assist you if it were necessary   104.15258488936547
said the swiss if she is as great a lady as her writing is large you are a lucky fellow gomrade   31.64328912454927
said d artagnan seizing the letter   180.63932412531983
tomorrow is the twenty third and buckingham sets sail tomorrow with his fleet   176.4043900461508
a third the illustrious mazarin stealing the portfolio of prime minister from monsieur de chavigny who had expected to have it   82.53326655901175
inquired the captain of the patrol   162.75262181129136
well what do you want   47.49893583970834
and what treatment do you adopt for this singular complaint   154.573851964103
you are a precious creature my pretty hostess and i am much obliged to you   184.92877689841012
however when morrel went down to his dinner he appeared very calm   133.56538281911975
never did funeral knell never did alarm bell produce a greater effect on the hearer   74.65893863855067
where do you come from   121.54900819399091
the innkeeper turned to franz with an air that seemed to say your friend is decidedly mad   8.949123629030339
and then there are robbers said la carconte   62.36899944101615
have you kitchens here   121.38856378380687
that will be sufficient where two men having met one of them will remain on the ground   80.76792681201717
inquired athos of the youth   159.1225233298028
we are going then we two with our swords you with daggers   124.05927114517355
20169m behind the penitents came a man of vast stature and proportions   41.01420466385724
besides the ordinary cicerone who seizes upon you directly you set foot in your hotel and never quits you while you remain in the city there is also a special cicerone belonging to each monument nay almost to each part of a monument   114.41077907778093
you know what athos told you the other day   127.24474701381969
not only a benefactor but a father   78.60084802254289
the night was extremely dark   117.53626910636014
of many things   139.0870590543285
replied d artagnan straining both at the same time his quick ear and his intelligent glance it is the murmur of the populace in revolution   108.66040405420163
are there any traditions respecting these dismal abodes in which it is difficult to believe men can ever have imprisoned their fellow creatures   114.56576191696466
and with this conclusion a way peculiar to himself he rose and left the room   119.29832953810211
she burst into a forced and melancholy laugh her arms stiffened and twisted her head fell back on her chair and she remained motionless   137.46827067602484
richelieu remained standing leaning against the mantelpiece   124.78272874851744
then when it was ended as if he had met with a bitter disappointment he asked have you nothing else to say to me by the living voice laporte   66.21962931164953
no i have left off laughing now that you speak french   118.49437499596391
i i own that when my mind returns to that terrible period i have no recollection of anything but the rigid corpse of poor madame bonancieux   20.241720569653566
three times i presented myself to ask his support and three times he ordered his servants to turn me away   110.66422150202914
he was perhaps about to regain his liberty   145.25255983816632
it is not true said milady in a tone of voice so firm and with a countenance so unchanged that if d artagnan had not been in such perfect possession of the fact he would have doubted   80.33343155542735
asked blaisois   111.50214075329836
however inclined mordaunt was to have recourse to violence he understood the reasons d artagnan had given him   131.4051208902678
de boville m   120.94065428433196
madame madame   137.13371545112733
this personage was m   76.56695516211488
exclaimed la carconte rising and descending to the chamber with a tolerably firm step   136.3340880452362
why did not the countess the proud mercédès the disdainful catalane who will scarcely open her lips to her oldest acquaintances take your arm lead you into the garden into the private walks and remain there for half an hour   52.45318856228864
during the darkness as before my supper was brought   133.6475960386924
d artagnan received the compliments of those who were present in his own way and whilst the conversation became general he looked earnestly at athos   77.78715896667671
athos bowed and obeyed   234.53854514595753
an entire wing of the villa was burnt down   30.674592739457097
my heart beat so violently that i feared my wound would open   202.77039928876758
we need not say that a smile of condescension was stamped upon his lips   108.07970642380401
well i was very near being hung by mazarin and that made me more popular than ever   125.8006276438071
pardon me count pardon me   174.4213864011931
cried athos be men   101.07019379677584
a sort of smile was discernible on the motionless lips of noirtier   77.93149028110022
why did not madame de lannoy come and inform you instantly   115.538851030584
de villefort entered followed by barrois   81.01416069394796
still more he talks seriously about the matter puts on a white tie and speaks of his family   72.66675732716831
i was therefore obliged to give it up as you may imagine but i own i went away with rather a heavy heart for the horse had looked at me affectionately had rubbed his head against me and when i mounted him had pranced in the most delightful way imaginable so that i was altogether fascinated with him   76.41785306978234
she called some of the nuns who against all monastic custom found themselves in the presence of five men   112.26411018425217
de monte cristo would lose the opportunity of discovering an enemy whom chance has revealed to him who now sends this warning to the count a warning he might not be able to send another time if this first attempt should fail and another be made   135.3159625995351
but that it may prove laughter worthy even to the end let us not lose time   135.43936662397988
let us alight here said athos   93.45343480471745
support a double weight   26.712178133714744
have you noticed the remarkable beauty of the young woman m   98.46851763686286
a thousand pistoles i said   87.85073966101186
he found tréville in a joyful mood   194.78081807278465
is he not the son of general de quesnel who was created baron d épinay by charles x   128.88816002132936
then you did not bury the poor child there sir   152.27815381911915
the prince assigned the count de guiche to his father and kept bragelonne near his own person   55.9402736494748
franz coolly cocked both barrels   88.96997800700359
oh villefort villefort murmured the count this scene must often have haunted thy sleepless hours   118.22006464509022
why replied porthos mouston of course   77.17171440973607
he got up and knocked on the door   101.38485226609232
is he then advancing on paris   142.95388193271444
if the window had been open or even ajar i should think nothing of it   57.94036108945546
that worthy prince   141.69013015938503
do you understand it   189.9102924574671
mazarin saw the sign and remained convinced that d artagnan had seen and heard everything   37.1622186110248
indeed said maximilian i have often been almost tempted to attribute to him the gift of prophecy   93.83098597532388
on their way they met grimaud   155.6649671990172
it seemed to her that they wanted to revenge the past and not to anticipate the future   203.01520695084156
everything in the apartment gave evidence of a violent and desperate struggle   54.49863942763873
i pledge you my honor returned the count that i mean to do as i have said   49.60244299306076
i make you my lieutenant general said the king   67.70617945843986
hurry hurry   39.23316994840374
what monseigneur   111.9292021814347
you would make me weep if such a thing were possible   72.39937885530244
then began his travels his duels his caprices   105.385690336661
said valentine looking anxiously around   160.3514178342701
then monsieur de coligny was killed and yes said mazarin but the coadjutor is not yet made cardinal   109.18238030391277
these words were addressed to the countess g who had just arrived and was leaning on the arm of signor torlonia the duke s brother   49.84123817125331
murmured madame danglars choking with fear   162.61588146102775
patience monsieur everything will come in its turn   84.26187945014121
and i was asleep cried raoul whilst you sir you had the kindness to attend to all these details   124.95157845297791
a deep silence reigned for a long time in the boat after the fearful scene described   156.88263116208987
i shall return thither my lord but it is a mistake on your part not to employ me   78.26847128469333
there is no harm in trying to buy things cheap monsieur porthos said the procurator s wife seeking to excuse herself   125.16242485998171
i am thirsty that is all   125.941079621422
the same happened to valentine of whom he was jealous   175.39400886179354
fortunately added he my good friends are down yonder and they will not allow me to be carried away without a struggle   205.85541813144937
nay answered monte cristo with the most gentlemanly air tis not for such trifling sums as these that your banking house is to be incommoded   141.1365701215153
you are right said morrel calmly   157.06501559379075
and now we understand each other   94.30239186213561
back already   205.92696319437556
cried eugénie smoothing the scattered curls of her hair which had now quite a masculine appearance   79.90149684389347
and a slight though meaning smile passed over his lips   92.760907874368
the young greek smiled   128.98258172215782
i am a sailor   5.192647904702099
is he at home   134.70337229217063
needless delays but increase the grief of parting said monte cristo and maximilian has doubtless provided himself with everything requisite   141.93160553606018
heavens athos a murder   104.63239702370954
because he is an enemy   163.41891306505767
close the door said la carconte   104.28295273143218
some of the inmates of the lions den were watching the operations of the prisoner s toilet with considerable interest   136.30434442586906
andrea to think of marrying   88.66550277746411
your excellency has 5 050 000 francs in your pocket   89.22921112234837
nevertheless you must not exaggerate the evil said monte cristo for by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into another   135.14181385981095
i am not mad replied faria with that acuteness of hearing peculiar to prisoners   95.96807974800016
now thinking that her host was a priest that coquette took it into her head that it would be a happy souvenir for her old age among the many happy souvenirs she already possessed if she could win that of having damned an abbé   102.96330542624283
ta ta ta ti ta ti ta ta   132.85314542631838
cried the horsemen rushing on d artagnan with naked swords   91.74791690495852
suppose a watchman should pass   146.3750031544247
the commissary who had till this time held his head down over his papers looked up to see what sort of person he had to do with   58.28280210668314
that i may relate my misfortunes for you to treat them as fables   150.93452240715976
he held the knife with which milady had stabbed herself open in his bosom   116.5086634955739
how so planchet   81.45615210408565
what athos   53.59223792606487
and give up your share of the venture said edmond to remain with me   107.24798825889545
i looked into the kitchen once more and saw caderousse sitting by the side of a long table upon one of the low wooden stools which in country places are frequently used instead of chairs   53.00162928047908
it is singular said the doctor   69.04489955694704
the little fellow who arrived last night in a post chaise with his sister and who asked for an apartment with two beds   97.14079923112459
the officers table and that of the king were opposite to them   96.75163242840584
then you pity him   167.62908903586634
40120m villefort shrieked clasped his hands and looked at the doctor with a supplicating air   118.86247033928537
yes a base coward murmured d artagnan   108.03818050789963
it is not a wonder they are fat sleeping all day and only waking to eat all night   153.1437151017872
and then when bonacieux s cries were no longer audible good   83.14951851794123
but what for the moment engaged my attention most earnestly and i am sure you will understand me d artagnan was the getting from this woman a kind of carte blanche which she had extorted from the cardinal and by means of which she could with impunity get rid of you and perhaps of us   227.2647442628426
the day passed away as rapidly as an hour   108.37241044897563
mamma mamma said i are we really to be killed   163.2044117494402
at the turning of the first street they would light the lamps as it would be foolish to attract the notice of the police by too many precautions   86.85225251484742
bonacieux pushed a little servants door open by day but generally closed at night   113.43992613479271
tony carries our muskets   141.9923449268953
mousqueton is propped against the door and here s the key   63.48843475079639
if it is a workman i need but knock against the wall and he will cease to work in order to find out who is knocking and why he does so   162.28429091335863
monsieur albert appears to me quite innocent of the treason charged against the general   161.7923208413199
besides there was one thing that engaged his most anxious thought in what way was the escape to be effected   100.59613179771439
this too was the opinion of comminges who withdrew somewhat reassured   99.49177087258774
the peasant started off running before the prince s horse   137.0212125520938
finally the prince led the right wing resting on aunay   110.6644020918617
i neither know nor care   119.1429917078661
monsieur d artagnan is a young man scarcely nineteen or twenty and this gentleman must be thirty at least   84.44161426979683
my carriage shall take you back   72.32969955246423
ah that is what i do not know   116.7273327590161
it is true said porthos   164.86585777973158
that is different   100.80063749880841
if this man should ever discover the names of the others my master is lost   90.3232260016009
on the contrary i think they are poor sir   74.1522469215109
by jove my lord said d artagnan you have well said but these are only words   114.85887751512197
for instance that henri iv   113.1841154538247
i wish to read in his eyes whether he intends to obey me   9.4579678773067
the greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised   166.13337709455936
no quarter   103.72367610728044
fight my dear captain fight   85.62427678878666
i do not think it is a moment to give way to useless sorrow   83.8282954110246
what a dreadful death what a blow   96.27947348145864
d artagnan the elder   82.72865337799394
the window turned on its hinges and a man entered   117.8014750603718
the fact is hazarded d artagnan timidly i did not see the handkerchief fall from the pocket of monsieur aramis   86.32928910474915
he spoke of me to lord de winter already prejudiced against me and told him that his sister in law was a prostitute a branded woman   225.65220720617992
your majesty has treated her with a severity it is thus i will always treat my enemies and yours duke however high they may be placed and whatever peril i may incur in acting severely toward them   113.0414057085523
we grow according to our race and our species and we pursue the same lines and often the same uselessness all our lives   68.94808693233051
he cried they must have obtained my arrest   105.31028222367576
we stepped into the boat   94.30650944650958
but the devil does not suffer himself to be easily dispossessed from a place in which he has fixed his garrison   135.61117418065277
and at some moment when nobody is expecting it behold trouble and misery and all sorts of persecutions are heaped on the unfortunate wretches who can not even see whence all their afflictions come   104.20227536322783
no not yet   20.991577752856927
it may be observed that at the very moment when thanks to the ray of the sun he perceived the gun barrel he was thinking with astonishment on the forbearance of his eminence with respect to him   22.130253449901673
perfectly said the dragoon   122.20356036100208
ah said beauchamp you doubt me   122.00813234189721
it is god s pleasure that things should be so   155.93449959864745
i have three friends who are more meritorious and more worthy you are a brave youth d artagnan interrupted the cardinal tapping him familiarly on the shoulder charmed at having vanquished this rebellious nature   139.37905012449718
the count bowed again but lower than before   46.8226899306007
but what are you up to   168.6050573454824
i would take the hundred pistoles   141.94081348570126
both the heart and the ground absorb that beneficent moisture falling on them and nothing is outwardly apparent   177.42100133439033
but i suppose you had no tools to aid you   42.56342340397647
you will say he calls himself andrea cavalcanti   97.70588343609987
he has a right to pay the dowry which i shall take with me to some convent   77.15533108884429
i have reached my destination   106.58407184758491
in five minutes bazin made his appearance looking in every direction to see if he were observed but he saw no one   75.17798329173354
a miserable old age awaits you   62.7381427116031
when you please replied beauchamp   182.39597712214754
come come thought d artagnan emerging from behind the curtain decidedly monsieur planchet is no fool   111.9948374752367
thank you sir but the way by the subterranean passage would take too much time and i have none to lose   68.71342822704864
he has besides a son a lieutenant in the army   117.75117503681221
it is a bad sign   57.39479659466355
in addition to this d artagnan possessed that invincible stock of resolution which the counsels of his father had implanted in his heart endure nothing from anyone but the king the cardinal and monsieur de tréville   175.8276216759407
i confess that unless you deign to give me some proof of what you advance what do you think of this   150.2189247234998
is it for this i name you captain of my musketeers that they should assassinate a man disturb a whole quarter and endeavor to set fire to paris without your saying a word   75.48990403679016
who and what are you   92.44333720032984
one might have thought there was in that cellar one of those famished ogres the gigantic heroes of popular legends into whose cavern nobody could force their way with impunity   161.75544783545902
you too have been in england sir   123.28466696656511
and lastly aramis the third to take orders and become an abbé   180.25859674276802
cried olivain reappearing at this accusation   79.53113970313336
but these two corsican bandits   164.11975002584552
it goes without saying that this impatience to return toward paris had for a cause the danger which mme   70.47540299485574
then an idea came to him which harmonized everything   151.4049941853794
de tréville entertained good company wholly anticardinalist though   121.69836107920959
not with us sir replied dantès   154.00866581801574
but on the road an aide de camp from cromwell sent orders that colonel tomlison should conduct him to holdenby castle   91.12786142195283
mademoiselle de villefort is the culprit she is the poisoner   139.3250305064631
well said milady what can those who sleep wish for a happy awakening   182.412546097872
a whole bottle   63.18292036670798
i have abjured my affections and like all renegades i am of evil omen to those who surround me   67.63168157309326
now the scent bag of white satin on which her cipher is embroidered in pearls   136.43210013221415
soon as the road turned the chateau de la valliere appeared in view   135.87738885768337
the fact was in leaving notre dame the coadjutor had learned the event of the day   100.10096400473502
i am sure i am the first cried morrel   113.1339819385042
to return instantly to england and to inform him as soon as the duke leaves london   125.88935391029372
to day look around you and it may astonish you that in order to accomplish a plan which is dearer to me than life i have only lord de winter the friend of twenty years and you gentlemen whom i see for the first time and whom i know but as my countrymen   220.39583004792377
mousqueton will lose another that s five   87.71087813650854
their horses flew and they never ceased speaking of athos and aramis   125.78870281504288
then calling planchet he said now my lad you may claim your seven hundred livres but you did not run much risk with such a note as that   173.203356373111
and both set off towards the capital at full gallop   141.6830358687826
the anchor was instantly dropped and the chain ran rattling through the port hole   32.36897493366146
they have allowed all this time to elapse and then all of a sudden rake up events which have been forgotten to furnish materials for scandal in order to tarnish the lustre of our high position   61.482607339246705
50065m woman siren that you are do you persist in fixing on me that fascinating eye which reminds me that i ought to blush   94.8936609744946
see i have thought about you look at the good breakfast we are going to have   174.63779403634177
and you morrel in breaking a horse that no one can ride   95.0444938953316
irrevocably   94.98776481584738
and this very nearly ruined the minister   84.47345453559204
cries of despair resounded on all sides   116.95546253133445
the four men stood motionless   114.81976274843387
then what may it be   142.04984879996124
you discovered what had become of your mother   152.1555338412591
really you alarm me   163.17199845951689
it would be ridiculous in me to regulate my conduct by such caprices   107.60979797589023
the duke in order to pass away another quarter of an hour pretended to be reading something that interested him and muttered that he wished they would allow him to finish his chapter   52.34964950850832
i stretched out my arms   46.693199485697434
it is a wound that confines him to his bed   82.865483444711
friquet heard perfectly but he pretended not to do so and tried to continue his road   95.88419531344546
will you remember us to him and ask him to solicit for me the same favor that he will have obtained   63.94095028014272
cried morrel throwing away his cigar and hastening to the carriage   132.6724617892024
treat him kindly therefore in the future   128.14717213366487
then his head was seen passing at the back of the boxes and the count knew that the approaching storm was intended to fall on him   174.44453396069378
but the son will be here   148.66283511111644
while you at least are sure of the credence of half your audience   103.11387061642002
the door had been opened and shut again   164.52482317303355
silence child   108.75375504103395
no noise gave reason to believe that it was inhabited   87.900825236727
he had been obliged to seclude himself more than ever to evade the enormous number of applications presented to him for the purpose of obtaining tickets of admission to the court on the day of trial   126.46620796021875
i mean to say that i have a good reason but that it is difficult to explain   101.53739398434737
well continued valentine the reason of my proposing it was that i might escape this hateful marriage which drives me to despair   144.99938989215775
i shall have something of the greatest importance to communicate to you   74.00122295986016
returned the count with surprise   10.73336016948953
a wintry blast   37.15702084394462
let us go on to another of his exercises   156.73459783401145
the four friends pleaded an engagement and took leave of m   110.99217769510452
well this letter gives the count of monte cristo unlimited credit on our house   166.0969516109454
for you surely would not wish to compromise one who from this day regards herself as destined honorably and happily to bear your name   59.4630009418522
come come this is very droll very amusing i allow   79.78223433356703
this poor child is quite resigned as she knows she can not live elsewhere without the salvation of her soul being in danger   4.657607117534994
said d artagnan who began to understand   176.07953730604368
franz did not doubt that these plans were the same concerning which the count had dropped a few words in the grotto of monte cristo and while the count was speaking the young man watched him closely hoping to read something of his purpose in his face but his countenance was inscrutable especially when as in the present case it was veiled in a sphinx like smile   107.39749422257518
d artagnan colored and grew pale several times in reading this billet   96.20791374430253
cried the priest with a laugh which made the dying man s hair stand on end   67.31737157246397
it is true murmured the englishman   89.75206610128342
that is never done   49.82708712792739
d artagnan who had no settled habits of his own as he came from his province into the midst of a world quite new to him fell easily into the habits of his friends   83.38599154686082
this is what you asked for he said and what i promised to give you   22.520402399988143
you know said the abbé that i was the secretary and intimate friend of cardinal spada the last of the princes of that name   155.75141991714872
the young woman complied   162.63401471176212
she was very beautiful but her usual pallor had increased   79.2705613132492
very well said the voice   71.91901430149018
said the gascon   141.2085719084327
porthos fired   135.31540093761504
but my lord you saw the queen come to the aid of the woman who faltered   46.623439518376784
yes they are wrong said d artagnan   78.05128917295791
cried planchet can it be   206.68183096370603
you are wrong then   61.768040331689335
in a few minutes through all the doors down all the staircases by every exit everyone hastened to retire or rather to fly   57.41454409632581
he came hoping that i would accept my shame as my shame was consummated   159.46954422343683
as to the monk without withdrawing the poniard from the wound he ran to the window opened it leaped out into the flowers of a small garden glided onward to the stable took out his mule went out by a back gate ran to a neighbouring thicket threw off his monkish garb took from his valise the complete habiliment of a cavalier clothed himself in it went on foot to the first post secured there a horse and continued with a loose rein his journey to paris   28.264640696783545
cried aramis pale with anger suspecting that d artagnan had acted as a spy on him and had seen him with madame de longueville   78.22054262333592
scratches himself   130.56734472012616
but likewise upon our word as gentlemen added athos knitting his brow monsieur d artagnan shall not leave us   153.20336252238673
you have already tried the power of your seductions upon many men and unfortunately you have always succeeded   165.187065989138
and what was the result of those duels   81.8768770886863
the queen had just regained her chamber and d artagnan was about to retire when he felt his shoulder lightly touched   104.42360858473786
do not be unhappy dear friend on that account   16.799006441220698
no doubt in the subterranean palace gaetano told you of   52.761668009930574
sire said athos we foresaw this   100.5036063154167
has not one of you a cross   127.00778928343648
what do you mean to do with that purse   89.8648587096703
carmela was greatly troubled that she had not recognized him   166.22324500643265
yes of you   113.87366246666701
but the glass cutter was a prudent man who had provided for all emergencies   97.96879487526668
well i must confess it does replied d artagnan   59.663458567593814
de villefort who had been the king s attorney at nîmes and afterwards at versailles   159.2426804378988
raoul bent his knee to the ground   167.98790559330598
i had need of distraction   176.1117160238027
mercédès had no fire in that cold and naked room she who was accustomed to stoves which heated the house from the hall to the boudoir   127.40770353497749
tis more than possible answered the comte de la fere   95.97207768857479
and your third attack if indeed you should have another will find you at liberty   92.74590002308842
you have indeed a noble nature edmond and i see by your paleness and agitation what is passing in your heart at this moment   143.0704170233787
the house belongs to him   78.63395504724778
bring hither that horse   44.41938269667342
yes much   148.22268655855692
certainly quite ready   70.59698011808018
the same nervous movements were repeated and the mouth contracted and turned purple   48.42456759461065
grimaud rose   156.49918770666406
but now the jailer might hear the noise and put an end to it and so destroy a ray of something like hope that soothed his last moments   67.87867580429693
i hope it may be so replied caderousse his face flushed with cupidity   76.07655344161347
speak my friend   42.61254021174699
in a very simple manner colonel said d artagnan   128.65824551548087
charles rose and turned toward parry whom he saw pale and with his temples dewed with moisture   157.3495780171703
i accept them at once   41.526418212017575
i said the traveller am called sinbad the sailor   140.60742176680097
besides this return offered him the advantage of watching his prisoner   174.30812557284042
yes said danglars while the perspiration started from the roots of his hair   93.70528487683491
yes indeed the marks are recent   174.54186095839822
i don t believe that monsieur de mazarin thinks of cutting off our heads for heads are not taken off without previous trial   136.7979461755053
my apartment will be close to his   172.22375399277624
i merely wish to overtake one of my friends with whom i am going to hunt tomorrow at chapelle en serval   117.95707975159954
well now that will do wonderfully well said athos   148.40682140173547
and by one of those rapid turns which he always had at command all his anger faded away into a smile   180.93556186006884
the enemy will not rally for fifteen days and until that time i have no need of your service   74.90161465352223
his cheek bones were broad and projecting a never failing proof of audacity and craftiness   171.5098967633649
the lion was daunted   91.05192708388645
the army i will answer for it will be but little pleased at being exposed to rigorous treatment on account of police affairs   105.96426886571341
the concierge closed the door leaving madame danglars in the street   108.4561468595919
i therefore repeat to you i speak not to a magistrate but to a friend   83.5129087445048
now the deliverance of the cardinal would be the ruin of our hopes   63.013675226108624
at a solitary and retired part of the road he drew his sword and required the messenger to deliver up to him the papers of which he was the bearer   86.25554629293094
hasten to monte cristo avail yourself of the fortune for you have indeed suffered long enough   145.1508182260493
the day after tomorrow he banishes me he transports me   171.5567729675069
while porthos was calling for help with all the power of his strong voice aramis ran to the table to get a glass of water   169.78647285103335
the anger of heaven will not pursue us since you are pure and i am innocent   172.13127684429304
that she shall not with one blow dishonor her husband and her child   94.08369569373693
i am ready to receive and return them sir said the officer in pretty good french for i resided three years in paris   96.77513938629696
then on the honor of a mazarin as i am and ever shall be i hope said the cardinal   95.85445105044835
in the meanwhile as the thing is difficult to find in france and your abbé is not probably disposed to make a journey to paris on my account i must continue to use monsieur planche s anti spasmodics   103.74785808684706
the library was divided into two parts on either side of the wall and contained upwards of two thousand volumes   103.89267128230422
i have no doubt that he did monsieur for all his wheedling manner   89.90510675966131
adieu edmond adieu and thank you   119.37521148878687
instantly afterward a door opened and a light played upon the staircase   91.9981033266992
de villefort answered nothing but sat or rather threw himself down again upon his chair   47.44863299156829
no fernand you will not thus give way to evil thoughts   128.91412061600334
this port wine belongs to the english therefore it belongs to us   112.42863496932225
follow me mr   7.922204076884867
and then commenced a roar of laughter in which they all joined to the astonishment of poor porthos   87.09295304259201
it is pleasant isn t it   121.38962185831073
when seven o clock came dantès agony really began   85.48732525890851
as if the same idea had animated these two beings mercédès was doing the same in her apartments that he had just done in his   89.05050109164216
procureur   80.98250455103677
so au revoir dear athos   66.95369577814677
drops of perspiration trickled down his face and from time to time he put a handkerchief to his mouth to wipe away the blood that rilled from it   40.13532379557165
drink a glass of port said aramis   84.59145510382952
monte cristo uttered a cry which those only can conceive who have heard the roar of a wounded lion   107.50839627113398
i do not know sire answered the minister of police   81.76590814649427
the king s attorney seemed to experience a sensation of pity   67.26084068159955
monte cristo repeated all the titles he had read on the baron s card   112.91256463258586
but the queen has obtained an order from the king by means of which she has been conveyed to a convent   19.525952859866862
let us then take advantage of it   95.78252452924298
may amount to nearly two mil   85.05202273754206
handsome well bred noble lord as you are my dear athos neither princesses nor queens would be secure from your amorous solicitations   166.87375828290845
d artagnan porthos and aramis uttered a cry of joy   117.38842001493926
the baron finding himself disarmed took two or three steps back but in this movement his foot slipped and he fell backward   98.3772357886782
monsieur is full of generosity said athos   14.45496653846996
he had been apprised by the groom of the last stage of the count s approach   33.385846785953106
and he drew from his pocket a marvellous casket formed out of a single emerald and closed by a golden lid which unscrewed and gave passage to a small greenish colored pellet about the size of a pea   173.4405674523729
perhaps he will be young strong and enduring like yourself and will aid you in your escape while i have been but a hindrance   159.8693024819222
that is the sum m   67.89017317068088
do you then know in what manner fernand injured dantès   72.60396754486135
in a court of justice that is called an alibi   193.31740652520722
bazin stretched his arms rubbed his eyes and tried to go to sleep again   139.37945739943171
accepting the hand of the officer she began the descent of the ladder at the foot of which the boat waited   104.69305898658014
you see said porthos this is my usual style   151.43263323491254
they stopped the horses and cut the escort to pieces whilst i opened the doors of the carriage and monsieur de rochefort jumped out and soon was lost amongst the crowd   70.89981535970182
but the awful murmuring which indicates an angry people continued   8.571329794426006
still higher   100.70906358947775
i will not detain you and will try to cure myself of my ambition   76.41691579188594
it must be done in the palace   131.32477527448705
7 prepared for him was situated precisely the same as no   59.21443183200781
without doubt the rioters are in prison and you come to tell me justice is done   94.64724698591236
here i am said vampa instantly appearing   135.51515874366697
la ramee entered   136.1024439636488
place this man in the care of his guards again and let him wait till i send for him   186.68320743103675
but i warn you you will lose a very curious sight returned the count   62.77932291259443
good night friend   116.80888226059714
do you think you have to do with galley slaves or novices in the world   106.9498313451088
oh yes i heard that   146.7252097358239
his footstep was heard one moment in the corridor then the rattling of his carriage wheels as he was driven rapidly away   7.02403068215645
i did not say france my lord   99.1832257809779
let us take ourselves out of the way and leave things for the present to take their course   128.3560110661432
go go at once   138.503338322137
but i carry your word with me do i not   90.94818067496664
my father has revealed the culprit s name   81.57081834624232
what is your name then   94.75369555094773
he will enter by this door   57.67397814100806
we anchored our vessel which had a double hold where our goods were concealed amidst a number of other vessels that bordered the banks of the rhône from beaucaire to arles   57.34828933440665
one is for seven o clock and the other for eight   178.1115292864534
there he dined heartily and again inquired about the young gentleman who was in advance of them   126.71561984111659
my dear d artagnan said aramis don t be too angry with me i beg   94.50589096857948
gervais   76.25661744807596
although warned that the man she had loved so much was in great danger the queen when his death was announced to her would not believe the fact and even imprudently exclaimed it is false   119.48705370271087
madame danglars was chatting at a short distance with debray beauchamp and château renaud   34.74252225010464
but friquet sprang from the entresol on to the top of the carriage   67.81722376834267
athos asked   113.63807353413642
he spoke in a voice of the procureur general with the rigid inflexibility of neck and shoulders which caused his flatterers to say as we have before observed that he was the living statue of the law   221.678594600674
we have no need therefore to say that d artagnan dared not join in the conversation only he looked with all his eyes and listened with all his ears stretching his five senses so as to lose nothing   122.96804629732715
madame danglars had until then perhaps hoped for something   126.64020305817706
he wished to confess to the officer and upon his refusal uttered such pitiable cries that the officer told him that if he continued to deafen him thus he should put a gag in his mouth   82.75298378106424
athos made a sign to porthos and aramis also to remain in the rear and advanced alone   134.34843266438375
and he jumped into the carriage with the alacrity of a man of five and twenty   172.58044301497245
the captain m   12.674761448343787
i parted from him two years ago at palermo and he was then on the point of setting out for the most remote regions   257.51261795671724
for after the death of richelieu everything went on contrary to expectation in the same way as before   90.88216486126296
he resolved to adopt the second and began that day to carry out his resolve   89.5181944638163
yes madame replied the magistrate   192.61080311116854
the handkerchief you saw had not been given to me but it had been forgotten and left at my house by one of my friends   112.99107421086669
forgotten he   131.98297782130263
the latter and the coadjutor touched the brush with the tips of their fingers and made the sign of the cross   137.9059073462674
can he give me any particulars   142.58893156342884
no madame they struck me always struck me   121.83418407431571
go on then i listen   88.13215226050849
it is the monk whispered porthos to aramis   89.40062618843258
yes yes when the campaign is over replied the gascon   57.893000005607476
the coadjutor returned to parliament more a monarch than king queen and cardinal all three together   46.28100206525127
thousands of wild goats   178.83514355481935
should he who had so often for mere amusement s sake plunged to the bottom of the sea to fetch up the bright coral branch hesitate to entertain the same project   97.41286995410996
repeat your father s name said the president   73.12337910068052
you have a park and horses servants   123.35042360041771
the room resumed its obscurity   132.49393587322112
cried d artagnan wringing his hands   46.99178912439592
speak monsieur   40.419581060726
athos came down last and found d artagnan already on horseback and growing impatient   172.97662662886927
one comes from the volga and the other from lake fusaro   155.04150960561935
but you i presume have decided to assert your pretensions viva voce   165.19190717854235
and as he uttered these words of doubt and depression within his mind a voice beside him said respect to fallen majesty   104.99345830630185
that then is your opinion   77.36404059492645
why does he go in secret   68.18907013911331
beauchamp said monte cristo as if this was the first time he had seen the journalist that evening   115.71201618368792
50049m at one time he thought he was saved for he heard the brigadier exclaim in a loud voice to the two gendarmes he is not here   63.28016365151272
we will fight nevertheless   124.58447873493198
this way this way my dear albert   61.67450932896281
murmured the minister feeling that the pressure of circumstances however light a thing to destiny was too much for any human strength to endure   186.62614036900018
do you love her much   58.03829740141
let me ask you why you deceived me   78.05746479937748
villefort looked at her with that piercing glance which reads the secrets of the heart   2.351408036848497
it was the last he ever gave me and i feel as if it were still warm on my forehead   154.20162161083547
during this short time valentine must have held her breath or moved in some slight degree for the woman disturbed stopped and leaned over the bed in order the better to ascertain whether valentine slept it was madame de villefort   105.92704886784138
for the persons of whom i am about to talk are rich and powerful and if they only laid the tips of their fingers on me i should break to pieces like glass   82.18071612343479
but she was greatly embarrassed   179.831008928182
this is terrible said athos   120.62377172049155
it was not that the sight of the wretched pony did not excite numerous smiles on the countenances of passers by   133.16841779306048
as he said this he pressed grimaud s hand who seemed honored by the distinction   100.8104644318977
can we do anything for you   136.46881953538536
he was at the window calling ali a horse for m   40.88998669882932
your milady said he appears to be an infamous creature but not the less you have done wrong to deceive her   142.30613672032206
gervais athos and the napkin which was converted into a banner   144.94728899823372
when i came to myself again i was stretched in the same place   133.16358379780786
by degrees the light of the lamps gradually faded in the hands of the marble statues which held them and the perfumes appeared less powerful to morrel   143.03941665123423
he proposed to me to undertake it with him and i agreed   87.66476937102439
yes replied d artagnan   188.44398464843886
porthos was discontented with his condition   107.45673564956003
besides nobody came thither but the three musketeers   82.13037380239548
one thing however reassured him   160.08742139472633
give it back to him sir and since you have such a man in your service make him useful   120.80561473785149
base coward   132.52693666840003
yes monseigneur replied the officer   50.80196622367793
permit me to remind you that you are not in the chamber my dear viscount   139.9787379189792
he had collected all his resources and fearing lest the report of his distress should get bruited abroad at marseilles when he was known to be reduced to such an extremity he went to the beaucaire fair to sell his wife s and daughter s jewels and a portion of his plate   82.69509004306201
chapter 102   140.53664943932645
well the man whom i offer you is a general syndic   151.80110785801972
furious at being held in check by one whom he had considered a boy he became warm and began to make mistakes   101.82908430687431
i do assure you grandpapa ah m   128.9923004010193
to take mazarin   89.15460296576968
said the jesuit disdainfully   227.19912059999012
five minutes later he came down the grand staircase   149.1095596653543
yes that s it no doubt   73.25264873653343
you are discreet so much the better   90.63906973063747
the avenger   36.830939131524616
ali mute and attentive brought the pipes and coffee and disappeared   54.979400992804884
come said he this matter will want a good deal of talking over   71.62357812733282
the duke went from one surprise to another   76.0362862565718
she was not at home   142.2932545305961
indeed i still shudder at the fearful danger you were placed in   55.88893339848734
through the gate was seen kitchen gardens carefully attended to a spacious courtyard in which neighed several horses held by valets in various liveries and a carriage drawn by two horses of the country   198.09419515276414
is the conference ended   80.73022404250425
but she with a strong movement tried to escape   118.35630968735835
for the dead man yes replied m   134.69021877448586
sure enough   140.08961648255445
then add that his grace has in the precipitation with which he quit the isle of ré forgotten and left behind him in his lodging a certain letter from madame de chevreuse which singularly compromises the queen inasmuch as it proves not only that her majesty can love the enemies of the king but that she can conspire with the enemies of france   40.3921307364303
all day he toiled on untiringly and by the evening he had succeeded in extracting ten handfuls of plaster and fragments of stone   33.566348339108785
where shall we escort him   80.95033202180223
and she came back without this casket   144.62967428958078
but at the first word the young woman started and exclaimed in a sharp bantering tone which sounded strangely in the darkness are you afraid dear monsieur d artagnan   155.6278187953303
for example supposing it were the daughter of a banker he might take an interest in the house of the father in law of his son   130.477758844036
noirtier s eye remained fixed and firm as if to imply that a promise did not suffice   141.53111921836435
he drew from his breast the diamond cross and the star of the garter which she had sent him by those generous frenchmen   117.00984585556914
you are punctual said he as he drew back the door   131.5774177002877
that s exactly the reason i won t go said d artagnan   167.72093675867404
you know the best harbors   79.99364155654136
like you i hesitated but the count s eloquence decides me   153.22449687304206
a delay would save my honor and consequently my life   53.57026489407891
he passed his tongue over a spoonful of preserves and stuck his teeth into the sticky pastry of mme   163.2465641242026
we are mistaken said d artagnan   95.43204469369964
the caves of the small   160.59079828097248
besides it will be an opportunity for her to wear those beautiful diamonds which you gave her recently on her birthday and with which she has since had no occasion to adorn herself   132.0302305998294
at the mention of the monk grimaud became pale   117.65304017732146
they lifted him off at the door of a cabaret left bazin with him who besides in a skirmish was more embarrassing than useful and set forward again in the hope of sleeping at amiens   98.16342901003355
his figure had grown rotund and as it were canonical   122.41373328683898
well edmond i swear to you by the head of that son for whom i entreat your pity edmond for ten years i saw every night every detail of that frightful tragedy and for ten years i heard every night the cry which awoke me shuddering and cold   149.5174849854972
destiny   159.04356834571567
the sea is the cemetery of the château d if   118.13595113068722
but all things are possible   18.31759094745297
where i am going   73.28473831283912
de tréville and consequently that he belonged body and soul to the king   72.24146790360393
this time bonacieux became so pale that d artagnan could not help perceiving it and asked him what was the matter   159.61255552753653
cried the young man why should you not live   66.22469813496716
he examined attentively the countenance of the applicant for place and fancied that the contracted eyebrows thin lips hooked nose and prominent cheek bones of grimaud were favorable signs   95.6624448140929
and what is that great lord s name   112.33373871600166
him there are means of destroying   142.77539872676806
a gentleman received from hand to hand money from the king and was not the least in the world humiliated   151.98574746582224
it restores the blue color of litmus paper reddened by an acid and it turns syrup of violets green   130.03516718031997
but the report did not prevent the new occupant establishing himself there with his modest furniture the same day at five o clock   87.50625300887455
you will bring lights and relieve the sentinel continued felton   102.99996093123822
and d artagnan retired but as he passed out he glanced at the curtain through which the queen had entered and at the bottom of the tapestry he remarked the tip of a velvet slipper   29.82795144940897
you know the environs of paris then   94.2203625588758
you would love me as much if i were poor would you not maximilian   146.77997891728967
he then called for his horses drove to the chamber and inscribed his name to speak against the budget   113.32934209008984
it was danglars letter to the king s attorney which the count of monte cristo disguised as a clerk from the house of thomson french had taken from the file against edmond dantès on the day he had paid the two hundred thousand francs to m   66.62610074670444
and he lost two hours in his attempts which were at last utterly useless   99.08302478548104
the curious suck our tears as flies suck the blood of a wounded hart   106.33978879356972
you are gentlemen and i am a poor innkeeper   116.34095304285268
sure of what   161.54845715934562
athos at that moment extended his hand with the air of supreme command which characterized him alone drew out his sword and the scabbard at the same time broke the blade in the sheath on his knee and threw the pieces to his right   82.75363513113524
excuse me for speaking so very candidly but as this is intended only for ourselves i do not see why i should weigh my words   134.0539231877869
bah i have passed perhaps ten times through chantilly and out of the ten times i have stopped three or four times at your house at least   128.33760815778768
in a house in the allées de meilhan no   153.45874284602564
inquired the countess eagerly   99.44918188115273
of this however be assured that should any favorable opportunity present itself i will not fail to offer you the choice of being present   142.0656329408722
the soldiers were complaisant   114.75903858324041
hardly had they put foot on deck ere her head was turned towards hastings where they were to disembark   122.63395774337418
devoted men are so rare tréville by the back staircase   91.9343152670587
if you happen to have any jewels hide them directly   106.0630329024265
his boots were covered with dust and he inquired if he could not instantly cross over to england   151.8406236207095
i do not know sir   86.46972046280656
then said the count your feeble spirit will not even grant me the trial i request   106.5778540838342
he struggled against his thirst till his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth   111.6235528373863
cries were soon heard and then moans which someone appeared to be endeavoring to stifle   134.6528652860283
it was about eleven o clock at night   165.097587077463
what are your eminence s orders   147.94241623544616
tomorrow said he you will be avenged or i shall be dead   165.74063170137237
and he looked at the young man as if he would read the bottom of his heart   99.38631588175846
it was an old soldier of the guards who could not see his king pass captive before him without rendering him this final homage   103.10825845017496
we know nothing as yet of the conspiracy monsieur   205.62165862562938
that s why you want to purchase my english horse said debray you think he will bear the cold better   60.69348349978222
yes there it is   99.54959882527592
today is the 30th of july 1816 why it is but seventeen months   140.14635535002736
is it possible that you can see anything more than the merest chance in this meeting   107.4252118078274
and to which   100.37202566534245
his whole body appeared in its ordinary state of calmness only an unusual fire beamed from his eyes like the effects of a fever   90.03698358576278
that is the name of a mountain cried the poor questioner who began to lose his head   162.24071644816587
well said he but you had another subject for your thoughts   150.36861461705018
does the sum you gave for them make the animals less beautiful inquired the count shrugging his shoulders   99.85688366630092
i had such a delightful dream   156.6651652546432
it was the first time one of these visions had ever addressed her in a living voice and she was about to utter an exclamation   102.54005878937022
but the duke is our friend   4.031508465529214
in a word an almost poetical fervor prevailed   168.49731837874435
he stops at the gate   129.6559596596415
the circumstances are grave and it will be necessary to act promptly   104.40341085667475
now retire to your chambers said athos and leave me to act   90.37112514694
and as a proof there is a crown to drink my health   156.49481205229773
madame said debray it is nearly six months since we have been associated   139.3355783873189
felton arrived at the palace of the admiralty covered with dust and streaming with perspiration   72.45370132481582
yes yes replied d artagnan   154.0975934200068
inquired valentine much agitated   124.20851783425651
for you without question inflicted four upon the dear gentleman and he is still very weak having lost almost all his blood   153.930911139368
exactly he is a quaker with the exception of the peculiar dress   9.59270512400147
towards the evening of the third day   249.4669756894624
mousqueton inquired therefore the state of the case of his old friend who confirmed the statement of d artagnan   28.806796934364172
indeed they will go so far that we shall be obliged to send them to the bastille   100.26563712647052
or rather back for the battle seems to be lost by the frondeurs   4.766610243674478
it may be observed that there was a proper proportion in his sentiments toward the governor of the prison and the minister toward the subordinate and the master   86.81338390456285
then running to the door exclaimed help help   18.612501450370715
but could you not compromise matters and give up a portion of your fortune to her son   99.34296914527634
said noirtier   63.558536081007105
the world still speaks within you in a loud voice altisimâ voce   95.17339876417176
all you have in gold   105.58665590708003
one felt that something unusual and terrible was happening in all the streets now dark as ocean s most unfathomable caves   95.34002439657657
he descended fifteen steps and the door of a dungeon was opened and he was thrust in   96.20969250974508
then why did you think of giving your daughter to him   114.15862931641067
he examined it to see if its hilt was well guarded and if the blade was firmly attached to the hilt   136.3184162760428
ah you call yourself oriental a levantine maltese indian chinese   24.443941668292155
aramis had some slight inclination to resume the cassock   107.90056396155822
but in the meantime well in the meantime   129.26930345820438
answer me do not these crimes exist   108.7201798377332
before he had spoken a word the count saw in the next room a veiled woman who had followed closely after baptistin and now seeing the count with a pistol in his hand and swords on the table rushed in   198.84989692968077
you are edmond dantès cried villefort seizing the count by the wrist   36.69901702361223
bazin   168.45585853928992
notwithstanding your father s wishes to the contrary   93.63024421279528
he was moistened before and behind with a greasy liquid which the host recognized as his best olive oil   145.3379202395995
a slight moisture on his brow was the only trace of emotion that charles evinced as he learned these tidings   132.58300410933026
one minute said the young man   119.71166302376771
i think it charming   91.19509713010835
no one suspected i was there   93.03719721316278
cried franz whose hair stood on end   150.01928578564113
i drew my sword in my turn and as he came back to the charge i fancied i felt that in throwing himself upon me he let it pass through his body   100.91758163009251
i have no doubt of it said d artagnan   98.39104693800239
muttered d artagnan leaning toward aramis and whispering in his ear you have made us swear on the crucifix of a frondeuse   87.37417725627922
without reckoning that as the bastion was not built yesterday all the rest of the building was badly shaken   116.57662090412865
have i friends   206.6380913530536
qui vive   139.80689725279763
do you wish me to lend you some   104.31335017038329
he hastened to descend into the street with a frightful beating at his heart   83.56370085614984
the cavalier made a movement as if to follow the carriage   63.57670816451603
having assassinated a man   56.41809625178894
but if anyone should entertain a false opinion of me added he drawing himself up as if he would challenge both friends and enemies i shall endeavor to correct his mistake   99.01573520218601
listen madame said gondy   60.747299639565874
why you know it is quite impossible to procure a carriage   111.74544442090311
said beauchamp much surprised   119.30226562297923
and who told you madame that i have any hostile intentions against your son   141.03876056009517
badly enough   181.10475530471524
and a minister   103.06828419310554
i predict from all this an avalanche of dinners and routs   78.21768721153464
chapter lxxxi   180.63934735099548
are the carbines loaded   185.9279316523585
one of the noble peers who was familiar with the arabic language having studied it during the famous egyptian campaign followed with his eye as the translator read aloud i el kobbir a slave merchant and purveyor of the harem of his highness acknowledge having received for transmission to the sublime emperor from the french lord the count of monte cristo an emerald valued at eight hundred thousand francs   69.82321644607325
on the other hand mazarin present at that audience heard very well what those deputies demanded   162.6103744465149
morrel now tried to negotiate bills at ninety days only and none of the banks would give him credit   115.29061479497346
he is an abbé   42.055770002239484
i admire all that is beautiful returned the young lady   111.86703899347808
marquise marquise   169.28660110383214
her white and slender fingers her pearly neck her cheeks tinted with varying hues reminded one of the lovely englishwomen who have been so poetically compared in their manner to the gracefulness of a swan   119.3139921995622
oh fear not said maximilian stopping at a short distance i do not intend to render another man responsible for the rigorous fate reserved for me   174.9068429779723
before questioning me he said reply to my question   113.73748620508951
faria fixed his eyes on him with an expression that would have convinced anyone else of his sanity   115.6482380621698
make the campaign like a handsome true gentleman and think of me who kisses tenderly your black eyes   70.91146349947934
ah i was quite sure you were a good and brave young man said mme   73.58228346346905
and truth obliges us even to confess that his chamber was just above the gutter and below the roof   141.54357199931857
it appeared however to milady that in one of the furtive glances she darted from time to time at the grating of the door she thought she saw the ardent eyes of the young man through the narrow opening   44.0235703260128
danglars stomach felt so empty that it seemed as if it would be impossible ever to fill it again   157.74687891381504
but these friends themselves tremble before the cardinal   20.328085912719075
but when i have no more money left to pay you   120.59790328465932
no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make his existence blessed   178.15492717339123
wait a week and i myself will give you some   201.16873316725432
upon my honor and by the holy cross   133.72859520640404
i have something better than that said monte cristo   142.7281173950278
monte cristo turned to albert   93.95302233249129
if not you were an accomplice   14.128402745429753
asked aramis haughtily   65.23684278449369
his eyes glittered with delight   141.34653061682675
he called out to him but they were too distant to be heard   129.92935302541107
not so fast   123.55153214632232
you will bind yourself cried the king by what monsieur de la trémouille shall say   190.84252626909048
in his whole person he bore such an impress of high degree that madame de chevreuse half rose from her seat when she saw him and made him a sign to sit down near her   31.76963265927624
let m   184.56727282322504
if i find you alive on my return you shall sleep tonight in the conciergerie   106.43850776153431
said the gardener ate dormice   156.03757832563252
shall i call one of the servants   85.32113717830457
at this moment a patrol passed by   39.32774058827245
chapter 109   106.55254593924197
or one of my friends what matters   103.04804592624313
do you accept the commission which i have intrusted to you   156.03749358508708
my god can you not remember her name   107.35666315067881
the queen entered and d artagnan remained at the door   48.726994365893304
let us put down 120 added albert smiling   125.27834779629929
you sent him for his education to a college in one of the provinces and now you wish him to complete his education in the parisian world   100.20565204246081
my husband has given me his word sir said madame de villefort   164.3898046272524
they are friends of yours then   120.01918333838098
asked lucien   52.81644160324102
i am all attention madame said he   103.17892158775638
d artagnan knelt as well as the rest received his share of the benediction and made the sign of the cross   100.45502986798085
you like m   76.55886731606387
morrel however extended his arm and commanded silence   169.48625594288987
that proves returned the abbé that you are like those of holy writ who having eyes see not and having ears hear not   88.24483407496513
oh you despise them   139.38235698330567
this portion of the napkin was marked with half a baron s crown and the letter h   90.56946256462324
i only as you see have remained poor wretched and forgotten   91.51951592726198
but when the culprits are discovered villefort here extended his hand toward a large crucifix placed opposite to his desk when they are discovered i swear to you by all i hold most sacred that whoever they may be they shall die   96.97627929331551
then he raised the flag stone cautiously with his head and looked carefully around the chamber   168.04606963748012
the fact is said d artagnan i have always observed a great degree of intelligence and devotedness in mousqueton   147.15803007601076
no one better   76.04355014000214
yet i repeat to you albert be prudent   129.01066549121072
ah monsieur said planchet on perceiving d artagnan how glad i am to see you   125.9423135799247
athos divided them into three groups assumed the command of one gave the second to aramis and the third to porthos   62.84536623112926
i see him very often said danglars drawing himself up   132.76247411531637
the man raised his head and the duke was about to utter a cry of surprise   51.13189563536033
however as they were fighting in a room and had not space to go on like that forever mordaunt s foot at last touched the wall against which he rested his left hand   101.85490335358891
let us wait by all means   126.70373623593915
d artagnan followed the soubrette with his eyes and saw her go toward the terrace   70.20503533027906
when the day after the arrival of this answer your father came by the advice of monte cristo to ask my daughter s hand for you i decidedly refused him but without any explanation or exposure   158.0550195479805
all must depend on circumstances   176.68079112208113
and that in the presence of witnesses   145.33457572152992
well cried his auditors   136.3643903531805
my god have mercy upon me   123.04471251750097
d artagnan had taken the precaution to set apart four trusses for his own use   4.03406815847741
now for the tally ho   89.8423319619923
as for porthos he assaulted the foe with such violence that although his sword was thrust aside the enemy was thrown off his horse and fell about ten steps from it   109.67166343887324
does the count know what answer you received   87.42243658218358
a servant wearing a livery of considerable style and richness appeared at the threshold and placing two cards in the landlord s hands who forthwith presented them to the two young men he said please to deliver these from the count of monte cristo to vicomte albert de morcerf and m   100.55532958577444
this address was accompanied by a look which was by no means difficult to understand   111.17954915522303
ah yes said the count   138.3523950723068
but cried anne of austria tired of these vague attacks but sire you do not tell me all that you have in your heart   104.33717035955598
said lord de winter in his turn fixing his eyes on those of milady   133.78053538840817
my wife escaped   186.5441097733181
it struck ten   115.19780909718246
athos said d artagnan i believe that were you to fall in with the devil you would conduct yourself so well that you would take him with you to heaven   132.79582220132605
to leave behind you the diamond you have on your finger   154.34217393939127
now said he that suffices begone   206.2547740408424
thus for instance don t you in the first place want a horse   161.64668228113476
he will not go today said d artagnan   139.57527256573763
this cost me on your account and mine 100 000 francs   119.72415256364927
i accuse no one sir said danglars   148.8736131517423
de villefort had this spade in his hands when he stopped close to the thicket where i was glanced round and began to dig a hole in the earth   103.94026815329325
well and what may you have to say against this name   115.29227700286718
he firmly adhered to a purpose once formed when it seemed to him to spring from conscience and to be prompted by a sense of duty   147.62851522291973
that renders it useless to get a pleurisy by too much haste   217.69768922396202
my left side still pains me   140.0798420511002
it looks very neat on a black coat buttoned up   75.468204850087
the prisoner turned pale   87.2074297992026
do you think emmanuel would oblige me   8.20632552282892
repeated beauchamp looking with amazement at the count   109.70417965746263
leave us alone then and you will enjoy a little amusement without cost to yourselves   49.74106890388697
he examined himself to see if advantage had been taken of his sleep and having found his diamond ring on his finger his purse in his pocket and his pistols in his belt he rose paid for his bottle and went out to try if he could have any better luck in his search after his lackey than he had had the night before   77.15955222762456
they both set off to the other end of the camp but as it did not cover more than a surface of five hundred feet they quickly arrived at the tent they were looking for   88.48281141978623
return to greenwich and bring them here   121.85195294147252
he had done all that was in his power and any fresh attempt would only compromise himself uselessly   83.17020308140653
what would you have me say   132.3623215356897
was i not a good ambassador in france   77.68848778160758
the day after the event she decided on leaving paris with a nun of her acquaintance   70.94797544288937
you will go to london continued the cardinal   56.61618328604248
with one word you have crushed it and i die   167.62210722347336
pardon me said he my dear baron but one of my friends the abbé busoni whom you perhaps saw pass by has just arrived in paris   151.46480790795056
all is lost   61.891748583547496
as usual the oldest women were the most decorated and the ugliest the most conspicuous   99.68859137005396
what a misfortune   43.35801728678554
i go sir said mordaunt advancing a few steps to the door by which he had entered   52.38384716854385
the old man uttered a cry and turned round   125.20010075929797
only by a single line this evening at my house let me know the arms and the hour   80.65047520086243
these four men were therefore all standing at the same time with a menacing aspect opposite to each other   135.29039256906174
only i say that if i were named madame de montpensier or the queen marie de médicis i should use less precautions than i take being simply called milady clarik   61.84239739487233
the minute hand moved on   91.72014476043603
debray was for a moment surprised but immediately recovering himself he bowed with an air which seemed to say as you please madame   73.26588246607963
it was a masonic sign caderousse had taught him   98.49863464689756
but you will see and judge for yourself   126.71260167784904
the four friends during the period of these two absences had as may well be supposed the eye on the watch the nose to the wind and the ear on the hark   85.68444954973052
to the hotel to be sure to get our baggage and horses   150.84448272154674
this lackey was my compatriot   86.67314816377592
not yet replied porthos   120.01523664776502
danglars too had recognized the bandit whose existence he would not believe when albert de morcerf mentioned him in paris   147.13053391959568
when the te deum was over the coadjutor without stopping to change his priestly dress took his way toward that old tower which he knew so well   135.97515797333307
finish mouston finish the work   38.704091770412745
but poor captain leclere what happened to him   80.53318992048767
ma foi spread that idea replied the count of monte cristo putting his foot on the velvet lined steps of his splendid carriage and that will be worth something to me among the ladies   124.4874206663132
i was passing close to the door of the captain s cabin which was half open and i saw him give the packet and letter to dantès   88.0397104166491
but i am sure that the count does not regret having once deviated from the principles he has so boldly avowed   177.61575031142837
he is dead   146.24673906969883
when we can t have one thing we invent another   136.9512293266127
it had now become a weary and almost hopeless task and had it not been for the threefold motives of honor friendship and gratitude implanted in their hearts our two travelers would have given up many a time their rides over the sand their interrogatories of the peasantry and their close inspection of faces   125.95412414936892
at this moment two women entered bringing salvers filled with ices and sherbet which they placed on two small tables appropriated to that purpose   88.1711651047555
he kept on his way at the same rate heedless about upsetting those whom he met on the road   94.11808875472987
and what does he wish   67.35684107125047
no replied dantès   19.834974989632528
for example you see these two fish   36.73011330120089
30 champs élysées   144.68236196680203
ali knows i generally smoke while i am taking my tea or coffee   72.9549153716905
having wished you all to witness the challenge he now wishes you to be present at the combat   211.71189938031443
as to fortune he had made he humble as he was an enemy of the cardinal   119.7732315148798
the headsman of bethune   94.31554466104953
at the second turn the count stopped the carriage and requested permission to withdraw leaving the vehicle at their disposal   150.68591278991778
everything goes too well porthos   147.09220505864226
it s of no importance   137.57106814012639
and in that codicil he acknowledges me   165.07970988031784
alas my boy said he human knowledge is confined within very narrow limits   88.27648635336062
said the figure   123.34799718542573
madame cried mazarin what are you about   100.18539109315877
in any case said the duke his cellar and kitchen might easily excel those of monsieur de chavigny   181.81252644014376
now we have in a dungeon about twenty feet distant and to which you descend by another stair an old abbé formerly leader of a party in italy who has been here since 1811 and in 1813 he went mad and the change is astonishing   93.0814631206167
the two friends went to the hotel de vendome   98.5781806844917
twas the first time d artagnan had ever refused a request from athos   83.02501848472073
you are going now to pay your court to her again and if this time you succeed in pleasing her in your own name and with your own face it will be much worse than before   168.98794802114068
the king danced facing the queen and every time he passed by her he devoured with his eyes those studs of which he could not ascertain the number   166.33914163082466
hate you sweet valentine exclaimed the young man   156.90929554822557
apropos what are the names of your friends   115.94734769689894
what signifies a delay of half an hour   208.14626019595988
they were just abreast of mareciana and beyond the flat but verdant island of la pianosa   79.01279932281831
observe the smallest gesture the least bit of song the least sign from any one near you   135.6173739345785
for the king   107.0404361834249
they will die before their children who will in their turn grieve for them   192.52543760357622
you are going into the garden   125.07340912105742
blaisois and mousqueton set themselves to preparing their bed which consisted of a plank and a valise   73.44030149788134
the boudoir upstairs communicated with the bedchamber by an invisible door on the staircase   144.31489803344562
it appeared very thin for the price it had cost   91.87063530854292
then all the superior officers approached him to pay their compliments m   137.44637446871093
i immediately put on the saddle and bridle to which operation he lent himself with the best grace possible   146.72060247696754
the conversation took a cheerful turn   145.86097846177174
neither am i said porthos   44.069157167322004
d artagnan keeping at some distance from his friends darted a scrutinizing glance into every carriage that appeared but saw no face with which he was acquainted   109.60205731507912
by force   63.98366592684813
you seem to forget the orders i received to conduct you safe and sound to his highness the prince   16.7820718058678
when do you want your twelve hundred francs   56.24783221150665
d artagnan only sighed   100.84149710237139
but at the mention of yanina and colonel fernand he turned so frightfully pale that every member shuddered and fixed his eyes upon him   146.90171357366876
tis an illustrious name said the lieutenant and had one day triumphal honors paid to it   123.51486625348163
my sister would be bathed in tears and fainting   88.39532861413426
no interrupted mercédès but i have seen him whom i loved on the point of murdering my son   115.22941299024725
asked d avrigny placing his hand on noirtier s shoulder   105.1064141862323
let us go to the peacock   96.68885507135212
you do not madame   121.10295565857439
the inn was full of disreputable looking people who seemed as if they were on the point of commencing some nightly expedition   120.97303379173886
but passing his hand across his forehead as if to dispel his reverie he rang the bell twice and bertuccio entered   167.90109001854847
which is a consolation   32.99535013611741
and who has filled your head with all this nonsense   123.22440092670072
speak out then say what it was   60.88608608313786
don t waste a charge   124.14827883543555
science becomes in their hands not only a defensive weapon but still more frequently an offensive one   187.00634087245896
and as d artagnan as he spoke looked at harrison the colonel imagined the toast was for himself   71.05998100294447
with all my heart returned albert   96.50286959265912
and after certain love passages much obstructed by an inconvenient husband to whom a dozen times d artagnan had made a pretence of passing a sword through his body that husband had disappeared one fine morning after furtively selling certain choice lots of wine carrying away with him money and jewels   137.85286595249664
and i hope to god that with our four lackeys we may be in sufficient number   118.55278760404211
noirtier fixed his eyes on her   170.21515031375077
i pledge you my word madam said the abbé that my intentions are good   139.99784301817004
i had no such contempt for men before   146.02936051791306
there were four or five more in the emerald which would contain about a dozen   115.61985390572787
so much the better i have a ray of hope left   162.635052298799
athos alone remained seated calm and thoughtful   161.10735060071195
you are dressed   147.76019987405687
grief could hardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of madame de saint méran   132.83159261021817
has anyone besides me seen madame de saint méran   65.31802131174476
then i have only to make arrangements for the duel said beauchamp   148.9042111267923
it was rita s father who brought his daughter s ransom in person   170.5246931463842
yes madame it is the custom not from gallantry but prudence that in time of war foreigners should be conducted to particular hôtels in order that they may remain under the eye of the government until full information can be obtained about them   82.22870173133332
yes madame he shall live said monte cristo surprised that without more emotion mercédès had accepted the heroic sacrifice he made for her   102.20968395166018
de tréville would doubtless give him good advice as to the whole affair   90.78753512587019
on reaching the top of the bank she slipped and fell upon her knees   147.05055377932615
do you wish a step or some place in the government   52.154760645143114
lucien looked at her for a moment in silence   106.57879957936278
and beg m   68.9639782533619
the month passed and morrel made extraordinary efforts to get in all his resources   120.45924828139222
but fortunately this was not the case and the governor left him convinced that the poor madman for whom in his heart he felt a kind of affection was only troubled with a slight indisposition   116.84909983656311
valentine kissed the old man who looked at her with such tenderness that her eyes again filled with tears whose sources he thought must be exhausted   120.32788839115436
but soon thou dost afford thy hand to lead them on   18.351360898242206
léon d armilly twenty years of age   30.097336203480083
what an awakening for the parisians   116.11954595272022
but said the countess breathlessly with her eyes fixed on monte cristo whose arm she convulsively pressed with both hands we are friends are we not   166.8783675227578
my dear fellow said debray you have come in the nick of time   56.135775135567506
but traitors to england are no longer members of my family   44.399860564750625
then some words were spoken by the two women   18.12015221300814
inquired he   59.31920286044196
it is quite immaterial to me said monte cristo and it was very unnecessary to disturb me at the opera for such a trifle   94.77073045514167
the last raised his eyes to ascertain doubtless that neither his companions nor himself had been watched and in spite of the darkness he perceived gondy   118.18289215494876
i do not know where she is or whither they have conducted her   95.38184444194532
ah said the captain we have still too much canvas set   40.96920551665157
there was a fourth gash in which a long table knife was plunged up to the handle   155.91697973448936
and so my dear count said d artagnan his eminence didn t actually insist on our attending him   113.40602289357692
no one knows what there is   53.14134930423923
perhaps with regard to you they are immaterial but i should be no artist if i had not some fancies   21.285664285583195
where then   99.19691619163878
she then had a fit which i took to be simply a nervous attack and it was only when i saw her raise herself in the bed and her limbs and neck appear stiffened that i became really alarmed   51.64300191547218
i entreat you doctor   61.30408053508873
the rest of mademoiselle eugénie s person was in perfect keeping with the head just described   73.58178917139395
i was once very fond of it but i do not indulge now   138.89376225579724
de tréville smiled at this flourish   88.38803629631015
d artagnan determined upon his course   150.32865033724792
he would never think of faring in the same manner as his master   181.47719922600663
the count with a smile of profound tenderness extended his hand and she carried it to her lips   142.5738911303006
in the first place said athos let us leave this chamber   105.58063460885404
bonacieux my punishment is drawing to a close   128.25063657423203
villefort had never been so concise and eloquent   119.59685370695063
oh do not be alarmed   131.80736567803268
noirtier evidently intends making me his heir   153.62013593366805
a tear moistened the eye of the phlegmatic englishman   128.43261869867257
and the good fortune which occurred to me monsieur might have enabled you to dispense with a duty which in its discharge confers an undoubtedly great honor   94.498945903675
what i think astonishing is that you should expect my coming   68.80950059619957
that is to say in the immediate vicinity of the chamber hired by d artagnan a circumstance which appeared to furnish a happy augury for the success of his journey   116.94310392482384
murmured the girl leave me my mother   119.75397262759842
they this time embraced heartily and without retaining any malice   59.103758778958166
i will denounce this place of infamy   149.3853312622539
then he returned hastily shut his door carefully and began to study like a clever architect the plan andrea had left him   146.0449938662932
we started a stag of ten branches   116.42217828341829
he who presumed to be a rival of yours for which he was severely punished   166.14409931648927
and how he terrified them even then and made them fly before him   111.7844215303757
but before setting out he reflected that for a lad of intelligence and experience he was in a singular predicament since he was proceeding toward uncertainty and leaving certainty behind him   45.48102894053399
certain   175.54245184796244

he had realized the plan he had imagined beforehand whose picturing had produced the smiles we noted upon his face   122.82851489680323
haydée answered his remark with a melancholy smile   111.05142946516752

is it possible you were so kind   136.27409986438164

on my word of honor said athos one must be either a mazarinist or a frondeur   122.33753190977289

here madame danglars instead of being calmed by the soft picture uttered a groan and fainted   117.25218860112993
and in passing as she was thirsty she drank what remained in the glass   88.75585618518356
unable to have me for your wife you will content yourself with having me for your friend and sister   120.12134470956245
mercédès came again and she found him so altered that she was even more anxious than before to have him taken to her own home   153.47404347802086
meanwhile the president carelessly opened the letter which had been brought to him   144.28186904833012
you think the count will be angry with me   114.57909670449799
he murmured in a low voice as he concluded his sentence   113.62104919436706
let us go down   120.87284224804098
if false let him be shot   145.1770345876849
such was the picturesque costume of the person who rang at the gate and demanded if it was not at no   157.99997103046456
replied d artagnan you care little if she kills buckingham or causes him to be killed   138.07840345265876

ma foi said the jeweller drenched with rain i am not destined to return to beaucaire tonight   117.48679888520753
what have i to fear   179.02183978363013
this secret which he possessed this woman whom he loved   145.0430521815859
and pray how did you acquire all these honors   126.84479983886742
do as i bade you cried the commissary and preserve absolute secrecy   82.44756297118838
she would not be weary thank god   157.61902666866598
this time i too saw them said porthos   96.27864126672435
aramis obeyed   88.57467547566318
bernouin came into the room   130.16751634733055
but this time our gascon saw at a glance all the advantage to be derived from the love which kitty had just confessed so innocently or so boldly the interception of letters addressed to the comte de wardes news on the spot entrance at all hours into kitty s chamber which was contiguous to her mistress s   82.56791222893398
said richelieu surprised   52.72043266297634
run   176.48843783697177
then he came back to the point where perhaps he ought to have begun and that was to knock at the door against which the stranger had leaned   157.5388061982459
a magnificent cavalier remarked mazarin   42.66613773856774
said the valet in the same carriage as your majesties   125.04647811013359
project gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify do copyright research on transcribe and proofread works not protected by u   132.51725135055835
still said the governor i believe it will be requisite notwithstanding your certainty and not that i doubt your science but in discharge of my official duty that we should be perfectly assured that the prisoner is dead   101.24316442361452
how not having been able to sleep for the joy he felt in the expectation of seeing his majesty he had gone to his three friends three hours before the hour of audience   174.78250314372562
present arms   175.3839069505642
of taste continued franz gravely   136.2390769537149
does your excellency happen to be hungry   36.903559547559524
yes he used to drink a great deal replied porthos   201.40390583817603
you think yourself well informed because the telegraph has told you three days after the landing the usurper has landed at cannes with several men   133.57137572894268
exactly my daughter   82.2306751193267
my offers did not arouse him did not even tempt him   150.5130515821512
d artagnan could not help perceiving that something more than usual was passing in the mind of his lackey and said well monsieur planchet what is the matter with us now   50.647032410698294
no from tréport   27.950709683753388
do you perchance think i set any great store by life   89.3349606403448
you might some time ago have looked upon this resolution as a vague project but today you see it was a reality and you must submit to it under penalty of breaking your word   122.88992687209365
i felt his blood gush over my face but i was intoxicated i was delirious and the blood refreshed instead of burning me   155.5092415690744
if your majesty desires it said laporte my sons like myself are at the queen s service   65.05248028990306
i believe near marseilles   144.1256635720925
all that the prudent planchet had said to him the preceding evening about the sinister character of the old man recurred to the mind of d artagnan who looked at him with more attention than he had done before   119.23563099316135
oh yes returned monte cristo   111.58453464785794
that makes ten days   124.65506687930457
yield you yield to me do you not   106.2234965237659
perhaps he has discovered some mine said madame danglars   104.35050654645832
you have no longer a weapon   129.50389434460175
that of marignan just at the point where one of my forefathers is offering his sword to francis i   122.2244045444559
to my misfortune to my eternal misfortune   127.93632706356422
aramis aramis   9.661522850174237
but lord montrose replied the queen i have heard of his great and rapid successes of battles gained   78.7424294600055
if they should hear of the separation ah yes   151.34859072730816
let us speak french my father said he to the jesuit   178.83634596740467
mazarin has been listening to discover whether i betrayed him   83.72982667326052
arrived in london you will seek buckingham   151.28087950715053
at this moment my mother seized me in her arms and hurrying noiselessly along numerous turnings and windings known only to ourselves she arrived at a private staircase of the kiosk where was a scene of frightful tumult and confusion   67.11821264518079
it shall be as you wish madame said villefort   171.30941231927326
thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard cavalcanti pronounce these words tomorrow sir i shall have the honor of waiting upon you on business   184.2948062321574
why has he not painted a spot upon his heart   133.38185692560836
donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks online payments and credit card donations   105.76449389760997
she tried to replace the arm but it moved with a frightful rigidity which could not deceive a sick nurse   166.7477503634978
as the doctors entered the street they saw a man in a cassock standing on the threshold of the next door   40.54721211979924
you will thank me for what   138.24578545576935
but he with his wonted prudence had mingled with the crowd   95.27761048722682
she had married a younger brother of the family who had left her a widow with one child   119.75574804599691
well well dandré said louis xviii   115.22436163921749
the cardinal writes better than i thought   110.1759867869493
d artagnan was too good a swordsman to trifle with his opponent   122.01511064828668
the name he pronounced in a voice of tenderness amounting almost to love was that of haydée   182.21926760411895
it appears to have been an apoplectic stroke   147.7466599630119
mazarin after this half humble half gallant attention went away   136.01393897845273
cried a hostler running out and looking after the stranger monsieur here is a paper which dropped out of your hat   93.21193841716439
said the stranger becoming attentive he put his hand upon his pocket while pronouncing the name of monsieur de tréville   99.42338841961897
and you reply   32.654565370698634
but a reinforcement having come up the assailants had been put to flight and the leader had taken refuge in the hotel next to his lodgings   176.10760586219612
cavalcanti was evidently embarrassed   90.50387686364611
come in my lord said philip in a low tone and i will show you something droll   49.40003076041148
his wife visited for him and this was the received thing in the world where the weighty and multifarious occupations of the magistrate were accepted as an excuse for what was really only calculated pride a manifestation of professed superiority in fact the application of the axiom pretend to think well of yourself and the world will think well of you an axiom a hundred times more useful in society nowadays than that of the greeks know thyself a knowledge for which in our days we have substituted the less difficult and more advantageous science of knowing others   71.28553817175667
why should you threaten me with death cried i when i have already declared my innocence   164.96351297538976
but in returning thither last night when fortunately you did not accompany him as his carriage was crossing the rue de la ferronnerie his guards insulted the people who began to abuse them   130.40326387701563
ladies said the officer do not disturb yourselves   129.45436662378935
you have dukes for friends a marshal of france for godfather a prince of the blood as commander and on the day of your return you have been received by two queens   120.29804651494621
but with such men it is not the sword that should be employed   127.23452103037265
for heaven s sake where is that   82.43922024302563
the king turned quickly around with tears in his eyes and heart   146.44912876496747
where is it then   161.28515339671435
but where is your master   120.95771753764026
they stopped him at the door   89.43025346351594
well said porthos to aramis we must do something   121.57800511387174
so we opened the bird and this time all special symptoms had disappeared there were only general symptoms   128.7484053137014
i am your majesty s body and soul and however far i may be from you however inferior may be my position i believe i have discovered a means of extricating your majesty from your trouble   111.14969658253402
the doctor could therefore measure neither the direction nor the depth of it   112.8126264596594
the chancellor reddened and stammered some words   143.28260362845293
exclaimed caderousse fifty thousand francs   71.33116257752897
how can you for an instant entertain so unworthy a thought dear valentine   118.83806681285253
nevertheless it was plain the letter came from milady   157.37223585119767
and if death be my lot i hope to die for the king for royalty and for god   157.85916250692875
franz now listened to it for the third time   55.82948564401999
said aramis smiling   110.97430611146594
and what may that be   130.42382503919282
read she said   87.9163644787687
remember that the queen awaits you and after the queen the cardinal and after the cardinal myself   14.576331843747482
i won t ask anything more of you   161.42155364198118
why i think there were not many intruders   35.49600558944054
in two bounds he was at the louvre   183.92506147760866
i must return to the minister s   126.14484086685738
to delay it a single day would be in my eyes now to commit a fresh offense   59.680393160799454
my prince   143.85843156694068
will that do   61.28200846459475
they sat down in such a manner as to turn their backs on nobody   100.56223611838084
then as in leaving the cabaret they took different directions my brother went and hid himself on the road of the catholic and i on that of the huguenot   174.05905004641704
cried the countess extending her hand to him with all the warmth and cordiality of an old acquaintance   71.81837757650095
you are madame s brother i learn be it so   93.99625542811701
the dog obeyed and jumped quickly over the cane   140.9092223807527
they were in the marvellous dining room before described where the statues had baskets on their heads always filled with fruits and flowers   138.05207554469243
i could not ride behind   140.72457976707517
his thirst had abated   165.42489256906032
patrick soon caught the sound of his master s voice calling his falcon   84.32676576975412
beauchamp chapter 85   90.7037859197184
then as he departed he fixed his eyes upon the gloomy prison   169.505655494125
conclusion   42.45353676774269
emmanuel julie farewell   82.8816909883059
external existence then resembles a sleep of which this thought is the dream   114.96728771223253
because nothing can save you   81.15824521608941
i relate and i will repeat before the count what i have said to you   41.922952203938976
there is the great the distressing truth   134.83097908265336
at this instant the second door opened and the young girl her eyes bathed with tears appeared   85.99334055125533
once for all sir replied the baroness sharply i tell you i will not hear cash named   157.40994420940683
and he rushed out of the room still crying edward edward   78.11138722530404
the aperture was already sufficiently large for him to enter but by waiting he could still cling to hope and retard the certainty of deception   69.49134243799554
in an instant they found themselves in a little harbor formed in a natural creek   94.5638109795186
replied porthos i am what i am   103.19469068674938
you are like debray and yet it seems to me that when the minister is out of spirits the opposition ought to be joyous   92.83363185741754
coquenard had seen everything   68.4897997944548
porthos knocked at the door of a house to the right whilst d artagnan knocked at the door of a house to the left   170.21659065595867
he had become lieutenant in a regiment composed entirely of corsicans   140.83848130716945
it will be happier i think than ours has been   131.65745180851567
my name is mordaunt replied the young man bowing   118.85919428877571
a single word had reminded her that morrel was expecting her in m   89.03111858432274
by the faith of a gentleman   68.31871613847473
well now said athos triumphantly i swear to you my friend by the god who hears us i believe that there is a power watching over us and that we shall all four see france again   54.34093579498339
i heard it from friquet   124.01458267680455
it is you who with that mandate obtained the pasha s ring which gave you authority over selim the fire keeper   40.462583616168644
la ramee   186.12109515906016
well oh speak speak doctor   149.42475686009098
it was necessary to separate   142.0774795956175
gaetano sprang to shore exchanged a few words with the sentinel then his comrades disembarked and lastly came franz   155.8560889890801
said la ramee scratching his head   123.34258836607786
have you business there   142.27751537993373
oh no answered caderousse that was not my reason i can assure you   63.104315249394816
he leaped with planchet into the boat and five minutes after they were on board   64.33623215685728
that which we can not obtain   37.88415302153447
i have made him a spy upon his wife   128.51695488193963
possibly continued aramis came toward me accompanied by five or six men who followed about ten paces behind him   168.12098048484796
you demanded a favor   101.72904033579402
without communicating his thoughts to his companion he sat down drew out his opera glass and looked another way   82.30279081070677
as yet he could form no definite plan   113.65520574273157
at last said he i shall know with whom i have to do   94.23359601646393
they say that it is quite fair and that sowing so much red you ought to reap a little blue   6.819787748456093
besides the same thing had occurred often before   108.93158320625862
cried the host if the lackey has drunk only half as much as the master i am a ruined man   151.51765942025045
they descended into the plain by the ladder   21.556909454938605
which he did with the conscientiousness that d artagnan carried into everything   68.34302471430101
alas it shows how little notion you can have of all it has cost me to effect a purpose so unexpectedly frustrated that you talk of beginning over again   76.10784038570213
what matters it if you avoid them   79.35907267540838
nothing can be easier than to comply with your excellency s wish said the landlord opening the door of the chamber   66.4500621948746
the people were infuriated   19.251401068732108
holland loved her and she responded to his love   134.76736063973738
athos took the purse and threw it into the hand of the coachman   174.64398416103506
he gave us some very fine horses   85.17425983347609
i never caution my servants a second time remember that   42.57800574209725
the count seized it hastily his eyes immediately fell upon the epigraph and he read thou shalt tear out the dragons teeth and shall trample the lions under foot saith the lord   128.5254144940879
it was one of the results of mazarin s niggardliness   140.0471886714869
silence whispered the duke she has her reasons   129.130060585179
my friend said andrea i was coming from mortefontaine to senlis when my horse which is a troublesome creature stumbled and threw me   201.02956423498244
albert cast his eyes on the passport then raised them in astonishment to beauchamp   101.42407418911941
he then descended but it was only when he felt his foot touch the ground that he was satisfied of his safety   172.7521231214934
totally disregarding the business of the stage he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the beauty of each pretty woman aided by a powerful opera glass   196.35865401723112
has he perceived anything   125.88954498228605
the blows which he received increased greatly his esteem and friendship for monsieur de tréville   84.11978697371241
bertuccio made amends however by loading the antechambers staircases and mantle pieces with flowers   132.18158672639055
dear grandfather   85.40052881943454
yes yes that was her name   113.62678681806305
as to the wounded man he had been taken in at once and as we have said in a very bad state   96.36461445783067
athos made him a sign to go to d artagnan s residence and bring back some clothes   95.31377121820165
well this is just what amuses me said monte cristo   151.91094299941346
but it would have been more seemly not upon the scaffold   93.37510541997253
he approached the hole he had dug and now with the aid of the torch saw that his pickaxe had in reality struck against iron and wood   141.33689313071343
he wrote the same day for the required information to m   125.94109530485237
is there any answer   145.04901041658457
ah is it you count   174.93867395331142
no said caderousse no   11.717546117662152
on our return to france she had a young woman who was attached to one of her opponents poisoned in the convent of the augustines at bethune   200.8656665182455
d artagnan scratched his ear   101.16614425748536
we have been forestalled   138.2466590080226
since lord de winter left him i am distracted sirs   67.56274034385146
they may hear us   107.0764495808969
0145m no sire he replied i alighted at the hotel de madrid in the rue de tournon   195.52324329975278
the chairs were of ancient workmanship and materials   100.05840273937713
for more than a month past the mischievous child who knew not what to wish for had taken it into his head to have a monkey   152.8493382214801
this gentleman asks me for information which common politeness will not permit me to refuse   20.915490546613896
i will return soon to learn the result of your trip   188.88245601451183
well these boards you hear unloaded are the posts and planks to build my scaffold   91.3013715130995
valentine replied the young man deeply affected i will not say you are all i love in the world for i dearly prize my sister and brother in law   136.2037037511019
but now about the middle of the rue des petits champs they were stopped by a second patrol   154.326063431441
well be on our side now resumed aramis   95.2050173212221
raoul i seem to read your future destiny as through a cloud   91.08201385993789
the man with the torch complied although not asked in the most polite terms   175.78542158059452
besides each individual had one or two others for whom he was interested   146.26885987885814
money   168.87613057417136
i was replied the procureur   52.7283038229333
then the iron hearted man felt his heart swell in his breast   171.8073288024893
cavalcanti the five hundred thousand francs you promise for my dowry   120.2964072749285
that is very annoying said the brigadier   65.28891216752007
but having received the signal that i might rest for an hour here he glanced at the sun dial for there was everything in the enclosure of montlhéry even a sun dial and having ten minutes before me and my strawberries being ripe when a day longer by the by sir do you think dormice eat them   88.77567744013052
for it is not pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his duty   191.73969077542893
the mob dispersed   121.06027937435506
oh if you do know him cried julie can you tell us where he is where we can find him   126.37075562705583
had preserved a great number of friends and these added to the personages whom the usages of society gave villefort a claim on formed a considerable body   152.5782600131544
olivain take care of our horses and give me my sword   52.60953144762264
then tell the men to be in readiness don t tell them why now   101.70670078614545
the duke received them and they informed him that they were resolved not to pay this tax even if they were obliged to defend themselves against its collectors by force of arms   109.96213010747476
the music of william tell is so sweet   65.80570261388111
we shall be a small party only yourself my mother and i   214.62136052557432
the explosion soon followed   134.17347881899164
the young man then entered the apartment of aramis   104.41314828436914
yes i do so bid you answered morrel it is your duty   139.85998603210209
which would not perhaps have been a great misfortune in time of war seeing that it is nothing but a nest of huguenots but which is in time of peace a frightful example   59.94844319133753
albert and beauchamp parted the last pressure of their hands expressing what their tongues could not before a stranger   130.4538174288771
when they were gone morrel ventured out from under the trees and the moon shone upon his face which was so pale it might have been taken for that of a ghost   112.54076423110233
i will lay a wager that twas that saint christopher porthos who performed this feat   114.23265766338804
athos turned pale and laid his hand on his heart   199.92637924789233
exploring however one of the side wings of the gallery after making a sign to porthos to explore the other he saw all at once at his left a tub containing an orange tree which had been pushed out of its place and in its place an open aperture   110.11074645565301
certainly the air of that dungeon was very provocative of appetite   214.91749617207716
milady on the contrary was quite conversant with all aristocratic intrigues amid which she had constantly lived for five or six years   106.90567586952328
cried milady seeing that on this point as on the other lord de winter seemed well instructed   81.53023662128192
cried d artagnan i can manage so that her majesty will receive me well   115.20032200049313
say no more of that madame said felton   81.13481380786854
milady knew the rest   61.37452177232014
cried all the witnesses of this scene   30.725055662663593
see what an exordium   124.9578555352177
besides he understands that in my position i can not plead against the poor   27.629923423276537
why that he might not have the trouble of returning to beaucaire   146.93701566264298
in a few moments the young girl had attracted the attention of the whole house and even the occupants of the boxes leaned forward to scrutinize her magnificent diamonds   175.20454084794454
on perceiving the musketeer he uttered an exclamation that was almost a cry of despair   38.73222075243606
the boat was now moving with the wind   179.16047839361266
the prince who had a great repugnance to treat with such an ill bred fellow made out a list against the grain and sent it   115.95322708639476
tell him that after his departure one of them came up to me and took from me by violence the safe conduct which he had given me   51.54518728579572
chapter lxxxv   90.5363909522096
capitally replied m   14.691835488975258
at eight o clock the march was resumed in the same order as the night before except that d artagnan left his friends and began to renew the acquaintance which he had already struck up with monsieur groslow   176.3934675787699
a very great nobleman but whether maltese or sicilian i can not exactly say   57.40325601055541
i will do better than that said albert   90.48107969433126
i did indeed charge him with a commission the result of which he must tell me   169.55518610961593
i do not care where i live said kitty provided i am well concealed and nobody knows where i am   164.7475968906342
the executioner thought that he had abandoned him and fell back groaning upon his bed   151.69128419581497
sick of the smallpox at his age   114.17804303532357
it will take a little longer time and may make a greater disturbance but you will be outside with swords and will rush in at the proper time   75.11517209104258
the boy undertook the commission promising to be in frosinone in less than an hour   102.08884092866809
now climb up athos quickly said d artagnan   127.75703936337577
does that satisfy you   81.8698714984781
what do you mean by the pure parliament   90.30650923180826
the count repeated eugénie as though it had not occurred to her to observe him sooner   160.1539379746536
is this then a campaign upon which we are now entering   181.5005585899964
they were thus perpetually employed faria that he might not see himself grow old   171.09159108522832
he never gave advice but when it was asked and even then he required to be asked twice   82.39747897211605
milady finding her thoughts betrayed dug her nails into her flesh to subdue every emotion that might give to her face any expression except agony   104.04739033192736
but you understand that if the young man should want a few thousands more do not advance it   122.16299081137466
and on the 5th of september at eleven o clock the hand of the clock pointed to eleven i shall come to receive the money   124.08629895371969
i would rather die a hundred times oh yes die   56.85602275949361
and for you aramis who always abstracted by your theological studies inspire your servant bazin a mild religious man with a profound respect   148.33653272846058
at thirsk replied harrison   139.23049639966672
had ever lived and that he had perished on the scaffold   73.81103195436864
then one could enjoy charming little dinners where one touches on one side the hand of a friend and on the other the foot of a mistress   140.58511645089078
is there any crime in this request   114.81007593532772
yes my dear the abduction is an accomplished fact replied eugénie   45.93665413051285
how many people thought he and not one true friend   132.68907556329964
in three days m   111.22827266377237
my son said the king to aramis do not take it so to heart   158.20133348808176
he thought they were fighting   109.42571657069495
and you i ve only thrown the fellow down but hark   111.2798348684174
these were the first words he had spoken   142.39763789317527
she was thinking of the despair of maximilian when he should be informed that madame de saint méran instead of being an ally was unconsciously acting as his enemy   133.441828399773
reflect that i am your wife   107.22228283965464
we must go said the superb lord of bracieux lest they should say we were afraid   95.20268587128206
at first like you he seemed distressed   67.29411680338895
two varieties of demons chapter lxiii   129.97437559248823
hair black eyes black   177.55981991523936
and then he was called fernand   89.36443958507176
you said that his majesty king charles my august consort had been condemned to death by a majority of his subjects   45.88857646068857
franz albert and the count continued to descend the corso   133.41269236714186
inquired the guest as caderousse placed before him the bottle of wine and a glass   89.24852962313776
you ask what god is doing   133.0185470384543
groslow on the question being interpreted answered three without counting myself   228.93689717623917
has something fresh happened   147.47097599182533
in fact they saw the soldiers running to their arms   71.68248028901974
his house   131.27881193351064
these are the ideas that render your nation superior to any other returned monte cristo   188.06827091981418
yes sir although i assure you the refusal is as painful for me to give as it is for you to receive for i had reckoned on the honor of your alliance and the breaking off of a marriage contract always injures the lady more than the gentleman   85.57222240378296
asked mazarin supporting his elbows on his desk and his chin on his hands   90.0730906529441
here after a short conference they proposed to separate   150.9218363416726
instantly a mask wearing the well known costume of a peasant woman snatched his moccoletto from him without his offering any resistance   211.31945968461207
her first movement was repellent   120.23788080255598
chapter 17   51.70804221124432
and what did you understand by what we said   80.27880954918206
dragoons swiss guardsmen musketeers light horsemen succeeded one another with a rapidity which might answer the purpose of the host very well but agreed badly with the views of the four friends   176.52050954738678
his complexion was brilliant and beautiful   106.59140547051072
guiche summoned one of his grooms and delivering the prisoner into his charge with orders to shoot him through the head if he attempted to escape he leaped from his horse and approached raoul   170.56727935046396
tell him that among these four men two only are to be feared d artagnan and athos   85.79422781440034
then you were wrong to refuse to dine with him   106.94482761177997
what a horrible face that monk has said de guiche   71.14395728422491
chance did everything   146.57632670936857
the next day he died   82.76763553708382
sup then and make as little noise as possible said the priest for i too have been on the go all day and shall not be sorry to sleep to night   106.1078718256936
but this planchet is so serious and important that i have not informed my friends that i would entrust this secret to you   79.05735027258814
hers had been accomplished   154.00094894375232
ah assunta cried i you are an excellent woman and heaven will bless you   98.88374920786688
well then said mordaunt i choose for my adversary the man who not thinking himself worthy to be called comte de la fere calls himself athos   162.9785168263611
bread and salt chapter 72   128.87746443494257
but d artagnan whose ideas had taken quite another course forgot himself like a fool and answered gallantly that it was too late to think about duels and sword thrusts   26.020269616488065
they want to arrest master broussel   141.91144844397076
then you speak german also   76.57742134348281
what the devil are you doing here   70.6231438308242
we made signals of distress she perceived us made for us and took us all on board   69.67308090738683
the quick eager glance of la carconte followed him as he ascended while caderousse on the contrary turned his back and seemed most anxiously to avoid even glancing at him   142.36532258151473
but he simply heard the sound of the bolts sliding in their copper rings   145.05135168920276
i shall go he said to the queen   209.74972394447207
quite possible sir   84.29669214722588
the abominable creature murmured d artagnan   129.53362000091468
de salvieux who recommends him to me i entreat your majesty to receive him graciously   108.02955949962326
said milady with a last doubt   102.95798192379263
athos opened it and began by drawing forth a little note written in these terms my dear count when one travels and especially for three months one never has a superfluity of money   6.79819501557364
my dear albert said debray rising it is half past two   128.54272881434818
i did not understand   149.365668142184
d artagnan checked him by a glance from the corner of his eye   152.38505217408584
it is my mistress you love   163.65422195889408
i held the horses my hands were full your honor   116.09570028299352
i don t know yet   138.99830251706973
yes said porthos recollecting himself but one uniform and one sword will not suffice for two   90.14158991133567
exclaimed the englishman   72.58971299700727
this time said athos first breaking the silence d artagnan has given us an excellent program and the letter must be written at once   104.41733957123512
they were replied mordaunt   94.20822117071987
they told me it was 4 500 francs   126.36210472459071
dressed as aramis had been the night before the bishop got into his carriage and the former more disguised by his pallor and sad countenance than his deacon s dress got in by his side   173.93520818537462
if you could see my heart said d artagnan you would there read so much curiosity that you would pity me and so much love that you would instantly satisfy my curiosity   82.87946207544601
he has followed us several times as i think when i have waited for my wife at the wicket of the louvre to escort her home   132.1079951152036
it is very well for you who risk your life every day but for me who only did so once we gather from all this baron that captain morrel saved your life   111.21168242862045
0257m perhaps said one of the previous speakers as he was a churchman they may go to some expense in his behalf   189.6327844419606
at length one by one all the noises in the neighborhood ceased   127.0209767074615
you arrive in good time monsieur said the king who when his passions were raised to a certain point could not dissemble   119.89341053327756
monsieur the comte de la fere he cried i supplicate you   177.50155198230036
a high wall surrounded the whole of the property surmounted at intervals by vases filled with flowers and broken in the centre by a large gate of gilded iron which served as the carriage entrance   151.67869847194044
the island of monte cristo   115.004324021972
at the door they found the old servant   159.9111289733939
tell me his name and i will put it in the place of the name of charlotte backson   69.61692871865883
from time to time parry stopped thinking the king whose eyes were closed was really asleep but charles would open his eyes and say with a smile go on my good parry i am listening   121.13218868688585
to ask for an engagement at the opera   93.38653570515194
a short gallop brought them to the road of chaillot   112.35657673953924
two days will be a different thing said danglars smiling   102.39702021909135
but this castle then   152.86698801479065
the abbé fixed on him a searching penetrating glance   198.49227560150985
the fact was that emery s son had run a great chance of being suffocated one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him until he gave up all the gold he had swallowed   102.38762518956418
d artagnan tore open the envelope of the letter   79.75567048779678
who talks of killing dantès   177.6122120771821
and is her name a secret   120.35881753010896
i really never met with one woman so ready to do justice to the charms of another as yourself responded lucien raising his lorgnette to his eye   70.88792273889794
hark ye my friend i have disobeyed my first order but i will not disobey the second   11.21504717255118
but how could you charge a nubian to purchase a house and a mute to furnish it   50.78666149813215
it was saddled and bridled   199.20575807915301
coquenard was not less affected by it on her part for she added my cousin will not return if he finds that we do not treat him kindly   117.2194858351966
he wished to display his authority   168.9593930783424
i also replied mercédès am going and i acknowledge i had depended on your accompanying me   99.13420586128402
la porte s memoirs   109.11529948998455
athos paused   61.15902571044796
i can pass as one of the sailors wrecked last night   128.64719969109677
the last movement of the heart ceased the face became livid the eyes remained open but the eyeballs were glazed   141.54996284654982
bertuccio is alone in the world   159.29802925083118
why did he not tell them he knew nothing about this affair   160.45635634179231
we will walk back and forth   102.37917064964978
i quite understand why you ask sir said eugénie making a sign that her father might be seated and in fact your two questions suggest fully the theme of our conversation   94.51051331307602
happily d artagnan was not yet acquainted with such niceties   87.82933978051673
this time as he was well attended he looked at them sternly and made a sign with his eye and hand for d artagnan to follow him   139.2334878009463
a positive feast   96.78907185053865
my lord answered de chavigny with a low bow i have on the ramparts twenty pieces of artillery and in my casemates thirty thousand guns   149.7476241903306
he despises all honors and contents himself with those written on his passport   51.58439082368421
this letter told buckingham that the city was at an extremity   88.16699644620098
you may therefore comprehend that being of no country asking no protection from any government acknowledging no man as my brother not one of the scruples that arrest the powerful or the obstacles which paralyze the weak paralyzes or arrests me   74.85523122838472
orders had just been given to the royal guards and the swiss guards not only to stand firm but to send out patrols to the streets of saint denis and saint martin where the people thronged and where they were the most vociferous when the mayor of paris was announced at the palais royal   128.7541430188156
groslow then having given the sailor on duty an order to be on the watch with more than usual vigilance went down into the longboat and soon reached greenwich   114.0398844211992
by what sign to morrow shall we be able to distinguish friends from foes   81.42048076244869
to obey in every particular the man to whom this letter is addressed   115.4118374423342
porthos had bicarat and aramis found himself opposed to two adversaries   74.87297089868969
the lantern was placed on the ground the two adversaries took their stations and the duel began   110.62920573280327
but if your eminence wishes it we will discontinue the permission   96.1779980809205
the sentinel who was relieved at six o clock in the morning remembered perfectly that just as he was taking his post a few minutes past four a young man arrived on horseback with a little boy before him   40.605157348877796
and perhaps perhaps everything is for the best   67.678588195246
an instant after bazin made his appearance at the door   123.6813995154429
but you say she is english   81.44791774132715
it has been made up a long time said gondy   192.0113624331663
the notary left the room backwards and bowing down to the ground   113.08758785417183
d artagnan smiled but made no answer   92.4238057952397
that is unreasonable said athos saluting in his turn the two cavaliers   74.61649435678291
and they walked on again   106.34860033078103
he still felt the same self satisfaction which he had experienced the previous evening and which had procured him so good a night s rest   168.30736001388098
if that young man should be appointed to a regiment what would his guardian say   101.02979230493182
are our lackeys sufficiently devoted to us to risk their lives for us   56.8358849260772
for a dealer perhaps   163.86165490836206
he wishes to have you in his service   117.02008932540497
we can not say   38.095946943009665
he drew near to the window and placing himself so that a ray of light should fall upon the letter as he held it he drew it from his pocket and read it again   123.99701408815396
for we four we once did condemn judge and slay a human being whom we had not any right to cut off from this world although apparently fitter for hell than for this life   149.09784030243134
the king was seated in the same place where the duke had left him   148.50413290143317
the crisis was terrible and a rigid form with twisted limbs swollen eyelids and lips flecked with bloody foam lay on the bed of torture in place of the intellectual being who so lately rested there   157.52591197642911
now say if i conceal anything from you   128.83109340185956
are you authorized by her majesty to communicate it to me   83.19491085461154
franz likes all that is eccentric   151.82198549103578
dearest exclaimed valentine with her adorable smile awake and look at me   65.93408145510861
as for albert he was busily occupied throwing bouquets at a carriage full of roman peasants that was passing near him   82.18192281572848
although milady would very willingly have gone without sleep sustained as she was by all the excitements which a new adventure awakened in her heart ever thirsting for intrigues she nevertheless accepted the offer of the superior   121.92327867399841
that sets my mind at rest   115.62976723208973
nothing was to be heard but oaths and blasphemies   206.5373832705631
morrel passed his hand over his brow   78.53669875696608
some of these boats were dark and mysterious others noisy and lighted up with torches   66.74288423441956
i can not comprehend what induced you to buy three   179.49697685169969
indeed i fear it replied andrea in the tone in which he had heard dorante or valère reply to alceste21 at the théâtre français   55.38357053068827
stop stop   60.69689730254074
he is a maltese   73.79969305208073
follow my advice swear and do not insult   92.79405060610853
and that running footman who waited at the door and that carriage with a coachman in grand livery who sat waiting on his seat   76.53071553313183
on a court   90.93440629563146
morrel had stepped back as morcerf approached and remained at a short distance   75.97775521049832
then he felt that he was still being carried with great rapidity over the same country thickly strewn with broken aqueducts which looked like granite giants petrified while running a race   155.12429683856593
and in justice it must be allowed that she supported her rank becomingly   186.7804407891628
valentine fetched a dictionary which she placed on a desk before noirtier   110.06472223629902
the abbess looked at her for an instant with uneasiness as if a fresh thought suggested itself to her mind   89.67392967470278
this letter was so important that it made them forsake their cards and their dice on the drumhead   138.18231097168274
that s all right said the man   122.95237526485175
i would then rather die   58.510226435691074
he my thief   155.35370487516508
the more profoundly she wounded his heart the more certainly he would avenge her   135.01080927803065
well then answered aramis pray tell me a day or two beforehand that i may take that opportunity of going to paris   157.69446993421712
madame de longueville was one of the highest ladies in the realm   90.82177342579027
there he is   68.14776206864212
and while reclining on the banks of his highness s pieces of water i slipped a few lines into his fish ponds   4.675000324936192
but i am speaking to you   112.95201782475434
he might be thirty   109.9480661851028
we couldn t leave our prisoners could we   147.5201121631503
danglars as well as the rest   234.28867663254223
to make you two costumes between now and tomorrow   156.48448520887925
proof of this crime will be found on arresting him for the letter will be found upon him or at his father s or in his cabin on board the pharaon   88.98286892312379
that would be to charge monsieur de séguier the keeper of the seals with this mission   140.4848279223801
the baroness returned the salute in the most smiling and graceful manner   194.13644037375423
i ask you if you recognize him   141.91910625274187
a man like danglars was wholly inaccessible to any gentler method of correction   131.58423115027156
indeed it is after so long a separation   106.94370384214301
what to me were all the treasures in the world or all the kings of the earth   136.81104561100827
she opened her eyes looked around her with terror saw that the apartment was empty and that she was alone with her liberator   155.96509783454042
porthos made no remark but obeyed with the sublime confidence he had in his friend   178.01030804848
d artagnan offered to lower the blinds of the royal carriage but the young king stretched out his arm saying no sir   93.1668155920996
it is i shouted a voice   138.5550366210739
but immediately through this opening twenty more shots were fired and the flame rushing up like fire from the crater of a volcano soon reached the tapestry which it quickly devoured   93.00039477757072
then tell me all you know about the catalane   141.00915805069025
she is a woman to return you the like and not to fail   164.5154999254255
the soldier on guard at her door stopped as if he had been changed into stone   77.72304995982019
ejaculated athos   161.501222136296
the affair is serious and unavoidable   97.97916120934354
andrea was so surprised that he pondered the matter for a moment   106.51274064488615
but you had better not have anything to say to him for he is not a very good tempered gentleman   110.16606617866591
are we going to fight perchance   66.5132119162141
the road takes a turn he is obliged to follow it while alongside of the canal there is a shorter road   150.55600072271056
if you venture again into the house in which i have met you this evening i will dare it myself   83.73535739669221
not at all my dear sir said la carconte in her most gracious manner   53.72796974042243
i looked at him an instant to see if there was anything to hope from further entreaty   147.57417958364445
i have addressed my people and i have spoken to god   84.62806239698948
dantès possessed a prodigious memory combined with an astonishing quickness and readiness of conception   105.12124860831115
yes but i thought perhaps you had worn out all your courage the first time   90.63982245075546
but i spare your life for the sake of your sister   75.96130786368288
they had not exceeded their leave of absence and that same evening they went to pay their customary visit to m   144.928834736175
40188m florentin here   97.81169563009945
barrois touched a spring the false bottom came out and they saw a bundle of papers tied with a black string   151.03072361854117
sighed mercédès   79.1406008385448
am i not right villefort   143.02408046306144
that i am forbidden to tell   166.62367922828753
has the law ears to be melted by your sweet voice   12.548683464020115
they do not concern me   95.55967183031964
the pope and cæsar borgia first found the two future cardinals   70.92720112527513
to saint peter s first and then to the colosseum returned albert   38.61364916288839
except this he has no pretension to nobility and calls himself a chance count although the general opinion at rome is that the count is a man of very high distinction   126.4196039489791
sire i believe it to be most urgent but i hope by the speed i have used that it is not irreparable   66.79771900259243
we can now part   66.36073721217153
then they were both silent   141.5749832817624
well upon my honor said athos your eminence is right in taking us with you   133.83651518750798
i approached the jeweller who was not quite dead and at the sound of my footsteps and the creaking of the floor he opened his eyes fixed them on me with an anxious and inquiring gaze moved his lips as though trying to speak then overcome by the effort fell back and expired   109.25599746923135
explain yourself for i really can not tell what you mean   73.10331183277819
thus i was able thanks to the strategic disposition of my forces to intercept two couriers from mazarin to the queen   18.439132399832275
my child said vasiliki may god preserve you from ever wishing for that death which today you so much dread   131.32423359548181
but to leave paris if i thought happiness might await you in paris morrel i would have left you there   72.94794576934186
as for fernand himself he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the damned   160.26780933195064
there was therefore three quarters of an hour to wait   85.87028921517094
noirtier the girondin   184.35510590613723
why did you not hear all we said   64.66574249128769
the cavalcanti are all descended from princes   119.00566137324287
the leader closed the window came out an instant after by the door and satisfied himself that the woman was in the carriage   134.4458288385848
and i should wait in all my glory till some rich heiress attracted by my good looks rode along to marry me   47.606706479468485
he turned towards noirtier   145.51839792944435
ejaculated the young princess falling on her knees have mercy on us   176.99094174271832
milady   107.57396841264153
edmond had all the night to work in but in the darkness he could not do much and he soon felt that he was working against something very hard   90.29755371609136
ask baron franz d épinay   142.95883914281697
and you will leave me then   112.24860907189769
yes but in regard to myself my lord it can not be so for i was removed from the chatelet to the bastile owing to an order from your eminence   88.5831517645741
all at once there s a noise like a cannon that s the air blowing up the deck   150.72406836480224
ah you speak spanish   43.296274387120235
for soliloquizing aloud as very preoccupied people do he had entered the alley at the end of which were the stairs which led to his chamber   33.12379643121338
the riding horses i entrusted to grimaud and i awaited your coming out which i did not expect till to morrow and i didn t hope to free you without a skirmish   147.73795589861535
about your own height sir   132.03464096700802
for a stranger who does not know paris said athos and to whom the viscount will show the way   126.64746820027796
oh you rave sir exclaimed villefort in vain endeavoring to escape the net in which he was taken   38.18969136933637
he sat down occasionally on his bed pressing his hand on his heart   82.49861525308077
and albert followed by franz and the count descended the staircase crossed the square chamber where stood all the bandits hat in hand   94.3869612372426
thank god i have never heard his name mentioned by any person and i hope and believe he is dead   36.69292664276914
they were making nearly ten knots an hour   102.89793998613622
an expression of intense joy illumined the old man s eyes   199.03632401117474
pray what does that mean   95.56697142112729
then he tremblingly fixed his ladder and not to lose a moment placed his foot on the first step   102.67361531431386
their excellencies stretched their legs along the seats   170.55675850232774
when monte cristo turned round she let fall her arm which for some unknown reason had been resting on the gilded door post   197.13561958616947
but may i beg that the greatest haste may be made for i have reasons for wishing the vicomte not to sleep longer than to morrow night in paris   120.48699515393591
the queen will ultimately decide your place of domicile   149.18725208466438
i will call on you sir since you bid me contemplate for the advantage of my pride this terrible spectacle which must have been so great a source of sorrow to your family   47.533443701139944
as to my orders since every one gives his own commands in our party i shall end if this goes on by giving none at all   125.55872291433214
this morning we breakfasted with him   90.10193125431609
and you fancy he will not put his maxim into execution now that he has got hold of the king   107.48714969127735
my present happiness equals my past misery said the count   137.4395144416575
it is better to have a blazon less and a figure more on it   115.47065979567468
but you are able to have me arrested you are able to have me tortured you are able to have me hanged   141.97829065739631
have you no letter for him   6.353298522959506
that s a frightful place that bastille   149.65809790663485
now to follow out this reasoning what is the marvellous   130.9729703882038
faith i do not remember the name of the hotel   83.67795961524658
mordaunt answered only by a terrible laugh threw his torch into the sea and plunged in after it   152.76263424491194
said d artagnan with his wise smile   75.97905157185853
while monsieur d arminges gave orders for the horses to be made ready for departure the two young men ascended to the upper windows of the house and saw in the direction of marsin and of lens a large body of infantry and cavalry   61.991871324819776
the comte de la fere is not a man   104.62949541318994
this disposition visible as it was in his majesty did not prevent the courtiers from ranging themselves along his pathway   177.36814129072297
we have something very important to say to him   137.29652638820085
fernand cried he of my hundred names i need only tell you one to overwhelm you   130.78112112924188
she would supplicate him by the remembrance of guilty yet happy days   94.61034003058361
d artagnan alone did not seem convinced   69.92667368131173
i suffer from emotion   202.052531349976
but she is now at length a little reassured having sent her secretary away in order that nothing may happen unexpectedly   127.95392679929354
almost directly afterwards another demand for the same sum was presented to me   161.31100290862022
as for porthos on whom d artagnan had impressed the necessity of absolute silence and who did not even now begin to comprehend the scheme of his friend which was to follow mazarin in his visit to athos he was simply mute   131.35638605271663
but this time there really had been fighting a triumph and a complete one   55.13719417756806
suddenly the dull beating of muffled drums filled the square   141.68125994449719
but as soon as he perceived that the orifice of the barrel was motionless he threw himself upon the ground   155.44188522724033
but this last and dreaded resource served only to exasperate the multitude   148.59288362300396
with a watch spring one may saw through an iron bar   123.7682658646201
my lord said the young officer summoning to his mild countenance all the hatred he could find in his heart my lord i swear all shall be done as you desire   161.2635382431002
this time the musketeers had an adversary who was worthy of them   98.89482979828816
let me go on captain   41.989638381132195
let us be neither cardinalists nor frondists   57.85422223119112

then let us have a match in the tennis court exclaimed la ramee   158.07390324647645
compared with such things what is the letter you have just read   125.78813875622788
he also drank half a glass of this sparingly served wine and found it to be nothing but that horrible montreuil the terror of all expert palates   167.00013628985175
cried the major taking a third biscuit   112.92547479311828
the countenance of this man who possessed such extraordinary control over his feelings expressed the most perfect cordiality   229.0341310426417
she still had her rich fair hair   96.68366249102255
but as to what had been done by porthos and d artagnan afterward they were as ignorant as all the inhabitants of the chateau   112.23788376277139
he wore a vest of garnet colored velvet with buttons of cut gold   122.20706400764837
and d artagnan making himself as small as he could concealed himself in the darkest side of the street near a stone bench placed at the back of a niche   108.41203536640181
reverend sir i am impelled every criminal says the same thing   111.64949499274648
the young man knew quite well that after the succession of misfortunes which had befallen his father great changes had taken place in the style of living and housekeeping   129.567150541897
benedetto maintained the truth of what he had said and accompanied it with details that did more honor to his imagination than to his veracity   115.31262769429689
as for porthos s coat a blow from a halberd had cut it open on the flank and a pistol shot had cut his feather in two   116.25835404473082
hush we are flying   251.81372320267735
27 replied the count   81.35182019876619
albert resumed his seat and beauchamp read with more attention than at first the lines denounced by his friend   43.3509702453795
i only ask you a simple question   151.8050665967205
d artagnan blushed   173.45376313321253
the magistrate laid emphasis on these words as if he wished to apply them to the owner himself while his eyes seemed to plunge into the heart of one who interceding for another had himself need of indulgence   58.516468124478436
let me see saturday i am to dine at my country house at auteuil on that day rue de la fontaine no   172.44732665485012
i am dead drunk that s all and never did a man more strongly set about getting so   155.64729576838437
thought mazarin   187.24265073899707
it must be on some elevated place whence a given signal may be seen in every part of paris   101.34865367692646
mademoiselle eugénie scarcely answers me and mademoiselle d armilly her confidant does not speak to me at all   83.10229211593924
as for athos they believed him to be dead and left him very quiet on the field of battle not thinking it worth the trouble to carry him away   87.27799775527059
he therefore quickly went to the gate in the clover patch prepared to hear the result of the proceedings and very certain that valentine would hasten to him the first moment she should be set at liberty   70.80802075765288
and after dinner   130.8635766878927
i am sorry he does not speak french that i might tender him my compliments   129.5166015287579
i do not deny it returned the count   124.50155463471717
it is eleven o clock in the morning and the pious sisters have just finished saying mass for the success of the armies of king charles i   68.46188163242027

the other following an opposite direction was about to round the island of corsica   48.03912418521362
the eyes of noirtier seemed as though they would start from their sockets   56.78236126014959
it is in london they must be found   145.59433251932847
de tréville s surgeon was seated on a post and waiting for his adversary with hat in hand his feather even touching the ground   153.3007595789319
you have suffered a great deal sir   48.39549363480897
because i have acted like queen marie de medicis who returning from her first exile treated with contempt all those who had suffered for her and being proscribed a second time died at cologne abandoned by every one even by her own son   121.9623646270482
he must sell them at whatever price   200.56997512128194
i was looking around for porthos when i saw near me a head which had been broken but which for better or worse had been patched with plaster and with black silk   47.11794577131117
the duke had already begun to descend   93.31028279622633
the friends looked at each other with unutterable surprise   46.62648554162237
i have told you that i was traveling on an important mission   192.4552556988497
i will go in your stead   47.62717696396396

you are exaggerating athos   81.93899584488004
if you are willing gentlemen i will sleep across your doorway and you will then be certain that nobody can reach you   231.87310065201524
nothing bad has happened to him then   147.10199834648338
i answered you think so   147.2707971256467
occupy yourselves with your own affairs gentlemen and let france settle matters as she will with me resumed mazarin   130.90317577801784
bonacieux s glass the contents of a ring which she opened with singular quickness   100.00680943774502
i say we have been here eighty three hours   115.90455333914377
merely to say these words i am going to send monsieur d artagnan away and i wish him to set out directly   61.76558527871666
he felt convinced of his identity but he did not venture to address him   63.33296253848252
and this done she next occupied herself in arranging his supper by spreading a napkin at the end of the table and placing on it the slender remains of their dinner to which she added three or four fresh laid eggs   80.71580451424218
i sent them to carry aid to king charles and they performed prodigies to save him   115.18505721833107
all at once the captain stopped as if struck by a sudden suspicion   73.43436972748385
the traitor who surrendered the castle of the man in whose service he was pardon me my friend that man was your father   197.40233427452014
at four o clock d artagnan recommenced his journey   88.6513139473816
nearly ten minutes passed   147.32776673805355
you are not then a man of the people   117.39243980862187
consent then i beg you madame to write at the bottom of this schedule which has been drawn up by mazarin as you see i consent to ratify the treaty proposed by the parisians   189.0299849561962
i will detain you no longer   140.78968018572266
this letter contains important news and the expression of his respect   22.960696781162156
i said aramis in his most flutelike tone i had made up my mind   165.0283480934909
that was the reason why i left my chateau du vallon near corbeil and came to my estate bracieux   32.13293294628211
forgive my servants he said for a terror i can not blame them for   104.6831129388468
porthos understood him and he and the lieutenant each drew with the left hand a pistol from their bolsters and cocked it in their turn   123.5403360297219
i have enemies   72.89888622697615
then strike boldly   79.12324038355658
there was no doubt in my look my voice my whole person that sincerity of gesture of attitude of accent which carries conviction to the most perverse minds for he paused   90.7916682109442
and if by any chance he should be wishing to establish his son find him a wife very rich very noble on her mother s side at least and a baroness in right of her father i will help you in the search   157.78331782875955
but he had gone farther than athos for at the village of festubert while drinking at an inn he had learned without needing to ask a question that the evening before at half past eight a wounded man who accompanied a lady traveling in a post chaise had been obliged to stop unable to go further   82.40282776608416
i think that a man must be so severely punished by the loss of your love that he stands in need of no other chastisement   111.02699932158949
said andrea we must overtake him soon   61.11220205489274
did your father serve under ali pasha   125.31284660158892
and indeed since his captivity in the château d if he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be witnessed   69.94121976410568
villefort smiled bitterly   105.91177519911851
porthos was twisting his mustache   127.56717293641336
give him a direct invitation but do not ask me to present him   188.05611227520322
the time and place are but ill suited for an introduction   102.26904767243786
this is the way in which you northerns understand chemistry madame   166.09494806580173
reassure yourself   121.69357205783152
they threw themselves into each other s arms embraced tenderly and returned together to the house   118.02518858449866
porthos the second to marry an attorney s wife   74.01863315226204
they suit each other remarkably well said danglars   141.9974126097978
shall we wait breakfast for you   71.40747229559665
as to cocles he seemed completely bewildered   178.14787730585272
nor although preceding the party did he once mistake one door for another or commit the smallest error when choosing any particular corridor or staircase to conduct him to a place or suite of rooms he desired to visit   88.73495165814485
adieu madame adieu   45.56417986925395
all must bow to the superiority of the gigantic labor of the cæsars and the many voices of fame spread far and wide the surpassing merits of this incomparable monument   115.48916071263257
wait for me   86.6346923690572
you already know two of them and you appeared to appreciate them like a judge   82.00089917758655
this day of reunion was the same day as that on which kitty came to find d artagnan   138.45691660427352
and this important service had established between them one of those sentiments of gratitude which so easily assume a more tender character   72.22093591657628
in fact fortune changed   231.31377332329762
he is of no earthly use to anybody   96.58441865004646
there were nobles who made war against each other   145.2074832739459
the old servant came   90.8614948586172
well i have not intercepted your confidence and yet i know all that as well as you and i have no conscientious scruples   56.70867804438279
indeed sir i thank you   77.71798940604101
i am looking at you   7.1003283225946205
think my dear girl it s life and death   155.68898882728138
the duke of buckingham and his english masters of the isle of ré continued to besiege but without success the citadel st   157.03808742423269
we must discover what is going on   51.51979162376161
danglars says you are rich and perfectly free   130.60521395053593
magnificent windows so beautiful so large that i believe a man of your size should pass through each frame   25.53859657626586
i took advantage of a moment when they left me alone   101.65079453524248
replied the count with increased anxiety   81.5311603853446
here it is replied d artagnan taking it from his finger   173.30300939043218
you will live my lord you will live   130.40862352409565
although since the change that had been working in himself athos had given grimaud permission to speak   64.77014943929514
a propos you have probably one or two friends   93.76895840852674
there to his great astonishment d artagnan heard the policy which made all europe tremble criticized aloud and openly as well as the private life of the cardinal which so many great nobles had been punished for trying to pry into   98.17261596082187
what is your pleasure with me   118.96606319909954
well he told me that benedetto who is considered a serpent of subtlety and a giant of cunning is really but a very commonplace silly rascal and altogether unworthy of the experiments that will be made on his phrenological organs after his death   26.625761342943917
8 brucea ferruginea   116.39127523528566
you have spared me till now but since you speak of it once for all i tell you madame i do not ask you to tell me said mazarin astounded by this returning courage   113.72717310457655
splendid paintings by the first masters were ranged against the walls intermingled with magnificent trophies of war while heavy curtains of costly tapestry were suspended before the different doors of the room   95.3563513275948
the next morning she found her grandmother in bed   99.37034509164704
so then we are all right as regards the executioner said athos   119.30399335588014
i do not like open doors when it thunders   66.60704151033173
he added that having learned at marseilles the particulars of my imprisonment he hastened to comply with my desire   152.5648531758603
during the recital mazarin entered and glided noiselessly up to the queen to listen   59.083774114477194
then upon seeing my musketeers they changed their minds and forgot their private hatred for partisan hatred   163.13370599442598
and you know who she is   106.31444029044594
athos listened to his projects then shook his head and recommended prudence to him with a shade of bitterness   140.5984597256929
she passed an hour without breathing panting with a cold sweat upon her brow and her heart oppressed by frightful agony at every movement she heard in the corridor   142.16063567395184
then i became a thief and lately have become an assassin   85.3595785458824
that i might the sooner see you again my dear father replied the young man   166.33590702948763
i have your word then   106.98183239352187
and i tell you freely that the comparison i draw between you and other men will ever be one of my greatest tortures   9.551923540752512
some years only   21.097100907054738
asked major cavalcanti innocently   112.6568784943976
i am very desirous of being so my lord but i am totally in the dark about everything   143.48230623300176
debray maximilian morrel and m   74.63503692456993
but d artagnan made a friendly sign to him with his head dismounted and throwing his bridle to a lackey who was passing he approached the valet de chambre with a smile on his lips   132.88159194286732
noirtier at one of the open windows where the old man had been placed that he might enjoy the last rays of the sun which yet yielded some heat and was now shining upon the dying flowers and red leaves of the creeper which twined around the balcony   40.829716050112665
your eminence means monsieur d artagnan   104.95291229679258
i told you the day before yesterday to bring them with you   106.69843432918604
i am so unhappy   182.94973233272657
the second two   96.24575603346692
well planchet how is the good monsieur de wardes   133.81417640503614
just as my mother was on the point of pushing open a small door we heard the voice of the pasha sounding in a loud and threatening tone   114.78744672985482
they began by walking through the apartments many of which were fitted up in the eastern style with cushions and divans instead of beds and pipes instead of furniture   112.33072794983431
the globe of the lamp appeared of a reddish hue and the flame brightening before it expired threw out the last flickerings which in an inanimate object have been so often compared with the convulsions of a human creature in its final agonies   60.00793569875253
all three agreed to meet at noon in whitehall place to see how things went on   130.8587366909855
i went too   30.106772024750242
that s porthos all over murmured d artagnan   145.13529643547244
but i am unable to leave london for want of money   102.9446352357757
repeated the traveller in an accent of indescribable sadness   85.66085974029131
really your manner of speaking it expresses my meaning and that is all i want   22.14023676272042
that can only be to hold gloves he said   119.99690486913963
yes said porthos we have mousqueton but since he has been steward he has become very heavy   117.28469563559926
what are my servants   183.0871404554639
pardieu he has come to draw but i don t know how much   90.25788747005276
these fellows were drunk said athos and knowing there was a lady who had arrived at the cabaret this evening they wanted to force her door   15.149384210828714
and she went out of the room   121.44715162840453
valentine sank weeping into a chair   142.8985329639581
madame de villefort must have experienced something of the sensation of a bird which looking up sees the murderous trap closing over its head   149.19310618743648
bravo count bravo   63.18268508394203
as long as i don t fight with him it is the same to me with whom i fight   62.27884160605664
i have seen him once replied grimaud a cloud darkening his countenance at the picture so suddenly summoned to the bar of recollection   77.17792262938748
apropos when do you aspect m   36.37424223926148
the young king leaned toward the door   135.35360816618888
and who is this wretch   71.17596786384078
cried the cardinal with astonishment   147.2986507820645
if you have forgotten the history of oedipus i at least remember it   106.41784999294157
and by the time they have found out the pleasantry we shall be out of the range of their balls   133.32702679057783
and now continued he you must change your clothes   122.43611260151197
all the delicacies in fact that are cast up by the wash of waters on the sandy beach and styled by the grateful fishermen fruits of the sea   104.83577243226287
fifteen thousand francs do you understand   41.84428480534014
d arminges and olivain and the two grooms then mounted their horses and all four started off at a quick trot to rejoin raoul and his companion   38.4089489016762
danglars mentioned that in a visit which i paid him   172.55961541658684
but this was not the case   216.68343361014652
you will not sign that order my lord   160.86880909911767
why are not my frenchmen here   49.13598504890086
before the door the traces were yet more apparent   67.47780483897665
accustomed however as he was to the work he had to repeat most of the letters of the alphabet and to find every word in the dictionary so that it was ten minutes before the thought of the old man was translated by these words fetch the glass of water and the decanter from valentine s room   148.56773566589447
this reassures me more than all the royal signatures thought d artagnan   136.99140991024126
now continued villefort those to whom the guilt really belongs by whom the crime was committed on whose heads the justice of man may probably descend here and the certain judgment of god hereafter would rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such a peace offering as valentine on the son of him whose life they so ruthlessly destroyed   87.58042135897549
it was for your interest i albert does not say you are a liar signor pastrini said franz but that he will not believe what you are going to tell us but i will believe all you say   149.02698513854642
but the notes did it injury   26.07528312828144
yes sir replied morcerf   100.5992831808956
for if the comte de la fere and i are not mistaken we saw you in the company of a third gentleman   120.80507661423721
i name only the most important   170.63433306851886
why did you so maladroitly restore me the handkerchief   167.13800774386075
very well my worthy gentleman replied d artagnan pick out the longest and come and show it to me this evening   198.64099679328098
adieu perhaps farewell   109.74366694920487
at the expiration of an hour felton tapped again   16.05921205148492
besides you will strike at the throat porthos   42.6951784165539
and if you can bring château renaud with you   77.26901646616766
that is the least we owe her   117.75801813071101
one now and then i don t say much about   93.79093113712524
well then it appears that we are the crœsuses of the society   182.65153283458008
do they not seem to say with their pale lips and staring eyes we have seen   63.25750623593461
that will give me time to pay him   54.67265856208353
she asked upon what day this fête would take place but the king replied that he must consult the cardinal upon that head   114.34349311828727
albert without knowing why started on hearing these words pronounced with such a haughty and dignified accent   53.30913644732807
your mother albert knows that poor house well   141.72484564494724
i can tell you but one thing sir for the secret you wish to know is not my own   59.099509500275325
de tréville a thing which considering the habitual reticence of the worthy musketeer had very much astonished his captain   47.36551458059222
perhaps you have done your duty as a soldier but as a gentleman i say that you are very culpable   182.99846941755007
the same impression was experienced by all present and no one was deceived by the expression of his countenance   129.60055103607647
we must wait for aramis   177.810735329996
at whatsoever hour of the day or night you may present yourself remember that i shall be ready to give you absolution   115.45858733274218
you prohibited my mentioning my father s name to her but perhaps she will allude to him of her own accord in the course of the recital and you have no idea how delighted i should be to hear our name pronounced by such beautiful lips   138.88517609715154
then he pressed the hand the baroness reluctantly gave him and led her respectfully back to the door   147.85726308904202
that is all very fine benedetto mio but i know what i am saying   73.2757072365166
for a whim   84.27700714742953
as she would not appear to be agitated by the threats of lord de winter she placed herself at the table and ate   73.48165838272007
in case of necessity i might also climb up but my two horses can not mount the ladder   96.92442950105368
on the contrary i shall feel much pleasure   134.27148760174023
the deuce he is well guarded then   121.8674977100303
i had told you that there was brucine in the mixture i give you   146.29915989697602
the storm increased the flashes succeeded one another more rapidly the thunder began to growl and the wind the precursor of a hurricane whistled in the plumes and the hair of the horsemen   110.66412348407185
that must have cut short the projects of escape   109.46146246089361
30 in the avenue des champs élysées that the count of monte cristo lived and who being answered by the porter in the affirmative entered closed the gate after him and began to ascend the steps   111.10907826153363
we will keep a sharp lookout for them   117.19993184200726
we have seen them at villefort s   115.95612036104865
ten kicks on his back   149.41665721600626
i am aware of that and i have told him a hundred times that he was wrong   196.50935536128745
let us proceed therefore to the usurper s conversion   16.4743955559031
but i would give you one piece of advice which you will do well to keep in mind   106.60493978506047
why it was won by a horse and rider utterly unknown on the course   88.2945150612693
then aloud well my dear la ramee   112.71355713550489
what a question so truly french   131.62082977896947
well said porthos this is my advice speak   92.66121979500045
remained alone and turning his eyes on his half opened horace muttered justum et tenacem propositi virum   126.50392703838877
let us make a compact   108.9165784100467
oh go on monsieur go on   57.81134333666208
monsieur d arminges and olivain had already dismounted and were attempting to raise the struggling horse   93.05537037315824
he used to be the headsman of bethune   102.0008903475363
but fortunately the world is a sepulcher   63.817186821830994
oh exclaimed haydée is it not yet over   156.96738576677325
there are ten men to accompany you   176.94541939460947
have you cords to bind him with and a gag to stop his mouth   165.2273568976873
ambroise and i repeat marie michon was an adorable creature   62.91574832805589
valentine in the extremity of her terror joined her hands for she felt that the moment had arrived to ask for courage and began to pray and while uttering little more than incoherent words she forgot that her white shoulders had no other covering than her long hair and that the pulsations of her heart could be seen through the lace of her nightdress   97.26312977267501
i suppose you mean continued d artagnan   44.44344584071429
however because i was prudent you must not take me for a fool   101.57275642259833
and in the midst of the greenhouse marvellous alike to sight and smell was a billiard table which looked as if it had been abandoned during the past hour by players who had left the balls on the cloth   112.977072387876
i have already forbidden that man he said to come in here without my permission   135.49690711724858
then how comes it said monte cristo with a frown that when i desired you to purchase for me the finest pair of horses to be found in paris there is another pair fully as fine as mine not in my stables   176.1483208511118
de saint méran also grandfather to mademoiselle danglars   133.86400547957416
this method was so simple that d artagnan employed it quite naturally and instinctively   104.60574005013025
lieutenant d artagnan   85.2797216099971
we are going to reach the nearest seaport unite our little resources hire a vessel and return to france   39.395709183726936
go my son go my dear gérard and by your obedience to my paternal orders or if you prefer it friendly counsels we will keep you in your place   103.57174967407907
this woman is full of mysteries murmured d artagnan to himself   150.52716343326114
what do you say to it   53.16999349855874
he walked to the window and looked into the court   63.39820408605241
i mean to ask if you are married   122.6618090295541
guitant and comminges at the head of the guards marched first   212.75084707475662
go gentlemen he said   62.552840124477704
but at the very moment when d artagnan stretched out his hand to receive it m   77.42940508991364
parry parted from his friends regretfully   37.57326462249475
is he dead   147.0084662719804
you had begun to pervert my poor felton   146.76309478377368
whenever this occurred although it proceeded only from goodwill and a desire to see the king and queen anne looked at d artagnan anxiously   160.24346356514548
you know raoul grimaud is an old and zealous servant   43.505262700986904
said the host in a doubtful tone   110.26929805393561
the fusillade continued   174.82398220375842
so much the better replied monte cristo   104.91741879036007
said aramis to juxon   95.12001223636736
he himself had given a plan to bertuccio marking the spot where each tree was to be planted and the shape and extent of the lawn which was to take the place of the paving stones   172.6739048167517
debray and five or six other choice spirits whom you do not know even by name   139.01060558604703
but nothing absolutely nothing   126.76317046913701
now should any letters or other documents of a compromising character be found upon him will it not be taken for granted that all who uphold him are his accomplices   145.67532716925584
yet it is probable on the contrary that we shall enter because we seem to have to do with sensible people   116.00869784108143
but watch over him   36.546726421525634
in artois where i fought for years   111.34171929980283
look well at that man   114.48676927784264
no the change in mercédès was that her eye no longer sparkled her lips no longer smiled and there was now a hesitation in uttering the words which formerly sprang so fluently from her ready wit   105.71406874788978
who ordered monsieur de beaufort to be arrested   76.06576114813467
pray excuse me madame replied monte cristo but i never eat muscatel grapes   90.02182393043893
those imbeciles of magicians can only imagine things to torment honest people   114.90617748172217
the grave and harmonious tones of that beloved voice seemed to have still its ancient influence whilst that of aramis which had become harsh and tuneless in his moments of ill humor irritated him   110.33274075768504
thanks to the garden we yet can flee   108.08072322326066
oh yes yes i do sir   126.90155291627289
and you are well aware that from the collision of clouds electricity is produced from electricity lightning from lightning illumination   27.73909892474161
let me at least reach a shady spot said andrea   110.4117878355377
one of them recognized him   96.38529491581079
the carriage stopped at an alley leading out of the rue saint jacques   125.19696680268218
now suppose that next day one of these eels or pike or carp poisoned at the fourth remove is served up at your table   164.8061468355095
ah indeed said the queen it would have much astonished me if that low cur with his distorted legs had not been mixed up with all this   105.84852866170472
let him come in   110.30663700035338
you will do me honor monsieur said d artagnan   16.43591825827467
have they then offered a large one   123.57353488666149
i will give you the signal   128.7810209437768
but aramis was livid   124.5226196908063
for my part i declare i want two thousand   105.01023304765684
thanks to something better   134.78913118987577
cried albert you are not a preacher to remain standing   223.79492854462598
you know the history of the saraband   144.48636562000758
will you enter this carriage and that without offering the least resistance without making the least noise   134.00121347070876
the people have seen monsieur de condé a prince of the blood royal arrested by my mother in law maria de medicis   197.07517149407988
however in an hour i shall know all   166.6581900745077
but wounded without doubt killed perhaps   205.27293183665353
i hope i shall gain renée s favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on me   103.15014788697515
that is to say he had the most remarkable audacity seconded by a most powerful organization a man who has not perhaps like yourself seen all the kingdoms of the earth but who has helped to overturn one of the greatest   167.68988237949407
you understand   73.79017373670592
you seem sir she remarked to be making me undergo a course of cross examination   124.22447548009049
are there not some latin verses upon that subject   175.595321965115
he is thinking of groslow   193.16160195499054
my friends that s exactly like me   123.30538672628563
she should certainly return from her exile she did not doubt that a single instant   150.93016991053727
you are indeed wonderful men said the king   137.70772096906117
noirtier looked his conviction that she was right in her supposition   159.35166939719306
perhaps you had a spy at your heels   111.88400516287096
and what favor pray   112.12724854412296
once out to sea you are too good a politician not to understand the rest mordaunt   151.67286449475486
there are gendarmes who occupy themselves with such affairs judges who condemn and scaffolds which avenge   73.50163551039378
that is to say soldiers   111.41754306106928
why said she you could plant one of the chestnut trees in the tuileries inside   122.0904755072654
mazarin was desirous of setting out instantly for saint germain but the queen declared that she should wait for the people whom she had appointed to meet her   66.4362295472939
i am at your service sir replied the major   110.03425843773933
yes for i can follow you no farther and i only stop at the foot of the scaffold   102.01221376127542
cavalcanti as the count s father who highly approved of the union regretted his inability to leave parma at that time and promised a wedding gift of a hundred and fifty thousand livres   52.97792666132749
oh said the count i only know two things which destroy the appetite grief and as i am happy to see you very cheerful it is not that and love   101.70882480290592
gentlemen said the duke i will thank you later   215.8383010845761
as soon as possible m   132.26938426446014
15 ask the porter for the key of the room on the fifth floor enter the apartment take from the corner of the mantelpiece a purse netted in red silk and give it to your father   74.07858060241131
but said the envoy you do not go about it in the right way to kill him if i understand you correctly   72.57129993105089
his friends   115.41395043075993
arrest the duke   151.26951119437362
he found the count standing before some copies of albano and fattore that had been passed off to the banker as originals   123.70060627548071
noirtier having at the commencement of the discussion been attacked by a sort of apoplectic fit the affair would necessarily be deferred for some days longer   153.95262830439373
my mother has noticed him and he must therefore perforce be remarkable   124.99965217150964
gives me pain but will not prevent my walking   124.60481422707183
still what   87.15394540808185
look at me well in your turn   147.30875281765938
you think resumed mazarin that rochefort he was cardinal richelieu s creature my lord   184.06383386042518
well that is precisely the feeling which i experienced when i first saw that extraordinary man   177.71122947369125
revenge yourself then edmond cried the poor mother   107.11683615647578
thus the day passed away   74.00422338711302
and will he talk thus of affairs in presence of two strangers   173.86128961102543
let us suppose for the moment that we are theologizing in a social way or even philosophically and i will say to you rude as it may seem my brother you sacrifice greatly to pride   65.67149230928436
it is something to hit inside the ring   105.83287335076645
go into the cavern with haydée   149.5267025440602
what was your deputy called   11.2702077889451
how is it that you have no friends in your prosperity when you had many in adversity   146.4426596791177
his eminence is not his holiness sire   84.98332652431961
bonacieux to stoop as he did toward the opening   5.777993442705807
he was very successful upon that question   91.92024274868827
on the left was an old abandoned mill with its motionless wings from the ruins of which an owl threw out its shrill periodical and monotonous cry   120.2120190357512
himself monsieur bernouin   27.56866868274291
it was impossible to wait longer his temples throbbed violently his eyes were growing dim   87.94550196421999
walk back and forth till some news of our friends reaches us or till we are visited by a good idea   51.900107108467985
all still remained silent the eyes of all were turned in the direction where the vessel had disappeared endeavoring in vain to penetrate the darkness   132.5992233692456
sire replied juxon you shall be obeyed   113.93481646700351
replied the gascon   164.43246417833905
peppino walked with a firm step doubtless aware of what awaited him   114.87539527888265
it must have been delirium   201.6254286850238
several days elapsed and they neither saw nor heard of cucumetto   75.51429932456708
but not before one o clock replied d artagnan   44.33617203201713
the punishment of death replied d artagnan   168.9537455402142
the young girl trembled very much at hearing the stories   127.20779137135523
ah you have reflected   176.28779542372064
it would be a dishonor to all the nobility   91.70222849494526
on the next day mathieu molé the chief president whose courage at this crisis says the cardinal de retz was equal to that of the duc de beaufort and the prince de condé in other words of the two men who were considered the bravest in france had been attacked in his turn   161.7084529580768
the cardinal knocked three times and in a peculiar manner   137.71099356643361
allowing his head to sink upon his two hands he pretended to sleep   159.67595259645373
afar off a few small fishing boats studded the bosom of the blue ocean   133.34468156785726
and the steward followed the notary out of the room   169.2798970741985
what could this treachery be   152.96864707071578
mouston appeared with a most piteous face   150.37946474701099
the host his mind at ease about his bill placed pen ink and paper upon the table   69.3727817823816
at this very moment the court is making overtures to me   135.1251657557683
those gilded cashbooks drawers locked like gates of fortresses heaps of bank bills come from i know not where and the quantities of letters from england holland spain india china and peru have generally a strange influence on a father s mind and make him forget that there is in the world an interest greater and more sacred than the good opinion of his correspondents   174.12320330902088
the deputy procureur du roi in one of the aristocratic mansions built by puget in the rue du grand cours opposite the medusa fountain a second marriage feast was being celebrated almost at the same hour with the nuptial repast given by dantès   131.15734385123912
the marshal bit his fingers   145.60311372225925
i am prepared for anything   100.8231105986947
have it your own way   162.1523704075861
sir he said there is one window of the convent lighted up   106.58838992389015
in the position in which raoul lay unfortunately he could neither draw his sword from the scabbard nor his pistols from their holsters   17.396624156100344
i am hungry that is all   160.90440194778697
and raising the foot of the bed he drew out the phial still a third filled with the red liquor   50.52107003622574
then jumping on his horse with the elegance of a first rate esquire after bowing to athos and d artagnan he went off close by the door of the carriage on somebody inside of which his eyes were riveted   125.14877134963889
but it must be said that if he had seen it he attached so little importance to this scrap of paper and so much importance to his two hundred thousand francs that he would not have opposed whatever the englishman might do however irregular it might be   121.30871678884326
in fact at the end of a few minutes the belfry of st   80.36493409392173
that which would now be considered as disgraceful to a gentleman was at that time quite a simple and natural affair and the younger sons of the best families were frequently supported by their mistresses   100.901560557716
you do not fear lest he should betray you to the cardinal   211.88684564060227
the major clasped his hands in token of admiration   83.22938669092134
he rose dignified and calm restraining by the severity of his look the wild glance of the young man   80.20100042275122
i became very pale   126.28399066022754
still at the hotel of the great charlemagne   113.95983893065454
oh monsieur you can write as much as you like   109.54391807592765
and he stepped on one side to give place to a young man of refined and dignified bearing with large and open brow piercing eyes and black moustache whom our readers have already seen at marseilles under circumstances sufficiently dramatic not to be forgotten   188.4661950183303
no sound was audible save that of the carriages that were carrying the maskers home   91.58984450396815
do so madame do so and that at once   42.71897482546689
they talk of making him an ambassador   99.63081610083759
ah it is really a serious matter then   121.42136432182927
she said i saw but i can not believe   11.6923733896177
my most faithful friends gentlemen my most faithful friends   100.9285114751094
danglars however who now made his appearance accompanied by caderousse effectually confirmed the report stating that he had recently conversed with m   52.069544253629736
preoccupied as madame danglars had been with the object of her visit the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so insulting that she began by complaining of it   101.71551364026756
do i wish to follow it   151.0188676093842
so little was it a dream that i stretched my hand towards the bell   82.29354284800077
no i said very well sir you have gained the victory   203.4581291093839
nothing for the present   109.75028762665012
no doubt he has been as lucky as the rest   139.29337905439655
in fact ten minutes had scarcely passed away when the door of the king s closet opened and m   103.81490521639907
they reached the rue st   165.93721779279946
but she exclaimed suddenly arsenic is indelible indestructible   126.56613757290292
raoul was directing his horse toward the unhappy man in danger   111.1637358380463
undeniably   68.84145829795409
the englishman received his thanks with the phlegm peculiar to his nation   147.1591628983648
by paying for it of course as among honest folk   104.28393046949192
in person and fortunately it seems for you my young friend   128.5913075092148
disguised as a monk he discovered the whole history in confession from the executioner of bethune and having confessed him after having learned everything from him he gave him absolution by planting this dagger into his heart   161.95959501586952
i came to tell you that i hate you instinctively   64.84808302493083
porthos agreed to the bargain   173.20933448766604
de tréville who thanked him for his information recommended him to have the service of the king and queen always at heart and returned to the saloon   133.4154555962698
but franz did come with the four thousand crowns said château renaud   7.175871293649848
yes yes said monte cristo   126.43024667134705
without seeing mademoiselle valentine   158.68489268937356
he examined the broken stock calculated what change it would require to adapt the gun to his shoulder and made a fresh stock so beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen or twenty piastres had he chosen to sell it   131.59987060270493
isn t this fox a genius athos   75.58160025634069
then came the question of gallantry and love affairs   126.84217336515675
indeed when placed beside m   118.98322501117993
cried renée clasping her hands and looking towards her lover with piteous earnestness be merciful on this the day of our betrothal   69.66536073795811
so now i breathe again i am happy   177.46109723685618
she descended and went through the passage   58.57064654582031
so that when he saw merely and simply instead of the executioner he expected only his commissary of the preceding evening attended by his clerk he was ready to embrace them both   52.71785273249681
but this gesture being repeated he left the ranks and advanced to receive orders   132.7465808514729
an officer as he spoke entered the apartment   77.64035730179604
then commencing a loud whistling noise he rubbed them well all over their bodies for several minutes   123.62995584150661
and besides they say that the culprit is an infamous scoundrel who killed with a log of wood a worthy canon who had brought him up like his own son   15.52318602538979
it glistened with such extraordinary joy so rich and full of thought that the physician was struck   76.75302890256178
monsieur de beaufort in common with many other prisoners was bent upon doing things that were prohibited   54.11979890506883
at the time when he decided on his profession his father had no desire to choose for him but had consulted young maximilian s taste   29.56674398359138
long life to his eminence   113.07233656524018
well replied the cardinal who could not for an instant suspect the loyalty of tréville and who felt that the victory was escaping him well but athos was taken in the house in the rue des fossoyeurs   126.15759531372863
a friend of ten years standing could not have done more for us or with a more perfect courtesy   177.8236933285118
his chin strongly marked denoted that strength of will which in the ordinary britannic type denotes mostly nothing but obstinacy   115.74619578489971
to kill yourself   77.04380142488355
chapter xx   21.841833271604116
i think it is the wind   64.25541872541777
she draws only fifteen feet   9.467727010934851
grimaud in fact brought back five horses   109.20957211287613
just then madame de villefort in the act of slipping on her dressing gown threw aside the drapery and for a moment stood motionless as though interrogating the occupants of the room while she endeavored to call up some rebellious tears   49.29864971264829
asked dantès with much surprise   92.38454592578684
if one has it not one must do without it   165.58638432241338
one of his guns was swung over his shoulder gaetano had the other and a sailor held his rifle   100.23957219774516
athos himself stared   75.13472598074497
half past one only   162.84743744563391
now you are rich said monte cristo   84.25509940058542
she murmured to herself then said aloud d artagnan   45.477081952502814
franz congratulated albert who received his congratulations with the air of a man conscious that they are merited   12.513016124458971
in the home of the witty abbé dwelt incessant laughter   145.10981553943824
he reached the rue saint honore and went up it toward the rue de la ferronnerie   143.94383191275733
it is quite ridiculous for a young lady of fashion   170.9907299975891
ma foi my dear viscount you are fated to hear music this evening   149.61543238494812
yes sir he had very good ones   11.48796283795754
mazarin replied only by a groan   36.41981217312534
i am admiring three magnificent horses which the stable boys are leading about   90.62360860138855
there appeared in his journal last night but wait and read for yourself   158.94169550016892
her self control however was so great that it might have been imagined that she was calm   109.41642457278267
did i know poor dear edmond   125.23617585153706
they will come in due season   105.08384109708882
bonacieux his name age condition and abode   102.42604107949622
you will find him quite enthusiastic   151.37275667187578
then you know that i did not leave him   157.9073191031576
and d artagnan gave feature for feature a description of the comte de wardes   139.56550578645562
mordaunt knelt down and fastened one end of the train to the spigot in order that he might have nothing to do but to set it on fire at the opposite end with the match   110.053062796693
that is my condemnation thought d artagnan   147.5717556491328
the next moment he darted to the door and knocked down two of the soldiers who guarded it before they had time to cock their muskets   52.760612112187154
thanks monsieur returned monte cristo my steward has orders to take a box at each theatre   194.0548287595464
she was branded   196.43144936435286
with this needle said the abbé as opening his ragged vestments he showed dantès a long sharp fish bone with a small perforated eye for the thread a small portion of which still remained in it   72.73281346393438
do you know that i am to be beheaded outside this window   72.26717263442926
he met villefort on his way to noirtier s room and accompanied him to see how the old man had slept   142.58353751582945
oh were i not a foreigner   128.31904346689734
de tréville promised this favor after a novitiate of two years a novitiate which might besides be abridged if an opportunity should present itself for d artagnan to render the king any signal service or to distinguish himself by some brilliant action   105.50209526898868
i am about to be seized with a fit of catalepsy   92.87734483599503
i am satisfied with having killed that fellow my boy seeing that it is blessed bread to kill an englishman   51.34949054911768
he opened his eyes   122.114518433094
now said athos that we can not even recognize one another and have therefore no fear of others recognizing us let us go and see the king s entrance   169.2658871836964
we are discovered   105.91718543090496
i die after my own manner i die exhausted and broken spirited as i fall asleep when i have paced three thousand times round my cell that is thirty thousand steps or about ten leagues   137.44425784028545
was it ali asked the count of morcerf who rescued my son from the hands of bandits   79.15309613580033
because we should run straight on to the island of rion   142.666564438383
the last month s payment had been made with the most scrupulous exactitude   130.64416436531326
you will not allow that   111.7549595553714
i bless and love you my dear son   124.76079279706215
they are young and cheerful they are tenderly attached to each other and with twenty five thousand francs a year they fancy themselves as rich as rothschild   80.53663475544715
ah said the englishman is it you my master   142.62259195478632
but beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young man and perhaps in that of the old man many repressed desires many stifled sighs which found vent when faria was left alone and when edmond returned to his cell   122.52211680973974
still more   175.3821377482437
is there anyone in the lobby   92.4626229725251
no with a relation   55.93420196326039
acknowledge therein the receipt of the cash and i will hand you over the money   145.27313771412497
it seemed as if a flow of blood had ascended from the chest to the head   100.335865589485
said d artagnan looking at aramis as he had looked at athos   58.46643617066858
now leave me or i will summon my servants to throw you out at the door   158.5615345405953
i saw the executioner return into the king s room change his clothes put on a black hat and a large cloak and disappear   144.5659274132716
alas no sir replied andrea with a sigh still more remarkable than the former ones   133.9570244604476
the four young men waited ten minutes a quarter of an hour twenty minutes   167.66892207303195
quite the contrary   138.14804704693452
gentlemen continued the stranger since you do not recognize a man who probably owes his life to you twice i must name myself   89.43202354764426
angels never err celestial beings remain where they wish to be   188.16295282124355
chapter xlviii   136.26034938684268
yes his bodily faculties for he can neither move nor speak nevertheless he thinks acts and wills in the manner i have described   120.50648819730118
well with the five minutes grace we have only ten left   117.97417755501516
five minutes afterward the wheels of the carriage and the horses shoes were heard resounding on the pavement of the courtyard   87.0457386130538
yes my mother said albert i will return and woe to the infamous wretch   188.28794024851624
you were no stranger to me for i knew you from the time i gave up two rooms to you invited you to breakfast with me lent you one of my carriages witnessed the carnival in your company and saw with you from a window in the piazza del popolo the execution that affected you so much that you nearly fainted   124.63672790805212
all paris rung with the praises of madame danglars beautiful horses and i had the folly to desire to know whether they really merited the high praise given to them   116.94563512545999
and while breakfasting they held it for two hours against the enemy and have killed i don t know how many rochellais   139.33504727494568
then as it was difficult to suggest a more reasonable proposal he agreed to it   121.4200449909902
the very anticipations of delight to be enjoyed in his forthcoming visits the bright pure gleam of heavenly happiness it diffused over the almost deadly warfare in which he had voluntarily engaged illumined his whole countenance with a look of ineffable joy and calmness as immediately after villefort s departure his thoughts flew back to the cheering prospect before him of tasting at least a brief respite from the fierce and stormy passions of his mind   160.3574645834057
but in either case what is to be done   58.33583703204504
but hatred and revenge were accumulating in his heart silently and drop by drop   54.712904085187915
meanwhile the object of this hideous admiration approached the wicket against which one of the keepers was leaning   86.19311125579516
but let us first sit down to table for here comes the servant to inform us that breakfast is ready   50.30340058174655
oh we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin is a glorious monument   133.78330732749734
i will keep it for myself   160.75559269059272
a few convulsions of rage which she could not suppress paid her debt of feminine weakness to nature   152.4693781901206
do not believe what albert is telling you countess   106.12457583640611
that is an important point do you understand   101.41683341653459
i too cried mousqueton saw them also   186.28708603227096
she departed last night   96.86522404056623
but they may catch him yet   83.3051633814978
i shall meet with a victim   4.072574459111664
he simply wrote nothing to be done   119.83387853047428
you may easily imagine with what eagerness i welcomed him and how minutely i related the whole of what i had seen and heard   94.6670651228739
the sun is not shining said morrel more alarmed by noirtier s expression than by valentine s indisposition   47.2940430653981
what was   94.88434195193824
you said you had an idea said athos   106.99614740182288
do i   91.82098484514246
the unfortunate barrois has been poisoned said d avrigny and i will maintain this assertion before god and man   5.750139332660552
but i must discover who pursues me with this hatred and when i have found him i shall kill him or he will kill me   38.35725768578682
said the banker   71.69053768421979
he kissed her hand tenderly   123.93360641925682
indiscretion oh you make us happy by giving us an excuse for expatiating on this subject   117.62829270793891
but though he hadn t strength to speak he had enough for action   91.38907399464263
nay said the count   78.69321279028364
he had learned that the pretended message from anne of austria upon the faith of which he had come to paris was a snare   85.28195216142325
in fact night had come on during this conversation and with night the storm which had been threatening for the last half hour   92.40437779184329
that is enough   194.81012856840124
see here are two similar letters to that you have yourself received   143.99907086103042
not for a stranger said debray but for a friend i might perhaps   92.78021591243473
yet you have need i believe to be guided in the adventurous career you have undertaken   144.09703270454796
what must i answer   182.83283539212516
when i call you chevalier it is in presenting you to my guests that they may know who you are   133.1613245361495
and we porthos said d artagnan will return carrying our shame to the cardinal   205.4029525728666
i shall pass over them   117.01354047786207
ask yourself wherefore after rescuing the infant from its living grave you did not restore it to its mother   220.46162159394777
but deuce take me if i understand at all   115.1949224382105
on the sea   166.79145809938123
but this letter in which he recommends you to me   79.79480978733024
you may make your mind easy said the doctor   108.83396604611293
d épinay can not leave the drawing room at present   80.40857975529205
ah yes i understand said mazarin   113.41176541919383
and even if she were to be seriously offended i could well understand it   140.03475430371884
but what is the meaning of all these questions   129.66026029834237
he had read different accounts of his death but the story seemed to acquire fresh meaning from the voice and expression of the young girl and her sympathetic accent and the melancholy expression of her countenance at once charmed and horrified him   125.27821091253759
you do not wish to hear it perhaps   156.95676816230917
and i was reflecting on what my instinct had told me in the darkest corner of the stable when a man wrapped in a cloak and followed by two other men came in   188.03424259217155
planchet stopped short staring at d artagnan   147.1674539355414
and who knows it   110.44490154680332
and if you were at rome the house of thomson french would make no more difficulty about paying the money on my receipt than you have just done   31.69227602883801
they have rarely been successful   195.02495953147798
which seems to me to leave no room for doubt since you are dressed as a cavalier and not as an officer of musketeers   100.6052072984584
silver simply round coins with the head of some monarch or other on them   104.19578505690606
he did well   20.597008121841526
on arriving at the rue des prouvaires the curate pointed toward the square before the church   160.81224527396137
i want to know what crime i have committed to be tried   104.19547061315234
nevertheless this morning she looked handsomer than usual for her eyes had all the sparkle inward satisfaction adds to expression   93.15867897006152
ah said the priest in a marked italian accent   163.60598563361702
that house is one inhabited by my friend and that friend is aramis   56.229640839128265
read it   113.23127920807002
i have fired since in that manner and have been quite successful   5.105322335311399
i was so bewildered by your departure and so overcome with grief at our separation that i am sure i was able to but very feebly express all the affection and gratitude i feel toward you   93.0853393067931
so much the worse for thee for harm may come of it   45.68578860517134
however we shall see   126.06031473066332
felton listened without uttering any word or sound except an inward expression of agony   154.64396439708813
i choose that which the red headed boy is leading   135.84707559865296
indeed sir said andrea i assure you i have never given the subject a thought but i suppose it must have been at least two millions   193.03016371386752
calm and resolute he treated any peril as he would an adversary in a duel calculated its probable method of approach   71.74812654749732
and the troop continued their route   172.36912028018253
that was that he should kill me   142.08344413171432
it fit his finger as if made for it   74.54749884013208
the peak of monte cristo reddened by the burning sun was seen against the azure sky   41.61393499753872
his brain was on fire and life and energy returned   94.05464796068384
anxious as you may suppose i was to behold and comfort my dear sister i lost no time in hastening to corsica but when i arrived at rogliano i found a house of mourning the consequences of a scene so horrible that the neighbors remember and speak of it to this day   91.89898594418358
or should we pause   126.31752062095175
and the commencement of the reign of king louis xiv   189.94093896340644
fortunately sire said m   154.13399825378275
morcerf did not pursue the subject and monte cristo himself fell into a silent reverie   195.46683824598628
in ten minutes the masters slept   83.2253175521811
what are his means of existence   20.70951982124734
but i have not seen your father   51.91760420458043
then extending his hand towards one of the pistols he said there is one for you and one for me thanks   37.9477116322868
and teresa was frivolous and coquettish and thus the embroidery and muslins the cashmere waist girdles all dazzled her and the reflection of sapphires and diamonds almost turned her giddy brain   119.75017710933979
the king looked around him   135.15282632555892
in france   150.93522402988796
i have a son   125.17808268215748
well let us hope he will do something for the sake of their honor said the queen   102.78744091722312
come this way and let us know when the wedding is to be for fernand here is so obstinate he will not tell us   125.34553677845597
one evening i went according to custom to a house which i frequented with much pleasure when one is young what can be expected   37.904559315925695
oh no your excellency he is not the devil replied the host with a grin of contempt   96.78416502787405
everything goes as if in flowery paths   110.72511300819409
the three friends for as we have said athos had sworn not to stir a foot to equip himself went out early in the morning and returned late at night   209.4298423944506
there only his memory returned to him   140.36990220334633
and be not concerned for your expenses or for those of your mule   159.087825637394
he s gone right by the road to the vieilles infirmeries   112.29150353227523
not to be found   139.52429748100894
each examined his arms and put them in order   100.70804844766577
it is not from mistrust that i request you to follow me but for my security   69.0024852081172
then along toward the fourth year came the expedition of franche comte   117.39104311347974
cried the poor tutor   139.95302349485402
porthos replied aramis i have had the occasion to observe to you more than once that you are very indiscreet   91.41169678823968
private secretary to a minister plunged at once into european cabals and parisian intrigues   92.42088807028922
since said d artagnan they have friends who ask it for them   150.78411135296668
you see madame how rightly i spoke when i said i required a preceptor to guide me in all my sayings and doings here   166.16240543633825
well since you will grant me no more i must be content with what you give me   58.412375967028396
there it lay stretching out into one interminable line of dust and sand with its sides bordered by tall meagre trees altogether presenting so uninviting an appearance that no one in his senses could have imagined that any traveller at liberty to regulate his hours for journeying would choose to expose himself in such a formidable sahara   99.16189432384527
now sire resumed aramis listen to me   126.69989460780668
nothing more moral   56.257744133023735
what the deuce can you expect   128.4636199259573
his comrades believed that his vow was fulfilled   58.50804399240456
she had not even one little flower she whose apartment had been a conservatory of costly exotics   125.61559652928594
so saying he leaped into a boat desiring to be rowed on board the pharaon where m   97.01737237571281
d artagnan meantime went into the house whistling a tune which he had begun before porthos went away   84.2191979281943
i have not said good morning to you monsieur d artagnan he said   92.24235321338399
their halberds were leveled at him threateningly   161.92159576904146
the cab crossed the pont neuf and entered the rue de harlay by the place dauphine   107.95330434632321
but then you know paleness is always looked upon as a strong proof of aristocratic descent and distinguished breeding   72.80898870866896
let us drop the subject and adopt the middle course of delay which implies neither a rupture nor an engagement   100.17293915634565
as for denying that i am your nephew you will think twice about it now that i have learned some things of which i was ignorant a year ago   81.71200664325784
he is an admirable man said the major   86.9131244609631
and he went right to the prisoner   24.7494229946072
i am very glad to see that you understand the value of these papers   81.29454222487819
and it was very evident that if leaders of the people were not provided all this agitation would pass off in idle buzzing   110.97025402640462
but nobody replied to him not even an echo   87.81702668948455
de boville took the paper danglars presented him and read received of baron danglars the sum of five million one hundred thousand francs to be repaid on demand by the house of thomson french of rome   93.22522311012405
our friend albert de morcerf countess whom i left in pursuit of his unknown about seven o clock this evening said franz and whom i have not seen since   95.44792400179199
still five days before us   154.90149587956557
monte cristo felt his limbs tremble   37.2397303718388
you accuse him then   153.38175461589725
tell me sir he said to the sergeant do you know those three gentlemen who are just gone out   99.160778439649
it is rather unkind i acknowledge but it is true   149.87536165123777
because it has instilled a new passion in your heart that of vengeance   143.5392621052504
d artagnan is right said athos   138.68923756270047
i am something of a physician and have like my fellows sought more than once for the soul in living and in dead matter   79.33942871418435
very probably answered the count   80.82999467324407
oh mercédès i have uttered your name with the sigh of melancholy with the groan of sorrow with the last effort of despair   113.03744291964937
he says he is german my lord replied raoul   147.39554088880072
indeed count said morcerf i thank you sincerely for having used so much candor towards me and i gratefully accept the exclusion which you propose   61.82162504992889
man proposes and god disposes   211.23929456329967
it is possible that the influence of the place the charm of the beautiful evening the fascination of your look the thousand circumstances in short which sometimes unite to destroy a woman were grouped around me on that fatal evening   199.23330831790705
monsieur de gondy   58.0815240273104
which you refused   118.99413363861368
then perceiving for the first time the garb of the traveller he had to entertain caderousse hastily exclaimed a thousand pardons   111.30846911056133
edmond had one friend only and thus it can not be divided   76.14321572520447
franz entered the hotel   120.45515620940293
but i found you proud and blood thirsty and i left you in the hands of god   117.09374985348693
and if you and i dress ourselves as neapolitan reapers we may get up a striking tableau after the manner of that splendid picture by léopold robert   113.74932736191627
my daughter mademoiselle danglars   158.48634801153457
she likewise charged me to tell you that she still loved you   77.46610494234761
milady breathed a deep sigh and fainted   159.63911774368466
villefort had only just given utterance to a few incoherent sentences and then retired to his study where he received about two hours afterwards the following letter after all the disclosures which were made this morning m   175.24564036771625
it was to ask your advice in the unhappy dilemma in which we find ourselves   151.38318352735013
there monsieur there is that letter   29.47612817807976
i remember that at the castle of rueil the cardinal richelieu had some horrible oubliettes constructed   203.42381213245636
noirtier looked inquiringly at his granddaughter   148.70535077056726
but you suppose scenes in a manner which gives them the appearance of reality   66.42926362692414
but parry withdrew thinking he was dreaming   156.54938411730606
this is all very well murmured the king yes this is just the account the duke gave me of the affair   152.26249088981268
she had recognized the voice of d artagnan   75.41664096769874
but let us leave off this strain sir if the tone of it is displeasing to you   120.68983982005453
let me overtake him   129.09975882806407
but has one ever seen such a wild fellow continued he making himself a mazarinist and helping to arrest broussel   91.27292375435161
but you would do better still by not going at all   180.69543554624784
said he that man would henceforward lay down his life for me   137.12869937775133
a firm and well practised hand was engaged in cutting the four sides of a pane of glass with a diamond   179.73985858214823
to whom is it addressed   79.15355426648142
did you ever hear of such an idea   70.01970108806421
the attention which we have been obliged to give during the commencement of the chapter to the illustrious personages we have introduced into it has diverted us for an instant from him to whom anne of austria owed the extraordinary triumph she had obtained over the cardinal   120.58859891136154
athos and aramis placed themselves behind him   170.0339995981224
well if you are really afraid monsieur planchet resumed d artagnan i will go without you   151.15830752753533
better for him in future that he should be supposed never to have seen me   113.02753001668034
he soon heard the clatter of the iron step of the hackney coach then the coachman s voice and then the rolling of the heavy vehicle shook the windows   60.1359840413184
captain leclere did not before he died give you a letter for me   157.8816865344001
valentine by means of her love her patience and her devotion had learned to read in noirtier s look all the varied feelings which were passing in his mind   105.00267080246854
i am not referring in the least to matrimony and i only addressed myself to m   109.31963700161339
0105m well i must detain you some time longer but i will strive to make it as short as possible   163.02655252812605
what does it signify to you if i am murdered   61.36564685861407
your name is celebrated your position magnificent   66.49852517290502
to be sure said porthos with majestic common sense   145.02599080690106
it is impossible that your majesty can make all this ado about a letter written to my brother   208.1464227361169
the snare is rather maladroit for the cardinal replied the young man smiling   136.88032482270603
trembling his hair erect his brow bathed with perspiration he counted the seconds by the beating of his heart   142.1010973487569
to lift their hands against a minister of god   25.955860960630005
cried the procurator s wife bursting into tears   99.99564288569022
the king saw the four gentlemen come in but appeared to take no notice of them   192.12905914458304
but cried dantès it was a hundred and forty francs i owed caderousse   0.9431527583901556
debray to whom she had run with the first instinct of a woman towards the man she loves and who yet betrays her debray could but give her advice she must apply to someone more powerful than he   122.18382998367986
formerly they believed themselves sprung from jupiter and shielded by their birth   109.056690061728
the queen reflected for a moment and then seeing the cautious demeanor of the musketeer perhaps you like repose   131.9016599295654
now i travel a great deal particularly on this road and i wish to see all innkeepers making a fortune   131.45457103683273
your emotion has quite overcome you   160.29550427434873
yes monsieur said the englishman bowing   99.58925952478475
for she had a wonderful way of dressing as a man that dear marie   134.0968015248626
friendship throws out deep roots in honest hearts d artagnan   75.02634100488972
20269m yes i do remember replied the countess   50.76661908678191
three cries for help came more distinctly to his ear   76.05164175831538
you see my strength fails me   89.07807248487097
no count of monte cristo added debray   83.58299894479572
debray had told you ah yes   114.92210380160928
it is useless then to attempt anything with him   142.38340271083354
and they finding their remarks useless regulated their pace by his   197.25847974639498
with the deputy s knowledge of crime and criminals every word the young man uttered convinced him more and more of his innocence   75.10160971934133
and the senator s robe which napoleon cast on his shoulders only served to disguise the old man without in any degree changing him   22.961822932842736
and what was the end of the affair   124.29187765318969
section 5   157.88759435418498
a telegraphic signal improperly interpreted owing to the fog was the cause of this error   98.11743805032334
this woman is one of the cardinal s spies i am sure of that   82.60407866583375
so that he wears the ribbon not as you would think in his waistcoat pocket but at his button hole   147.92665017721498
the audience chapter iv   210.11877374115107
athos sighed deeply   126.44353145360705
they were surrounded by a crowd of people who opened a way for us to pass when suddenly my mother having looked closely at an object which was attracting their attention uttered a piercing cry and fell to the ground pointing as she did so to a head which was placed over the gates and beneath which were inscribed these words this is the head of ali tepelini pasha of yanina   154.85929231818136
but at all events i gave him absolution in articulo mortis   85.53874743158259
to my great regret mordieu   126.4424047662973
the favorite of two kings immensely rich all powerful in a kingdom which he disordered at his fancy and calmed again at his caprice george villiers duke of buckingham had lived one of those fabulous existences which survive in the course of centuries to astonish posterity   76.76739557146882
nothing is more simple   126.83647881540108
and you would be right my friend   144.49449292315583
no i use your generosity that s all   123.79328941897467
morrel in demanding justice for crime   161.36644778174553
without waiting for my coming out again   133.25642284920332
danglars surrounded by deputies and men connected with the revenue was explaining a new theory of taxation which he intended to adopt when the course of events had compelled the government to call him into the ministry   92.47004723436049
but being wounded in the right arm he was unable to write and therefore the count de guiche acted as his secretary   58.22969554231926
ah that would be easy enough i would give her a lesson   140.7598058601569
d artagnan thought of all these matters   161.64948901706788
aramis affected a laugh to divert the attention of certain curious listeners and perceiving that athos had betaken himself to the embrasure of a window and remained there he proceeded to join him throwing out a few words carelessly as he moved through the room   166.12682758491508
yes he answered if a fortune brings consolation i ought to be consoled   133.78062333167088
he knew me that man did and did not doubt an instant   159.08568602513895
suddenly the boat leaned on one side beneath a new and unexpected weight and grimaud uttered a shout of joy   107.15336982744115
morrel had agreed to meet him   30.799611076287775
adieu gentlemen said the count   99.0608445511667
we shall see better what is going on   102.77453759490325
so much the better for him he will suffer less said the inspector   123.85356290630489
she was walking with her nurse marceline in the place where the woodmen cut the wood when passing on horseback i stopped   143.70356223484825
i will take it in the turkish style replied franz   90.0207004102492
where does he come from the end of the world   152.9772661296076
come come my friend interrupted the marquise do not neglect your duty to linger with us   180.69359778166972
on two of my shirts   161.99721316780207
my dear fellow it is perfectly ridiculous stupid   129.81577376211672
my sword is shorter than yours it s true but bah   136.30076378850762
by that letter which my comrade has in his pocket   24.845636621200086
as a misfortune necessary to the welfare of england   39.139720515312774
she rose   88.41166177976976
i can not throw the loop through this partition nor move with a pack thread a cask of wine which may perhaps weigh two hundred pounds   62.741804130725185
what said athos no fish at a seaport   220.16528619306325
and you my dear companion said he you speak of the baronesses countesses and princesses of others   151.39882907653063
edmond talked to me a great deal about the old man for whom he had the deepest love   97.94862699025933
porthos raised his terrible fist which whistled through the air like a sling and the portentous mass fell with a smothered crash on the insulter s skull and crushed it   171.52036160823312
they deputed ten of their number to wait upon the duke of orleans who according to his custom affected popularity   130.75497881746958
it follows from this that the king s attorney be he who he may with whom i should have to deal would assuredly be more embarrassed than i should   80.45426970619897
to avoid meeting him my mother and i left town   104.16332040395272
this scene so enchanted the duke that at the moment he forgave grimaud for his part in it   180.85475430445575
i have a passport and my clothes are ready packed said morrel in his tranquil but mournful manner   134.24826396373382
by heavens exclaimed monte cristo starting back it is ali raised his hatchet   91.63771985200584
106 and good bye to my dream of resembling the retired baker   166.81858970591261
he offered his hand to the baroness who descending took it with a peculiarity of manner imperceptible to everyone but monte cristo   130.07792953573113
a child   80.45567285829858
albert rose and took his hat   189.7020110991392
bonacieux with an energy of which she might not have been believed capable   130.1653808137628
an hour had passed since the sun had set when franz fancied he saw at a quarter of a mile to the left a dark mass but he could not precisely make out what it was and fearing to excite the mirth of the sailors by mistaking a floating cloud for land he remained silent   76.27387563279682
trees appeared in the darkness like great black phantoms chasing one another   83.07905031663213
athos went to pay a visit to madame de vendome left his name at madame de chevreuse s and wrote the following letter to d artagnan dear friend i am about to set off with aramis on important business   112.09721398996508
and indeed the little note and pin upon the table confirmed or rather corroborated the sad truth   105.41017416099142
fernand smiled piteously   123.8974265245642
in a moment all the bandits were on their feet and twenty carbines were levelled at the count   75.22285114799217
no was the old man s reply i will not leave this house for my poor dear boy loves me better than anything in the world   175.7520119511667
albert de morcerf inhabited a pavilion situated at the corner of a large court and directly opposite another building in which were the servants apartments   109.29399160635245
de sable mme   162.95177006773582
a high wall at the angle of which was the pavilion ran along one side of this lane and on the other was a little garden connected with a poor cottage which was protected by a hedge from passers by   141.49315321191114
de tréville to the others as may be perceived   186.99839021581002
monte cristo in taking the seat morcerf offered him placed himself in such a manner as to remain concealed in the shadow of the large velvet curtains and read on the careworn and livid features of the count a whole history of secret griefs written in each wrinkle time had planted there   71.91553112969396
and i think a glass of wine will not be disagreeable to you   103.1620895486763
yes there is the sky   107.32055709199449
it is your place to seek the assassin   168.18836703377906
i have something to say to you   105.33117322105673
knowest thou not that it is the custom of these soldiers to act thus and that it is usual for the regiment to form themselves into two solid walls when the king goes by   122.57286915615194
my friend here monsieur du vallon shares my gratitude for he was particularly hungry   121.45606819529
she was at length appeased and the conversation turned upon him while kitty was assisting her mistress   127.94212744770442
at ten o clock athos with his habitual exactitude was waiting on the pont du louvre and was almost immediately joined by lord de winter   211.30318996694302
porthos bowed to his friend   24.47913449915623
if you know why don t you tell   136.78337825083037
moreover he had this advantage he was master of the count s secret while the count had no hold on franz who had nothing to conceal   79.88431567744932
the pope therefore blesses with the fingers   121.1110804236458
i should be sorry to advise you in the matter   200.59405456578347
as we shall probably meet with him again in the course of our history it may be well for our readers to be made at once acquainted with him   72.76213092854927
he will speak to me of god and death as he has spoken to many another dying man not understanding that this one leaves his throne to an usurper his children to the cold contempt of public charity   72.30658311356254
but there was more difficulty in arousing porthos   127.96013166644066
we will see where it leads to   126.60409005999051
here i am said he   62.264944466236685
well and what does it signify whether it was he or i   45.52253777296765
however much the ballet might have claimed his attention franz was too deeply occupied with the beautiful greek to take any note of it   98.29233259490617
directly my father caught the sound of your name he turned round quite hastily and like a poor silly thing i was so persuaded that everyone must be as much affected as myself by the utterance of your name that i was not surprised to see my father start and almost tremble   170.5929256663858
do you bring me tidings of my guardian   75.23591549970618
i will not make a confidant of him   108.92686983601558
said porthos looking around   118.9989324808065
you marry a money bag label it is true   92.14010758900427
and i for my part have a somewhat hazardous expedition for this evening and shall not be sorry i confess to fortify myself with a few glasses of good old burgundy   181.247963936234
did you know them   70.64072169253717
i have just received my courier from greece said danglars   62.64100857822839
a galley slave escaped from confinement at toulon   61.98032663362987
neither can we procure horses   150.75715651869024
i answered mazarin i shall not sleep at all   29.616063633265313
the first movement of d artagnan was to return it but milady added no no   65.01198766959658
the aperture was finished and athos passed through it carrying the clothes destined for the king wrapped in black cloth and the tools with which he was to open a communication with the king s room   94.37214391708952
we have the gates   21.85196962994496
and i monsieur de chatillon   135.34122277249975
if on the other side it was not she which was still quite possible for the little light that remained rendered a mistake easy might it not be the commencement of some plot against him through the allurement of this woman for whom his love was known   115.89559277226671
what fault do you find with the fellow   111.7946784462889
cried she two thousand livres   60.313209008389585
we shall save you another time as we have done this only with a better chance of success because we shall be able to command every requisite assistance   18.10964819992573
the days of expectation are long and d artagnan in particular would have wagered that the days were forty four hours   103.9705276380684
in passing through the gate the hilt of the lieutenant s sword was caught in the grating and he was obliged to pull off his cloak   124.10122012310816
each time you have applied to me said the doctor it has been too late   167.78906191255106
nearly nine o clock why i shall not get back to beaucaire before midnight   148.1815817182897
have you no friends who could assist you   129.07514255685808
gentlemen said the man who was young and pale bowing with ease and courtesy pardon my curiosity but i see you come from paris or at least that you are strangers at boulogne   74.8167313894256
how had he discovered her arrival and caused her to be seized   118.34992458398737
and what is the origin of this name   110.90679594762068
but what danger threatens him then emmanuel   153.62048208243982
and moreover my dear duke continued the minister of police we are almost assured that in a very short time the usurper will be insane   50.50379788645097
only added he with a smile i warn you i know very little   136.17423857140602
two young gentlemen who were on their way to join the army and the name of one of whom i heard his companion mention the viscount de bragelonne   175.06070696344682
woe to them if it be so   119.57099058149589
may i reckon on you as an auxiliary   150.1222767869731
you have brought me something   115.00618760306934
to morrow rather said de chatillon if you will take the trouble of coming so far as the gates of charenton   170.2547492569559
yes it is i my uncle i the son of milady i the monk i the secretary and friend of cromwell i know you now both you and your companions   155.08195722262005
her eyes first flashed and then swam she staggered towards the door and disappeared   152.44955364182857
but at all events we have seen by the anterior developments of this story that buckingham had the advantage over him and in two or three circumstances particularly that of the diamond studs had thanks to the devotedness of the three musketeers and the courage and conduct of d artagnan cruelly mystified him   107.35625148190759
nay indeed your excellency   124.0003768944108
still it belongs to government and i ought not to waste it   39.201003554973866
the minister of police thanked the young man by an eloquent look and villefort understood that he had succeeded in his design   101.3420711806027
d artagnan who was accustomed to his friend s manner of acting and who perceived immediately by a word a gesture or a sign from him that the circumstances were serious took athos s arm and went out without saying anything   54.788926569657484
yes replied eugénie   90.0480505613812
come here there is nothing to be done with him whilst we may perhaps be able to save the other   113.08396345986755
d artagnan in the meantime had taken the head of his detachment without a word and with that ready and profound obedience which marks the character of an old soldier   108.637325121722
it would be fatal to his interests   77.16961453771165
but you see that the angel whom you hoped for has left this earth she has nothing more to do with the adoration of men   77.88609988416164
a moment later friquet went out carrying in his hand a large leather bag   116.6779353843437
i do not know if the result will be as agreeable as you describe but the thing does not appear to me as palatable as you say   119.69463221290252
sir said he with compressed lips and flashing eyes you have not the presumption to instruct the comte de la fere and myself what we ought to say here   148.26622357846514

flattery was at that period very current and m   125.32841584657773
this devil of a fellow he muttered shaking his head   106.60372272438097
i fancied that i still heard faint moans and imagining that the unfortunate jeweller might not be quite dead i determined to go to his relief by way of atoning in some slight degree not for the crime i had committed but for that which i had not endeavored to prevent   88.11332928619663

he knocked and it opened immediately to admit him   118.94876338032148
that is to say you refuse to serve me monsieur said the cardinal with a tone of vexation through which however might be seen a sort of esteem   58.936982242173976
but let it be done explicitly and positively   136.87507125896803
the queen saving us her friends   97.49229615433015

father and son m   132.56671392134893
d artagnan uttered an exclamation of surprise and indignation   91.80592548066647
but suddenly he recoiled and placed his right hand on morrel s breast   74.3549806129896
i have affairs to settle   51.77227592483621
except you athos who never had one   46.36660923907027
they were numerous and inauspicious   99.30054286244444
oh my friends said d artagnan you come once more to save my life not only mine but that of these gentlemen   196.57953176175732
it is impossible to understand the music of his country better than prince cavalcanti does   157.22950717888386
he had not long to wait for the queen scarcely remained a quarter of an hour with mazarin but this quarter of an hour of expectation appeared a century to him   68.30708332736866

good morning benedetto said bertuccio with his deep hollow voice   191.624735113226
when he reached the summit he found himself stopped by a hedge upon which green fruit had succeeded to red and white flowers   108.10615946627644
now that i have the word of athos i can set out   46.14094752055074
said every voice   55.970606979766
as soon as she heard the cannon which announced the fatal event she had ordered the anchor to be weighed   94.01627249650642
had he escaped we should either have seen him or have heard him spoken of   97.33142578591125
at this moment the door was opened and having questioned the servant the officer learned that master broussel was at home and at dinner   158.66770716742948
dantès turned and perceived that they had got out to sea   186.04900147300253
when left alone with bernouin mazarin was for some minutes lost in thought   114.30951214795742
there remained then no other place to fear but the traitor s cross   118.1462479592644
dantès gazed on the man who could thus philosophically resign hopes so long and ardently nourished with an astonishment mingled with admiration   118.2806236052071
you are to marry the daughter of danglars   55.4299633958358
answer me   45.911257451129
dantès recoiled from the idea of so infamous a death and passed suddenly from despair to an ardent desire for life and liberty   73.67861922000415
but one evening about five o clock our little cabin boy came breathlessly to inform us that he had seen a detachment of custom house officers advancing in our direction   64.859089982927
because he has made his will in my favor   160.3708476181433
baptistin entered and remained standing at the door   143.61338695938383
cromwell is mighty mazarin is tricky but i would rather have to do with them than with the late monsieur mordaunt   85.88423803514846
murmured the monk shaking his head   74.6814815452702
from avignon to marseilles seven francs   97.1802223366656
one day however an emissary of the cardinal s gave him to understand that he was wrong in receiving the coadjutor so often   67.39888208628412
de villefort was not only a magistrate he was almost a diplomatist   127.76660239959827
yes said madame de villefort   166.1186920664118
madame de saint méran two months since   96.02908018011368
her majesty did me the honor to grant me that favor   64.24539849518064
said milady placing a bag full of louis in felton s hands   121.10674748953643
you will breakfast with me will you not morrel   98.1492560871169
she only witnessed the withdrawal of the arm the fair round arm of a woman but twenty five years old and who yet spread death around her   188.8711362685845
oh yes she exclaimed i recognize the flavor of my nocturnal beverage which refreshed me so much and seemed to ease my aching brain   100.98934366463794
i have known you four days   124.18093841388259
ah he is not a man like that cursed d artagnan   150.61325034162306
in fact the young man appeared at the gate covered with dust entered the courtyard leaped from his horse which he consigned to the charge of a groom and then went to greet the count and d artagnan   164.6431726186887
fortunately the reader may remember or may not remember fortunately we have promised not to lose sight of him   70.62348993753588
d artagnan and cahusac sprang forward at the same instant the one to recover the other to obtain the sword   95.94995592679041
but you answered porthos seem to me agitated   104.07433871643391
he called them food for cannon which was precisely all they were good for   104.19832612297196
you can come he said and led them back to noirtier   153.80845147815256
i am from the country   81.28392535543045
luigi threw his cloak on the ground placed his carbine on his shoulder and freed from his heavy covering preceded the traveller with the rapid step of a mountaineer which a horse can scarcely keep up with   122.05976558335642
chapter 47   119.30978467348717
well then i appeal to m   139.35388889201076
cried selim   141.8458995867472

well i rely upon your promise   117.63614175389668
i have not the strength of mind you have or rather that which you would not have if instead of my daughter valentine your daughter madeleine were concerned   89.53487454684083
he said making a sign to the queen who was evidently going to issue a severe order   120.52990591271445
and there are no doors by which you can escape this time but those of hell   87.13255447036931
and however i may be honored by your friendship my worthy friend if once the extent of our intimacy were known i am sadly afraid both my reputation and credit would suffer thereby   58.360566981872
let us go and have a game at tennis la ramee   130.00517843570495
did you say he was coming   102.17976043647106
do you understand what i mean   27.934952053793765
said athos to himself is it indeed possible that i hear what i hear and that i see what i see   77.8324138717528
d artagnan then saw that the young woman took from her pocket a white object which she unfolded quickly and which took the form of a handkerchief   131.62123563047984
his boat had proved herself a first class sailor and had come the distance from genoa in thirty five hours   127.19475645206909
broussel   37.83428881581504
bernouin bowed and retired   122.98866043087764
but these 200 francs   97.08310638713925
athos was seized with a kind of vertigo   188.84699444768384
perfectly comprehending the meaning of the question   144.33183379487915
milady had had time during the whole day to trace her plan of conduct   118.68595284628282
his eyes therefore were fixed in a sort of agony upon the door through which the king must enter   78.13195189903847
oh no replied caderousse that i can answer for you did not   235.25639305721657
man does not appear to me to be intended to enjoy felicity so unmixed   172.90491985257535
we have forgotten to mention that the count s coachman was attired in a bear skin exactly resembling odry s in the bear and the pasha   97.63458200839322
do you think it can be a trap that they are laying for us   12.94702447219018
i was now safe for i could swim along the ditch without being seen and i reached the canal in safety   80.44703265689432
cried jussac advancing toward them and making a sign to his men to do so likewise halloo musketeers   115.20905067485532
yes but i know also that monsieur le comte de la fere arranged that you were to remain with me and that olivain should return to paris   118.31793833109997
but your honor will soon be called so generally   180.23812591570356
porthos shrugged his shoulders   144.0539760149259
i assure you i shall be very much in the way in that little boat said mousqueton   21.535892738318807
but you also know that with the help of god men have often conquered the most terrible demons   136.72028751264793
a thousand pardons gentlemen   126.52937632632288
i made it as well as this larger knife out of an old iron candlestick   149.0261058100497
but he stopped short and could not be made to move a step   75.5786609935663
the nurse was engaged in watching the chemical analysis and villefort was still absorbed in grief   73.0594415787821
all my fortune is in the funds   173.01107850523366
yes i have heard that death is in that house   128.74055603007076
that word ill becomes my faded lip now but it is a memory dear to my heart and one that i would not lose for all that the world contains   103.94247178016944
but as to love there was not a single word about it in all the letter   76.35058672842788
i wish to do madame all that your majesty pleases   143.50848464803465
he did not move as he heard it open and the door keeper pronounce the words walk in madame and then reclose it   111.54084772433929
as happy as possible   60.66868295901759
i believed your heart noble enough to enable a friendship of twenty years to overcome an affront of a quarter of an hour   8.84839373079987
fernand gave a groan which resembled a sob and dropped his head into his hands his elbows leaning on the table   112.57259163093171
i appreciate your calm reasoning   43.304055296987585
he was quite alone   191.17972812608198
and on my part it would be a real happiness to withdraw from public affairs   109.92816384974783
but the horses were all used up   191.83053518007966
d artagnan was a man and he would have considered it unworthy of a man to give way to his feelings   58.8862512622325
kill a woman   140.67626041122747

half past twelve he said   137.1442622038009
battle   116.85636130513059
athos was about to retire   145.194572624444
how once   151.38450682105486
one was writing and the other praying when the door opened   125.10643023444692
0151m and who told you this fine story   146.72178417249032
who then are you   77.44922782474525
the abbé lowered the shade   128.17165433577642
but i excuse it it is impossible to expect the son of a girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven   57.91714404322603
the greater the amount the more flattering it is to you   132.50601245638592
then the duke said openly that his dog had been killed by a drug with which they meant to poison him   149.80502877449737
you know maximilian grandpapa once thought of leaving this house and taking an apartment away from m   104.69451521572009
she inquired   116.77333167907338
i recognize the coadjutor by his frondist hat   99.02458790456173
i shall find him there   70.53551533598207
and mazarin buried himself so far behind the two friends that he disappeared completely hidden between them   93.83741137187967
we are under mazarin s orders   111.59618581770869
the devil take this gout   61.598186731348285

the bustle which had been observed by henrietta maria and for which she had vainly sought to discover a reason was occasioned by the battle of lens announced by the prince s messenger the duc de chatillon who had taken such a noble part in the engagement   194.21209321312415
whom do you mean by they   115.58664961570646
the boat grounded on the fine sand   155.8206659201357
and not more than justice either you ass   121.37588845538941
yes said athos by his own nephew   157.33686216525408
yes yes make your mind easy he shall be decently interred in the newest sack we can find   127.7366314424676

then the pope and cæsar borgia invited the two cardinals to dinner   114.35148382519728

50181m the president called for the indictment revised as we know by the clever and implacable pen of villefort   132.73638067429658
indeed the last three days some odd adventures have happened but what is the matter   167.99627474793198
i would beg of you who see so completely to the depths of things and to whom the greatest mystery seems but an easy riddle to explain to me how it was that i underwent no second examination was never brought to trial and above all was condemned without ever having had sentence passed on me   49.78107986232478
but it is not that which i wish to speak of but a secret i have to reveal of the greatest importance   128.78857633667133
grimaud is a well bred lackey   81.53977424852465

in the morning it was rumored that prince de condé had evacuated bethune and fallen back on carvin leaving however a strong garrison in the former city   100.08483397348873
i have certain apprehensions well what is the meaning of that   96.26859835236843

buckingham remained for a moment dazzled   122.17597099801517
ah i forgot said louis smiling in a manner which proved that all these questions were not made without a motive   165.92077325411123
athos collected himself and in proportion as he did so d artagnan saw that he became pale   125.35557419698131
cried d artagnan furious nailing him to the earth with a fourth thrust through his body   146.2615255637813
i will repair it indeed i will my dear porthos   161.8232310756054
she made for her the scandalous chronicle of the lords and ladies of the court whom the abbess knew perfectly by name touched lightly on the amours of the queen and the duke of buckingham talking a great deal to induce her auditor to talk a little   165.33903120031266

there is only the comparison of one state with another nothing more   146.63305563793205
the young peasant girl at first timid and scared soon recovered herself   109.09108592187962
let us speak of m   58.01368430132949
you tell me he burned the letter   145.17910697601627

morrel went out called baptistin and whispered a few words to him   168.29914794363012
i am just setting out for blois   114.0339649478909

danglars turned to the left   103.36177574365327
the queen saw this and doubtless her maternal heart translated the emotion for addressing raoul again and no evil has happened to the young count de guiche   61.69978228707144
he made his way along the corridors through force of habit   132.84552468491086
endeavor to remember the names of those faithful servants who crossed the channel in spite of monsieur de richelieu tracking the roads along which they passed by their blood to bring back to your majesty certain jewels given by you to buckingham   102.454586082748
that is acting like a good fellow   127.5339616744449
yes monsieur replied raoul   144.7437637895432
and now when i see the fruition of my wishes almost within reach the power i hold in my hands bursts and shatters me to atoms   134.04163198336462

then he became alarmed and dared not stay any longer at nîmes so he solicited a change of residence and as he was in reality very influential he was nominated to versailles   103.8744323913832

milady had already rung her bell and roused the whole hôtel   34.70565329096178
the dog raised and dropped his paw six times   119.54530349596173
it is my duty as your host returned albert ringing the bell while lucien turned over with his gold mounted cane the papers that lay on the table   159.58482848268216
and the wounded man sought to recall the features of the person now before him   123.0719882020878
then she will give me some sign or other and i shall know what i have to do   134.5474319433364
yes keen and cutting politeness   210.79771383336424
from her majesty   131.80683230712157
copies were put up at the corners of the streets   57.285894260859365
then as he rolled on the ground his adversary seized him by the hair and struck him a third blow in the chest   117.69761872540558
and athos bowed to d artagnan like a man who wishes it understood that he would not be sorry to be left alone with his thoughts   113.8469431276093
did you see it all   148.82294983853768
we are the poor succored by god   72.31252169319505
she was fearful of exciting any remark and believed firmly in her daughter s innocence and fidelity to the paternal roof   10.276681555118557

oh heaven said valentine   105.59688400122442
that s fortunate   98.44675670701626
there was a crowd on the pier   85.76819587521861
there was once in the rue des tournelles a house known by all the sedan chairmen and footmen of paris and yet nevertheless this house was neither that of a great lord nor of a rich man   123.07809335552679
to these were added about fifty little vagabonds from the papal states who earned a pittance by diving into the tiber at high water from the bridge of st   68.23009727135077
danglars in promoting a new railway line   213.27549093826235
morrel smiled sadly   121.48569728527201
rest content with my friendship for i say once more that is all i can promise and i will promise no more than i can bestow   83.41652669218843
de monte cristo is apprised that this night a man will enter his house in the champs élysées with the intention of carrying off some papers supposed to be in the secretaire in the dressing room   86.34057107747248
at this announcement of a battle having taken place the princess opened her mouth as though to ask a question of interest   134.3186257136645
as he left the queen s presence bernouin summoned him to the cardinal   92.33952095452489
are you quite sure of it   120.4298521267653
hardly was he concealed when the little bell sounded   87.91595142004775
no one had entered the house since i had left it   117.58754574030014
he said to his friend   92.22754189948891
you see i have not yet received the ring true said my mother   137.18579450604327
he reminded me of it telling me if i did not pay for you he would be paid by m   124.4285650905949
ten minutes afterwards villefort reached his hotel ordered horses to be ready in two hours and asked to have his breakfast brought to him   12.158342006680485
i might not always be content with that answer replied the visitor for i come from one to whom everyone must be at home   129.4879366223729
there was certainly enough in all this to turn a head only twenty three years old and mme   79.18164946463516
besides it doesn t concern me   197.74040527603594
the matter was all explained to him and the friends gave him to understand that among all his high connections he must find a place for kitty   111.93001035462291
return then at five o clock and bring that worthy monsieur du vallon with you   111.61376466063045
the question of carrying the city by assault though often debated in the council of the king had been always rejected   142.376715790208
jussac anxious to put an end to this springing forward aimed a terrible thrust at his adversary but the latter parried it   43.053524875664664
danglars leaped into the carriage like a young man of twenty   64.92761608445687
because as i said without you i can do nothing   135.06022614143865
it was long since he had any reason for his morning s inspiration but he always slept all night long   116.1510682315026
and he offered a chair to madame danglars which she accepted for her heart beat so violently that she felt nearly suffocated   123.32582778680987
sir he cried scarcely able to believe his good fortune sir i can not understand your generosity   160.54131338410028
it is the declaration of cardinal spada and the will so long sought for replied edmond still incredulous   128.21041696757905
whether it belongs to you or another you may perhaps stand in need of it   161.207394211674
mercédès was the only one awake in the whole settlement   90.34299178642917
he remembered how at the louvre he had often seen as she passed by him in the full radiance of her dazzling charms the beautiful madame de longueville   92.15759662345232
have we not on our side the conqueror of rocroy of nordlingen of lens   147.88706371368832
and twenty violins were ordered and the price for them fixed at double the usual rate upon condition said the report that they should be played all night   159.22997184826895
then when i shall have learned what i desire to know i will withdraw   109.95657635847931
his attention was engrossed with what was passing at the count s and his only aim appeared to be to discern every movement in the dressing room   69.323600460585
athos did not lose sight of the two speakers   128.27894379238492
holloa there   133.7705892666943

biribi   66.43794137265094
here i have a garden laid out in such a way as to afford the fullest scope for the imagination and furnished with thickly grown trees beneath whose leafy screen a visionary like myself may conjure up phantoms at will   123.08345598389161
which is the nearest way   128.02164411744988
i must and will see him again   119.55300101059127
am i am i then to sleep on the floor   99.80181880851224
cried d artagnan finishing his friend s sentence   153.41365067457411
immediately a brilliant light from the next room or rather from the palace adjoining shone upon the room in which he was gently gliding into his last sleep   117.33132357424394
i shall be at vendin to place it in position   160.68049978045272
the horses which were more kindly used than on the previous day stopped at arras at four o clock in the evening   122.38925380697195
my master has ordered his horses at eight o clock precisely   126.46666900516321
d artagnan and athos refused them   120.17261196665942
cried athos going toward him i ll cut your ears off   146.41275236666678
his desire for revenge had not forsaken him   75.9491461111948
if you went to spain would you not see the bull fights   61.62673275237184
if on the contrary i die remember maximilian my corpse is that of an honest but unfortunate man   186.92370133121386
d artagnan came again on the morrow and the day after that and each day milady gave him a more gracious reception   178.64342609302236
the englishmen were all men of rank   117.2912112406629
they were rapidly leaving the château d if behind   123.49049297543432
au revoir said the musketeer making a sign to grimaud to uncork the bottle he had just brought   138.64852748771057
but for the moment let us do as did the amorous gascon   168.1949171808701
and then he a wanderer on the earth a man without fortune a man without family a soldier accustomed to inns cabarets taverns and restaurants a lover of wine forced to depend upon chance treats was about to partake of family meals to enjoy the pleasures of a comfortable establishment and to give himself up to those little attentions which the harder one is the more they please as old soldiers say   79.44502419439064
there s a carriage coming over yonder   111.3374859526528

when he drew near to the bedroom door monte cristo expected that he was coming in and raised one of his pistols   157.11989363567605
lastly her hair which from being light in her youth had become chestnut and which she wore curled very plainly and with much powder admirably set off her face in which the most rigid critic could only have desired a little less rouge and the most fastidious sculptor a little more fineness in the nose   98.00795754898112
but i hope governor that you will show him all proper respect in consequence   99.64816334570881

chapter 26   139.12814815590244
this musketeer had just come off guard complained of having a cold and coughed from time to time affectedly   136.43205943088492
your mother will add to them a recipe for a certain balsam which she had from a bohemian and which has the miraculous virtue of curing all wounds that do not reach the heart   142.7611048703688
it was four o clock when dantès was placed in this chamber   142.03011362407779
you must have time to recover yourself   164.93649588238998
monsieur porthos said the procurator s wife will you have the kindness to offer me your arm for five minutes   47.64020030024376
i passed the day and the night in prayer for i hoped that god would pardon me my suicide   50.826458363992025
what can have happened then to bragelonne   84.7076471908129

make way for us planchet said d artagnan in a whisper to him or he will not arrive alive   97.67109807012744
what have you seen   142.57889301807234
well then before going to beauchamp with your witnesses seek further information on the subject   161.20661058232147
this is a boy tréville a mere boy   101.84003805050476
well sir said andrea bowing to the banker respectfully may i hope   156.44136690469955
d artagnan dressed himself and athos did the same   113.66526183546976
it was a grain of a reddish color which dissolved immediately   126.52557985730414
day was just dawning   106.74047761415463
the brigadier and two pioneers fell dead   74.37398558840219
tis not one man not athos only not the comte de la fere whom you will ruin by this amiable weakness but a whole party to whom you belong and who depend upon you   163.3804102492922
the two sailors redoubled their efforts and one of them cried in italian courage   151.5571581106289
it is evident enough to me who am always at his house   75.9984130123896
at that moment aramis entered   135.5252832874472
the queen sprang to the window   131.46932197512842
but notwithstanding this precaution which was in fact taken rather against others than against him he at once recognized his usual guide the light and intelligent mme   174.59957144845515
words might be heard at a distance through all these open doors   164.63298765321247
he has said it and will do it   66.26112373426764
unhappy girl replied eugénie unhappy girl do you say sir   46.63220516912267
who dismissed madame de hautefort that friend so loyal that she refused the favor of the king that she might remain in mine   60.1187844450652
said porthos as if disgusted   74.84247601271392
there was something mournful solemn and terrible in the count s manner   121.70177061366776
well said caderousse i should have sworn that he turned to the right how treacherous wine is   122.91669493924798
he hit him but once but as he had foretold that hit was a mortal one   82.97222551067996
aramis by a movement of his lips endorsed athos   117.78771552583042
they laugh best who laugh last   88.92955036204651
a terrible vision the cardinal leaned his elbow on his manuscript his cheek upon his hand and looked intently at the young man for a moment   112.49468160441981
beware of giving anyone the clue to your griefs   200.74357502795544
the duke in his turn bowed and an imperceptible smile appeared on the face of grimaud who kept behind la ramee   143.4084310889999
the knife was bent against it   119.92452487953274
bonacieux would be accused of having introduced her lover into the louvre that was all   147.72525459056777
monte cristo resumed the perusal of the letter and who only needs one thing more to make him happy   96.27669985418102
d épinay said he allow me to remind you at this moment which is perhaps not so ill chosen as at first sight may appear for obedience to the wishes of the departed is the first offering which should be made at their tomb allow me then to remind you of the wish expressed by madame de saint méran on her death bed that valentine s wedding might not be deferred   162.915715849975
we left paris each with seventy five pistoles in his pocket   199.04957086374054
will your majesty pardon me said planchet but is it really the king who is lying there   114.93978043668632
we must have a carriage   207.52579285005214
are you armed   107.93503392224868
i know well demon that you have penetrated into the darkness of the past and that you have read by the light of what torch i know not every page of my life   93.89292908708151
just as you please gentlemen provided we set sail he said   100.76256373698769
if you be a priest i conjure you in the name of humanity to follow me to aid this man   114.16155535881921
he was free from the slightest headache   102.04300716102087
monsieur de beaufort or monsieur le prince   210.4642523708011
besides her majesty had said ladies wait for me and she did not dare to disobey the queen   111.17174533337463
a saddled horse was fastened to the window shutter   152.54951438534178
then turning to athos he continued and this gentleman is that noble comte de la fere whose high reputation is so well known to your majesty   149.75678775396528
this mystery required an explanation   176.49930591925528
let me think a moment   90.23524302768294
and you say that by his will he leaves me five hundred thousand livres   143.7144560192674
and he took the gibbet and shaped it out as neatly as possible   70.82868395713471
her mouth was mute   118.7385832727311
enter my sister said the queen   114.81931078106044
you see i am obliged to economize in case your prosperity should cease   118.65306060858461
then monsieur takes his horse back again said the englishman   189.49606401705262
i not only promise but swear it   146.69464631960437
at the sight of the stranger m   107.37343836078983
on my word said franz you are as wise as nestor and prudent as ulysses and your fair circe must be very skilful or very powerful if she succeed in changing you into a beast of any kind   89.83704727919998
true said aramis   101.12831461399973
yes she is still beautiful   148.97227433995914
suddenly d artagnan looked up and in his eyes there was a gleam which scarcely even porthos observed   55.29189551227584
i know it from my wife monsieur from my wife herself   109.23632252022017
that would be to denounce herself   90.5510678471224
you were saying this were you not   60.386419028670936
i have been so for many days   142.6572632292819
eugénie covered her face with her hands   130.91277309560496
all the past was effaced from the eyes of this woman   126.98951244738859
and they all looked with astonishment at this man whose eye now disclosed an intelligence and his body a vigor they had not thought him capable of showing   69.76371527662369
to tell the truth count if i knew less of you i should think that you were less brave than you are   86.37580531931746
de saint méran madame de saint méran m   119.1815245671581
two hours after he again landed at pianosa where he was assured that red partridges abounded   157.8186064413606
20303m ah said monte cristo the evening of the 3rd of june 1829   137.13663010667443
he was dressed in a common gray blouse and velvet cap but his carefully arranged hair beard and moustache all of the richest and glossiest black ill accorded with his plebeian attire   118.96634857127269
i have no hope of penetrating sword in hand to paris i know that well   153.16339974018388
the second commissary was as much bewildered as the first had been by the simple and firm declaration of the musketeer upon whom he was anxious to take the revenge which men of the robe like at all times to gain over men of the sword   164.6382682928532
the prince had supplied him with fifty light horse not so much by way of guard as to show the deputies how readily the queen s generals dispersed their troops and to prove that they might be safely scattered at pleasure   143.68127797533495
but carlini felt his heart sink for he but too well knew the fate that awaited her   75.03183673337261
but when he learned that the unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who followed him he breathed again   53.417200786608056
without a blush men made their way in the world by the means of women blushing   117.87524386232803
i fancied myself despised betrayed   89.8700319250506
but my mother no not my mother   61.157909690068315

everyone listened eagerly   117.06523636235673
my death believe me will not be the end of this atrocious misadventure   75.5504614444882
a hat with wide brim and a cane   58.497576012940456
the ball was not a musket ball it was an arquebus ball   126.42695135822545
the duke had been five years in prison and now to him looking back upon them those five years which had passed so slowly seemed not so long a time as were the two days the forty eight hours which still parted him from the time fixed for his escape   67.41573547719364
too late by a minute   112.8480522727713
with what an air he says all this muttered beauchamp   13.56608640561899
five minutes afterward he entered the hotel of la chevrette where pretty madeleine the hostess came to him   45.524588151036156
for the assassination itself i had never felt any remorse   172.98492590857933
i shall endeavor to be prepared for all suppositions   125.48607694701055
we found the pasha calm but paler than usual   170.1068402551182
valentine the hand which now threatens you will pursue you everywhere   90.79214712932264
vast clouds covered the heavens concealing the stars   115.37757982862463
there may be   96.61442732416606
you were at the festival of your marriage   159.51057744554524
rob your master eat his sweetmeats and drink his wine   164.4868235160498
but it is not the less true that you have this year received 500 000 livres   62.39654527251134
and am i not a hundred times better thus   97.71173380828071
but he went on with his peculiar smile i am here in paris and have plenty of time before me by and by will do for that   77.09239692098879
what did you do then   115.92413034743804
what do you want me to do   76.6078217830418
at the end of a quarter of an hour however surprised at the length of the journey she leaned forward toward the door to see whither she was being conducted   103.07839647517154
cried d artagnan and do you suppose i suppose monsieur that you are not a fool and that you knew very well although coming from gascony that people do not tread upon handkerchiefs without a reason   200.5219791385614
allow me to take a glass of water in your apartment   62.156406806694314
lord de winter perceived nothing of this   131.5405050927583
while retracing the past i forget the present   123.72459083844265
beauchamp left the box perfectly amazed   184.7927422216481
oh madame said mazarin your majesty knows not what you ask   63.77569909451929
but the duel will not take place edmond since you forgive   101.08506380255173
the cardinal trusted him and therein found his advantage   82.33353119625464
but wait   115.85755575152326
come said monte cristo this cross seems to me to be wisely awarded   175.78334324371033
at two o clock   145.2857142543359
the king made his way through the crowd without a mask and the ribbons of his doublet scarcely tied   106.85285135713298
swear   80.97190628485262
d artagnan a little recovered from his first surprise had now leisure to study costumes and physiognomy   58.22929025366014
yes count and charged with a commission for which i beg of you to accept my excuses   146.23564318883405
so far so well answered planchet alighting and extending his arms to mousqueton the two servants embraced with an emotion which touched those who were present and made them suppose that planchet was a great lord in disguise so highly did they estimate the position of mousqueton   180.94280393268193
la mazzolata gentlemen said the count of monte cristo as he entered i pray you excuse me for suffering my visit to be anticipated   212.1870468959179
i am a dead man he said and fell from his horse to the ground   161.06381184506856
carlini s teeth clenched convulsively   148.07378443039713
as soon as the noise of the hoofs was lost in the distance d artagnan remounted the bank of the stream and scoured the plain followed by his three friends directing their course as well as they could guess toward london   154.20549841419296
by a letter addressed to you from the island of elba   17.644144527564762
well said franz to albert do you know what is the best thing we can do   163.29865947287738
you make me young and happy again by it   20.980657395761895
enchanted monsieur said mazarin venturing his head out of one of the windows   64.88160754993717
noirtier for it was indeed he who entered looked after the servant until the door was closed and then fearing no doubt that he might be overheard in the antechamber he opened the door again nor was the precaution useless as appeared from the rapid retreat of germain who proved that he was not exempt from the sin which ruined our first parents   83.41866787722071
alone in his usual room lighted by two candles the condemned monarch gazed sadly on the luxury of his past greatness just as at the last hour one sees the images of life more mildly brilliant than of yore   102.8057222349267
having given this vent to his ill humor the baron became more calm   96.76034605452618
but d artagnan will discover one   186.76770113929263
if you do not take great heed they will destroy you   190.72820846504948
his terrible story is recited in the chimney corner and a shudder is felt at the description of his transit through the air to be swallowed by the deep   141.62405755654336
monte cristo reflected one instant   133.77465816778988
one would have said that he longed to break through the wall of glass which separated him from his enemy   28.98646814769708
let s sit down to table and take something to strengthen us for the night   77.49283064610499
the heart of the young gascon beat as if it would burst through his side not from fear god be thanked he had not the shade of it but with emulation   141.4303497288992
go and try   158.09328715890865
yes a telegraph   116.5885140310593
the challenge chapter 88   190.8957114265229
under the name of athos   158.62420385585253
nothing was changed   99.9740869719538
why in passing through lilliers you will send me your chaise with an order to your servant to place himself at my disposal   89.06708166884066
the prisoner muttered a few words in a foreign tongue   120.02179602468621
carefully closing the box door ali placed himself before it while a crowd of spectators assembled round the nubian   85.48040897889959
a false telegraphic despatch it is almost impossible for wrong signals to be made as they were in the last two telegrams   145.54978020896533
then aloud the friend of that wretch is capable of everything   90.36746086690742
since i have arrived at years of discretion and become my own master i have been constantly seeking him but all in vain   149.2469196680602
said lord wilmore with that tone which is only known to natives of great britain   136.39041303600658
mouston   102.32467815522129
de villefort who considers him already as one of the family   180.24889385353228

never did a man deeply in love allow the clocks to go on peacefully   150.57191739137818
go said he quickly   28.177753639722667
then was heard that second cry not so loud as the first and followed by a long groan   197.64366020939943
will bazin go with us   105.53184339473034

scarron s house   115.0853811745398
you mentioned a fowl i think   173.88074768525337
i must calculate our chances   132.66609689033874
so they said   172.93589793708526
yes a horse   273.6209886501586
madame de saint méran s last request was that the marriage might not be delayed   92.0624826055249
albert kissed his mother s hand and drew near the count   1.1037283502801216
we shall be beaten again and must die on the spot for on my part i declare i will never appear again before the captain as a conquered man   129.14640958200462
is all safe m   67.72671197087348
grimaud and blaisois are holding your horses ready saddled   97.18829740520951
how much may it amount to   114.96398810154359
the heavens were hung with black and the gigantic structure of the château d if seemed like the phantom of a mortal enemy   152.44945765133008
one has never the last word with such a man   89.56003808160685
he was standing his arms folded near rita who was still insensible   83.18432751909819
conceal nothing gloss over nothing   112.79912661555835
yes said danglars taking it from beyond his reach   71.91490923797286
dantès employed it in manœuvring his yacht round the island studying it as a skilful horseman would the animal he destined for some important service till at the end of that time he was perfectly conversant with its good and bad qualities   113.74764901275654
allow us to observe in passing that in this fight perished the baron de chantal   111.6162587886455
come said he laughing there are all my hopes about to be destroyed   161.26269840951474
quite so said albert if the way be picturesque   115.63759290811956
mordaunt recoiled   159.31067597483596
of course you know you can do so   84.18977280178497
do you think i am going to change the life i lead for your mode of existence my agreeable indolence for the hard and precarious toil you impose on yourself exposed to the bitter frost at night and the scorching heat by day compelled to conceal yourself and when you are perceived receive a volley of bullets all to earn a paltry sum   56.66885351819468
d artagnan and planchet mounted and took the road to st   110.11241829185255
but he had not been able to catch more than a few vague syllables without any positive sense when a sonorous and short cry made him start and attracted the attention of the musketeers   137.44954804529678
wait a moment sir said he   101.36144026416603
i pardon you monseigneur   66.02667255138337
but he did ward them off said de rochefort and the reason was that though he had bitter enemies he possessed also true friends   149.05428422844162
i was very far then from expecting the change you have just informed me of   134.80257687885504
but my reverend replied aramis a little amazed by the shower of arguments that poured upon his head   130.56606813267425
then a double concussion was felt and two of the wheels seemed to pass over a round and flexible body   110.85083958166896
and this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old jacobin noirtier   79.72858332654977
but what if i am not liberated cried he and am detained here until my death   233.3176036174424
inquired vampa of the sentinel   57.320287896638625
grimaud had only to make them a sign to go away and i am convinced they would have left us in peace   53.39819831217231
the pistol is blind   113.84429188905322
but nowadays they are not inviolable   69.81532000017027
thought milady   152.50750211135767
then we will follow yonder cavalier   183.61218746222153
and now leave me monsieur bertuccio to walk alone here in the garden   170.40513879899038
he remained silent his eyes fixed upon the light   119.34476003851412
powerful memories were stirred within them by the sight of the round tower fort saint nicolas the city hall designed by puget 28 the port with its brick quays where they had both played in childhood and it was with one accord that they stopped on the canebière   139.43965349520826
but the ransom of that immense treasure buried under the gallery to which one descends on pushing a spring hidden in the wall which causes a tub to turn revealing a staircase must not one speak of that a little my lord   149.1375369027292
you have found out that there is something worth having about this large gentleman   101.03141518184697
i could not bear to see her suffer   70.96866571303073
where have you come from my dear count   143.91053163149732
a dinner in the old style   175.43560278422413
he held out his hand   118.04245014024728
orders were given that no drum should be beaten no trumpet sounded   123.13191633635692
exclaimed athos turning pale   139.48451547701018
0267m chapter 21   167.98000409509842
what we want replied one is to communicate to you the will of his highness   28.15778118646118
and did my husband know i had been carried off   128.70204356994503
caderousse counted and again counted the gold and the notes then handed them to his wife who counted and counted them again in her turn   150.31327918038764
i have traveled sixty leagues in forty hours and by tomorrow at midday i must be in london   114.37683602735379
holà aramis   108.8270536192012
de monte cristo or m   88.99798965088864
if i am not mistaken those are citizens helmeted and mailed armed with good muskets as in the time of the league and whose eyes are so intently fixed on this window that they will see you if you raise that curtain much   74.67044584573063
he instantly began to climb up the slope of the moat on the top of which he met de rochefort   172.2258674650183
he glanced around in order to seize on something on which the conversation might turn and seemed to fall easily on a topic   78.78697246236857
do not quit his salon until you have seen me   100.43895560234893
when he closed his eyes he saw myriads of lights dancing before them like the will o the wisps that play about the marshes   104.28187073311601
they do indeed   83.87744213959913
ah monseigneur   163.07183102673824
yes had i died years ago   174.95285470510368
they were untouched   23.342577541272277
watch her arrival for she has great and terrible projects   118.84794151544637
oh father   155.80716992190318
but urge the king strongly not to stand on false generosity   46.73695903408134
this lasted several minutes until the frightful overturn of reason was accomplished   172.25125308580763
de beaufort did not venture to draw the cardinal s fat face   107.3164131823021
that our sentinels have seen this movement and i have been left unacquainted with it   71.57957066887833
porthos would have found it very difficult even to make him see that he was dying of hunger   170.45210779731198
the tower contained implements such as spades rakes watering pots hung against the wall   161.83226056590732
to this question de guiche could not respond   59.16341650593029
twice a day he cast out through the barred aperture the provisions his jailer brought him at first gayly then with deliberation and at last with regret   65.13724973669746
no entreaty no proposition of increased wages could induce them to remain   58.60289877181108
porthos was ruminating over an excellent dinner he had just demolished   116.35103625161801
said lord de winter to felton who was being dragged away with his eyes turned toward the sea   69.41534540147697
yes returned aramis   95.32787571948658
what were you saying   107.21085867588614
if he comes   124.9309946221506
this advice was to the jailer s taste as it spared him the necessity of making another trip   80.81587397273415
i asked after you and came up as soon as i could   64.7932331760924
sir said she it is superfluous for me to tell you that valentine s marriage is broken off since it was here that the affair was concluded   161.1977731420699
by the way said bazin where was he carried   140.15837808753813
you know my dear count said he the ceremony is to take place this evening   117.71649551796749
and as if acted upon by a spring she bounded toward the baron who awaited her attack with his arms crossed but nevertheless with one hand on the hilt of his sword   107.49512998114692
it is possible said milady   193.22997186648422
see if the young man with the black doublet and the short hair who was with me just now is still in the palace   146.2196129521565
what do you think should be done asked athos if we have no news of them to night   159.5398068420668
i left it where i found it monsieur   128.78007690436328
we are not on duty and we believed that not being on duty we were at liberty to dispose of our time as we pleased   153.0078430670468
i had no previous knowledge of your visit had i   169.08743002232
then fixing his eyes upon grimaud with a singular expression the dying man uttered the last death rattle and expired   123.4392987191609
pledge it then   95.39183242981045
although drawn downwards by the heavy weight which hastened his rapid descent it seemed to him as if the fall lasted for a century   103.77011380246128
the curate then entered followed by planchet   68.16220726344355
no gentlemen i have kept the harness said porthos   159.4383759028233
then they began to pass around the dusky piquant arlesian sausages and lobsters in their dazzling red cuirasses prawns of large size and brilliant color the echinus with its prickly outside and dainty morsel within the clovis esteemed by the epicures of the south as more than rivalling the exquisite flavor of the oyster north   121.4530064000027
at the expiration of ten minutes aramis arrived accompanied by grimaud and eight or ten followers   66.51550348837067
you see said danglars he fancies himself captain already upon my word   159.9124122602495
if a second traveller had passed he would have seen a strange thing a shepherdess watching her flock clad in a cashmere grown with ear rings and necklace of pearls diamond pins and buttons of sapphires emeralds and rubies   65.75943454319363
but what of that as long as carmela was safe and uninjured   114.24551027155786
i shall tell him therefore and in doing so i shall confer a personal favor on him how he is mistaken in regard to me   108.0433172339584
you remember said the count during the most profound silence that the unhappy wretch who came to rob me died at my house   127.72038134635713
in the hour of rest between noon and one o clock galley slaves having a nap after dinner   84.71646081110823
the drawing rooms were decorated with the rarest pictures by the old masters the boudoirs hung with draperies from china of fanciful colors fantastic design and wonderful texture   12.311616883115889
the grating against the library door aroused the young girl from the stupor in which she was plunged and which almost amounted to insensibility   178.3506658568191
see said beauchamp pointing out morrel to debray   117.27980423520462
would you rather die then and cause maximilian s death   63.14530598500389
five full casks   135.7075401043145
the two gentlemen were obliged therefore to get off their horses and take a boat   138.58315344031413
the three friends ordered breakfast and went into a room in which the host said they would not be disturbed   16.16032418276319
the young man read valentine s letter twenty times in the course of the day   143.35301972853478
d artagnan even fancied he could recognize amid this strange disorder fragments of garments and some bloody spots staining the cloth and the curtains   97.75453852650519
the frondeurs will have a treaty and your eminence must sign it before us promising at the same time to obtain the queen s consent to it   91.38712873868819
are there any magistrates or judges at the château d if   185.80305196855096
and so saying mazarin extended his hand to the officer who sighed as he recognized the ring so gracefully given to him by the queen on the night of the ball at the hotel de ville and which she had repurchased from monsieur des essarts   23.184408430628437
from time to time caderousse darted on his wife keen searching glances but rapid as the lightning flash   134.39486968435318
do not fear there is our safeguard pointing to the bed   138.94168856720904
she is there said he   79.70066784142548
the sergeant answered that puritans never drank and put the crown piece in his pocket   199.9546311293471
because you have not yet invited me   161.96621494558883
replied aramis in a tone of resignation   146.6227804733411
sebastian instead of receiving them in my humble abode in the rue du helder   184.4947513583192
cried aramis with an emotion very rare in him   82.8134530452025
a secret voice whispered to him at the bottom of his heart that he was but an instrument of vengeance that he was only caressed till he had given death   123.32784339403372
yes athos i know what you mean we shall do very well at the parpaillot   111.41931800604684
i may sleep perhaps at an inn   194.86569308571353
you would have been abducted and conducted back to paris   72.16985862114532
d artagnan offered his arm to mme   157.65626625630796
at length with the help of his two hands he lifted himself from the bench and found himself on his feet   163.59644759710903
you have perhaps some jewels you would like to take   154.80146442977812
but kings and queens are strange beings and have odd fancies   125.74637197930814
then when they had finished they cast the earth over the corpse until the grave was filled   109.46751590947254
i madame   99.24183386309859
he is your man do you say   80.23497631312013
i was about to become an abbé and all was arranged   112.07869323871063
i must speak to him about it   91.35093302010847
repeated danglars   69.40446027337681
that is another matter   87.31105799664516
and madame de villefort cried baptistin   119.47807379949126
and d artagnan rushed into athos s chamber   78.28478986985347
the camp had entered saint omer   148.10112710613356
faria had dug his way through fifty feet dantès would dig a hundred   49.36760739564228
then having removed a plank from his floor and nothing remaining but a simple ceiling between him and the room beneath in which the interrogatories were made he heard all that passed between the inquisitors and the accused   148.64948904186497
confided to me it shall never escape my lips   61.85372193178167
ah monsieur you may take my word when i tell you anything   159.48160674340377
however he did not yield but calling up all his fortitude said i will not swear   94.64393313130027
because you have had strength because you have had trust in god and god has sustained you   44.50309063245116
he then made a sign for mousqueton to come to him   113.64626727747034
the troops about to embark were marching toward the sea   122.87410406311298
he has come   18.89742303760191
it was the way in which he spoke   87.02290601862536
i have loved him four years   123.94878119363244
it was la carconte   146.22128083823245
so you see in what a situation i am   171.52468412188824
the comtesse de winter with whom i had quarreled became reconciled to me at that ball   165.75596370448815
i do not know my age for i have not counted the years i have been here   125.57694582037999
you had friends albert   114.9426622068894
d artagnan requested the servant to wait in the next room and when the door was closed he sprang up from his bed and read rapidly whilst porthos looked at him with starting eyes not daring to ask a single question   68.51363607421219
no my lord replied the impassive young man   116.45376766402427
let us try what we can do then said the notary   47.77282531749496
no but i have just met with a terrible adventure   159.13240721535516
40080m no replied haydée he did not dare to keep us so we were sold to some slave merchants who were going to constantinople   142.36045280659303
no returned monte cristo i only guessed   113.86784593212785
in the first place you have plenty of money haven t you   39.57694203132188
young men take advantage of it against the time when you may be in command   139.5071318410504
you see i give you a wide range   26.86510992429703
cried morcerf it is your fault   184.54484395855604
now then do you wish for anything else   153.9718859611599
unfortunately the negotiation failed and when he returned to defend his benefactor he was dead   123.78231914017016
by no means my dear duke   110.77516757169072
if you are attacked by day or by night fight but retreat without shame   74.37670755276679
on seeing the appointed signal groslow who had at first crept behind one of the cannons planted on that spot walked straight up to the gentlemen   121.90227752998375
he pointed out to him the bearings of the coast explained to him the variations of the compass and taught him to read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call heaven and where god writes in azure with letters of diamonds   4.0241950333736725
with forced composure he dipped the pen in the ink and wrote the following lines upon a sheet of paper i have no money to pay my bill but i am not a dishonest man   128.4635319890834
at length an honorable peer morcerf s acknowledged enemy ascended the tribune with that solemnity which announced that the expected moment had arrived   100.13332419589271
well before dying i wish to see my son in law   127.67891863175942
all was quiet but on returning from m   167.1253643825797
cries were heard from the interior of which they could not comprehend the sense   104.15795200426082
you can not take me for a commonplace man a mere rattle emitting a vague and senseless noise   170.5711028053401
the brigands have never been really extirpated from the neighborhood of rome   117.4441761361275
no your enemy is conquered since we know her and you will live valentine live to be happy yourself and to confer happiness upon a noble heart   119.53778935474799
but her heart beat with joy and secret hope shone in her eyes   151.17596706002524
why do you not realize a six months a year s advance even and retire to brussels   97.4836821764195
oh if my mother were still living there would be nothing to fear maximilian for i would tell her that i loved you and she would protect us   123.9738678879914
this charge was so fierce so skillfully conducted that chanleu was almost surrounded   203.48367597160308
i don t at all understand you but i believe all you say to be true   153.5771913567491
there were three gates to open before reaching the inclosure each by a different key   93.2368794377559
on what shall i reflect   154.11281283751225
the queen immediately exhibited strong emotion   146.2985065802729
hold your tongue you stupid fellow   136.52768847192834
then he returned and still unable to believe the evidence of his senses rushed into the grotto and found himself before this mine of gold and jewels   101.07152017309866
i think it is kept a secret from grandpapa noirtier that the contract is to be signed this evening   108.58937927475131
delighted with this assurance the governor countersigned the passport and delivered it to d artagnan   132.87410446211965
this apparition was so strange and so solemn that everyone rose with the exception of carlini who remained seated and ate and drank calmly   75.67948017164464
remain then sir   29.914730930945083
the sailors had again hoisted sail and the vessel was once more cleaving the waves   190.53229681078818
yes i would do so   24.64818376507118
and as he spoke these words with a hoarse choking voice he staggered towards the door which was mechanically opened by a door keeper   160.18813811737454
he would care very little about it i think   91.11812356535533
he will not return till after the taking of the city   163.41014083634525
then all the members looked at each other with terror   129.00588821808523
plaints made in common are almost prayers and prayers where two or three are gathered together invoke the mercy of heaven   179.747670982542
said my father to his palikares   67.80827561856557
just as you please my lord   187.01309729203808
at rome you spent fifty thousand piastres in furnishing your apartments but i presume that you are not disposed to spend a similar sum every day   108.92255342217675
from 206 they have risen to 409 in three days and the prudent banker had purchased at 206   55.28024082036147
these bravoes who resuscitate in our epoch the traditions of another reign are troublesome   89.75984241969624
although i am very much afraid that your good wishes will not be of great service to me   107.74947238710035
asked porthos filling a second glass of wine   193.5396700851062
yes hell has resuscitated you continued athos   59.62105577957117
continue to be the good sweet girl you are at present and i have great hopes that heaven will reward you by giving you emmanuel for a husband   109.85302333566032
as monsieur porthos is a very boastful man he insists that nobody shall know he has received this wound except the duchess whom he endeavored to interest by an account of his adventure   99.0257216257399
we take him to the other side of the french frontier and offer him hospitality at bourges   78.69119078999361
all eyes were turned towards this man for to all except athos he was unknown   144.708229057289
we are judges of wounds we old soldiers athos added smiling   122.76176626238681
in returning with the comte de la fere and monsieur d herblay our crime would be confirmed   118.54841723572122
he caused me to be instructed gave me masters and when i was thirteen years of age he sold me to the sultan mahmoud   187.16046401707302
said d artagnan i beg you will have a care what you say   110.72644692122836
that imbecile lacked but one thing to become a cardinalist   130.4157008629197
who wants me   175.9652802161707
not i   97.67296773096079
but all at once as if undergoing the influence of an unspoken thought the countenance of the cardinal till then gloomy cleared up by degrees and recovered perfect serenity   75.60528751120988
how many guns gentlemen   92.42268160122066
said the priest with a show of interest glancing round as he spoke at the scanty furnishings of the apartment   134.24343272560847
morrel took the purse and started as he did so for a vague remembrance reminded him that it once belonged to himself   129.86684878462745
tell me at least who you are   78.13902426145422
besides the worst that could happen to him would be the punishment of which we have already spoken and which the philanthropic french revolution has substituted for being torn to pieces by horses or broken on the wheel   81.09033740884574
d artagnan i am ready to follow you   157.56835317012093
the horses upon which we were mounted were bought in paris   38.160106359461224
he is then the same englishman whom i met at ah yes indeed   98.898143249643
this is modesty indeed   126.95715794313202
contrary to the custom of a man so firm and decided there was this morning in his personal appearance something tardy and irresolute   121.08048846224673
the dog turned his back to the cane   114.06089834160102
are we alone   152.58119931772367
wait a moment no threats if you please m   113.38953830061992
dantès fell on his knees and prayed earnestly   151.4671305413774
every career is open to you   91.69901490450636
oh no it is as simple as possible replied monte cristo   141.68889087704903
is she beautiful   35.299002594110604
but the story of the crab made a great noise through the interior of the donjon and even outside   45.98471545280371
wait madame continued athos what remains for me to tell you is even more strange than what i have narrated   124.5786126634378
the part of an honest man full of courage and real regard   117.10024374576304
there is very little amusement in the cloister and the good superior was eager to make the acquaintance of her new boarder   51.886798725488596
we shall have time afterward for the usual compliments   72.27238182312934
bonacieux to the chamber of examination   110.87266817488401
have you a heart   91.64808964461034
at the first glance d artagnan judged that the mind of the king was stormy   113.04014365413839
it is true that my father will be equally angry   74.91068860391002
however stupid the royalist police may be they do know one terrible thing   68.95762934889883
and on my part said d artagnan i wished to speak of you but i find you so completely detached from everything   40.47232244193397
as i know that you do not like to ask money of your friends i offer you some of my own accord   218.85912045002522
is your honor sure   134.88342938349282
you ate it   32.604443137959436
continued morrel answering his own thoughts   123.36610714922585
dantès from his rocky perch saw the shattered vessel and among the fragments the floating forms of the hapless sailors   77.73987775338361
he is afraid and retreated before the bayonets madmen are not afraid of anything   0.7093541651183699
i should like to say something evil of mazarin   109.80338483825773
30147m chapter 57   146.2637468584544
after going about thirty paces he smelt the appetizing odor of the kid that was roasting and knew thus that he was passing the bivouac   129.24756211879546
hitherto i have fancied myself merely waging war against circumstances not men   136.0904882765003
every day at nine o clock in the morning the priest and the boy sat down on a bank by the wayside and the little shepherd took his lesson out of the priest s breviary   94.8647019598378
your affectionate anne buckingham collected all his remaining strength to listen to the reading of the letter   61.91201190135682
to good principles   186.4357551048504
to be overwhelmed with insults and ignominy   88.87243690215203
all went well till they arrived at chantilly which they reached about eight o clock in the morning   31.65470624737742
do you think i love you   87.78042797573171
in the meantime i remain here   158.2905022303675
said château renaud phlegmatically   114.42163449996376
this place if monsieur d herblay can procure the key is the best that we can have was the answer   131.60702679543198
michael which came from my husband   120.19308145467966
but that is not an answer   181.34966909866225
i say what i think   117.6139636947373
yes interposed porthos four hundred pistoles   158.2647944248385
this soot i dissolved in a portion of the wine brought to me every sunday and i assure you a better ink can not be desired   154.7558644818687
at this moment a little boy half peasant half foot boy came to announce supper   48.699980938067434
tea play and the conversation which had become interesting during the discussion of such serious affairs lasted till one o clock in the morning   86.93876638607736
d artagnan summoned anne of austria s servant and signified that he was ready to follow him into the queen s presence   92.85708289944833
but tell me my dear sister replied he what makes you come to england   41.25499553012092
perfect madame as you have seen replied the count   66.96555414507759
planchet had followed the road   102.6789186672165
whose is that letter of your mistress   119.09437632558345
he double locked it took the key returned to the bedroom door removed the double staple of the bolt and went in   155.70289956567598
explain yourself count   224.64150201041335
the hinges of the door creaked and a man appeared in the dress of a cavalier wrapped in a brown cloak with a lantern in one hand and a large beaver hat pulled down over his eyes   108.17638164183805
they had not mistaken the gravity of this event for the moment after morrel had entered his private office with cocles julie saw the latter leave it pale trembling and his features betraying the utmost consternation   26.087587757562318
then putting forth his arm he pulled the bell   111.12161448904462
ah monsieur i have not here as i had there the ponds of monsieur le prince where i could catch those beautiful carp nor the forests of his highness to provide me with partridges   139.59157302362112
tis his custom   77.41331931629091
it is like the golden cloud in which the messiah went up into heaven   66.29767774534773
five hours after that he passed through arras   171.7361436389275
at two and twenty to be thus famous   239.8674659244865
his only fear was that milady would recognize in him the man of meung and of dover   76.63336670645816
these were the counterscarps and bastions of athos which the besieged himself demolished   93.45040724650339
if by any good luck you lay your hand on a certain man named mordaunt tell porthos to take him into a corner and to wring his neck   106.25728608672783
asked madame henrietta   112.58212991839972
your excellencies are aware responded the landlord swelling with importance that the count of monte cristo is living on the same floor with yourselves   56.55389745680295
suggested porthos incessantly thinking how his greatness must be irksome to inferior people   89.67553016020176
your majesty s mind may be quite at ease replied the officer   134.19808421334585
on a level with the floor   89.97009983466458
almost all the armed pilgrims that went to the holy land took for their arms either a cross in honor of their mission or birds of passage in sign of the long voyage they were about to undertake and which they hoped to accomplish on the wings of faith   106.23693378050491
said the host   68.52399739003789
by your poems   103.01069872458318
and i say to you one drop of water suffices to make the full vase overflow   120.87628500043309
cried all present with one voice   86.39946079915197
but you must let me make my observations or the frenchman will transact his business without my knowing the sum   124.36736651630713
this voice was that of athos who standing up with outstretched hand and quite out of his mind thus assailed the public accuser   110.96762325178233
seek them my lord and find them i conjure you   170.25645436179573
i have but now left a house where death has just entered to run to you   151.16609396179936
now said planchet let us thank the queen   193.98483542969052
they were approaching the scene of war   97.63127458844176
petersburg to china   64.22087390481093
may god preserve you   76.78025936380456
not yet   146.69757951241618
it was on that occasion that my ancestor enguerrand de la fere was made a knight of the order of st   120.03621676121585
de tréville at a distance come here monsieur captain said he come here that i may growl at you   87.32817523925215
yet the great sometimes repent of their ingratitude   52.795758226945345
but it appears that this edmond dantès this dangerous man s name was edmond dantès   183.50087406785354
planchet who had been the first to enter was the last to leave   210.87386644416435
backhanded   74.26044067303395
behind them by another outlet a group of about twenty persons rushed into the garden with loud exclamations of delight   95.04986715682304
ah to inquire after the little la valliere   232.74550876887469
as i am of the church and the affair might injure me if i should share it with any other than a sure friend like you i write to beg that you will serve me as second   149.7615902796761
of the cardinal   157.33337526753309
but when he discovered what it meant he shouted it in such a voice that even the most exacting were satisfied   128.80332766214582
monte cristo motioned to ali to undress him and he then examined his dreadful wounds   17.407272746109257
he s an old acquaintance   143.19737429609927
i accept it answered the traveller but then the obligation will be on my side for this poniard is worth more than two sequins   142.51405554664703
you are right your excellency he said   39.083709051601915
cried guitant   144.78602023763943
by his advice a decree from parliament summoned the citizens to lay down their arms and demolish the barricades   117.67731058626575
the ball it was in the warmest days of july when in due course of time the saturday arrived upon which the ball was to take place at m   101.78194823914278
and once there to endeavor to find the wonderful caverns and search in the appointed spot the appointed spot be it remembered being the farthest angle in the second opening   28.97604934444061
bear skins from siberia fox skins from norway and so on   133.51636573017814
my lord i saw him run off from the top of the terrace   123.33776482535816
franz then related to his friend the history of his excursion to the island of monte cristo and of his finding a party of smugglers there and the two corsican bandits with them   150.29999272465682
the queen was standing in the room pale with anger   151.7267281571398
no you do not know me   41.52332616007399
this however doesn t concern you with your forty thousand francs income the happiest man in the world it seems to me   97.2119605180025
my son replied the bishop with firmness you see him not because the passions of the world conceal him   178.17235311785606
bertuccio you make use of heraldic terms   117.3820601231312
ten minutes later the escort stopped at ermenonville but the four friends went on with well sustained ardor guarding mazarin carefully   18.47698815135523
i also have a pious visit to pay   174.42503692791047
you have credit with your landlord then   109.89189975673108
murmured the two young people   93.87043174094326
the fact is one can not remain thus with a sword hanging eternally over his head said athos   163.6099066383089
they appear to be speaking of me   188.11780633973052
tis not a quarter of an hour since they passed this place   149.46129510657795
oh count you could assist me perhaps in researches which have been up to the present fruitless   129.0709950367093
château renaud contented himself with tapping his boot with his flexible cane   108.3153446022108
he looked around and saw the objects of his search upon the chimney piece   131.3752447244133
and he related what he had seen watching athos all the while   87.47986595714869
it seems then reserved for me said monte cristo coldly to be the first to do so   80.80391480391188
what do you see   15.612940010234851
oh those villeforts are an accursed race   53.44363282629499
when i saw her weeping i began to cry too   52.27231241395818
degradation took away two thirds of her greatness   72.4796753937137
on the contrary i do not find you the same person at all   121.56239869582058
asked the queen coloring as she found that she had to deal with a mind as subtle as her own   18.043270886578398
but albert had great projects to put into execution before going to the theatre   118.67173114191098
the vendetta chapter 45   122.82039296057849
and he looked down at the pretty girl with the most triumphant air imaginable   140.09782940258793
he still lives   184.4365019371569
he had assumed the entire costume of cucumetto   231.0311789359679
enough sir enough   121.68303600866744
well let us be sure of that   152.40301910367808
1 you said sir you would like to help me but yes   139.9779480243317
but where can i get a chisel to take the planks out a gimlet to pierce the cask   83.46305909649385
i think returned anne of austria fixing upon him a glance which in any woman s face would have expressed disdain but in a queen s spread terror to those she looked upon nay i perceive you dare to threaten the mother of your sovereign   41.38142675978706
she then turned to the right followed the course of a long corridor descended a flight went a few steps farther introduced a key into a lock opened a door and pushed the duke into an apartment lighted only by a lamp saying remain here my lord duke   143.09439892236017
there only remained three things to decide what they should write to milady s brother   106.11197674027594
i think he did not for he fell without a cry   124.43566337355222
he thought that voice more feeble than usual   79.8897135168319
he perceived his mistake   158.76204489341094
but her swollen tongue could utter no more than a hoarse sound which had nothing human in it and resembled the rattle of a wild beast   26.800194767194867
they had proposed his going with them to france but he had straightway declined   197.66947566198712
yes motioned the latter with a firmness which seemed to declare that with the help of valentine and his old servant who both knew what his wishes were he was quite prepared to maintain the contest   91.08300047463194
oh monsieur cried dantès you have been rather a friend than a judge   151.86800139448687
inquired the duke what does your majesty mean   117.0407379820439
at eight o clock in the evening athos ordered the horses to be saddled and lord de winter and his friends notified that they must prepare for the expedition   195.70565927092284
but before it was out of the scabbard porthos with the hilt of his had struck him such a terrible blow on the head that he fell like an ox beneath the butcher s knife   109.27236204032795
noirtier nodded his head   157.08538824055518
responded sinbad laughing with his singular laugh which displayed his white and sharp teeth   82.66316747464903
at the same time couriers started in every direction over england and europe to announce that charles stuart was the prisoner of oliver cromwell   178.53359030278156
villefort quietly opened a window saying it is very warm and the heat affects m   78.08502947172649
winter approached   135.35719650307058
his new valet brought him the papers and with them a cup of chocolate   169.02453754501053
count said albert in a low tone to monte cristo do allow the signora to tell me something of her history   115.25336318492026
albert my child said mercédès if i had a stronger heart that is the counsel i would have given you   116.48707949057423
she evidently interrogated him by her look   120.47824268822906
he saw my father bury something in the ground and stabbed him   49.19068945080453
oh my god i have suffered enough surely   155.09815112786362
acknowledge then you stony heart said d artagnan that you are wrong to be so hard upon us tender hearts   124.2469016491765
during this time the captain had thrown off his vest and shirt and secured his trousers round his waist   77.07390913210334
go on baptistin   170.73708933353043
i positively refuse   132.1342827781135
truly cried the host misfortune is coming on our house   131.6048212466506
and now said the queen addressing d artagnan what is to be done   76.24668784456762
latterly i heard his friend monsieur d artagnan give him that name   113.34178728728219
i am entirely at your service m   66.99108692566352
ah that s it   134.9899169448887
what was the name of your old master   165.16057647830314
nor would either the one or the other believe the reports that were brought to them declaring they would rather rely on the evidence of their own eyes and ears   128.82294574204252
the young woman with tears in her eyes and every mark of affection of a true mother approached valentine and took her hand   110.43215780603127
and then relaxing his sentiment of pride he addressed his supplications not to god but to man   193.51808838436645
illness of body would not affect the validity of the deed but sanity of mind is absolutely requisite   141.71426750287105
but when andrea urged his suit she betrayed an entire dislike to him   50.399632207793765
what have you got to say   90.94844889544271
and added he biting off with his large white teeth an enormous mouthful of bread i have formed a plan   98.56891277642339
and that will not be long it is to be hoped said porthos   97.78702410482123
he called out in his gascon accent what do you want   105.66643487400694
which said the abbé to himself you would have done   196.26593304808438
as he said this the man came towards edmond who heard a heavy metallic substance laid down beside him and at the same moment a cord was fastened round his feet with sudden and painful violence   148.08798367129648
but at the same moment his two auditors accompanied by the host fell upon d artagnan with sticks shovels and tongs   114.072650347797
fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve in greece still having his name kept on the army roll   68.57371144895964
the cardinal fixed his piercing eyes on this courageous speaker   152.095852321474
i don t insist on answering   95.36761562063268
he went before i came down   152.21394113145135
chapter 27   188.0619779109845
said the young girl with hesitation it is your opinion that i should obey this invitation   94.65680297366768
chatillon saw the motion and put his hand to his sword   117.05637870723008
he is at bergen in norway   182.10001904734906
dantès observed however that faria in spite of the relief his society afforded daily grew sadder   92.25932474894513
ah my lord he said have you come to drive away those rascal spaniards and those lorraine robbers   127.34489625755877
some voices even added long live the marshal   166.19813441348452
i am not strong enough   156.33148923212246
cried he at length   167.5234466038563
yes if i am killed said albert laughing   155.8995465794664
the counter was covered with a plate of pewter   59.327139972133935
he quietly said what do i care if i am   178.25667550793008
you say an exterminating angel appears to have devoted that house to god s anger well who says your supposition is not reality   81.10179782441315
be more economical   137.0396954664828
porthos received all these attentions like a man accustomed to such demonstrations only on turning the corner of the street he lifted his hat gracefully and waved it to her as a sign of adieu   148.81285655133928
think only of yourself   140.0454407542328
eleven o clock sounded from all the clocks of the faubourg st   115.82760221900512
franz passed the night in confused dreams respecting the two meetings he had already had with his mysterious tormentor and in waking speculations as to what the morrow would produce   161.1582011455114
in fact said the cardinal placing his hand upon a bundle of papers i have here a whole pile which concerns you   81.27057340888659
who can answer for that   139.8845656859047
now one evening when d artagnan who was in the trenches was not able to accompany them athos porthos and aramis mounted on their battle steeds enveloped in their war cloaks with their hands upon their pistol butts were returning from a drinking place called the red dovecot which athos had discovered two days before upon the route to jarrie following the road which led to the camp and quite on their guard as we have stated for fear of an ambuscade when about a quarter of a league from the village of boisnau they fancied they heard the sound of horses approaching them   150.56177569244107
i think i may venture to ask you this favor   61.36002904715404
is that the look of a man whose victim is likely to escape him   70.78088852571587
i should think we did know it exclaimed albert since it is owing to that circumstance that we are packed into these small rooms like two poor students in the back streets of paris   149.73869083763955
we can find no fault with you for watching over yourselves when you watch so carefully over others   129.81726738796735
at last do you imagine he resumed that they mean to kill you   21.92981798225425
then he murmured the words of the english poet frailty thy name is woman   127.23132104740166
i had no longer any wish to live for myself i have lived for him   93.1675579385765
thus richard iii   126.48137363452898
is one friend forbidden to visit another or a musketeer of my company to fraternize with a guard of dessessart s company   125.28683564906146
then he rose and went out   177.3397865115228
and i not at all said the prince laughing   198.73335731595142
there are some situations which men understand by instinct but which reason is powerless to explain   105.88242175981682
do you wish for a notary   128.80876640446814
if you wished to demolish them you could not and if it were possible you would not dare   112.78867158533502
monte cristo stepped into it with his two friends   147.49223605762896
that they must have patience said anne as i have   26.75840350004914
so that if this resource had failed me i should have found myself very unpleasantly situated in paris   77.17378382208598
make it monsieur i listen   91.66804560658666
it is not because mademoiselle valentine is going to marry you that he is angry but because she will marry a union with any other would have caused him the same sorrow   25.308807926100926
in my name said mme   59.97649413034841
athos required no more   57.22376000265552
when they arrived at the antechamber above the door was visible a shield which by its rich ornaments and its harmony with the rest of the furniture indicated the importance the owner attached to this blazon   42.46189077807104
the lookout has signalled her and they say she is now coming into port   112.31725254599935
there was no one like him for that   100.20296344846024
besides d artagnan passed the evening with me   81.22163662768115
i will await you at the corner of the rue du musée and if you are so long absent as to make me uneasy i will hasten to rejoin you and woe to him of whom you shall have cause to complain to me   154.79046328799183
he thanked the governor bowed and departed   187.81963685299235
his two companions were already on horseback   90.22874165461369
and then said aramis pinching his ear to make it red as he rubbed his hands to make them white and then i made a certain rondeau upon it last year which i showed to monsieur voiture and that great man paid me a thousand compliments   86.74665094610887
pale with a dull eye and heavy heart all the noble features of that face usually so calm and serene were overcast by grief   57.66057702691826
i will undertake to throw up fifty and when the day comes to defend them   46.944469163257224
nay said caderousse one can t always work one is not a dog   177.61407898363274
he married her   146.37473899577756
porthos has perhaps sixty thousand francs income   185.8536910786585
but at the moment mousqueton came to announce that the horses were ready and they were arising from table the stranger proposed to porthos to drink the health of the cardinal   175.05894111270294
those who love me follow me   84.35209926248196
it was a frightful thing to see this wretch leaving a long track of blood on the ground he passed over pale with approaching death trying to drag himself along without being seen to the body of his accomplice which lay twenty paces from him   144.91219976849086
well the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you   171.9796305760255
because an astrologer had predicted that you would escape   109.7381954041464
i should know what doctrine he leans to and i should glean from that what saint he has adopted as his patron   156.28113471576404
i smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination for the consummation of the engagement in question as there is for my own   138.7619820169666
do you shut it   88.27858666779723
asked albert in his turn astonished at this strange theory   108.76881019128338
the queen remained standing near the hangings whilst d artagnan glided behind the curtains   146.57995389592875
this time franz could contain himself no longer but sank half fainting into a seat   105.47723715140597
it is the best thing to do   194.63564004208666
at them   82.74071467078025
that s the last folly to be committed said athos seeing it is the only one for which there is no remedy   103.15339934324476
let us go to breakfast   139.2161729963782
the first was a royalist the other suspected of bonapartism   100.14483231978922
madame cried mazarin you have ruined us all the king yourself and me   133.4473182056615
said athos recovering from the instinctive fear he had at first experienced by the aid of reason   73.31050871989207
i was most anxious to see you   121.26934486246657
then sir i am patiently to submit to your refusal   207.10758852575893
aramis smiled as one who hopes   112.3270902759911
i wish to speak to him   89.82869090440879
ah come in come in monsieur d artagnan   45.97077059211131
the steward left the room with a faltering step and returned with a bundle of bank notes which the notary counted like a man who never gives a receipt for money until after he is sure it is all there   112.16525360216798
zounds my lord i don t know yet   65.57789221577653
countess returned franz totally unheeding her raillery i asked you a short time since if you knew any particulars respecting the albanian lady opposite   46.901797237736716
the guests stopped formed quadrilles and danced in any part of the grounds they pleased   85.69603841775606
at the moment a great jingling of spurs was heard on the stairs   130.93773644894918
they used the same precautions in leaving as in entering the house   50.911541894861536
but asked morrel will the house of thomson french consent   85.79616094454848
50211m madame said the count it is no longer in my power to restore you to happiness but i offer you consolation   92.97499309927889
but be laconic i beg   142.92233636056721
that mazarin was contemptible and that i wouldn t serve mazarin   82.77487096780372
well then it is but fair that you should be paid for your loss of time and trouble said the count   63.91012577666892
yes you understand that explains all   92.98502928454803
i have a dreadful headache said albert   63.640523340640605
what else   59.78570829600183
she slept as a prisoner sleeps rocked by his first hope   103.36555165824132
he was truly crying but it would have been difficult to say whether joy or the onions produced the greatest effect on the lachrymal glands of the old innkeeper of the pont du gard   48.746227455983494
they are two qualities out of the four   142.05181650523113
well sir resumed danglars after a brief silence i will endeavor to make myself understood by requesting you to inform me for what sum you propose to draw upon me   64.17809573573624
and mounting his horse mousqueton rode off down the avenue on the grass at a hand gallop   27.344844122455612
be seated juxon said the king falling upon his knees   130.16543059477843
you have had too much already drunkard said danglars   83.32561246156986
fernand s fortune was already waxing great and she developed with his growing fortune   130.9052665507999
said porthos a little perplexed between the two i suppose as i came with you i must go away with you   114.96740511041641
the cardinal i believe would give the world to prevent my success   58.23395281939851
but i will take the left hand it is my custom in such circumstances   127.12270329561613
you like your title do you not   77.84611971257439
ah true said aramis   125.40953621959737
and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he would of the first comer   20.775404121434264
and what took place   152.9793603458209
the trial   31.19381136500745
his shadow did the same   67.44613384431418
my first business will be to dispose of this diamond   172.23733359622472
but we are not equal to the four that you know of   78.3678588114144
this time he was both seen and heard and the tartan instantly steered towards him   91.67991594338434
smiling is a thing very easy to meditate but more difficult to conduct to an end inasmuch as re established so recently on the throne of our ancestors we have our eyes open at once upon the past the present and the future   267.62894731860825
at three o clock came two companies of the guards one french the other swiss   100.80337052594905
i want a letter that will enable me to reach the king s presence without all the formalities of demanding an audience   92.41414995408759
will you come into the garden   33.34204145638573
oh my lord he cried with an expression of stupefaction in his face   101.69480168607171
i will repeat them then   144.58825804500884
ah ha said albert i see you were preparing for a game of cards   129.07940929696028
giovanni light a torch he added and give it to his excellency   104.53264969407947
if you go out do not go out alone   86.78266028897002
neither do i wish to incur guilt   175.6462697074955
i have it gentlemen   117.07860623844235
after all said the inspector if he had been rich he would not have been here   104.72978466444539
the inquiry m   28.01132956774825
my dear franz m   33.79631869820996
but on arriving on the quai they were obliged to stop   70.92396957474679
and alone   92.85886853264088
it is already done he said   123.08407756110009
raoul gives me much uneasiness he said   93.73648121950968
repeated the count   64.3462948679282
and so he went instantly towards the waxlight and unfolded it   145.9682001153265
habitually he spoke little and slowly bowed frequently laughed without noise showing his teeth which were fine and of which as the rest of his person he appeared to take great care   148.64625026084087
let us speak of nothing till we get home   83.59159347676763
the same silence and then ere the host could oppose his design grimaud seized a pair of pincers he perceived in a corner and forced the bolt   154.3789618478799
no replied monte cristo   110.56272082165674
that shall be testified to rest assured   92.68226016357275
you are right valentine   120.67937201733342
aguado and m   124.55157339845628
she fancied that the hand not holding the phial clasped a long sharp knife   116.87971902459151
the friend of the cardinal and the famous epicure whose grace after dinner used to be good lord do me the favor to cause me to digest what i have eaten   130.14417851389356
40032m forgive me sir said franz in a resolute tone   178.48313421464428
d artagnan had so much confidence in the word of his friend that he lowered his head and entered the inn without reply   87.82161923934135
be punctual and we shall arrive at twelve or one   94.48238950896555
his companions horror struck could neither move nor cry out   123.83758046752064
monte cristo smiled at her unusual humility and showed her two immense porcelain jars over which wound marine plants of a size and delicacy that nature alone could produce   70.15328020423601
it is a pleasure to work miracles before them   114.26380086176117
i will not sign this order   199.2596521575469
these marks are regular   171.54073342920955
it is but fair said porthos and aramis hoping he would choose one of them   8.73013976013084
said albert staring   103.74953875308195
the lackey bowed to the ground and departed   138.19866399520163
let us pursue him and we shall overtake him   176.2289706601905
the old man intimated that such was his meaning   130.09631651927344
as a punishment for having spoken without permission my friend you will please to eat this piece of paper   146.02316033135858
a silent party soon drew near to the same enclosure entered and joined the musketeers   66.43011052832482
then the tunnel will be discovered   60.33013306718456
the next morning danglars awoke late though he went to bed so early   141.44310778478862
d avrigny with an imposing calmness but i think it is now time to act   95.89451442366824
eight vigorous arms lifted him up immediately and laid him in the boat where directly athos was warmed and reanimated reviving with the caresses and cares of his friends who were intoxicated with joy   93.02904367667509
well monsieur duke said the king have you made your calculations   162.8712558393206
you shall know   75.28795061296691
but were you not on horseback   119.19284091921227
a loud noise was heard on the stairs of people moving hastily and half stifled sobs   8.997351100413127
the officer replied in words that belonged to no language at all and the bargain was concluded   145.44411156607032
what are you meddling with stupid   191.93989360952736
athos recognized grimaud   85.75943585442181
it seems that master la ramee s is gluttony   195.7392851466054
you a journalist the husband of renown   107.04359962077636
if i were a man that would barely be possible   104.02241304652352
my friend said he here is a proof of it   89.54482205977777
d artagnan bowed to the duke and was retiring   99.72637258691957
strange child murmured the baroness   74.14578347875299
what said he is it you my dear franz whose devotion and friendship are thus displayed   143.5616873922282
to prove to noirtier that he was in valentine s confidence and knew all their secrets morrel took the dictionary a pen and some paper and placed them all on a table where there was a light   121.90560901665614
d artagnan was on the point of telling athos all   34.81019148017157
the report of spanish cruelty had gone out and every one was frightened   82.58292318788789
now if your mistress is not dead if it is she we have just seen you will meet with her again some day or other   105.4418189204662
they proceeded silently to the centre of the place but as at this very moment the moon had just emerged from behind a cloud they thought they might be observed if they remained on that spot and therefore regained the shade of the lime trees   122.74661321137523
the cause of misfortune of religion royalty   113.30528537642998
oh fie a quarrel between priests a duel between allies   144.05412525041936
no mother   59.811927345013004
but mark the distinction with which he is treated   73.846947999735
if he defers he will find the place of honor taken   107.21646679682826
well i should hope in the first instance to have for keeper an honest fellow like you   20.069788230269396
for i know no one except god who can be so far above your majesty   116.60676594164775
and forced at last to yield to evidence he was on the point of breaking forth in exclamations when he encountered a glance from the eyes of porthos the repressive force of which he was not inclined to dispute   104.84741203126181
monte cristo examined him with the same look that at rome he had bent upon the execution of andrea and then in a tone that made a shudder pass through the veins of the poor steward the abbé busoni then told me an untruth said he when after his journey in france in 1829 he sent you to me with a letter of recommendation in which he enumerated all your valuable qualities   140.10646500782454
he made a rapid and brilliant feint which mordaunt parried   131.8348436918054
fortunately she is far off said porthos for i confess she would worry me if she were here   52.889603028856115
you do not wish me to marry m   113.40968031958693
bonacieux he could obtain no intelligence of her   124.52871198251135
it took some time for d artagnan to resume this little dialogue   54.32893078390811
the day passed away without having any other influence on me than to strengthen the resolution i had formed   88.88069626917049
i have sir   61.6947953459174
my lord he said which way do we go   133.7773541022372
athos by signs desired grimaud to bring another bottle of wine   71.24561753022235
they had all been engaged in earnest search and inquiries but had discovered nothing   85.92076012122494
some of those men sometimes die worth twenty thousand and twenty five and thirty thousand francs and sometimes more   139.89221642326703
the castle of yanina rose white and angular from the blue waters of the lake and the immense masses of black vegetation which viewed in the distance gave the idea of lichens clinging to the rocks were in reality gigantic fir trees and myrtles   87.328769933656
but my fears were this time ill founded   115.4718696683875
rochefort alone was dissatisfied with the termination of affairs   100.34557953991052
well your publisher is very generous my dear aramis that s all i can say   107.05945612573078
she loves him devilishly he murmured   139.0219704365951
do you see the waistcoat   139.13711476405314
you are not joking are you   122.43849900455133
it is a gift from my beautiful englishwoman or rather frenchwoman for i am convinced she was born in france though i have not questioned her   154.63987898979747
the perspiration stood in large drops on mazarin s brow   129.5602411480638
i am very fortunate added he looking gratefully at villefort to be examined by such a man as you   231.81517091752102
what should you know about it   89.01173080611903
he turned around saw the sign by the light of a reflected lamp and having dismissed the child giving him all the small coin he had about him he began knocking at the door very reasonably concluding that having now three or four hours before him he had best fortify himself against the fatigues of the morrow by a sound sleep and a good supper   140.31990966706533
the cardinal wiped his forehead with his handkerchief and looked around him   100.19711323225968
buckingham had left england the day before sent as ambassador to spain to demand the hand of the infanta for king charles i   151.8252050698158
ah i understand said beauchamp on our friend albert s account   76.8775268445481
the two friends saluted the duke   0.9602017678163293
once beyond saint denis we shall have nothing to fear   115.4186190003713
but the four friends were out of reach and the rochellais only fired to appease their consciences   141.40349380078973
honoré   158.40002051522498
really captain groslow you are too much in fortune s way   130.22263453919197
have you the money he demands   62.31164842452223
but his eyes raised toward heaven during this delicious occupation spoke a language which though mute was not the less expressive   55.83172491156182
he certainly did not prevent others from speaking of them before him although it was easy to perceive that this kind of conversation in which he only mingled by bitter words and misanthropic remarks was very disagreeable to him   131.46419786675173
the shoulder of athos the baldric of porthos and the handkerchief of aramis chapter v   126.7015891131019
and now i wish to see him on an affair of great importance   177.7037726534053
why said danglars in the letter i believe i have it about me here he felt in his breast pocket yes here it is   101.01812062284029
sir replied olivain respectfully allow me to remark that we have already much fatigued the horses this morning   95.92665911728264
i then thought of that french justice of which i had heard so much and which feared nothing and i went to the king s attorney   36.30539598226902
in her bedchamber go on   178.62827543032586
they turned the bowsprit towards sardinia where they intended to take in a cargo which was to replace what had been discharged   125.67033341572534
it was like a besieged town   49.193896601125196
edmond dantès replied the magistrate i arrest you in the name of the law   38.2172799407611
we will go together   111.37462256890917
cried d artagnan becoming more pale than the white veil of his mistress   168.1993450567767
while his horses were impatiently pawing the ground held in by the coachman who had been seated a quarter of an hour on his box the elegant phaeton with which we are familiar rapidly turned the angle of the entrance gate and cast out on the doorsteps m   172.21173158816129
at this moment a shriek was heard that seemed to come from the river   196.35535384604827
well unfurl your wings and fly into superhuman regions   154.8183485377086
monte cristo advanced towards her and extended his hand which she as usual raised to her lips   104.94668636228131
i separated the fat from the meat served to me melted it and so made oil here is my lamp   115.86094801498412
having escaped these dangers they returned by the main road to boulogne at abbeville and followed it step by step examining every track   184.60671086001287
as they left paris an equipage with four horses at full speed was seen to draw up suddenly   139.3804094157493
under certain circumstances with that strong and shrewd mind your majesty possesses aided by your friends you were able to repel the attacks of that adversary   101.47333721518424
something whispers me so continued porthos becoming more and more melancholy   47.460258475965844
he fell into meditation   140.67909843540585
go then   178.08816081587577
i have none said athos   75.62758935103386
said porthos i am sorry for that   164.93384780672415
she will never write like monsieur de voiture   124.89736226278113
and i hate her said château renaud   97.20154694654843
are you waiting for him underneath these windows   161.66496175164403
lord de winter advanced in his turn   120.38075407759523
as for that benedetto who so grossly belied his name have you never made any effort to trace out whither he has gone or what has become of him   113.46006159272196
as it is no inconsiderable affair to spend the carnival at rome especially when you have no great desire to sleep on the piazza del popolo or the campo vaccino they wrote to signor pastrini the proprietor of the hôtel de londres piazza di spagna to reserve comfortable apartments for them   84.14039564744185
of all that passed in that sleep or the time which glided away while it lasted i have no remembrance   56.723941494917256
then when they had passed he brought up the rear and on his face was a smile which if they could have understood it would have alarmed them much more than a visit to the room they were about to enter   98.60204112306099
it was the soul of my husband   188.79399099604782
the captain seemed inclined to go upon deck again but controlling himself he answered port wine   133.36095996183928
king judges spectators all turned their eyes to the bench where the four friends were seated   160.91552634442183
but even while they watched his daring progress edmond s foot slipped and they saw him stagger on the edge of a rock and disappear   67.8906459306352
the horse was of hungarian breed and ambled along at an easy pace   170.4841510866944
there is still something else said he   68.14588674439459
well now he said it seems my dear friend that something vexes you   157.74374256549254
i confined myself then to begging him to give up his chamber which is the handsomest in the hôtel and to be satisfied with a pretty little room on the third floor   70.22559066753007
de tréville the third personage in the kingdom in the paternal estimation   77.7939689442725
this scene completely changed the opinion of the assembly respecting the accused count   127.39276049991078
follow you   105.29075343305313
most assuredly replied he   130.72260224472805
but dress yourself   77.46869734098271
heaven pardon me cried edmond falling on his knees before his father   83.70807137567733
and if the suspicions of your majesty which i still continue to doubt should prove to have any foundation what a terrible disclosure what a fearful scandal   66.53794315329392
oh know him   124.91071700397546
after he had remained through the heat of the day unconscious on the battle field the cool freshness of the night brought him to himself   172.3966106363478
cried château renaud   120.81806318054433
the matter was arranged as d artagnan had suggested and when he returned he found the king already seated at his little table where parry waited on him harrison and his officers sitting together at another table and in a corner places reserved for himself and his companions   126.7526626934557
madame henrietta is almost no longer queen   149.2612957731134
take every care of him i beg of you   53.15762323612331
certainly all four   86.77286480196307
do you say m   142.26713192663345
vicomte come here said athos   51.314309562755625
andrea cavalcanti as decked up and gay as if he were going to marry a princess   135.2404517333368
already up raoul   151.6789301714757
during the time occupied by the interview we have just detailed madame de villefort had gone to visit m   111.53228236146084
don t make a bad use of it i entreat you   151.62006674264535
rail on rail on at your ease gentlemen said morcerf somewhat piqued   177.76504363508636
the celebrated cucumetto pursued in the abruzzo driven out of the kingdom of naples where he had carried on a regular war had crossed the garigliano like manfred and had taken refuge on the banks of the amasine between sonnino and juperno   71.48622078026669
what do you mean by that monsieur   58.847355473306656
if it were not so far from here to the house i would return and finish him   108.16134178148354
the day passed away in utter silence night came without recurrence of the noise   51.156073424490266
but as porthos on his side could not comprehend his astonishment he merely pushed him indoors saying let us go in   0.7702172104724525
porthos was delighted   101.75568817009403
don t mention it   149.03082541849585
for if you utter another word like that be you marquis duke prince or king i will thrust it down your throat   73.31442395172687
get me my purse back and keep the sixty pistoles   122.39598350738383
de winter made the grooms who carried the arms and the porters with the luggage descend first and was about to follow them   169.50466422779976
de villefort has been telling me   90.49761872626001
asked albert who being a constant visitor there did not understand this opposition to his entrance   114.1623033783237
he certainly likes the child but will he love me less as his affection grows for her   139.3361645128772
oh yes scoundrel   130.36730334304764
on his side d artagnan became more cautious also   89.5960406217075
for myself i will reconnoitre   121.1995558507999
this was our resolution   65.79924434679867
come continued d artagnan who irritated that instead of listening to him athos seemed to be attending to his own thoughts you have never found yourself the worse for my advice   125.7888231401026
the coachman took care of his horses the lackey held the saddlehorses   163.18486604302308
the traveller who was going from palestrina to tivoli had mistaken his way   123.88452163323596
hark said she we have been overheard   101.3786525764728
it is not for me to say   93.86147361393893
that is to say replied milady driven into her entrenchment that i have not the honor of knowing her personally   91.464428420393
you know that even now the king is but a child and the queen a woman weak enough   53.396669593573264
is that the example you set penelon   93.93721717195095
for d artagnan had assumed a threatening attitude and planchet modeled himself after his master   121.80767800585599
and there is something in this room which reminds me forcibly of the chamber of the marquise de ganges10 or desdemona   92.20140618131357
lord de winter is ruined for the moment   81.37518597423414
i think he entered the service   9.978505277301863
yes yes i see him well enough said d artagnan   164.36898663135435
countersigned by you   51.45532818181922
i i return to paris   104.44628696717689
near one of the bedrooms they came to a winding staircase that led down to the garden   71.23375295812997
de laffemas chief gamekeeper of france   128.9177115953757
i will go alone in search of athos   114.40213259668046
there he bore the fainting man and laying him down upon the grass unfastened the buttons of his collar and unhooked his doublet   5.436493740964451
certainly not replied the count   126.68014463441264
a gentleman who had just arrived by the route of dammartin was seated at the same table and was breakfasting   13.581435664523525
satisfied with this discovery which confirmed all his suspicions athos returned to the hôtel and found planchet impatiently waiting for him   143.8862642639687
oh it s a description you want   168.64236099054887
the prisoners were then to make their way through one of the gallery windows and to let themselves down from the outer walls by means of the abbé s ladder of cords   152.62297415412988
i really must pray you to excuse me but in truth i was not attending to the conversation   75.93830719572973
well said the coadjutor on seeing him you are in disgrace then abbé   105.29959871010787
i remember how unmercifully i laughed at what i considered your eulogistic and exaggerated praises of him   102.9125575627377
you may imagine there was something startling and ominous said haydée shaking her head and turning pale at the mere remembrance of the scene in this long file of slaves and women only half aroused from sleep or at least so they appeared to me who was myself scarcely awake   139.62865184961132
i am at the command of the committee and even claim the honor of being heard   220.41951547549206
there is nothing now to prevent my building myself a little hut on my plantation and residing not twenty yards from you   48.432249375277294
the letter is precise   87.74485684529296
i am prettily caught   169.11260585160232
after the ladies had departed for the ball whither all the entreaties of madame de villefort had failed in persuading him to accompany them the procureur had shut himself up in his study according to his custom with a heap of papers calculated to alarm anyone else but which generally scarcely satisfied his inordinate desires   55.924147254203085
in a room the walls of which are seven feet thick with grated windows each bar as thick as my arm   64.66761592448286
ah i much fear that with all your wisdom such mercy yet will prove supernal folly   91.70754903209252
i never go there   117.54057235164464
i don t like people to quiz me   133.70239990359772
towards the house the chestnut trees we have before mentioned rose high above the wall without in any way affecting the growth of other luxuriant shrubs and flowers that eagerly dressed forward to fill up the vacant spaces as though asserting their right to enjoy the boon of light and air   116.71276627290712
for about seven or eight years the little tavern had been kept by a man and his wife with two servants a chambermaid named trinette and a hostler called pecaud   13.419111299194242
de morcerf will kill me   44.941218110102085
i protest my dear la ramee said the duke that you are a charming fellow and that i would stay forever at vincennes to have the pleasure of your society   92.29361310699863
in a few minutes laporte came into the room   169.18193580950452
you don t imagine he would consider a little thing like that   112.5659524507179
chapter 68   120.51232818634756
exclaimed gondy you speak with a certainty that gives me pleasure   150.0072949114715
he was the man who had proposed to carlini the health of their chief and to whom carlini replied by breaking the glass across his face   147.94311576852252
but i have expected you to tell me   79.26981382958114
do you remember how he cried on d artagnan on i am taken   160.35205617660807
you have decided friend   108.55983943995454
but as we have said he was a very prudent youth and he restrained himself   91.65969955500056
that throw of the dice is extraordinary   168.31104814295685
anne of austria who in consequence of the seizure of her letter expected reproaches was much astonished the next day to see the king make some attempts at reconciliation with her   86.11251792057804
raoul his hat in ribbons his face bleeding felt not only his strength but also his reason going   117.98067732122021
ah i am sure he has not sold the house for what he gave for it   95.16660500392473
that concerns your majesty more than me said the cardinal   99.07931411982122
chance for once seemed to favor them in sending what they were so assiduously seeking   182.6617227900396
indeed i should think not replied monte cristo   52.51570386160942
and even this diamond supposing that d artagnan in his projects of ambition wished to keep it to make it someday a pledge for the gratitude of the queen had not in the meanwhile since he could not part with it more value than the gravel he trod under his feet   127.06073511374214
instead of taking the waters of forges i go and take sea waters   115.09465120001573
he rose again to the surface struggled with the last desperate effort of a drowning man uttered a third cry and felt himself sinking as if the fatal cannon shot were again tied to his feet   65.45702718275928
you shall pass it by twenty fathoms   141.76922138908543
d artagnan started   81.57959980362475
the hinges yielded in their turn and fell still holding in their grasp fragments of the wood and the chest was open   110.69502651408717
gaetano departed with the reply   159.49399808155408
not one hour of peaceful calm was mine   137.0479827205661
favorable yesterday she may turn her back tomorrow   82.13120042041014

i thought so   140.611834098562
the accusation   62.38448136498162
his company was on guard at the louvre   229.6001897559015
the motive given for all the taxes summarily imposed and to which the parliament had made opposition was the necessity of sustaining the honor of france and the uncertain hope of beating the enemy   121.70498629665792
bring him with you then   199.63745458594897
in the midst of all the compliments that awaited her on her entrance the duchess seemed to be looking for some one   133.3083741382295
dantès eyes sparkled with joy and he rubbed his hands with delight at the idea of a plan so simple yet apparently so certain to succeed   123.72565749449457
is he not your friend   169.79411331203877
bonacieux starting   62.63045467445431
i have told him the truth   64.86767955655733
the remembrance of the scene at st   59.23755499370072
which means that you now hesitate   86.33197484272064
even the very furniture in these moments of delirium seemed to move and this state lasted till about three o clock in the morning when a deep heavy slumber overcame the young girl from which she did not awake till daylight   224.52072398353033
d artagnan sank on his knees and prayed   135.9877218155314
i am not only the most miserable of queens but the most unhappy of mothers the most wretched of wives   80.72661716605748
do you wish him to read it   161.51841904989223
stories of gypsies who steal children are not at all in vogue in this part of the world and would not be believed   81.9027036947566
every man has a devouring passion in his heart as every fruit has its worm   118.98876339088513
said d artagnan they will have left a chicken at least   153.95532953763427
we performed the usual burial service and he is at his rest sewn up in his hammock with a thirty six pound shot at his head and his heels off el giglio island   155.45635790894252
he was wealthy once perhaps   64.42269346151417
it is my cousin   139.33042419782123
yes he is that   184.28009416729594
in order to go from the door to the house or from the house to the door m   186.03554635671844
the remembrance of strafford was a source of lasting remorse to him the shadow that haunted him by day and night   59.836221132366354
perhaps those prayers may soften the remorse he feels in his heart   81.83721006574262
after a few minutes of silent embarrassment athos spoke   56.38667409918596

cried one of them in very good french though with a foreign accent that this madman will not allow these good people access to their own wine   61.69802131956058
yes the king and his lackey   127.89968414210993
and indeed it required but one glance at mademoiselle danglars to comprehend the justness of morcerf s remark   112.91765988940571
and i also said d artagnan i also   132.7660731439318
athos and he exchanged some words in a low voice then the tall man made a sign to the musketeer that he might come in   123.90023166545399
sir thanks   125.27727900851498
the neighbors who had opened their windows with the coolness peculiar to the inhabitants of paris in these times of perpetual riots and disturbances closed them again as soon as they saw the four men in black flee their instinct telling them that for the time all was over   110.26391459697588
the young man was more pale than usual and his eyes reddened by want of sleep denoted that he had passed a feverish night   132.2417379043704
then when he has acquired his specific he administers duly to his enemy or near kinsman a dose of arsenic which would make a mammoth or mastodon burst and which without rhyme or reason makes his victim utter groans which alarm the entire neighborhood   172.0945262571458

said the grave diggers two   111.34884485877384
i own that i am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which i feel myself unworthy that of being the husband of mercédès   101.43082310041736

the greek princess was in ecstasies   93.41426012794881
bonacieux followed him with her eyes with that long fond look with which he had turned the angle of the street she fell on her knees and clasping her hands oh my god cried she protect the queen protect me   105.14927437924528
as for myself i shall be proud to face the bullets or even the rope in company with you athos   80.3251738534749

sir said aramis you speak to the point   158.89550746636004
de villefort remained mute and cold as a statue   203.70522728207646
but perhaps you ought not to know tell us what returned d artagnan but first put a napkin against the window and draw the curtains   104.60527895158515
now leave me and desire my valet de chambre to come hither   87.66168901930938
julie saw the means offered of carrying off her precious relic which monte cristo had forgotten   82.60230530128243
this noble gentleman with his lofty glance this handsome cavalier so brilliant in feats of arms that every one was surprised that he held in his hand a sword only instead of a baton of command   89.65860929266233
milady faltered d artagnan and fainted a second time   56.185748147182075
but it is not the same with travellers   30.92035018591075
before him is a dead sea that stretches in azure calm before the eye   164.97272797807452
no said aramis they will doubtless treat us like the prisoners of the philipghauts   159.491426684528
the procurator s wife took porthos into an adjoining room and they began to lay the basis of a reconciliation   124.41521613225804
but arriving at four crossroads he stopped again visibly embarrassed   117.54898988205393
0073m how can i tell you   123.89956478417871
it does not appear to be very clean in the crossroads   52.46737355343841
the prisoner was one of those military adventurers who sold their blood to whoever would buy and grew old in stratagems and spoils   109.59582147717296
juxon consented the more readily to take him with him as he would require an assistant priest in case the king should wish to communicate   163.39899595293411
edward raised his head looked at his mother and then finding that she did not confirm the order began cutting off the heads of his leaden soldiers   65.70080204730428

answer and exculpate yourselves for i stand here to accuse you   86.90736023633568
and it is only by continuing prime minister that i can make monsieur d artagnan a captain and monsieur du vallon a baron   101.08247116137322
then you did not see either of them   28.571394050532803
d artagnan you are a great man   170.59635283337445
cried the latter i should say that i do pledge myself to it   85.6343112396124
but please to observe i won back the equipage cried athos   118.19120892024974
and he is going to land them added franz   78.30898633475734
the minister of police bowed   97.30537892616722
but if they come   59.632498717682004
was it not so you were called when your honored brother married us   7.0572307901351365
de tréville that will be unjust to the guardsmen   93.94969747812533
chatillon and flamarens started   59.37305878779657
i came to entreat you to promise me upon your honor to swear to me by what you hold most sacred that you will make no attempt upon your life   68.45605657378347
there a post chaise was waiting for him he entered it with his valet de chambre saying that he was going to fontainebleau   123.92592056051053
but while we are speaking of business danglars added pleased to find an opportunity of changing the subject tell me what i am to do for m   59.576157480813876
but don t think yourselves in a better position than you are   108.30338646041974
noirtier s eye continued to say read   88.45894678165888
milady sprang out of bed and opened the window   76.0100383123216
there the aspect changed   11.81285096204192
excellency said a servant opening the door a man in the dress of a penitent wishes to speak to you   104.47805449969992
the notary after having according to the customary method arranged the papers on the table taken his place in an armchair and raised his spectacles turned towards franz are you m   117.59163640395212
to yours monsieur   155.3283858803198
bazin was their only attendant for grimaud had stayed behind to take care of mousqueton   80.38113511997696
how you are going soon   87.24224323674073
the noise of the door with its creaking hinges and bolts ceased and a silence more sombre than that of solitude ensued the silence of death which was all pervasive and struck its icy chill to the very soul of dantès   33.617705714245844
did you know him   97.19181947948337
yes and i am come to look for him   120.29665117524571
and as one of them drooped over the road he thought that from its branches he might get a glimpse of the interior of the pavilion   116.37511970856899
it was purely and simply his removal in terms clear and precise   137.67275197539516
they never buried the dead   68.18293434387326
it is the application of the sciences to truth   77.92726886824097
i do nothing else all day   51.552549731347966
they opened the door and the four men alighted   64.2586124410264
you do not avoid going to war by that means   140.62883104364622
morrel was about to cast himself on his knees before his son but maximilian caught him in his arms and those two noble hearts were pressed against each other for a moment   82.46288663016931
and who is this colonel bridge   139.13986227462854
the two cavalcanti bowed to the count and left the house   161.71379094361188
d artagnan tapped the bag he had in his pocket   190.3661260369475
what has the monk to do with this milady   26.445535046922473
i will not say without trouble for if i did i should tell a lie   120.75757157819501
but for me alone this is good enough   116.93913712513292
from the cardinal   59.99221541646055
and have you not seen any of our other friends   132.14324327303885
the 28th of february 1815 at half past two in the afternoon   70.46258629197054
you terrify me athos   40.14295524509501
yes answered maximilian but i feel sure he has an excellent heart and that he likes us   203.15552131956667
that woman had in all probability poisoned my brother and in order to inherit from me she was about to assassinate me in my turn   78.32378105996972
come it is worth thinking about   9.457047921144863
he touched him on the shoulder   109.74400666178255
let us unite again not our hearts which have never been severed but our courage and our fortunes   120.29890440766421
danglars himself announced   208.1316367607432
they must be good animals then   89.01187042470956
toward the middle of the town commanding the principal open space rose a dark mass separated from the rest of the world by two lanes and overshadowed in the front by enormous lime trees   156.23018727789042
what she had taken for confusion was a tumult   157.2699902062021
for having only arrived yesterday in paris i as yet know no one but monsieur de tréville to whom i was recommended by my father who has the honor to be in some degree one of his friends   146.97141935128633
this was before his servant came   225.40737183974426
do you intend to struggle against our ill fortune   66.12154401280637
in a corner was the spanish companion donna estafania who had followed her from madrid   97.0082386359657
three of my best soldiers whom your majesty knows by name and whose devotedness you have more than once appreciated and who have i dare affirm to the king his service much at heart three of my best soldiers i say athos porthos and aramis had made a party of pleasure with a young fellow from gascony whom i had introduced to them the same morning   127.01160282127628
you who like ariel verge on the angelic are but an inert mass which like caliban verges on the brutal   59.04276534859722
you shall soon see him   106.7483482400901
as to that answered mousqueton puzzled how to get out of the difficulty i must confess that to me beer is as disagreeable as wine is to the english   124.19047737691143
let it be a million said caderousse   173.19716007645616
do not concern yourself about that   94.72166209662502
ah and as if struck in the heart he let go the hook and dropped with a groan   120.07023821280116
now the queen is of a sensitive nature   168.03091621963722
he had found himself so strictly guarded that he soon perceived the fruitlessness of any attempt at escape   94.60660575757632
the splendor was within   132.70248050771144
the host shook his head   75.46892033792807
but it appears to me that my guards mine are also his majesty s guards   156.26110646385996
beauchamp related to the young man all the facts we have just narrated   28.540903227430803
count what am i bound to do being in possession of this secret   162.2679842739141
gervais and do not bow too low to this italian   176.4666930421102
you have heard perhaps said the comte de salvieux one of m   117.09878937596025
edmond took the old man in his arms and laid him on the bed   89.60739662872885
you see my poor friend that i am sometimes bereft of my ordinary thoughtfulness   52.27460587371856
yesterday i was at the house of a doctor of theology whom i sometimes consult about my studies   116.0762358787338
could we send anyone to paris without its being known in the camp   76.22199133820976
a man between fifty five and sixty tall strong swarthy black hair and beard   180.91622415593076
the mother retires into the country and the son enters the army   131.5162455633516
muttered athos   86.08458502767425
and so i came added caderousse as fast as i could to have the pleasure of shaking hands with a friend   157.9640556650526
fernand mondego count of morcerf an old soldier who has fought in twenty battles and whose honorable scars they would denounce as badges of disgrace   128.99695700824452
i have none and am obliged to prepare my own meals   86.20735966490565
who do these three cavaliers appear to you to be   153.85046875818236
but then there must be some occasion for speaking   112.2274442933472
that is true said porthos echoing d artagnan s sigh   142.78349985259618
there is a certain fatality in it   95.9781561652633
she allowed the vessel to pass lorient and brest without repeating her request to the captain who on his part took care not to remind her of it   185.99320506232993
if he land in france it must be with a handful of men and the result of that is easily foretold execrated as he is by the population   173.57144058454764
a concierge waited at the door to exhibit to visitors this monument of curiosity once a scene of terror   136.57753248745814
you will not believe in him who requires but a prayer a word a tear and he will forgive   191.11914015443583
the former executioner of bethune   104.44937782532246
milady was not mistaken   116.39182369763249
these gardeners are the most careless people in the world   103.45937435884666
there ensued a brief silence during which these two persons who at first sight recognized each other so clearly as of noble race examined each other without embarrassment on either side   62.79455162468887
yes kill them   197.0469567433675
come first of all said athos to d artagnan my friend that i may shake hands with you you our rescuer you the true hero of us all   161.8845038985236
porthos drew back a step   25.6347806094266
cried jussac   160.7780599690216
noirtier looked at her with a glance of the most profound scrutiny   127.95726317869963
her crimes i know them not   110.20511469523971
are you sure you are more reasonable   63.66020642717833
impossible for three reasons replied athos   16.397324039265882
he would crush you at a word   165.67014882909677
i was indeed alone no noise disturbed the silence but the owl whose piercing cry seemed to be calling up the phantoms of the night   107.26328270745425
take him and teach him to be as brave and loyal as you are yourself   166.48106008834122
believe me that she who alone recognized you has been the only one to comprehend you   107.92648673527499
i am listening madame with the greatest interest said mazarin   163.96554677493538
if mazarin is an italian i am a gascon   84.46863781883332
and now at the moment when i reckoned upon success my hopes are forever dashed from me   88.58781748486302
he made haste to pass out by the opening still thinking himself in a dream   63.708569206789306
said mercédès endeavoring in vain to restrain a tear which glistened in the corner of her eye   97.19139218031023
and had the dark and wondrous island indeed faithfully guarded its precious secret   126.86087507233391
you had your portfolio with you then   130.0080757603095
she continued to look at him for nearly ten minutes and in these ten minutes the immovable guardian never turned round once   73.46464266455948
as for benedetto he gracefully wiped his lips with a fine cambric pocket handkerchief   214.65075406482262
you are the pearl of brave bold men   112.60118339975455
who told you that my dear   149.8669397382639
the guests chapter 40   98.409780916152
midnight struck slowly and sadly   133.71153716926798
one of our party is still wanting   160.22836918031527
yes there are two hundred of them and each of them will need two which will make four hundred   80.1740564236713
as he spoke dantès looked toward the spot where the fishing vessel had been wrecked and started   88.86932027761435
then i make a sacrifice   164.427325757967
the next day athos leaning out of his window which looked upon the most populous part of the city heard the act of parliament which summoned the ex king charles i   45.7688258265281
pray to the almighty to spare his life and i will take upon myself to promote his happiness   103.46501796858851
and who thinks of using him ill   82.92409453810266
i thank you my son   144.39370291167322
so far well said athos i perceive you know me   118.48291301171231
because for instance you noticed on the evening of the ball we gave that m   170.61744916126008
as soon as the door was closed sire said aramis speaking rapidly you are saved   117.87797017971378
it appears that the method i have adopted with this boy is decidedly the best   135.05614970881606
ali then entered bringing coffee and chibouques   101.01935629249922
yes sir replied julie with hesitation   131.6672973826545
these words were pronounced with the most exact politeness and the most perfect calmness   142.0818498680117
who comes there   138.3187943753033
i should therefore be ill received here and ill regarded there if i accepted what monseigneur offers me   186.67074951619634
i know him better than he knows himself   102.65936874208288
then they saw as the felucca turned two other heads peeping those of aramis and grimaud   174.59905575292285
the general putting his hand on his sword exclaimed if you talk of honor do not begin by disavowing its laws and impose nothing by violence   21.944544207546826
the patron shook his head   131.80671580979774
milady during this time continued to strike at him with horrible fury screaming in a formidable way   101.22449389559065
i will now go up into my apartment   82.98413277863861
but the hesitation with which he proceeded stopping and listening with anxious attention at every step he took convinced franz that he expected the arrival of some person   67.0543238028248
i am rich enough to know whatever i desire to know and i can promise you i am not wanting in curiosity   161.08353300630932
then in these trunks i presume you have given orders to your valet de chambre to put in all you are likely to need your plain clothes and your uniform   101.92479881530758
it was the island of monte cristo   110.56690925239602
who is this creature   178.25367635444755
he must be mad said the inspector   65.57244879502909
did you come from boulogne   127.46914447189123
this time the clerks evinced no inclination to laugh such a real ear clipper did porthos appear   164.7724971039663
felton darted into the palace   150.7497478884584
the less pretension there is in your attire the better will be the effect as you are a rich man   181.51141165244258
not like you heartless creature who would be glad never to see them again   26.74892360683718
it seems to me returned the count smiling that you played a sufficiently important part to know as well as myself what happened   101.85885793519581
and pray asked franz where are these pistols blunderbusses and other deadly weapons with which you intend filling the carriage   122.1320554097131
the result was that the two men communicated with one another   92.79247520843049
just think   19.99867040184401
come come continued the count complaints are unavailing be a man be strong be full of hope for i am here and will watch over you   154.58029487988165
thirty five minutes after seven said athos by which you perceive i am five minutes faster than you   30.053536937406463
gimblou another bottle   93.08013248912181
besides those who must be considered the leaders of the enterprise had quit the group and were making their way toward the hôtel of m   91.65023244310873
and what do you think of her personal appearance   104.45635249511567
look around you gentlemen if you doubt the fact said the duke   157.23027742481983
for when the lower classes alone complained the court of france separated as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of the gentry and the bourgeoisie seldom listened to their voice   127.4187042845725
that is like a good master   153.28941145112017
i have not so much as you have since i do not fly as you do   120.00486901092285
held a gourd full of rum to his mouth   125.4070616292409
he had a splendid cashmere round his waist and a small sharp and crooked cangiar was passed through his girdle   125.82344322439764
said porthos there is quite a gap between that fate and the baronial coronet you promised me d artagnan   110.82612260281556
thou dost exist thou art indeed man s father in heaven and his judge on earth   135.7197209529124
i will deny it   180.65449448771423
0113m here is your chamber for tonight said he   113.86667467887632
it also boasted of what in languedoc is styled a garden consisting of a small plot of ground on the side opposite to the main entrance reserved for the reception of guests   103.86633801691603
you would hardly have recited your touching history before it would go forth to the world and be deemed unlikely and unnatural   92.0220397857033
if i made you that present it was that you might adorn yourself therewith   151.71333258612518
around us were all my mother s servants carrying trunks bags ornaments jewels purses of gold with which they were hurrying away in the greatest distraction   207.72887007693322
but athos was standing with his eyes fixed on a black line which bordered the banks of the tyne and seemed to extend double the length of the camp   73.53961734842795
the door was closed but i looked through the keyhole and saw him so pale and haggard that believing him very ill i went and told m   115.87871317030176
did you come to noisy to defend him   104.40783878716118
until saturday when i may expect you may i not   148.53056444174925
albert i am bound to give you credit for having hit upon a most capital idea   164.83871414432318
without reckoning said athos that if he had not rescued me from the hands of cahusac i should not now have the honor of making my very humble reverence to your majesty   44.44493999892214
and she put the glass to the lips of the young woman who drank mechanically   142.82042987911382
she opened her eyes and saw the abbess accompanied by a young woman with light hair and delicate complexion who fixed upon her a look full of benevolent curiosity   78.5121205147662
thus bassompierre who was at once protestant and catholic protestant by conviction and catholic as commander of the order of the holy ghost   173.23243549112715
everything is paid replied the host and liberally   162.94445330649475
he has slept a long time on a hard bed so he won t object to a soft one   85.07422460747497
i have proof of it   120.72978546837548
but the boy refuses saying you are too ugly   187.21177475271276
the coachman without saying a word drove up it passed along the piazza di spagna and the rospoli palace and stopped at the door of the hotel   120.53047838638668
but the case is provided for and i am come to france to seek allies   41.38954505793485
happy is he who after having watched its silent growth is permitted to gather and call it his own   43.528309403751734
he knew better than anyone else how to open that weather beaten door with the large headed nail which served to raise the latch within   113.23771440555063
yes truly dear friend   99.76174841016763
during the meal which was excellent and admirably served franz looked repeatedly at albert in order to observe the impressions which he doubted not had been made on him by the words of their entertainer   41.9097237319464
it appeared as if there were abysses in milady s soul whose depths were dark and unknown   27.926104255687022
and monsieur de nogaret de la valette what do you say of him   45.81155045750418
danglars which is one of the safest banks in paris   98.01733328203778
go on m   213.89649592105422
that i am exceedingly disquieted sire   151.65498025709113
d artagnan immediately placed the point of his sword at his throat   129.09699096354333
yes my lord answered the man   106.51872830276524
but he could look and with that look ask assistance   105.35856720501553
and to his credit be it spoken his mind even amid the glib loquacity of the guides was duly and deeply touched with awe and enthusiastic admiration of all he saw   119.93544463045
yet i expect in all probability to quit the convent at any moment   16.795433003302946
it was only inhabited by a guard kept there for the prevention of smuggling   107.13814019612443
i cut it in his copse and i am taking it to the chateau   89.69946587562846
neffer neffer   37.926706302499866
antoine mounted two horses properly equipped which a servant without livery had waiting for them   33.36443911382777
you annoyed count   111.96489086175724
monseigneur i swear to you that i never for an instant had the intention of defending my head against you   220.27752098431637
he had always something or other to do   119.80177103282472
the queen stopped him   157.02588566963885
i am all attention   153.1093855041506
a hundred writers since socrates seneca st   103.52256769447395
d artagnan is too good a comrade to leave his brothers in embarrassment while he wears the ransom of a king on his finger   169.3594376116798
something you have worn and that i may wear in my turn a ring a necklace a chain   112.7905947562509
yes replied the angry look   123.74403469139013
well sir said the young girl do you understand now and is your conscience perfectly at rest on the subject   96.42490888483917
valentine was sitting at a little distance from them timidly awaiting the moment when she should be obliged to speak   65.81946861605468
then i drew another glass of water from my protecting fountain and drank it   135.29443281039227
since then continued aramis i have lived very agreeably   174.43446410481482
morrel took the head of his son between his two hands drew him forward and kissing his forehead several times said oh yes yes i bless you in my own name and in the name of three generations of irreproachable men who say through me the edifice which misfortune has destroyed providence may build up again   130.3794135943695
the rencontre   60.06333064611715
i know you to be well skilled in the management of the sword while i am only moderately so   170.92128930049608
the count then is in the chateau   132.45030728368948
no one has seen him   66.81049235129245
disinterestedness is the brightest ray in which a noble sword can shine   76.79656420305903
at the noise of the door madame danglars turned round and looked upon her husband with an astonishment she took no trouble to conceal   81.32226928157365
and if i have come my dear father said gérard drawing closer to m   147.0985826890498
yes sire said a voice which athos recognized as that of aramis   92.07386753882987
we thought it dead he repeated   94.3857393283939
no madame contrary to most history it is true   94.38762992591573
replied she   111.11170610298663
were you there then   112.31517668730037
will he believe that your eminence is in a position to accomplish the threat thus made   127.53625396751268
at another time added he i should have said give them besides two hundred francs over as a present   103.51936509458295
do not lull yourself in security or you will be lost   72.79922375459184
and porthos and aramis   97.66337490084763
the first words exchanged between the four friends on account of the ceremony which each of them mingled with their demonstration were somewhat forced and even the repast began with a kind of stiffness   180.03706621302456
listen then returned rochefort as he spoke endeavoring to read in that subtle countenance the cardinal s motive   88.34414345364151
the following day dantès presented jacopo with an entirely new vessel accompanying the gift by a donation of one hundred piastres that he might provide himself with a suitable crew and other requisites for his outfit upon condition that he would go at once to marseilles for the purpose of inquiring after an old man named louis dantès residing in the allées de meilhan and also a young woman called mercédès an inhabitant of the catalan village   92.38410515340206
aramis you know continued athos is naturally cold and then he is always involved in intrigues with women   87.45665718414219
it is for a consultation which will last three hours at least   152.07149258207616
on the contrary i have one but i expected the count would be tempted by one of the brilliant proposals made him yet as he has not replied to any of them i will venture to offer him a suite of apartments in a charming hotel in the pompadour style that my sister has inhabited for a year in the rue meslay   174.56106340184584
the boat that now arrived assured by the answering signal that all was well soon came in sight white and silent as a phantom and cast anchor within a cable s length of shore   115.28372866018971
that is just the case precisely so   157.70483387736016
and where is he going   86.5795346478064
but d artagnan took no heed of it   92.96880263665975
all very fine my lord but at the very first hint you give of such a thing i will strangle you and become frondist   106.16442211706341
and perhaps you have a preference for one boat more than another   86.19031015001246
the complexion of our fortune has changed very much since i saw you madame bonacieux and i should not be astonished if in the course of a few months it were to excite the envy of many folks   155.58039545331772
the news of the return of don carlos was brought by telegraph   109.75999219590562
oh replied valentine with a convulsive movement oh indeed maximilian you are too timid for an officer for a soldier who they say never knows fear   168.71900197565128
and therefore added he quietly i have not confidence in every one   67.91374945512908
then i would kill him rather than let him go   73.59645040511842
i bought it from him but it belongs to d artagnan   191.1030087839941
come tell me what is the joke   120.51253362166237
on opening the door villefort found himself facing him and the young magistrate s first impulse was to pause   169.98498175676366
but he feared lest this mark of affection bestowed upon his lackey in the open street might appear extraordinary to passers by and he restrained himself   97.20216132246392
i can not consent that this woman should die thus   77.77841842335653
and yet that woman deserved her fate   113.85686892096038
after passing through the porte saint denis athos looked at raoul s way of riding and observed take care raoul   200.11083952145256
he cast a rapid glance around the room and perceived that one of his men was missing   60.08793812496769
the horse started brushed against the imprudent man who thought by his strength alone to stay the tempest and he fell against the wall   88.02905994703761
but if you don t know this woman how do you know her name   146.312034445481
she has a clear and penetrating judgment and does not smile on the proposed union   190.52469414382608
but since my arrest and the robbery that was committed in my house i am alarmed every time i hear a door open particularly in the night   185.54075819453857
cried planchet i ve a man behind me   87.53396007259053
well my dear friend let us approach the window and there you can match your strength against that of an iron bar   80.0770493967228
of course you sent for a doctor   112.72787782956817
one was compelled to say i am the angel of the lord   103.87221259246428
noirtier had every morning and he has escaped by a miracle   133.3083340608548
did you see the president at the minister s last night   37.141364128775336
ali made a sign in the affirmative   80.47653763867487
the person who opened it must have taken me for a madman for i rushed at once to the stable   170.57756806449999
morrel soon perceived a man standing among the rocks apparently awaiting a sign from them to advance and pointed him out to valentine   121.61096164217406
sire replied the courtier laughing in order that he might seem to comprehend the quotation your majesty may be perfectly right in relying on the good feeling of france but i fear i am not altogether wrong in dreading some desperate attempt   163.76316606006952
the pont du gard inn such of my readers as have made a pedestrian excursion to the south of france may perchance have noticed about midway between the town of beaucaire and the village of bellegarde a little nearer to the former than to the latter a small roadside inn from the front of which hung creaking and flapping in the wind a sheet of tin covered with a grotesque representation of the pont du gard   92.33170584402035
but it was so carefully folded that no one could have read it and the seal was perfect   45.0057819412213
gentlemen said jussac it is with great regret that i pronounce the thing impossible   159.47775524557602
besides you can tell them that you have full confidence in me and they will not be more incredulous than you   182.6332490173549
the name of the owner of the winning horse   111.98584017024638
oh heaven exclaimed julie clasping her hands in what did he believe then   187.60800184763454
oh mother   139.92631120953598
the thin spare man   128.19034488527197
reflect upon it   136.0109755016952
twas too brief an enjoyment and la ramee felt that the gayety of heart he had regarded as the cause of health of which it was perhaps rather the result would not long survive such a mode of life   107.36224168942954
you have found that out have you my lord   27.643984570556327
yes where is this letter   114.0811737501764
this seemed a good augury   91.953770760502
all would pay deference to an officer like you with a fierce moustache and a long sabre but they think they may crush a poor weeping girl with impunity   68.7561037621183
edmond if you knew all the prayers i have addressed to god for you while i thought you were living and since i have thought you must be dead   195.93006558410792
od s bodikins said groslow as the four friends entered i had almost given you up   184.76960696518125
there is yours my dear friend replied d artagnan   95.39325119491713
he had the resolution to stop with this   98.57340580505233
the baroness knew how calm villefort naturally was and his present excitement frightened her so much that she opened her mouth to scream but the sound died in her throat   39.2746289808633
i will let you know a week beforehand   87.39849219505514
let the past be forever forgotten   157.3877205119645
yet these two noble and intelligent creatures united by the indissoluble ties of maternal and filial love had succeeded in tacitly understanding one another and economizing their stores and albert had been able to tell his mother without extorting a change of countenance mother we have no more money   117.02196953690128
you know him by what title   171.2141280416923
the young men rode up to the wounded man to announce that they were followed by the priest   77.3544798325371
i hope i am not the cause   86.68363133175296
said franz then you are a smuggler occasionally gaetano   162.1875002033417
your captivity shall be mild be assured   113.0341107344084
the white hair was thrown back from her yellow forehead and her eyes already sunken by the furrows of age now almost disappeared beneath the eyelids swollen with grief   50.505771773217084
it was in fact a small craft from dunkirk bound for boulogne   175.2688278096902
of what use to day   154.05879009069932
what a wrist you have reverend sir   241.61947813955055
he will gain himself a reputation   139.8750831407281
after this satisfied with the way in which he had conducted himself at meung without remorse for the past confident in the present and full of hope for the future he retired to bed and slept the sleep of the brave   157.39218577337948
replied danglars pleased to find the other so tractable   121.12130825612158
if on the sixteenth day after your departure at eight o clock in the evening you are not here no money even if it be but five minutes past eight   114.05692945353124
he is a young man that appears scarce sixteen years of age and is called the viscount de bragelonne   22.871123628575646
dantès stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle as if he now beheld it for the first time   185.86218208094618
i think i have sprained my wrist said porthos   83.18389152104766
they came nobody knew whence   79.14815334599567
that is it replied the cardinal dryly   174.9113492964901
that little man in black that you upset at the corner of saint jean cemetery   56.008538801225484
a lion even   100.80582428616941
still consider that although i may not be strictly speaking what is termed an illustrious match for you i am for many reasons not altogether so much beneath your alliance   106.07965543243122
the brutal affectation with which you have enumerated and classified your crimes calls for a severe reprimand on the part of the court both in the name of morality and for the respect due to humanity   181.47539551891987
bertuccio said the count severely   122.7727552271855
i shouldn t wonder if he were at the head of the mob at this very moment   143.8695516173519
large valances of silk embroidered with flowers of gay colors which were rather faded fell from the wide windows   107.58396990206869
madame de motteville who was on especial duty that evening followed to aid and undress her   93.33362817143077
and i do not think you can regret the intended husband of your daughter   59.42792811880469
planchet recognized him first   128.98401669076134
d avrigny m   150.49736263852787
he had only been back an hour or two   90.08945035370589
unfortunately we do not live in the times of the great emperor we live in the times of the cardinal   144.10400665631744
the other two gentlemen were unknown to him   83.60211429462858
he brought him also the amount of his wages which captain gaumard had not dared to apply for   27.04000548530088
de tréville was admitted into the household of the young prince where he made such good use of his sword and was so faithful to his motto that louis xiii   100.49159479745572
villefort complied and they passed on to the dining room   131.20850954217605
eugénie bowed coldly to the count and availed herself of the first moment when the conversation became earnest to escape to her study whence very soon two cheerful and noisy voices being heard in connection with occasional notes of the piano assured monte cristo that mademoiselle danglars preferred to his society and to that of m   21.618575211956056
the chancellor advanced therefore toward anne of austria and said with a very perplexed and embarrassed air and now it remains for me to make the principal examination   209.8092861511016
they proceeded thus to peronne   56.0141976852236
said caderousse or i shall be unable to sign it   153.35065921502388
well madame i perceive i must do as you wish   94.21023570724691
a tall young man with light hair clear gray eyes and thin and compressed lips dressed in a blue coat with beautifully carved gold buttons a white neckcloth and a tortoiseshell eye glass suspended by a silken thread and which by an effort of the superciliary and zygomatic muscles he fixed in his eye entered with a half official air without smiling or speaking   62.95876840952648
as usual valentine strolled for a short time among her flowers but without gathering them   26.786182498224818
the musketeers who had already discovered who mazarin was followed in profound silence   69.32721076544358
there was an expression on the face of her intrepid protector which commanded her veneration   164.9822958059208
d artagnan looked at the envelope   103.52627905138294
replied the young man additionally exasperated with this mixture of insolence and good manners of politeness and scorn   107.70212073022601
in that case i assure you there would very soon be a countess and viscountess of morcerf   91.44399666779721
the count bowed with the air of a person who hears a name for the first time   90.68825104279804
you pretend not to know because government was not rich enough   157.14525763486716
are you french sir   104.66756279030415
thomson french were your bankers   86.85129651420084
but a certain briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it probable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of time   92.04665688600164
i swear to make you my lawful wife before my lips even shall have approached your forehead   133.5334862226846
well i will have franz and château renaud   119.73110451308037
when mankind as you were just saying have discovered the secrets of death then that death will become as sweet and voluptuous as a slumber in the arms of your beloved   33.742397115587266
although the coadjutor had preached that same morning it was well known that he leaned much to the side of the fronde   99.2032423359538
only take care you do not break your legs in stumbling over some chain or your neck by falling in a hole   56.02223963467308
at least we shall see each other again m   153.1312599208803
he was disagreeably surprised to see his own valet de chambre whom he had not brought that he might not inconvenience monte cristo   124.36931718222539
he is an original then   72.35826043657644
bravo villefort   79.35412481724167
you mean to say we have lost said athos quietly drawing four pistoles from his pocket and throwing them upon the table   45.63788857031619
on what plea   155.78730093760336
trial chapter lxvi   57.29357520716292
i am entirely at your service except only for my orders   170.75527889797124
i will go to the second after attending the first said d artagnan   114.21846077906744
for you told me your father desired the marriage   123.79814973282419
and why were you alone   113.95972223132712
will you add these twenty francs to the seven you have   103.80624625875663
but the diamond i gave you yesterday   153.24092870190128
and at the same time he sprang toward his sword   128.71986575227183
my father has been a jacobin more than anything else said villefort carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence   130.225609717072
morrel looked around him and then drawing dantès on one side he said suddenly and how is the emperor   111.12037094603006
d avrigny cried villefort i can not tell you all i feel at this moment terror grief madness   139.7261727383739
he intended to pass the day in making a small gallows and hang one of the finest of these fish in the middle of his room the red color evidently conveying an allusion to the cardinal so that he might have the pleasure of hanging mazarin in effigy without being accused of having hung anything more significant than a crawfish   128.8209780941243
having dined with his usual tranquillity and moderation the count making a signal to ali to follow him went out by the side gate and on reaching the bois de boulogne turned apparently without design towards paris and at twilight   14.279526933023675
friend mousqueton you see that we have a reinforcement and we must have an increase of supplies   154.55319419325872
the queen breathed more freely   111.11503488134503
of what must i repent   137.64459286730332
villefort while turning restlessly on the cushions felt something press against him   110.68892288123288
the abbé with difficulty got away from the enthusiastic thanks of caderousse opened the door himself got out and mounted his horse once more saluted the innkeeper who kept uttering his loud farewells and then returned by the road he had travelled in coming   98.78995276401801
i fear an attack myself after all these disasters   106.9766333352127
thou mayst add that thou hast risked it planchet   141.4219644121818
thanks my friends thanks   109.39517561591339
the two travelers consulted for a moment   139.1286426410079
oh no not at all   171.13216052818677
the cardinal s quarters were upon the downs at the bridge of la pierre in a simple house without any entrenchment   137.63931912595135
realizing this villefort came to the rescue of the crest fallen minister instead of aiding to crush him   90.47027362769887
indeed sir i recognize you   80.01228729744511
for tell me where can you find a love like mine a love which neither time nor absence nor despair can extinguish a love which contents itself with a lost ribbon a stray look or a chance word   98.3064711428298
i wish you would try and find me a situation with him as grandfather since he holds the money chest   147.06991424075943
ah yes most assuredly said the eyes of the paralytic for he closed them with an expression which valentine could not mistake   109.79224513293438
but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard   87.40976887387075
de tréville s spread themselves about in the cabarets in the public walks and the public sports shouting twisting their mustaches clanking their swords and taking great pleasure in annoying the guards of the cardinal whenever they could fall in with them   132.25986612809731
well let me see what can you want that begins with n   113.67355222851783
four of them can guard the king and the other four your prisoners   85.85245988748039
do i turn to the right or to the left hand   64.61971319835769
well i tell you i will not drag my daughter before a tribunal and give her up to the executioner   96.59265426253704
but let your vengeance fall on the culprits on him on me but not on my son   117.74956974319407
the young man waited in comparative darkness and listened   128.69134682135723
since the evening before he had really been the hero of one of the tales of the thousand and one nights and he was irresistibly attracted towards the grotto   190.05440015361802
the door as it opened disclosed a gloomy sky in which the moon strove vainly to struggle through a sea of clouds that covered her with billows of vapor which she illumined for an instant only to sink into obscurity   84.72606553814506
i questioned her but in vain   172.80552124413657
but he was mistaken   134.39497797747387
grimaud who had risen to watch the effect of the shot fell back hopeless wringing his hands   12.917507326588208
there he saw the grand marshal who charged him with an oral message to a bonapartist in paris whose name i could not extract from him   154.39596028211193
in 1829 who made him a baron and chevalier of the legion of honor   61.46041017726029
besides this as every great action bears its recompense with it the brave exploit of d artagnan resulted in the restoration of the tranquility he had lost   58.68753281641363
have i discovered the truth   79.0559180018951
god has made them senseless said felton   95.38658045472752
the soldier replied by pointing out to him an officer who was conversing on foot his hand upon the neck of a horse on which the individual to whom he was talking sat   201.0098986544819
i am curious to know what work you were perusing with so much attention as we entered   121.66728217566552
the fact is maximilian that i was there and my presence had the effect of rendering you unjust in your comparison   112.1219036439981
having then a keeper like la ramee i should try also to have introduced to him by some friend or other a man who would be devoted to me who would assist me in my flight   50.436761209663985
château renaud bowed to the countess   123.31174401454005
withdraw then or i shall call and have you turned out as you were in london   137.57389391315414
you is it   136.4751097170288
the three young people separated that is to say morrel went to the boulevards château renaud to the pont de la révolution and debray to the quai   62.46468210963098
since the first attack i experienced of this malady i have continually reflected on it   163.35859405995416
then perhaps it is to your son m   133.68531540011745
yes that is inevitable said porthos   37.743483324372335
en route gentlemen   219.30317654998595
said athos you require too much d artagnan   130.20183565625473
you forget replied athos that we consider ourselves your prisoners and not free from the engagement we entered into   40.891174296094775
will you kitty   194.85271307938518
i am to fight today   76.16203291395496
nothing madame   56.74120942838526
robert le diable chapter 54   104.88438071263839
she began to believe herself really alive and awake and the belief that her reason was this time not deceived made her shudder   142.66752056946257
and i too murmured the young lady with the velvet eyes   112.79768953527177
yes there is something in what you say   22.237337781496564
can i be of service to your majesty   200.56533497099758
friend he said you have been too good in pardoning me   78.2574240717783
valentine and the old man heard this conversation and noirtier fixed his eye so earnestly on valentine that she felt bound to answer to the look   107.735752430701
yes yes they could not help admitting that the king for whom we sacrificed rank wealth and station was truly our louis the well beloved while their wretched usurper has been and ever will be to them their evil genius their napoleon the accursed   161.90036320351186
the concierge therefore heard for the first time that the lodger s name was lucien   146.0204093798987
he never invited anybody to go up with him and no one could form an idea of what his sumptuous apartment contained in the shape of real riches   86.01539291781415
one thing alone struck me of all the exquisite things he placed before us he touched nothing   116.82445733698215
now take my horse to the nearest inn and conduct me to your vessel   108.72299921295883
is it to make me a captain   142.38179553731212
called a joyous voice from without mercédès   126.2922186347554
either to seek the duc de beaufort or the duc de bouillon and to tell them about this   98.60914036133337
the husband heard of the affair   74.12444460034035
dormice are bad neighbors for us who do not eat them preserved as the romans did   70.2462997694193
they carried the man to his bed and called grimaud to dress the wound   158.49349609925974
when the boat was within twenty paces of the shore the man on the beach who carried a carbine presented arms after the manner of a sentinel and cried who comes there   44.76077589160289
and this feeling had been more painfully perceived by young d artagnan for so was the don quixote of this second rosinante named from his not being able to conceal from himself the ridiculous appearance that such a steed gave him good horseman as he was   66.27223489171786
in that case i will forgive him   159.7477588796627
it is of very little consequence to me at the end of the matter whether you have any angry feeling or not against dantès   136.35738896855983
a trial would make a noise and a noise would get the attention of our friends who would check the operations of monsieur de mazarin   100.83634721991379
25th april 1498   85.78657332273836
you will accomplish what i was to have done and derive all the honor and profit from it   175.5410574839499
he will never believe that my death was suicide   186.3551518218137
it is a very cold one my dear friend said aramis   129.53355439637681
madame said raoul the louvre is but the second palace this news has reached   60.05094701509397
you have been to yanina   104.72870135527592
some fragments of past splendor appeared here and there upon the walls of this modest lodging   148.25680661660087
but tell me dantès if you had command of the pharaon should you be glad to see danglars remain   164.3733404309608
well gentlemen resumed mordaunt we must set out without delay to day is the last day granted me by the cardinal   213.11314004882826
monsieur said morrel recovering his assurance as he proceeded do you recollect that a few days before the landing of his majesty the emperor i came to intercede for a young man the mate of my ship who was accused of being concerned in correspondence with the island of elba   96.50957681530537
and madame de villefort bowed and left the room giving orders that valentine should be summoned to her grandfather s presence and feeling sure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the perturbed spirit of the invalid   134.820950904268
and athos   175.77528428768304
a flash of terrible joy but rapid as thought gleamed from the eyes of milady   108.53805928338777
why should i do that   134.61962141860772
her soul lives in the body of this demon   107.70738609671074
that is to say you are invited m   163.62444405931262
i was four years old   141.1562122647273
the lock turned and the door slowly opened   72.88912922417055
before him on the front seat lay two pairs of pistols one in front of porthos and the other of d artagnan   131.27607542038558
no not even to my betrothed   81.03275010087151
do not think so bertuccio replied the count   121.76160092568689
said d artagnan monsters have only to complain to gain your sympathy   65.29418547935732
now an englishman is an enemy   80.96392491234397
then he felt and felt again the contents of the tankard he held in his hand   216.1763225842179
then the danger was so imminent the rioters came so near uttering such threats that the chancellor thought his last hour had come and confessed himself to his brother priest so as to be all ready to die in case he was discovered   92.29885435750701
then he added aloud but you have relations left you   29.013234382837254
why did we not destroy the child with the mother   57.78992787130444
oh i don t doubt that replied d artagnan   111.68468957090943
planchet called out d artagnan take care of the lackey   32.547019963928804
said porthos his eyes glistening at the news   183.91101287615896
from whom is this   143.60088807285914
but that is not all madame   108.01609683465085
the two assistants had borne andrea to the scaffold and there in spite of his struggles his bites and his cries had forced him to his knees   100.65170068696236
if you are take care for i shall never forgive you   31.819438231173194
this silence and this interruption in serving which were unintelligible to porthos had on the contrary a terrible meaning for the clerks   126.25126695390956
besides the tattoo has been sounded and we should be observed if we kept a light burning much longer than the others   41.49811830142772
come come that is not bad   150.25224676099825
why she inquired in a hoarse voice did you invite him to sleep here tonight   25.21392462965082
so without losing time tell me have you the slightest idea whence this terrible blow proceeds   124.30426687979379
your goodness confounds me monseigneur replied d artagnan and i am conscious of a greatness of soul in your eminence that makes me mean as an earthworm   60.01508583399625
that is very easily done   5.545950756483862
it communicates with my mistress s by that door   62.223531825156094
still more he has lifted the corner of her mask that shield with which she covered herself and which rendered her so strong   69.15341094700102
the office of the king s attorney chapter 68   96.3298939239098
and as if he feared doctor d avrigny would recall his promise he hurried him towards the house   45.92660513357109
i would rather find it triply bolted   165.29829563218033
only think then if mademoiselle danglars instead of being called claire marie eugénie had been named mademoiselle chastity modesty innocence danglars   75.50429746890288
in the meantime anne of austria approached comminges and conversed with him in a subdued tone whilst mazarin glanced uneasily at the corner occupied by d artagnan and porthos   189.8600574978073
responded dantès almost terrified   130.10035070910615
as to franz he had no longer any inducement to remain at monte cristo   60.32086828921624
no no madame there is no such thing as chance   51.03495866041283
here is m   75.77010598061541
meantime porthos had reloaded his pistols   148.57904024601115
then the diamond is safe   122.66830723726133
and you aramis   106.9340288077665
he resembles the old conventionalist of 93 who said to napoleon in 1814 you bend because your empire is a young stem weakened by rapid growth   126.49646859103387
all this is very sad which you tell me   101.20929050376074
and in addition to the lightness of her step which had betrayed her she emitted a little cough which denoted a sweet voice   93.33670367874576
what she had regarded as something distressing was in reality a disgrace   77.49764231816354
the weakness of a murderer   84.24277486321463
ah i remember athos is at monsieur de tréville s   124.22635685748891
a don quixote clothed in a woolen doublet the blue color of which had faded into a nameless shade between lees of wine and a heavenly azure   29.94828939428784
an apoplectic stroke   119.1359512904199
for how much   101.36854180852337
then she grasped the front hair which she also cut off without expressing the least regret   124.05538720850303
we will not constrain you to help us   125.1270937624789
a slave does not dictate to a master   132.7586264357004
because she was afraid of compromising you   164.2140124860386
although m   114.50624438127315
the second floor a house with a balcony   138.5267160670678
very well at one o clock then replied d artagnan turning the angle of the street   37.91930427145414
this one is i think a sterlet said château renaud   94.86588616500717
no no albert but you know these roses tuberoses and orange flowers throw out at first before one is used to them such violent perfumes   132.22760877414828
they threatened me with torture   139.43807430713616
four hours passed by and the giant was replaced by another bandit   54.53500155917475
the tree was easy to climb   147.08507060509834
but said franz the corsican bandits that were among the crew of his vessel   103.18469756307533
it was not a want of courage which rendered her poverty burdensome   67.16761618767205
the journey at two o clock in the morning our four adventurers left paris by the barrière st   100.5683026670534
bad weather   113.77057887868118
a bad reason replied danglars who reckoned on conciliating his keeper   137.02676518319186
in business sir said he one has no friends only correspondents   98.02231653152539
the host was alone seated before his desk one of the drawers of which was partly open   117.83933809210251
it is only to poets that such things happen said athos gravely   137.6350775794342
friquet who did not expect to be let off so cheaply bounded off like a gazelle up the quai a la rue dauphine and disappeared   62.41317712977638
cried lord winter   84.02572268798893
now said planchet let us bind him to a tree   157.15579996660745
let him run on said danglars restraining the young man   197.87272629145792
inquired mazarin   25.5329498350155
tilted on one side of her head she had a small cap of gold colored silk embroidered with pearls   65.90520235516328
a large cloak was spread at the stern   90.48844934247207
d épinay for he came this morning to paris   134.29058009772731
finally said felton finally what did they do   180.64096027252356
in the meantime said athos i renounce my plan of seclusion and wherever you go i will go with you   129.8870362471693
he could not therefore in the solitude of his dungeon traverse in mental vision the history of the ages bring to life the nations that had perished and rebuild the ancient cities so vast and stupendous in the light of the imagination and that pass before the eye glowing with celestial colors in martin s babylonian pictures   112.853782687398
bonacieux hesitated to continue   120.92287879995668
he was in the front row of the crowd admirably placed for seeing   159.5838378671266
in the second were ranged bars of unpolished gold which possessed nothing attractive save their value   136.7735049629479
the abbé was a man of the world and had moreover mixed in the first society of the day   133.82779460223634
to this i add a certificate in the funds of 25 000 francs   139.13582664841314
what do you tell me   103.60352361511767
his life madame belongs not to him   58.829245055222984
my mind appeared to strive in vain to shake off the heavy darkness of the sleep from which i could not rouse myself   112.14812195949065
that explains if the portrait you showed me be like the dark hue i so much admired on the visage of the noble catalan   131.78889751143194
yes but before we can kill him and he will be hard to kill that swiss he will shriek out and the whole picket will come and we shall be taken like foxes we who are lions and thrown into some dungeon where we shall not even have the consolation of seeing this frightful gray sky of rueil which no more resembles the sky of tarbes than the moon is like the sun   111.75694881081083
here is the key of the door so that you can go in and out as you please   79.37055774342925
but the two months expire next week   161.50381907996632
i can not calmly say with you providence has struck the blow   132.31914039629967
d artagnan concealed himself in his closet   145.0200959808893
it is the one my brother sends for us   133.35579012013565
go therefore and await it at boulogne sur mer and promise me to set out to morrow morning   208.91828259080222
a moment afterwards baptistin announced the count of morcerf to monte cristo and the latter leading haydée aside ordered that morcerf be asked into the drawing room   111.58302765877015
once more let me thank you my good friends both in my own name and the queen s   69.90223431392619
inquired franz   148.4822433740285
the count s marvellous sagacity understood all that was passing in the young girl s mind   108.89068613195948
but young as you are and scarcely entering into the world you have powerful enemies   99.15090127657388
monsieur d artagnan he said you are to take this dispatch to the bastile and bring back here the person it concerns   103.07205350126955
laws alone swamp our small staff   71.47909404427449
inspector continued the governor i can tell you the story as well as he for it has been dinned in my ears for the last four or five years   95.75929664059926
it appears to me that the news you bear is worth the trouble of a little diligence   106.87901461279036
when the count thought franz had gazed sufficiently on this picturesque tableau he raised his finger to his lips to warn him to be silent and ascending the three steps which led to the corridor of the columbarium entered the chamber by the middle arcade and advanced towards vampa who was so intent on the book before him that he did not hear the noise of his footsteps   132.81257398094922
the three friends remained mute for although the voice as well as the countenance reminded them of someone they had seen they could not remember under what circumstances   131.05840426362764
certainly they were   133.6510735851115
the project gutenberg ebook of the count of monte cristo illustrated this ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the united states and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever   130.2740145700888
oh he is so dreadfully pale   124.93602369151527
on arriving at the house morrel was not even out of breath for love lends wings to our desires   83.11117658149199
but it is not for me although i am a creditor myself to the amount of ten thousand francs to give any information as to the state of his finances   79.7274488568996
i know it because yesterday monsieur de wardes in a saloon where i was showed a ring which he said he had received from you   114.34889018121193
it is he who in an encounter with your eminence s guards decided the victory in favor of the king s musketeers   41.12852142648224
only this time it was no longer an inert body without feeling that the villain had to deal with   145.66734926246403
he did not know said the abbé   78.76631366391244
you are taking a poetical tone and the comedy of yesterday turns to a tragedy this evening   40.22078806016317
but you will be left alone   31.72806414953142
whom does your highness wish me to send to you   40.698072389828496
spy cried the duke more and more enraged i will strangle you with my own hands   12.022826130966152
now my lord give me if you have not lost it the ball that which contained the letter   140.62523776543324
really you were only before sparkling but now you are brilliant   140.6602965856689

said the musketeer   64.08712395396796
she had sent for me to know when you would return   124.0595671843552
i promise on my honor   101.66046906430978
two carriages were soon heard to enter the courtyard   154.91616203943343
if you have any appointment for this evening defer it till tomorrow   87.35140441318309
my lord i have in my parish a man who might be of the greatest use to you   148.91133317992245
my father had a long white beard but i loved him   51.70946814920917
could you incur my displeasure by having followed the orders of your superiors with more intelligence and courage than another would have done   106.17677626445077
then turning to the queen we may still hope   125.56254648791719
i can see neither heaven nor earth said the jeweller who was outside the door   65.65584243792811
but after he had gone about two hundred steps d artagnan stopped short alighted threw the bridle of his horse over the arm of planchet and took the pistols from his saddle bow to fasten them to his girdle   80.10720593476043
not that i can accept it but a league off it savors of the gentleman   46.8798034113115
why i think that they are rising faster than they have any business to do and that they would not be so black if they didn t mean mischief   118.83908679322475
but do you happen to belong to him   74.79301454377958
i attach great importance to the question i am about to put to you   161.297364711941
he told him his birth his position his fortune and more than once when he consulted the look of the paralytic that look answered that is good proceed   94.7318147384226
the noise was caused by porthos who had just knocked down his man   145.7422632360515
the king is alone with a few gentlemen whom he fears to lose every day   229.49095789221306
surely valentine you are mistaken   94.28385199310262
in a few minutes porthos had rejoined his companions who were already in the boat   175.76407021752726
and fernand   102.4780260047421
the nubian smiled assentingly to his master s words then kneeling on one knee respectfully kissed the hand of the count   107.3583577090161
i say you are a miserable creature   160.72469424133692
said danglars enraged   131.1419003238246
to be sure they may   103.93507874698491
well said cried aramis   69.16557546692096
i recollect coming for my mother to look at it when m   72.71954756538975
interrogate me i entreat you   159.53567668794008
at length through the window of a little hut they showed me a woman sitting leaning on a table and said there is the person to be executed   84.8153338796456
they went into the chateau   76.58574106508001
cavalcanti remained master of the field   121.06650222870502
his signal was returned and in two hours afterwards the new comer lay at anchor beside the yacht   87.02953211989887
i was thinking my dear old friend that when you were a musketeer you turned your thoughts incessantly to the church and now that you are an abbé you are perpetually longing to be once more a musketeer   93.07525977606154
as soon as i learned i could in any way assist you i most eagerly seized the opportunity of offering my services   88.6782203426517
if god willing these swords should be devoted to the service of your eminence said d artagnan i shall venture to express a wish which is that in its turn the purse of your eminence may become light and theirs heavy for with these three men your eminence may rouse all europe if you like   78.86732380416183
this was julie who had become as the clerk of the house of thomson french had predicted madame emmanuel herbault   56.93991205617701
the man said in a low voice i wish i wish you to spare me the walk back to paris   123.44633494455819
i promise you it shall be done answered de comminges   117.27653753785175
ah said villefort this seems to me the truth   79.51292455798844
maillard   102.27319514057581
cried the baron i shall never console myself   133.8689724797184
what i know is that like a fool a greater fool than he of whom i spoke just now i mistook for this peasant girl a young bandit of fifteen or sixteen with a beardless chin and slim waist and who just as i was about to imprint a chaste salute on his lips placed a pistol to my head and aided by seven or eight others led or rather dragged me to the catacombs of st   140.72702676556762
you have a broker have you not   24.57640705674038
the overflow of my brain would probably in a state of freedom have evaporated in a thousand follies   203.9861700924973
ali and his master conveyed the wounded man into a room   199.4414449512706
cried athos extending his hand to the lieutenant   120.92990507527243
but soon a ray of hope glimmered in the multitude of thoughts which bewildered his mind and a faint smile played upon his white lips and pallid cheeks   132.36403958994197
in recalling all he had been through he foresaw all that raoul might suffer   119.10554233314387
the pardon chapter 117   165.33311405809494
i might have suspected he was poisoning us   124.13761477026662
a ball had passed through his breast   106.49608060305914
nevertheless while acknowledging the truth of what he said i thought proper to insist   124.2109434240154
there was a musketeer who was in love with one of my women   147.27563132312443
raoul had only been at m   136.59773953329287
only you must please to remember that this is friday   103.73725970558476
the sentinel wanted to repulse him   140.47888767803292
and just below this lamp there was laid wrapped in a flowing mantle of violet velvet worked with fleurs de lis of gold a catafalque resting on trestles of oak   102.8996270247745
it is to him that the queen has been writing all the day   151.59941938487594
it was the fault of their horses not theirs   162.78971201389822
and the count burst into a laugh   144.41808661608744
then knitting his brows into a deep frown he added surely this can not be one of the morrel family who lived at marseilles and gave us so much trouble from their violent bonapartism i mean about the year 1815   108.19304289371308
i have already told you that we do not sell at retail   40.098770471470246
the floor was uncarpeted   37.58636567498225
an hour after her table was cleared   112.8841885839383
you have promised me to go said the queen   128.17643344566784
he turned around and seized his new antagonist by the wrist when he started back exclaiming raoul   71.39311014953759
but you who have taken no such oath why are you here and what cause do you represent   79.87576098003052
are we not their majesties servants   143.13498485165246
i would be alone   56.33070945423309
the old man winked his eyes expressively which we may remember was his only way of expressing his approval   168.7604723299573
then they follow you   84.03906301898476
i said nothing   156.68776194751715
this important task was just completed as they arrived at the countess s box   168.08399636669074
if i have been your friend morcerf your present manner of speaking would almost lead me to forget that i ever bore that title   84.13904634455461
nevertheless had caderousse but retained his post a few minutes longer he might have caught a dim outline of something approaching from the direction of bellegarde   81.80585692729976
be easy kitty there is something between that man and me that he is quite ignorant of he nearly made me lose my credit with his eminence   176.3714911311283
once for all tréville had placed his stable at d artagnan s service   87.84877788747983
fernand was enrolled in the active army went to the frontier with his regiment and was at the battle of ligny   159.00139363966278
but said he whom d artagnan thus provoked it appears to me that this place is badly chosen and that we should be better behind the abbey st   157.43287495876208
instead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor dantès carefully preserved it that in the event of his getting out of prison he might have wherewithal to live for the sale of such a diamond would have quite sufficed to make his fortune   114.40484298581607
the prince immediately sent fifty thousand francs to mazarin begging him never to write to him again and offered twenty thousand francs more on condition that he would never speak to him   189.56451705872433
it was and the feast that began so gayly had a very sorrowful ending   144.33687546878346
the two doctors therefore entered the room alone   109.8127108621468
cried athos are not those fellows poachers they have arrested yonder   134.8214368127459
and her name was do you desire to know her name   163.81405798210594
i am to be a soldier then   159.9390337768898
no said the count i was making a suit   130.23809709310925
they stopped at the first tavern and made each horse swallow a double quantity of corn steeped in wine   63.63129422045402
her devotion to the queen is known   136.12600929710516
the pharaon is entering the harbor   106.26903743642158
on her side mme   92.98352199957657
well said morcerf impatiently what does all this mean   69.79662071526765
accept my compliments   200.46511064814666
the count received him with his habitual smile   64.73391070861723
whom do you bring   43.77847024424328
we have secured him   56.208378669217474
there s one way of settling this said jacopo   108.100332216842
i know that porthos was in a fair way replied d artagnan   96.91815280151059
well then said athos it is agreed   124.71999376582707
it was against his will that athos took these precautions but aramis had very judiciously reminded him that they had no right to be imprudent that they had been charged by king charles with a supreme and sacred mission which received at the foot of the scaffold could be accomplished only at the feet of queen henrietta   127.84810807348592
excitement was at its height among the musketeers and their allies and they even began to deliberate whether they should not set fire to the hôtel to punish the insolence of m   31.174393396381106
and believe me dear friend we ought not to lose our time it is precious   79.6982281386667
adieu countess   170.0424347348808
villefort had secluded himself not to study but to reflect   131.6927970895702
dantès saw that he must attack the wedge   134.24697601577444
touching sympathy   69.48967835175615
d artagnan returned to help porthos if porthos needed help   112.41687247735867
were i but of gentle birth   145.1649382120376
but a most ridiculous circumstance has occurred which is this thomson french the roman bankers have sent to me a certain person calling himself the count of monte cristo and have given him an unlimited credit with me   87.5754437345614
it was her husband who had discovered the disappearance of the moneybag and was crying thieves   56.16264768301099
at the end of an instant s observation he heard the noise of a vehicle and saw milady s carriage stop opposite to him   189.8980789736101
noble and unhappy king   133.22098402667177
it led into the park as the three fugitives perceived by the night breeze which rushed into the corridor and blew the wind into their faces   71.45078468005953
that would be much more difficult   128.37497673291006
vampa measured the distance   110.55947455424054
you will be assassinated   171.49724646879227
then continued château renaud since you have an establishment a steward and a hotel in the champs élysées you only want a mistress   122.12179904865309
cried the cardinal with violence   143.60827020272325
at the same instant the firing began on the other side and the balls penetrated the boards all round us   165.6994271031864
on landing the count turned towards the cemetery where he felt sure of finding morrel   147.3787168675513
here it is said aramis taking a small key from his breast and opening a little ebony box inlaid with mother of pearl here it is   61.621572116000216
in short continued the cardinal as i have heard nothing of you for some time past i wished to know what you were doing   59.313292294334495
just as he was his mind perfectly clear but the same incapability of moving or speaking   113.44709542782893
hein   54.24795130737299
i called on fernand who sent me a hundred francs by his valet de chambre   151.73853544944285
credit owing to the reports afloat was no longer to be had   135.47918688551067
d artagnan glanced at athos and aramis and for the first time replied to porthos s nudge of the knee by a nudge responsive   190.09175067761458
you decide then nothing about me my lord   171.94387863004857
no yes he was   115.06302567321819
at la réserve   142.75120016376286
the patron of la jeune amélie proposed as a place of landing the island of monte cristo which being completely deserted and having neither soldiers nor revenue officers seemed to have been placed in the midst of the ocean since the time of the heathen olympus by mercury the god of merchants and robbers classes of mankind which we in modern times have separated if not made distinct but which antiquity appears to have included in the same category   46.59949390885107
coquenard understood it   123.58021641003936
julie returned holding the silken purse in her hands while tears of joy rolled down her cheeks like dewdrops on the rose   73.05595469615456
that we may be more at our ease la ramee removes the guards keeping only grimaud to wait on us   83.39484481298268
ah you scoundrel   139.65816394768487
therefore instead of condemning him for his intimacy with outlaws you must give me leave to excuse any little irregularity there may be in such a connection   82.2541156968328
however monte cristo only made a sign to apprise ali who understanding that danger was approaching from the other side drew nearer to his master   126.19707832965405
this unexpected circumstance brought back richelieu s former anxiety and forced him in spite of himself once more to turn his eyes to the other side of the sea   141.23547268837652
groaned forth villefort in a paroxysm of grief which was the more terrible from the novelty of the sensation in the iron heart of that man   121.82040663156965
you seem to forget that   79.19796129919342
i wish his eminence to become pope on the first opportunity allowing me then the right of demanding full indulgences for myself and my friends   26.7583469202893
but raoul was not at the hotel du grand charlemagne   87.71805569845102
you have doubtless already guessed that i was preparing a surprise for you   77.33463794431903
ah what a dreadful thing said the young musician   100.9381240411968
i believed i had a right to endeavor to find her   62.53221208594637
the pale light of the first rays of day gave to her clear eyes a strangely frightful expression   104.73091234958275
it is to throw ourselves into the wolf s jaws said aramis   92.60295060198355
lay him down here   95.27792428582467
but i have often resolved to visit them   88.33468024849105
and who appeared to abide on that spot that he might thus address human pride so sure to be exalted by the glories of a throne dust of the earth   131.39123625524888
edmond stiffened himself in order to play the part of a dead man and then the party lighted by the man with the torch who went first ascended the stairs   177.23085511435406
but he recalled the promise he had made to valentine and kept his secret   48.07492293369242
a tuscan count   141.81535480692952
yes said the duke but take care my dear la ramee for i propose to beat you badly   88.85735576352425
i wish albert de morcerf and raoul de château renaud to be present at this signature   114.95383398510558
two persons were coming down the stairs   125.9890710765782
undeceive yourself again   85.92076665979415
here and there on the walls of the staircase were reflected gigantic shadows which trembled in the flickering light of the pine torches till they seemed to reach to the vaulted roof above   134.96311046732026
it appeared to him that something might have happened at the pavilion in his absence and that fresh information awaited him   56.560134256442375
but i swear to you before god who hears us that if you betray me and my enemies pardon me i will kill myself while accusing you of my death   121.78659107826462
the bastion st   25.881680130327283
as for me so nervous and so subject to fainting fits i should require a doctor adelmonte to invent for me some means of breathing freely and tranquillizing my mind in the fear i have of dying some fine day of suffocation   82.22194961014853
only tell him tréville since he wishes to be considered your friend that i also wish to be one of his but he neglects me   166.9304091686564
madame de villefort is ill   109.70437380220092
mademoiselle valentine passed through the room to go to madame de villefort s said he   164.3224824447705
he wished to see everything   51.11670820257593
this is a beastly country this england   45.71002618000119
said raoul   75.52358816270947
your majesty answered mazarin desires me to do only what i was going to ask you to let me do   159.46456578936585
still seeing that albert continually watched her countenance to judge the state of her feelings she constrained herself to assume a monotonous smile of the lips alone which contrasted with the sweet and beaming expression that usually shone from her eyes seemed like moonlight on a statue yielding light without warmth   165.00542597196767
he had foreseen all   169.9540733333612
oh yes said the count you are looking for the sailors   131.4431982255103
athos alone kept away and sat in the furthest corner of the room as if determined to be merely a spectator of the proceedings   82.65588913009714
to what class of society does he belong   91.24434444558587
if he comes out we shall catch him   125.4688544356044
milady uttered a frightful shriek and dragged herself along several paces upon her knees toward her judges   129.13800731236523
the unhappy man uttered an exclamation of joy   158.97647953816335
since it is at the same time the opinion of d artagnan and of athos it must be the best   80.84938623278138
then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in the portfolio   101.98363480883864
sleep well your last night as citizen   73.67436245578367
but after all said lord de winter when the three friends had been named we do not know who you are   113.51331372191132
suffer me also madame replied villefort to add my earnest request to mademoiselle de saint méran s that you will kindly allow the veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past   64.35993816662213
and of what religion are you then madame   57.733425383349235
out of all the numerous clerks that used to fill the deserted corridor and the empty office but two remained   78.15094862274537
you have been in my service a year your fund has already begun to accumulate let it continue to do so   132.6033905597143
has the law any eyes to witness your grief   156.47367296669927
oh i dare not she forbade my sending for you   113.5370380375778
oh he is the exact personification of what i have been led to expect   142.28601446344854
i can understand that said d artagnan   65.43165546340049
cried grimaud   95.42496207763455
cried d artagnan as he went down the steps of the hatchway preceded by the lantern what a number of barrels   131.18252580675855
it was too much for a heart furrowed by the love of heaven that burns by the hatred of men that devours   115.60608618991415
but afterwards   64.40680449772228
his vigilant eye watches over and penetrates to the bottom of the heart   53.42779945846399
i took then in conformity with the orders of the authorities who sent me a reinforcement of six men such measures as i thought necessary to get possession of the persons of the pretended coiners   140.74395278127835
twice he had overcome his doubts   108.79188831844756
if beaten i am lost   61.056009835160665
her lips were about to pass his sentence of life or death   161.76802601378526
giving me her hand to kiss   118.51516421048713
he remembered those interesting stories so little believed in paris respecting roman bandits   156.6198001811465
and he fell rather than sat down on one of the seats which surrounded the table   168.89238973951694
40274m morrel watched her as she left the room   47.74150366816376
his feet were naked so he had no shoes and stockings to take off   211.4000625296158
cromwell looked at him with astonishment   118.27057316033648
the noise became so distinct that the horses might be counted by the rattle of their hoofs   103.1013931004458
these would just have suited them   153.3776104305278
and will you sign the contract   109.86843485747235
then in spite of the weariness of his beast he made it gallop but the rising ground soon deprived him of all sight of the travelers and when he had again attained a new height the ferryboat had left the shore and was making for the opposite bank   62.99416254347583
there was one lying on the table   85.54704802594135
monte cristo saw nothing but the shadow which no one else observed   158.19582095014806
cried the king is the messenger s name m   96.44148444746995
it must then be the visitor he hoped for   117.22598569156186
but his eyes scarcely quitted the box between the columns which remained obstinately closed during the whole of the first act   99.18149599703256
her nerves gave way and she sunk on the carpet   95.57145331077925
it was evident that all was not yet over   154.9946561700872
the three windows were still untenanted   92.00812335727485
on descending we saw through the lattice work several boats which were gradually becoming more distinct to our view   110.63797365672136
poor man he is a worthy creature   113.34273724259177
for i wager anything it is the creditor who visits me   88.16303196667286
come come murmured d artagnan rochefort has kept his promise but where in the devil is he   163.16175531972723
but the young man had begun to follow or rather to advance before the boat   77.86347694955498
said laporte   39.8094584300117
faria followed him with an excited look   113.24692062117512
but by the smallness of the form the hesitation of the walk and the indecision of the step he soon discovered that it was a woman   144.71832631597863
can i have lost it   48.47621298593097
the woman you poisoned at béthune was still younger than you madame and yet she is dead said d artagnan   105.49112463387279
are you not a sportsman and a great wolf hunter   104.5464853656937
have i not told you so gentlemen   60.96200932045172
ah really   115.2555620949721
and it was they who told you something which made you angry   121.20096280587308
is it to have the pleasure of insulting us that you say that my little viper   120.89141152642956
whilst d artagnan and porthos were engaged in conducting the cardinal to saint germain athos and aramis returned to paris   128.91983211600294
and what of that   110.16721371471631
but we must first learn what convent she is in   41.89897001914622
i know that from the gulf in which their enemies have plunged them they have risen with so much vigor and glory that in their turn they have ruled their former conquerors and have punished them   73.2085739092825
morrel attributed penelon s embarrassment to the elegance of his attire   70.453249611283
you will return after three or four years with a russian princess for a bride and no one will think more of what occurred yesterday than if it had happened sixteen years ago   48.47792511762624
for ever and ever   171.23646559045912
the young man went to her and took her hands   139.57724488446487
did you observe d artagnan that three days running they have brought us braised mutton   68.55522481245907
france is so prosaic and paris so civilized a city that you will not find in its eighty five departments i say eighty five because i do not include corsica you will not find then in these eighty five departments a single hill on which there is not a telegraph or a grotto in which the commissary of police has not put up a gaslamp   86.98065590428334
dying in the arms of his children he had been by them laid by the side of his wife who had preceded him in eternity by two years   110.24402973636982
the woman had the outline of mme   59.302512081392585
and with his sailor s eye he knew it to be a genoese tartan   65.20497708282713
what are my commands   110.36784896426016
cromwell bowed   148.1612624329433
but monsieur said mousqueton i can t swim   119.50861758594459
his only jewellery was a chain so fine that the slender gold thread was scarcely perceptible on his white waistcoat   135.09612511713033
this secret aramis does not belong to us   99.36718994305367
do not envy me this happiness   209.35741332214064
only as you see the carnival has commenced   133.40024107183157
yes i understand that   90.07556979277174
well this time said the cardinal it is not necessary to steal his confidence but to present yourself frankly and loyally as a negotiator   146.3924462943258
it is a wretched damp nay even horrible spot more especially when we consider the agonizing conferences which have taken place between those iron bars   126.690272612534
between the forest and this accursed spot a little behind the trampled ground was the same track of small feet as in the garden   99.95913548240367
this is my story then   80.18235077206727
but that is not the question   165.97914518048566
caderousse was thoughtful for a moment   97.6272252093679
no said d artagnan   149.96376188229002
athos was introduced and announced by name   153.96552124354918
can you see the air you breathe and yet without which you could not for a moment exist   97.04364891193383
men are so made   214.4583071936932
danglars turned pale   31.260383191210195
in a quarter of an hour let every one be in bed and snoring   74.41397793114582
one window was lighted   131.811470483924
by the way i have received news of franz   52.41627577049039
along the isle of dogs   92.7673888205761
well if my husband s soul can come to me why should not my soul reappear to guard my granddaughter   57.40378267014078
it appears according to your account that if by mischance a musketeer is arrested france is in danger   82.3223090490275
the man was caught in the act of assassination and robbery   147.02447016335222
well asked he what now   162.0828886601778
whither art thou going grimaud   135.82103831040632
i swear by my honor as a sailor by my love for mercédès by the life of my father speak monsieur said villefort   126.9389063130925
porthos sucked his mustache muttering a good deal of ceremony to night about crushing an adder   95.66594824695657
said albert gazing through his tears at his mother s portrait   119.73278291932327
i respect old age but i don t much like it boiled or roasted   146.44961008702177
morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me replied dantès   193.2263701799876
well said beauchamp we shall see our friend   85.86883721980975
but if your honor knew this man   101.50998081384766
he came to announce that the solemn entrance of the king queen and her ministers was to take place on the ensuing day   113.4241759661232
the abbé asked one day of dantès   149.46495609376154
at length the poor old fellow reached the end of all he had   107.88333489840933
the siege of la rochelle is about to be resumed monseigneur   7.09602458188823
the only sublime ideas in politics are those which bear fruit   106.87543147506594
ah said he to debray who had thrown himself into an easy chair at the farthest extremity of the salon and who held a pencil in his right hand and an account book in his left what are you doing there   97.40521810639996
so that he told me that poor monsieur maillard go find the coadjutor friquet and if you bring him to me you shall be my heir   171.2312170385054
but tell me all about it   107.29265727174898
he had only time to get his hat and throw himself breathless into the closet when the procureur s footstep was heard in the passage   139.93505854598348
at whose house you robbed and murdered did you not   131.80845527206517
besides we can but blow out his brains if he proves false said the gascon   30.82698227800023
what did i say   106.79556117239342
a nobility of the rope   116.1426593841867
and as much at least in pearls diamonds and jewels said eugénie   133.35671204100254
replied d artagnan deuce take it the campaign is going to begin   6.700438362534058
everything is turned topsy turvy in the world nowadays   125.95948586991899
de morcerf to the position he had long held in public opinion   106.24770267635009
i fear lest athos should have been beaten down by serving men   144.05975036262865
thereupon she ran toward the carriage which had turned round toward the way it came jumped upon the step and the carriage drove off   138.71148284392427
monsieur said d artagnan on quitting tarbes and coming hither it was my intention to request of you in remembrance of the friendship which you have not forgotten the uniform of a musketeer   105.504362483793
everyone had just seen it pass   122.05683096800979
no no said noirtier s look   141.03766030438896
this is not a command but advice i give you   79.0328656765165
tis he past all doubt   125.69454170586921
he is reduced almost to the last extremity nay he is almost at the point of dishonor   63.519993384616484
now let us pass the orangery to the hunting lodge   106.52910153102127
he had been down to the stables already taken a look at the horses and given the necessary orders for the day whilst athos and aramis were still in bed and porthos snoring   120.85991226975074
that bonacieux   237.11735769095074
and if you doubt the sincerity of my gratitude oh then ask haydée   108.63687823633445
in this place were together 60 000 pouches and 200 barrels   181.44763562082773
grimaud s a cunning fellow murmured mousqueton   98.89180991866198
said he to himself while the lamp and the wax lights were nearly burnt out and the servants were waiting impatiently in the anteroom   108.75792188813325
nay more he seemed greatly flattered at two or three compliments which the count very skilfully and agreeably paid him with as much ease as if he had known him these thirty years   114.13201146387811
it was a movement of vengeance upon milady   113.2164273283974
at this instant the three friends turned in spite of themselves a last look on the rock upon the menacing figure which pursued them and now stood out with a distinctness still   122.46515785111669
end of the project gutenberg ebook twenty years after updated editions will replace the previous one the old editions will be renamed   79.23139733581625
but as you have said two that are a match for twenty said athos   86.17079769600966
air liberty melody of birds plains of lombardy venetian canals roman palaces the bay of naples   143.57042040626988
yes indeed i have often thought with a bitter joy that these riches which would make the wealth of a dozen families will be forever lost to those men who persecute me   150.1738679301008
and why revenge   109.58964879000098
i should have feared to injure both edmond and yourself had i divulged my own apprehensions to a soul   135.5159816482261
devil take it he muttered to himself don t let me betray my secrets to a man not inclined to entertain them   62.95168591993709
and that my lord after having been present at the christening should go to proffer his homage to our holy father the pope   97.55141092312397
impossible madame impossible murmured felton who felt to the bottom of his heart the justness of this argument   103.46685785477331
at last comminges appeared pushing broussel before him   86.84214586057763
athos and aramis again questioned planchet but he had seen nothing of d artagnan   81.95153444514264
it is a bad year for kings said gondy shaking his head   46.71413048736177
monsieur said louis xviii   152.37867423785434
he related to him what he had heard of the projects of the cardinal with regard to buckingham and all with a tranquillity and candor of which m   140.1233099900603
no you did not   21.931339138832328
athos when he reached his appointed room observed through the gratings of his window walls and roofs   119.7856768988598
yes we   87.8367611014923
i will do it captain   160.63074424817168
if he did not return by ten o clock she was to sail   124.77737995453708
he crossed the sea and brought back the set of ornaments to the great queen who was able to wear them on her shoulder on the appointed day   115.29557261497587
but i shall say like the spaniard he has not been so brave today as he was yesterday   153.17930865388377
fernand went and mercédès remained alone   1.4221570145999891
then you hope   110.88481028652826
i did not mention that because the signature seemed to me so strange   170.96218079297446
no all is over   187.66990999767532
you gave your direction to no one but your postilion yet i have your address and in proof i am here the very instant you are going to sit at table   131.06004447998257
athos bowed and prepared to leave   88.25722257550183
he has given you some little writing for me the least bit of paper which may show that you come in his name   67.09869174290226
he felt himself doubly betrayed by his friend and by her whom he already loved like a mistress   75.83211498162008
40227m the stranger cast one look around her to be certain that they were quite alone   105.51061458470963
you have brought him to see me thinking to make me happy   109.52671184304002
you remind me said the priest that the young man concerning whom i asked you was said to bear the name of edmond   98.33995673329542
with what view   67.22738797681185
no noise from without by which i could measure the time reached me   53.289050425542406
meanwhile the sailors had collected dried sticks and branches with which they made a fire   22.378952856798122
have you shown this letter to anyone   113.5740655222765
then valentine s attention was engrossed by the clock in her room which marked the seconds   134.45818222463708
he sent us word this morning replied château renaud that he would meet us on the ground   65.97451701656934
at last the half hour struck   71.64390952773972
the letter is here   195.4544455032341
de tréville had always been so thoroughly his friend had always been so devoted to the king and queen and hated the cardinal so cordially that the young man resolved to tell him everything   108.81841319872468
he had found in m   53.543005042498216
ah how good my dear father is   160.11124406585105
everything is clear to me now   97.57175546419417
do you think he would recollect you   126.21058402697608
these two can not have drunk all the cellar   70.76195792966308
and yet you say he has sent you some as from us   101.86161522024496
he knew what were the rights of the great land owners   156.2298043831918
and as for me said porthos i swear nothing but i m choked   75.78497437650837
de saint méran s death which took place on the first stage after he left marseilles   132.00077140454238
very true said monte cristo   155.1267421964528
two hours after all was over   105.50766269742309
0069m fernand closed his eyes a burning sensation passed across his brow and he was compelled to support himself by the table to prevent his falling from his chair   44.216873871999994
he had not slept well for five or six nights even if he had slept at all   177.7454815709848
well then said franz let us to the colosseum   101.9979944201796
however as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last chance and making them understand that they were condemned to perpetual imprisonment a new misfortune befell them   139.19289570683875
however it was this answer in which the child s whole character revealed itself that almost terrified me and my arm fell without touching him   132.79780284526817
on guard then   74.66702745686737
these gentlemen wage war on private account and in buying them up by granting them what they wished monsieur le cardinal has made a good bargain   142.81967682230785
i concluded that he was going to versailles and i was not deceived   99.55416169864534
finally d artagnan had entire faith in the bravery of planchet and reminded them of the manner in which he had conducted himself in the ticklish affair of boulogne   110.3069216784986
then said athos in a tone of delight he is well   164.2395637382451
much more so would be that of the king   89.65976288177373
workmen were immediately called in and that same night the passengers at the end of the faubourg saw with surprise that carpenters and masons were occupied in repairing the lower part of the tottering house   210.823538166335
groslow whistled and a sailor appeared   153.06166784729874
always to show mercy to those i plead for   158.9299749722806
he came to this melancholy conclusion as he entered the antechamber   110.41754804781547
it is true said the baroness with that strange simplicity sometimes met with among fashionable ladies and of which plebeian intercourse can never entirely deprive them it is very true that had not the morcerfs hesitated my daughter would have married monsieur albert   87.59336987228619
oh there was no harm meant answered danglars   46.08635670759182
well wife replied caderousse i don t know but what you re right   113.0569454023909
of the second opening wh   108.37456807076619
do you know the decision we have come to mother   133.11803542942116
thank god sir they are not   93.1899815745769
this morning being ignorant that i should have the honor of seeing your majesty i encumbered myself with this dress but you will find me none the less a man devoted to your majesty s service in whatever way you may see fit to use me   103.49546756579494
this advice was too reasonable and moreover came from a man who knew the king too well to allow the four young men to dispute it   100.81860388753726
speak quickly friend   118.20561543591221
let me hear then said the count who this deeply regretted son was   103.55334413264579
have two riding horses ready   117.07684677537122
exclaimed dantès pressing his hand to his throbbing brows   150.56616484796405
make yourself quite easy on that point answered villefort with one of his sweetest smiles   221.35782299989233
rochefort bent low   153.61871980177244
in an instant he had cleared every obstacle away and he saw successively the lock placed between two padlocks and the two handles at each end all carved as things were carved at that epoch when art rendered the commonest metals precious   71.96526430969013
and if you grant me the care of your future prospects you will redouble my strength   91.67977803996533
a lady it was said had just fainted   44.3273650546263
he has invited us in return to morrow   75.26961376880624
perused too the application dated 10th april 1815 in which morrel by the deputy procureur s advice exaggerated with the best intentions for napoleon was then on the throne the services dantès had rendered to the imperial cause services which villefort s certificates rendered indisputable   147.4102071891414
you see then said albert that instead of opposing she will encourage me   169.24946148159577
i never joke with bankers said monte cristo in a freezing manner which repelled impertinence   21.477573842356307
d artagnan related the adventure of the preceding day in all its details   100.41790179120632
but this unexpected unhoped for unheard of fortune sufficed you no longer when you once possessed it   157.7632143824397
i ask for no more   20.379632516088336
asked albert in the most sprightly tone   145.5985873110742
the banker uttered a groan and followed his guide   73.73356584047085
he did so and thus doubled his income   93.37795768692007
we ought in our adventures never to be defeated or give any one a chance to laugh at us   160.22892205358772
i was lying on the floor for my strength began to abandon me   33.925387959215314
oh no it s only because i am tired and also because i have a little business to talk over with you   94.64875670585565
we must trust in god   92.7426912782303
in the room adjoining the chamber in which she changed her toilet   62.43707929894884
she pressed her son s hand and sobbed aloud but her tears relieved her   138.0477964337074
but on my soul it looks so   265.2346967320464
sir said madame de chevreuse you must excuse me but i long to know to whom i am talking   126.33118941636951
we shall see returned the other smiling   73.2141061702311
you will see danglars that it will turn out an unlucky job for both of us   106.0762221205399
at length one evening as the jailer was visiting him for the last time that night dantès with his ear for the hundredth time at the wall fancied he heard an almost imperceptible movement among the stones   39.58892922723017
he was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time when the door opened and eugénie appeared attired in a figured black satin dress her hair dressed and gloves on as if she were going to the italian opera   105.89711117806752
said he your son s life   140.521580371951
in fact a great noise was heard in the ante chamber   102.05777634321664
it is well said haydée   174.37168934866608
said the young woman endeavoring to read her husband s inmost thoughts while a smile passed over her countenance which froze the impassibility of villefort   86.89148834999781
40050m the two young ladies were seen seated on the same chair at the piano accompanying themselves each with one hand a fancy to which they had accustomed themselves and performed admirably   80.86667362649037
you have lived three years in paris   152.68427071102374
or rather sir said aramis with his peculiar irritating politeness the error of the person who was with you when we met you in the guardroom   102.89733378406797
fine sport   93.68201477756607
sir i can take my pay at this moment to the full extent of my wishes   154.27034577062065
president   177.1362200634397
so far good monseigneur   178.66558226073437
tush tush cried the men   171.124516133832
here is a man who had resigned himself to his fate who was going to the scaffold to die like a coward it is true but he was about to die without resistance   124.36994149028268
but the count expecting my bachelor s revenue could not suffice for the coming month s outlay has offered me a draft for twenty thousand francs   51.57383535009988
nor in the second said aramis nor in the third returned porthos   87.2972807424015
i have lost even the knife that saved me   152.85364628200998
madame cried mazarin more and more moved will your majesty permit me to give you counsel   208.89320013973344
the cart was returning empty to paris and the two lackeys had agreed for their transport to slake the wagoner s thirst along the route   113.35639852790523
it is needless to add that there were gold and silver fish in the basin   178.65267727293673
an hour afterwards the carriage was again ordered and this time it went to the rue fontaine saint georges and stopped at no   95.43022471537103
still annotating   201.97401100240597
a nubian   50.22688866346322
and then all things being accomplished to the satisfaction of the cardinal to come to him and claim her vengeance   158.6390180616459
well eugénie what is it you want with me   51.823209923180265
don t be in a hurry to weave crowns for our scotchman   140.6218989520268
it was evident that she had shared the grief of the family for she was pale and looked fatigued   72.04234695841348
edmond continued she you will see that if my face is pale if my eyes are dull if my beauty is gone   70.53490186462349
there s liberty for all the world   19.268776601352855

we have accomplished more difficult things than that   95.54064415818456
here replied the gendarmes   54.69093904426118
a cabriolet was ordered for maximilian alone without a servant without lights   127.60653709238274
not at all cried d artagnan who was anxious the matter should be accomplished   170.5940186186996
as he pronounced the two last names the count glanced at maximilian morrel   102.91615727193711
said the old lady   142.531824975882
his eyes rested on the weapons and he pointed to them   159.69085814933908
to you   120.80582601171784
now at the moment when i left his house here aramis paused   109.61519866018895
it was the sword of the comte de wardes which made that hole when he gave me a good thrust in the breast   58.078747424015006
for after having gained a victory over the spaniard it had just gained another over the people   53.633774522625615
aramis darted at d artagnan one of those looks which inform a man that he has acquired a mortal enemy   101.63921917195233
my man was going to fire a pistol at me   205.93967245045712
you are no longer a minister my lord   128.54232989777748
it only proves how little indulgence we may expect from your sex interrupted valentine   98.42196691484033
these gentlemen read it to me and i wept for joy   141.4615105042673
but so it is   128.1737300243804
yes i am known so that proceed my dear monsieur cavalcanti   86.68123233809898
but by jove   198.23774407188193
so pray keep your places like athos whose calmness is entirely laudable   37.83674752959975
abundance of hair falling over her shoulders   50.318291860959675
thus the dealer to whom d artagnan sold him for the nine livres did not conceal from the young man that he only gave that enormous sum for him on the account of the originality of his color   71.51704046554752
what sort of person is he   186.92723465232564
all i do know is that i observed some suspicious looking people go in there nonsense   133.28675981592377
unluckily i hit him on the head and immediately his face was covered with blood   32.417092866569675
but why valentine do you persist in anticipating the worst why picture so gloomy a future   140.45469102274075
dantès was almost glad of this affray and almost pleased at being wounded for they were rude lessons which taught him with what eye he could view danger and with what endurance he could bear suffering   83.78500002437858
i have a cousin who has undertaken this sad office   138.34694811463206
i shall be at home till midday or if not i will leave a receipt with my steward   135.35234503598556
he remained there some time alone   91.05442116395662
the steward wished to turn to the left   113.70218633476004
d épinay if he is an honorable man will consider himself more than ever pledged to mademoiselle de villefort unless he were actuated by a decided feeling of avarice but that is impossible   221.77189270010007
the story first sir said caderousse you must make me a promise   114.47915378722396
the count read it   74.45922209657425
vampa took cucumetto s body in his arms and conveyed it to the grotto while in her turn teresa remained outside   136.99500001247736
in short my lord said athos glancing at aramis your highness is discontented with your party   70.29618228770862
he then concluded it must be an assassin   175.9641838901997
to regret the world is to regret the devil   195.43521205070408
yes as you said you are indeed wretched and a miracle alone can cure you   114.67741447718542
moreover i have answered for your devotion also   65.16663421419972
he may have gone by the other door   135.34692342551295
said he there are two of them   202.75964613863323
she appeared to be stupefied   136.25577816447594
but his successive defeats did service to the duke in one way they killed time for him till eight o clock in the evening   141.6207504909897
i faith colonel said d artagnan we are very grateful for your gracious invitation   127.7487988931522
the young king approached his mother and said why do as these people ask   146.55187440563355
what shall i do now   91.25724109680398
a few minutes after twelve o clock bernouin knocked at the queen s bedroom door having come by the cardinal s secret corridor   95.21192066915033
oh it is nothing said monte cristo   117.9211249956976
you was right said the swiss   141.640675381749
but they were prevented by the royal guard and the queen proceeded on her way haughtily disdainful of their entreaties   217.40530799834414
it does not   148.22737261123805
now we are getting on   35.434295831688274
has she returned   104.55132841385809
it would make very little difference to me said caderousse if i were retaken i am a poor creature to live alone and sometimes pine for my old comrades   174.79568155398957
and what do you find in it that is worthy of blame   16.863346731885457
i told him i would attend to the prisoners in his absence   83.84760278682745
continued the king without directly replying to de tréville s question   86.68845119112906
upon hearing d artagnan s reply aramis seemed about to draw his sword when athos prevented him   34.65856886022422
we have heard all it was necessary we should hear   60.92846539030652
day for day hour for hour said albert   27.489776080647673
that of the cardinal predominated enormously   174.79906834562323
when this speech was arranged villefort turned to dantès   99.23966100943007
no said aramis he has not seen us   93.96956991063546
the count perceived at one glance madame danglars at one end of the drawing room m   99.13487770009793
but that costume however elegant in itself has long been out of fashion in paris   113.57232235945106
the love with which his young wife had inspired him was a secondary sentiment and was not strong enough to contend with the primitive feelings we have just enumerated   101.00946688631079
pen ink and paper are my tools and without my tools i am fit for nothing   174.14336859003325
ah i had eighty louis before me   118.78838164494319
tis god who gives them into our hands answered groslow   154.41715829043892
i dare say you have not brought too large a stock of money with you   155.25936884071658
that s true said athos   89.71372989029953
on the contrary it is a matter of the utmost importance edmond   85.48921952265842
i know something of diamonds   137.87226760668665
and the baroness took from her pocket a letter which she gave to debray   164.92657813892768
the young man looked bowed in obedience and then went to teresa and invited her to dance in a quadrille directed by the count s daughter   66.21275492363137
oh i expect him every minute   142.3884439373037
one fine morning then his yacht followed by the little fishing boat boldly entered the port of marseilles and anchored exactly opposite the spot from whence on the never to be forgotten night of his departure for the château d if he had been put on board the boat destined to convey him thither   78.38190540360003
he who for so long a time had forgotten god began to think that miracles were possible that the accursed cavern might be discovered by the officers of the papal states who would release him   82.53759765650572
good said he our syndic is at his post   66.19930858754756
what induces you to think so   128.77568185807974
i know that she has written to the prince to return in haste from the army   200.66000189758017
very dangerous to say the least   111.17561105105156
so many times in order to follow valentine in thought at every hour in the day had he made her describe the whole house that without having seen it he knew it all   131.14078555073715
we are never quits with those who oblige us was dantès reply   181.47501947444738
i suppose i am free to say or not to say who i am to two strangers who take a fancy to ask me   123.11776275686056
there was a moment s silence and then a voice in excellent french although with a foreign accent said welcome sir   114.9017854609464
athos laughed   75.91271290572121
i have however kept along the corridor on which your chamber opens instead of going beneath it   101.49087245358017
20125m teresa was clothed from head to foot in the garb of the count of san felice s daughter   132.58316130096944
true my lord   169.79068577894847
mademoiselle paulet has observed you vicomte   61.808529572091246
on his track   65.58947671898676
d artagnan had a quick eye and a prompt understanding   142.05912670976224
i never was in a law court   95.78107862876244
her   176.51132434562967
from the former she took some greasy letters and put in their place the bank notes and from the bag took two or three crowns of six livres each which in all probability formed the entire fortune of the miserable couple   210.57597273036632
advice is worse than a service   90.39397840467132
i ask no more for liberty i only ask to live   24.169810131674055
only reflect my good fellow said athos it is but dying rather sooner   39.89974454422729
yet this catalan has eyes that glisten like those of the vengeful spaniards sicilians and calabrians and the other has fists big enough to crush an ox at one blow   43.37801585764757
oh very well replied aramis   112.54795281261958
a servant entered summoned by albert s ring of the bell   82.09334011572003
now i thought that the butcher would not let his horse out like that without knowing where it was going   140.01981631158094
morrel bringing a doctor and the doctor said it was inflammation of the bowels and ordered him a limited diet   146.94906228521313
tell him answered the brave man to let the king know that they have not killed me outright   11.703855790940821
thus it is called by those who have wished for this demonstration and who are perhaps the cause of it   138.57570437139552
no my friend athos gently replied but de winter sought us out in france and introduced us monsieur d herblay and myself to madame henrietta   206.81680122475387
chibouques with jasmine tubes and amber mouthpieces were within reach and all prepared so that there was no need to smoke the same pipe twice   16.427355947367104
with spain no answered d artagnan   65.91568072805836
stop in the name of heaven monsieur porthos   143.30493882594425
the duke tried to exchange a glance with grimaud but there was no glance in grimaud s eyes   162.66873564303748
when i speak of ignominy you think i speak of some chastisement of imprisonment or death   104.0247018479155
if you require to know positively what she is capable of read her past history on her left shoulder   122.18160892137473
if your friend remains another week in my cellar i shall be a ruined man   192.29862336239478
on entering this holy place the poor penitent was unable to shut the door so close as to prevent the passions he fled from entering with him   159.68013328307273
you are stupid friend porthos   141.15810629524907
i demand admittance said a loud voice outside the room in the name of the law   85.77900216574476
but madame replied the count continuing the conversation and looking by turns at madame de villefort and valentine have i not already had the honor of meeting yourself and mademoiselle before   104.09323665122635
the abbé with a shaking hand seized a glass of water that was standing by him half full swallowed it at one gulp and then resumed his seat with red eyes and pale cheeks   4.058729590869206
will you take me away with you   165.01480735302536
i repeat to you i don t know her   99.56359827221607
do you know modern greek asked he   191.85203868573814
it was terrible to behold the frightful pallor of that woman the anguish of her look the trembling of her whole frame   81.87898707888515
bonacieux who was to have paid him the price of his devotedness   23.948023466885374
ask him then for the written order   95.82221236320459
it speaks of his return does it not porthos   108.48484633274948
but at this period the title of gentleman had great influence with the citizen class and d artagnan was a gentleman   140.22872377732932
they say said aramis resuming his pious reading that the dyke which the cardinal is making drives them all out into the open sea   101.22233204723868
this was the last blow to the prisoner   58.31291424405739
your majesty wishes then you to say what you would do in her place mazarin hastened to reply   122.26532907023281
cried d artagnan loosing his hold of her dress and remaining mute motionless and frozen   206.398814595247
besides to tell truth whilst d artagnan was quite disposed to adopt a subtle course against the cunning of aramis or the vanity of porthos he was ashamed to equivocate with athos true hearted open athos   80.92048552050079
0125m i do not know   113.62295267781448
the confidence with which d artagnan spoke convinced patrick which was the name of this minister of the minister   177.04655056854102
i was executioner of the city of lille as this woman has said   179.18329201302146
a little farther a little farther said the other   86.35540221568573
danglars smiled and seemed to say it is of no consequence   84.02890815251033
what do you propose to me d avrigny   102.39742380540198
50215m enough said mercédès   125.3524275723437
in an instant his sword glittered in his hand and he sprang upon his adversary whom thanks to his great youthfulness he hoped to intimidate   153.55182052924908
nor you to mine cried the abbé   110.94073188264412
now we may say at last thank heaven   90.21857139440426
i will tell you morrel said the count that i do not need entreating to spare the life of m   122.07143070935834
go to the stable   125.46495084723813
they both arose and while he who called himself sinbad and whom we have occasionally named so that we might like his guest have some title by which to distinguish him gave some orders to the servant franz entered still another apartment   144.80822089830625
necessity has no law   59.66157237245781
the horse as if it understood these words bent its red nostrils toward the king s face and parting his lips displayed all its teeth as if with pleasure   150.1295960527683
it is probable   138.52439937617447
silence then   85.15845629476865
only with that word you would be quartered instead of being broken on the wheel   132.68855065561078
no replied the two musketeers after a moment s silence no sir we do not   157.76103228608108
edward begged for a long while the maternal kiss probably not offering sufficient recompense for the trouble he must take to obtain it   113.44798112188727
let one of us put on the dress and mount the king s horse   92.11544624846958
well then said monte cristo you have all the documents with you   126.75772922331389
then placing herself in the full light of the lamp which lit the yard gate   39.70329744008495
he gave porthos a second nudge of the knee and porthos got up as if to stretch his legs and took care at the same time to ascertain that his sword could be drawn smoothly from the scabbard   80.13808313912497
for i criticise him without knowing what he does   102.13976156421674
andrea said the latter with his half jesting tone   74.00487596230928
in the struggle her clothes caught fire and they were obliged to let go their hold in order to preserve themselves from sharing the same fate   88.19302341801995
oh the red duke   92.61177999442693
then turning to his men allow these gentlemen to pass he said   50.03235292751909
do not lose time comminges he continued   87.01318525890069
the door opened so quietly that the thief heard no sound   170.33358370594945
for if we meet by night without seeking each other much more shall we meet by day when wishing it   73.79262108111159
the idea came into your mind to avenge yourself on this man did it not   118.82379965559625
i have only one thing to ask of you   171.02520464815615
i must start for paris again immediately   83.34244951239239
monte cristo trembled from head to foot and as if his determination had been taken with the rapidity of lightning he struck one of the panes of glass with his elbow   84.40365234746595
with this red handkerchief on my head with scarcely any shoes no papers and ten gold napoleons in my pocket without reckoning what was there before making in all about two hundred francs why i should certainly be arrested at the barriers   118.38579161579707
they demanded who was there and recognizing the voices of their lackeys opened the shutter   119.6393022019638
where we should have been seen all four conferring together so that at the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been informed by his spies that we were holding a council   65.83972621337904
d artagnan who as we have said was exceedingly prudent for a young man of twenty then remembered his suspicions regarding milady   64.5125589392362
have pity on valentine   85.49210540573475
and something like a faint smile lighted the still terrified features of the young woman   229.23153386744752
and it is exactly because he is a bold fellow that he is the more to be feared   103.51568963520303
they soon appeared satisfied and returned with the exception of one who remained at the shore to their fire at which the carcass of a goat was roasting   117.47195001146869
and if you wish ever to leave my palace you can not   59.46216268411575
thank you sir said albert smiling   224.55590939352368
what do you say that she wanted to have her brother in law killed   132.65265934439321

my good friend i can only repeat the words addressed to you by the abbé busoni   108.69793879179325
but there must be some cause for this strange scene   37.66304556497447

bonacieux and dwelt for an instant on the lips of d artagnan   65.15163726931164
yet the parisian world is so strange that even all this might not have won attention had there not been connected with it a mysterious story gilded by an immense fortune   171.69649603703726
younger sons he said who enlisted in the musketeers under feigned names in order not to lower their family names   112.05735749609434

athos without saying anything emptied his pockets got together all his jewels purses aiguillettes and gold chains and offered them all to porthos   40.645429000876845

all i do know is that i was just nineteen when i was arrested the 28th of february 1815   189.60889885295103
and de winter glancing around him raoul quickly understood that the two friends wished to be alone and he therefore left the room unaffectedly   89.37861645148516
the conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor man   149.81127219316298
then swallowing the contents of his glass which he put down close to him athos arose carelessly took the musket next to him and drew near to one of the loopholes   160.75792098080012

and what is his especial talent   122.89474653568344
somewhat   64.29716779503062
perhaps you speak the truth aramis   189.32647390136694
for he well remembered that albert particularly prided himself on the entire absence of color in his own complexion   137.32261736409276
there was a moment of trouble and confusion in the assembly   71.57481336577993
he alone could have transmitted to lord de winter all these frightful secrets which he has discovered one after another by a train of fatalities   66.91728626737844
and then said madame de villefort endeavoring by a struggle and with effort to get away from her thoughts however skilfully it is prepared crime is always crime and if it avoid human scrutiny it does not escape the eye of god   81.49381996850735
i will see the queen   77.93132860579986

half in gold and the other half in bank notes if you please said the count rising from his seat   56.12600761964321
then i will presume to say that all my friends are in the king s musketeers and guards and that by an inconceivable fatality my enemies are in the service of your eminence   133.2325010704066
it is he who gave three desperate wounds to de wardes your emissary and who caused the affair of the diamond studs to fail   136.43235800945624

athos availed himself of the permission ascended the stairs with his lightest step gained the landing and through the open door perceived milady putting on her hat   159.2862531395749
your eminence means i presume the knife stab in the rue de la feronnerie   124.84904000601341
you will understand monsieur i thought there would be still time if you wish to see monsieur de cavois to contradict me by saying you were not yet gone   104.97512147947332
true said la ramee   117.11090270067307
you wish to speak to me about the circumstance which has just happened   82.0685104882684
but first i will state the case to them   111.93086951501907
andrea had spoken very little during dinner   132.6216490715028
the other   86.94047453651973
d artagnan concealed his face in the bosom of athos and sobbed aloud   235.98669211138207
no it is not existence then that i regret but the ruin of projects so slowly carried out so laboriously framed   121.26952794667095
albert s attack on andrea had placed him on a different footing and he hoped this visit had another cause than that he had at first supposed   75.71602876524435
asked blaisois i can   175.25367077488923
if i fly she will fly   130.11716091845432
kitty guessed what was passing in the mind of the young man and heaved a deep sigh   135.31113163694178
dear albert said beauchamp   154.953793308367
sire i can assert that they have hitherto discovered no gold mines in their mountains   82.66739748848975
the viscount de bragelonne   174.67760023785212
then your grace knows her real name   83.56424897887446
it is to be remembered that eleven crowns was just the sum that remained in d artagnan s purse   98.06656750854786
oh pray for mercy s sake don t fly from me   154.31713269426257
and you too said he come if you like monsieur   96.19454187314288
his hands of which he took little care were the despair of aramis who cultivated his with almond paste and perfumed oil   81.0248717360076
this lady is infamous   127.61940719050418
six of his eminence s guards arrest six of his majesty s musketeers   144.75382274202943
yes in some respects tolerably well   86.0885792265516
that settles it murmured franz   138.43355246346383
it was even told me that fernand especially was terrible in his vengeance   156.0002387063695
said caderousse with a shudder   151.64043968666908
from his past life from his resolution to shrink from nothing the count had acquired an inconceivable relish for the contests in which he had engaged sometimes against nature that is to say against god and sometimes against the world that is against the devil   208.87495495513838
you do wrong   142.05117048626275
oh thank you sir thank you monsieur broussel said friquet   84.11237838768918
but since such men as you assure me that i am wrong in doing so i ve a good mind to follow your advice and to accept a proposition made to me by the duc de chatillon just now   113.70379921402129

his hands gracefully placed one upon his hat the other in the opening of his white waistcoat were not at all tremulous   133.81619917775797
on whose side   173.2473217073826
as i was saying last night they intend me to be ransomed   78.04063430110844
the two young persons obeyed   120.7234305621131
he expected you will remember to be here on the fifth   157.04880139101846
meantime d artagnan had thrown himself upon the other soldier attacking him with his sword   59.376876804299286
for i am not a man to bore my friends as you will learn   141.15191442780485
i ask no better said aramis with that ingenious air of confidence which every poet has in himself   146.89569238127106
for in the course of two hours it will be dark and you will not be able to see anything   75.98048787861158
their nostrils reddened like glowing furnaces   125.16164651402559
there will be no obstacle from that quarter i assure you   43.83225921401544
he had friends then after five years in prison   46.26925724955683
groslow advanced to the door of the king s room replaced on his head the hat he had taken off to receive his guests looked for a moment contemptuously at this simple yet touching scene then turning to d artagnan assumed an air of triumph at what he had achieved   91.02523661578246
he thought that there had been no less thick a veil before the eyes of those to whom faria offered the treasures   126.4589524048249
swear my son   152.22969147676955

it was selim s flaming lance   124.30423768850243
that king who was so grand so sublime in the hour of death meeting his fate with a smile of resignation on his lips now in that gloomy hour wiped away a tear which had fallen on the table and quivered on the gold embroidered cloth   80.27824961914382

happy beyond measure   76.33791349450843
then undisturbed by the noisy crowd collected round the broken carriage ali quietly harnessed the pacified animals to the count s chariot took the reins in his hands and mounted the box when to the utter astonishment of those who had witnessed the ungovernable spirit and maddened speed of the same horses he was actually compelled to apply his whip in no very gentle manner before he could induce them to start   179.98169301215307
it was a béarn pony from twelve to fourteen years old yellow in his hide without a hair in his tail but not without windgalls on his legs which though going with his head lower than his knees rendering a martingale quite unnecessary contrived nevertheless to perform his eight leagues a day   99.04669220817301
i am lieutenant in his majesty s musketeers said d artagnan and consequently your superior in everything   75.25815359408611
but this is a needless quarrel you seek with me as it seems to me   98.13939650233431
the comtesse de monsieur porthos be generous   103.45738137462259
it was however too late   63.6563506975602
besides your own fortune as your father assured me is almost equal to that of your betrothed   215.157223752016
there is another word which pleases me cried athos with a gracious nod to d artagnan   146.84353116324647
but what you tell me madame what you inquire of me is not the result of a chance query for two years ago you asked me the same questions and said then that for a very long time this history of mithridates had occupied your mind   95.79582874505213
the queen fell into a chair took the pen and signed   63.95328098420167

you have despoiled me of my fortune   44.57436027835634
aramis tried to withdraw his hand but the king still held it   36.762206126027365
the doctor then slowly poured some drops of the lemonade from the decanter into the cup and in an instant a light cloudy sediment began to form at the bottom of the cup   97.76834063943302
sire i fear it is more than a plot   159.9980716485825
he made that quarter of a league in four or five minutes   106.63947274598259

it seems a likely story to me   119.70673831515111
do you fear any approaching evil   95.59150510043372
come here   96.1037166161671
unfortunately whether through envy or stupidity all morrel s correspondents did not take this view   59.259692864367686
the former was confiding to the latter his grief and fear for it was the second time within a month that death had suddenly and unexpectedly entered that house which was apparently destined to destruction by some exterminating angel as an object of god s anger   95.33549487806917
she flew to the windows but they were also secured   111.57185241865253
the count bowed while mademoiselle danglars bent her head slightly   109.1689875201528
said bazin looking uneasily around   76.48251082671538
why what in the world cried aramis is that animal bazin doing   133.26924531529585
the young man pressed valentine s hand to his lips and then left the house by a back staircase   160.13810866086885
cried the citizen swearing in order to rouse his courage   160.16068612418496
and taking the letter he squeezed it up in his hands and threw it into a corner of the arbor   97.37934177329149
morrel threw a glance around but before it reached the spot occupied by monte cristo the latter had advanced yet nearer still unperceived   112.1368241174542

my mother and i traversed the gloomy passage leading to the cavern   55.87963997509665
around a broken down carriage the people were uttering imprecations whilst the persons who had attempted to escape were made prisoners that is to say an old man and two women   90.9583604359001
meanwhile do not be surprised at anything that happens   104.29970814290671
de la trémouille   97.1912644379282
edmond was obliged to assist him for otherwise he would not have been able to enter by the small aperture which led to dantès chamber   131.6332067655442
it is my wish that she should marry m   195.13852778614472
said lord winter   58.54128409851928
it must be observed that as a separate passage led to the first floor in which d artagnan lodged those who called on him were exempted from this detention   156.32819122399556
said d artagnan raising the battered hat   160.63288967757651
and now now what   74.32915252934482
but i can readily tell you where he is going to and that is down below without the least doubt   97.51707143057442
silence me   206.43456603523646
but to do this he must have spoken   170.12185663538946
but this is all i have left in the world he said out of an immense fortune   134.33804544086732
you came you say to see me   24.502033385095075
it was now athos s turn to take a sly look   136.52984926938606
he had escaped so rapidly that he had not had leisure to notice anything   125.83232792983442
he has gone said he and the house door is shut   155.18448009282116
take it from me then and so long at least as i receive my income you shall be paid yours   75.6342678761334
eugénie is to be married in a week and in three days there is to be a grand feast a betrothal festival   191.31015911472423
the facchino follows the prince the transteverin the citizen everyone blowing extinguishing relighting   102.99608409043685
a pen a pen   109.29352804856795
now the portmanteau let us make haste the portmanteau   89.43021306622913
bertuccio hid his face in his hands as he uttered these words while monte cristo fixed on him a look of inscrutable meaning   84.96285073391293
what can you expect my dear porthos   49.25159723391588
however what had you to say to me   58.77820577691585
de tréville for they were the first to whom he communicated it   145.71351334508927
your arm is still strong enough is it not porthos   107.70761178113361
they were about to proceed to the reading of the contract which half paris assembled was to sign   144.05764749033466
but said danglars who on his part did not perceive how soon the conversation which was at first disinterested was turning to a business transaction there is doubtless a part of your fortune your father could not refuse you   87.25926293773611
oh the frightful brute   88.29680743587542
20277m it was unexampled for a servant of the count s to dare to dispute an order of his so the steward without saying a word followed his master who got into the carriage and signed to him to follow which he did taking his place respectfully on the front seat   74.59225909587823
you had already passed half your life in coveting that which you might have honorably acquired   105.76684371905388
perceiving m   112.49127200821509
d artagnan took some water in the hollow of his hand and threw it upon his face   72.59535259466715
welcome home again   89.80359053992403
aramis then reperused the letter and perceived a postscript ps   124.26872582198953
by thus exaggerating to his own mind the anticipated ill fortune of the next day to which he had condemned himself by promising mercédès to spare her son the count at last exclaimed folly folly folly   99.18965615906805
my lord said d artagnan no longer able to contain himself allow me to introduce to you the chevalier d herblay who wishes as you may have heard to offer his congratulations to your eminence   120.84404117993928
petition the minister   143.2655076552965
i advise you to complain   119.75779443594665
athos curled his lip with disdain   119.30453146357867
i do not need rest gentlemen   105.74292418194462
oh well then said monte cristo i am not particular about these five notes pay me in a different form   114.43124482183039
and now gentlemen said d artagnan without stopping to explain his conduct to porthos all for one one for all that is our motto is it not   115.04844744838645
i can believe that had you been madame de chevreuse poor buckingham might have hoped   123.28654423991057
your orchestra is too noisy   89.31047063071169
i can scarcely realize so great a happiness   133.1316604210767
two days previously the article had appeared in another paper besides l impartial and what was more serious one that was well known as a government paper   153.3477739888492
then opening a feather bed he had rolled in it and had thus become the most grotesque fowl it is possible to imagine   122.28215096341627
the count returned to young morcerf   1.9858070574080529
oh d artagnan   174.59208242988979
it was not the plain white waistcoat   144.282163804827
i love you also you   115.61479848906708
59   44.925326936700685
then remembering the narcotic mixed with the water i had drunk i would not touch that which was placed on the table but filled my glass at a marble fountain fixed in the wall over my dressing table   125.86242061036688
you are too fortunate in your love for play not to take its revenge   247.48654860812616
then that explains everything that is extraordinary said andrea   167.13969705374927
ah his friend is with him   95.05933173157898
raoul continued his way and was visibly gaining ground   148.6575449249509
all looked around   143.419428401372
if you think you are right in giving them to me you shall do so but from this very moment you are free from any obligation to keep them   160.58264961820007
believe me as long as i live i shall never cease to dwell with grateful recollection on the prompt and important service you rendered me   71.49385122294524
you have not been long detained   138.61850115198928
but the spasmodic working of the nostrils showed to the practiced eye of monte cristo that the arab had been wounded to the heart   144.72022362228873
and is not this daughter dead   120.99240847061891
said mazarin with a grimace which he always made when spoken to about money   79.65422509363714
the young man hesitated and looked at athos as if seeking to read in his eyes a rule of conduct   39.02625023701739
that is why you in your turn are to die it is because your father would inherit your property and your brother his only son succeed to his   17.07650115556551
the latter retained the count s hand between his   84.392583189188
franz and the count in their turn then advanced along the same path which at the distance of a hundred paces led them over a declivity to the bottom of a small valley   17.992088510816615
yes all but eight hundred piastres   81.93560803419972
aramis received a ball which passed through his shoulder and mousqueton another ball which lodged in the fleshy part which prolongs the lower portion of the loins   157.23299735418277
i i was where d artagnan stands   61.817185977481756
two or three times a week   150.7818860271224
luigi was jealous   154.93151382496308
did parliament pass this act   137.76423305806145
but the count did not appear to suspect that there could be the slightest connection between lucien s visit and the curiosity of the baroness   26.74404607634503
however much of a jew he may be he will give you at least eight hundred pistoles   61.712213331663634
she still loves me   131.49962339199794
i know you are accustomed to assassinate people   123.08076802850508
what do you mean my lord   116.57428817194356
that will do for us   170.39537979186102
he read them again and again and fixing his eyes on m   105.50500412135712
oh my brain whirls   160.27144624025544
this was a terrible moment for the fugitives   179.93272676035238
replied the prince   146.96981225304057
ghosts at first sight the exterior of the house at auteuil gave no indications of splendor nothing one would expect from the destined residence of the magnificent count of monte cristo   65.38970074190014
it was then albert returning from his meeting with the count perceived his father watching for his arrival behind a curtain and turned aside   111.00926239154164
unless i am mistaken it has been already written   129.53550400263688
without having been in the school of the abbé faria the worthy master of la jeune amélie the name of the genoese tartan knew a smattering of all the tongues spoken on the shores of that large lake called the mediterranean from the arabic to the provençal and this while it spared him interpreters persons always troublesome and frequently indiscreet gave him great facilities of communication either with the vessels he met at sea with the small boats sailing along the coast or with the people without name country or occupation who are always seen on the quays of seaports and who live by hidden and mysterious means which we must suppose to be a direct gift of providence as they have no visible means of support   96.72241552884181
quick quick d artagnan   113.38262906351093
and for pirates   75.84983810361746
but peppino what has become of him   104.11550920374106
the wind blew violently   135.06149686694062
if you do not overtake him before we reach bourget you shall have twenty francs   81.91426175888908
but said renée this letter which after all is but an anonymous scrawl is not even addressed to you but to the king s attorney   134.46592641705928
she cast her eyes upon the table saw the glittering of a knife rushed toward it and clutched it   95.52907442130248
depend upon it i know what i say   46.58561442635589
he will explain to you the steps that i expect you to pursue   177.9227828853168
it seemed to him that if porthos and aramis deemed him superior to them in the arts of diplomacy they would like him all the better for it   93.44575743238713
50125m maximilian said the count let us both lay aside the mask we have assumed   155.50724200381646
did not touch those hearts of stone   176.58862962427858
do you see that   127.75071106576092
toward the town of louvres was the reply   125.94174551365099
and taking the lighted torch from the hands of the herdsman he preceded his guests not as a servant who performs an act of civility but like a king who precedes ambassadors   156.88516535918322
but the excitement had calmed down and they felt themselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality   201.50294210182972
danglars listened with the most profound attention   119.14191279856726
but having lost the horses i am particularly anxious to preserve the harnesses   155.5610348256975
this evening to morrow always   158.9024453122698
is it not enough   87.30130052228142
i suffer horribly   103.16881804197362
speak sir replied the queen   203.56568632573678
and with these words henrietta rose in majestic indignation whilst the cardinal raising his hands clasped toward her exclaimed ah madame madame how little you know me mon dieu   103.56280691409934
well don carlos will drink bordeaux and in ten years we will marry his son to the little queen   102.14525304480682
a leather pocketbook a purse in which was evidently a part of the sum which the bandit had received with a dice box and dice completed the possessions of the dead man   148.16568881699334
he certainly bodes us no good said athos   141.1114337038081
the chevalier de rochefort cast a glance backward and saw that porthos and aramis had placed themselves between him and the gate   90.26159328453872
a dead father or husband is better than a dishonored one blood washes out shame   10.025071520649874
can you imagine said monte cristo some othello or abbé de ganges one stormy dark night descending these stairs step by step carrying a load which he wishes to hide from the sight of man if not from god   189.90930786740495
these four men were not princes neither were they dukes neither were they men in power   110.03417111046886
but there is nothing which would do   162.75526210774106
yes monseigneur enemies against whom you owe me all your support for i made them by serving your eminence   27.831003343962053
i have arrived from cadiz this morning   124.39872245075703
porthos had found nothing and with him fatigue had prevailed over hunger   168.4186418530716
athos did the same   178.84868608707254
you who pretend to understand everything even the hidden sources of knowledge and who enact the part of a guardian angel upon earth and could not even find an antidote to a poison administered to a young girl   84.77604203656178
yes monsieur i must   196.0118479683432
d artagnan was a physiognomist   125.92619222700925
50151m i am no comrade of these people said the young man proudly you have no right to insult me thus   139.86475504933856
a few moments passed   104.16987549456366
you must know that in france they are very particular on these points   34.26489398462952
perhaps you did not see well   60.431556911836786
no emmanuel i am but a man and your admiration is as unmerited as your words are sacrilegious   117.1714630811378
there could be no doubt that behind this little window which threw forth such friendly beams the pretty mme   133.0963229260132
have i travelled in that country   130.49251325182846
perhaps he would have sought to escape by flight had he seen any possibility of doing so   137.09781767611108
well said franz to his friend what think you of all this   147.88770726160837
it might have been said that between this man and his inferiors spoken language did not exist or had become useless   112.76017142741598
february 5th 1815   124.86481791347794
i shall do my duty as conscientiously as i can and fulfil my promise to the dying man   99.68085102889683
what a scandal   188.01918522321506
well then only fulfil your promise of rescuing peppino and henceforward you shall receive not only devotion but the most absolute obedience from myself and those under me that one human being can render to another   109.06864941116046
no no monsieur said monte cristo   119.0706170556831
a stranger who will not send in his name   163.4035487263038
bonacieux recognized in these papers his interrogatories of the bastille   71.5501136103278
the more must you fortify yourself albert   119.5122560389193
you will find good cigars on the centre table   25.87968686859638
château renaud looked for a moment for morrel   142.85925604157336
the two oarsmen bent to their work and the little boat glided away as rapidly as possible in the midst of the thousand vessels which choke up the narrow way which leads between the two rows of ships from the mouth of the harbor to the quai d orléans   109.9069175148452
i say monsieur that chance has rendered me master of a secret which you will guard i hope young man as your life   89.92021159989793
it is the people who do not obey that i punish and not those who like you obey but too well   145.63779436607365
she listened panting overwhelmed crushed   172.08554326279872
and if it makes thee happy i will not tutoyer you any longer   143.28384090655666
and was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed   194.86359226888996
but monte cristo is not the only one i miss here   80.61601753336822
out even to me   152.10614293286955
the two musketeers arrived in their turn holding the horses of d artagnan and porthos in their hands   109.09171573738794
it was in the name of comte de wardes   126.40265395003031
it is for me then to interrogate grimaud   117.34926051281673
he was a stout man of about two or three and twenty with an open ingenuous countenance a black mild eye and cheeks rosy and downy as an autumn peach   95.9108593392193
you have a right to be unjust to them monsieur   200.2898809365641
it means at once come enter you are welcome   102.51540858674461
command   98.24155944022888
but d artagnan was still in confusion and turned around almost mechanically when a fine young man of fifteen years of age dressed simply but in perfect taste entered the room raising as he came his hat adorned with a long plume of scarlet feathers   58.907838065314635
or as you are a corsican that you had been unable to resist the desire of making a stiff as you call it   116.38917275626599
but athos porthos and aramis quickly appeared in their turn and the moment the two guardsmen attacked their young companion drove them back   147.1893823580805
your hour   70.17219651902518
madame de villefort however reassured by the silence which was alone disturbed by the regular breathing of valentine again extended her hand and half hidden by the curtains succeeded in emptying the contents of the phial into the glass   96.9158925857476
but only on condition that you will not open it till i am gone   92.08053621464013
but that i am not ambitious i am going to prove to you   110.70250987888942
they are mostly foreigners scotch irish or danish   55.13442298669879
come in said louis xviii   67.80934742697515
the prince kept his gaze fixed in the direction of the sound with the steadfastness of a bird of prey   73.28400712754724
lord leven   137.97338077541747
it contained a few poor articles of household furniture a bed a table two chairs a stone pitcher and some dry herbs hung up to the ceiling which the count recognized as sweet peas and of which the good man was preserving the seeds   96.0230993933959
her beautiful face was distorted with agony   128.98078541107398
the valet de chambre will carry your message   134.05238459730072
well perhaps   103.33299592261403
the young man shuddered at this strange familiarity   177.6780671321739
i do not like to disturb those who pray madame said felton seriously   176.13330345293153
besides how do i know that this was not a political trick that the minister enraged at seeing me in the opposition and jealous of the popular sympathy i excite has not concerted with m   92.84115196934593
he saluted the cardinal and plunged the bag into the depths of an immense pocket   99.86524044042763
let us go you mean   136.01444882474712
for the last month this wretched house had presented the gloomy appearance of a lazaretto infected with the plague   79.50417835354541
by the way added he in a low tone take care to throw away that cup of syrup of violets in the ashes   68.89824673191941
bonacieux thought she recognized the sound of that voice   113.83726405469365
take it then but in exchange caderousse who touched the diamond withdrew his hand   151.59333583213618
i am rich enough forsooth to distribute his authority on this occasion   57.29823959609694
oh yes very gloomy my friend   45.804207308183805
while the waiter was preparing his room the hostess arose   104.42296578089467
faith yes replied andrea whose hunger prevailed over every other feeling   158.57082698647125
athos and aramis entered last and locked the door behind them   98.78993786513085
his voyage would upset him quite   70.7002416884038
that is not difficult   79.06865255336987
ask d artagnan   122.00019105386754
gentlemen we are arrived   180.93936653716315
very rich do you think   140.50355562827767
if we say one hundred pistoles for the three good for the hundred pistoles   118.22390762530974
they could willingly have strangled m   88.4020354754836
the count in his survey of the pit encountered a pale face and threatening eyes which evidently sought to gain his attention   124.30168931217605
in the meantime grimaud appeared in his turn behind his master with the musketoon on his shoulder and his head shaking   139.0139603115864
that makes no difference   85.57543339943504
but i give you my word morrel that god who does know it will be on our side   119.43630347814641
war for the king   40.84985529450114
the luck had turned and groslow having won some hundred pistoles was in the merriest possible humor   92.29065810962584
why replied danglars not entirely so   97.60164127147058
you are the king of poets my dear aramis   120.2985781128611
her preserver was everywhere sought for but he did not appear   124.4088324354499
but perhaps you have been wrong   108.30744094915423
well you are right for if you indulged in such reflections you would never risk your principal which is to the speculator what the skin is to civilized man   51.437338450153256
and the king has seen the cardinal   155.38277576492112
i was obliged to sound a retreat toward the rue tiquetonne   102.85130312687266
monseigneur let your eminence be reassured   44.95748866405171
it is all as he has said   128.47232184086172

houses were no longer to be seen   76.04700833735188
dantès remained in his cell all day not daring to return to his friend thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced once for all that the abbé was mad such a conviction would be so terrible   78.47861109363933

debray was petrified not only to hear danglars speak so calmly and politely but because it was apparent that beneath outward politeness there really lurked a determined spirit of opposition to anything his wife might wish to do   88.75918467967067
they asked a thousand livres for him   201.95070744460776

monte cristo looked in turn at the two iron handles by which the machine was worked   140.88268638953014
besides courage was out of the question here   113.62175735323103
the visitor either understood the abbé s meaning or had no more questions to ask   209.7386357033255
tis well said d artagnan holding out his hand to receive the money   200.09854928245807

rather sir before we sit down i must demand your answer   124.02722639105816
and then so short a time had elapsed since the death of poor valentine and the gloom which overshadowed the house was so recent that no one wondered to see the father so absorbed in his professional duties which were the only means he had of dissipating his grief   144.2698415006967
yes said maximilian i recollect the project of which i highly approved   55.98450862762774
porthos lent him his back and d artagnan was soon on the summit of the wall where he seated himself   121.70126877239316
may i beg of you baroness to honor me with an introduction to your daughter   97.21667431029721

father and son we will leave danglars struggling with the demon of hatred and endeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil suspicions against his comrade and follow dantès who after having traversed la canebière took the rue de noailles and entering a small house on the left of the allées de meilhan rapidly ascended four flights of a dark staircase holding the baluster with one hand while with the other he repressed the beatings of his heart and paused before a half open door from which he could see the whole of a small room   144.59442222188804
i was utterly overpowered by surprise and terror   133.90566141334784
and yet in all this the cardinal had not yet said a word about the duke of buckingham   144.74040224877706

the little hand was then immediately withdrawn and the young man saw valentine hurrying towards the house as though she were almost terrified at her own sensations   84.03670835395022

and despite his confidence on the paternal admonitions he felt himself carried by his tastes and led by his instincts to praise rather than to blame the unheard of things which were taking place   117.94670295708076
felton   75.21964152704031
20121m that night a memorable event occurred due no doubt to the imprudence of some servant who had neglected to extinguish the lights   76.82809720537452
she also thinking to protect me was acting against me   79.09374897596922
and i am to take off the first one when i have reached a certain place   70.86408998219584
and you think you are avenged because you send a ball through the head or pass a sword through the breast of that man who has planted madness in your brain and despair in your heart   176.6930727886333
the fair unknown had resolved doubtless to carry the intrigue no farther   67.47438202521599
i will give you three months ere i join you   71.60236127120696
well then athos porthos aramis and d artagnan forward   101.53758172499892
an excellent idea   59.905000767723244
from him and from my friend the comte de rochefort   80.6293674832167
caderousse more and more astonished went toward a large oaken cupboard opened it and gave the abbé a long purse of faded red silk round which were two copper runners that had once been gilt   141.7383739844786
at the barrière du trône they met bertuccio who was waiting there motionless as a sentinel at his post   87.35134079287852
is she your daughter   108.14877984482706
old age is selfish sir and mademoiselle de villefort has been a faithful companion to m   157.45855527829409
he will feel obliged to make some little speech to the cousin and the three young men drew near to listen   109.28937388679479
i have that permission said the gentleman drawing the paper from his pocket   158.22309406549044
repeated the president   142.79198520983292
the count will find there a charming hotel with a court and garden   204.03001877822345
debray conveyed the count s reply to the baroness   93.60990256245736
luigi vampa replied the shepherd with the same air as he would have replied alexander king of macedon   133.76518268348917
and if i did your tone is too high   76.00191769228488
in the first place let us agree that the word poison does not exist because in medicine use is made of the most violent poisons which become according as they are employed most salutary remedies   116.91877159704873
at one of these encounters accidentally or purposely albert s mask fell off   101.9424974621347
if he land in tuscany he will be in an unfriendly territory   91.78477267813719
but all seemed unanimous in doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding condescension could possibly be intended   67.69699645893218
no no i am aware you know me   126.22013448778515
he could not distinguish her countenance but a sinister smile passed over the lips of athos   87.74172403254323
they announced to all their comrades that they had seen the king and that the queen had spoken to them   94.69130775674319
ah replied monte cristo since that is the case i will take advantage of his presence to make my declaration   142.92286496309612
he was alone in the darkness with sailors whom he did not know and who had no reason to be devoted to him   106.99991631641188
do you know where i shall find him   46.9244158051321
morrel hesitated to advance   116.31794834302043
have you then who have calculated everything with such nicety have you forgotten to calculate one thing i mean where the revelation of your crimes will lead you to   80.88193234248769
at the end of a hundred paces the ground began to decline and he could only see the mast of the sloop   89.33326952760447
how is it concealed   56.91952467430063
let us to bed   71.42239896201447
with pleasure   135.57379859092114
as i was weeping and begging on the high road a minister from kingston took me in instructed me in the calvinistic faith taught me all he knew himself and aided me in my researches after my family   124.43396402178028
he told her in fact that an explanation had taken place between m   73.46463463167447
d artagnan began to be touched   77.61796497008115
don t alarm yourself my little benedetto but just point out to me some means of gaining those thirty thousand francs without your assistance and i will contrive it   146.96342390426213
thanks sir   142.3888256843522
well then under these circumstances said caderousse i will i even believe i ought to undeceive you as to the friendship which poor edmond thought so sincere and unquestionable   128.05151167545063
i only ask you to examine my position as if it were your own and then judge for yourself   66.8100128524118
de montbazon and mme   178.31098673644868
you have seen nothing that resembles him because he works by secret springs and moves by hidden ways   112.7009522799603
it was now cromwell s turn to look fixedly at mordaunt and mordaunt to make himself impenetrable   128.37970159178315
he uses my property without accounting for the use he makes of it   133.26960227021937
as the clock struck eight they drove up to the place of meeting   160.58563631904005
mazarin followed the direction of his eyes and gently turned the hoop of the ring inside   120.55861585707409
speak loud very loud for they will be listening at the door   106.19071161710579
none of the lads of pampinara palestrina or valmontone had been able to gain any influence over him or even to become his companion   123.50927209276277
today the preliminaries tomorrow or next day the ceremony   23.636881757277152
ah in truth madame to do that i must forget the hour s conversation i have had with you which is indeed impossible   60.81453763662975
the dying man collected all his forces   72.65327821433304
why it seems to me replied morrel that in delivering m   48.376617960348554
40086m well baron said he here i am at last   1.1653495937428318
to be sure to see you   136.6281809129486
to meet d artagnan with a false excuse   91.85751289252946
how do you know that he does   85.09592594662627
said the same voice   70.62199989136398
the assizes chapter 110   103.26458277560947
this is the name of the lower class   20.865536700988187
but he also declared that he never had taken on himself the responsibility of making proposals for another and he never would   163.87309723385783
he has been sent by cromwell to mazarin and the queen guessed rightly   134.36942769345023
he reflected that this second grotto must penetrate deeper into the island   108.24013711027784
to make us between now and tomorrow two roman peasant costumes returned albert   132.9754536884161
your excellency is perfectly right in so thinking said the man   191.68788706882737
perhaps some of these days i may be entrapped like poor peppino and may be very glad to have some little nibbling mouse to gnaw the meshes of my net and so help me out of prison   112.27774894445703
supposing this person wearied at the inefficacy of the poison should as monte cristo intimated have recourse to steel   130.1662999843261
madame de villefort was in deep thought yet listened attentively   90.29295378475723
en route monsieur d artagnan said the cardinal   156.22853233919759
said the voice in a threatening accent that i had never yet heard   125.56472146801916
noirtier seating himself i might say the same thing to you when you announce to me your wedding for the 28th of february and on the 3rd of march you turn up here in paris   99.39518309209649
she opened and found the word secret   144.75559649365528
this time danglars had double reason to understand for if the word and gesture had not explained the speaker s meaning it was clearly expressed by the man walking behind him who pushed him so rudely that he struck against the guide   182.2624281653781
the second notary had also arrived   62.312845398976926
another reigns in her name   129.83755545408056
i wish to speak with him this evening   100.57308149940037
provided he can get money out of the people that is all he wants   117.97793241902272
gave him   31.229196103481456
they advanced fifty paces farther and then stopped to open a door then went forward again   72.60696681939993
said eugénie in a tone which a vestal in the amphitheatre would have used when urging the victorious gladiator to finish his vanquished adversary   92.11494077471889
nowadays the military profession is in abeyance and the magisterial robe is the badge of honor   155.8788748317421
he feared it would be hypocritical to accost in a friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly opposing but his oath and the gravity of the circumstances recurred to his memory   140.48216963856606
i know he can not save my life but he may strengthen me to give my evidence   130.22886772088225
he cried no boat   64.42509888029414
said d artagnan what did i tell you   56.29024529005237
no my boy no said caderousse   101.3975091722344
one of the sailors got down the side of the ship seized the cable and drew it   119.13881076754355
doubtless they are bad since they have not determined minds so just as yours   36.75536478730339
there is a proposition almost like it in the augustinus of the heresiarch jansenius whose book will sooner or later be burned by the hands of the executioner   111.07915857593707
for i saw her where she now sits the very first night of the season and since then she has never missed a performance   168.80210046834446
haydée sighed deeply and a shade of sadness clouded her beautiful brow   19.428816231326508
some voices were heard to say that the gentleman was right   31.974312732471077
i am said i the little abbé who reads lives of the saints and translates judith into verse   100.41761112669649
in those times panics were common and few days passed without some city or other registering in its archives an event of this kind   86.14174526106405
it then seems as if my hand grew heavy as if the cutlass was still in its grasp as if the water had the color of blood and all the voices of nature the whispering of the trees the murmur of the wind the lapping of the wave united in a voice tearful despairing terrible crying to me place for the justice of god   121.74786237259408
if they go out to day as they did yesterday we shall have the honor then of seeing them in half an hour   124.35803627995737
nonsense returned danglars i tell you again i have nothing whatever to do with it   105.61068382738603
whilst this went on porthos arrived with a very cross look on his face and was astonished to find the lieutenant resigned and mousqueton almost merry   189.40488682202297
it is easier and less noisy than the door   12.741214795684627
noirtier and let him tell you if ever once during that time he has entertained a thought which he was unable to make me understand   73.79580585899951
mazarin clever politician as he was was for once mistaken   11.426881130247196
thinking this one of importance he sent for me but not finding me took upon himself to give the necessary orders for arresting the accused party   99.33381627234101
the surgeon declared that the situation of the musketeer had nothing in it to render his friends uneasy his weakness having been purely and simply caused by loss of blood   82.26567797837652
i have no seconds on my part monsieur said d artagnan   87.19598910077482
monte cristo shrugged his shoulders   190.1005478512626
my lords answered he it is not by time i could repel the attack made on me by enemies unknown to me and doubtless hidden in obscurity   91.63097613592623
so long as three or four years ago he used to adorn and adore his little idol whom he will some day fall in love with in right earnest if he remains here   147.11252720581112
a glass of wine will be extremely welcome   146.46059999975495
there was not on the pavement in the carriages at the windows a single tongue that was silent a single arm that did not move   100.10664615014204
no repeated noirtier   52.91886892105641
if he be acknowledged as sovereign of france he should be upheld in peace and tranquillity   105.53004982083387
teresa returned it all this with the consent of the chief who was in the carriage   167.6970801113312
a desert island in the midst of the mediterranean must be a curiosity   88.50954694936526
the cardinal s house had no secrets for me   84.11693193316076
she is about to appoint some rendezvous of which she had not courage to speak   177.0047999346903
no you will be deprived of that pleasure   57.99583285047967
there are no extravagant hopes but for fools monsieur and you are a man of understanding   11.888432732844322
augustine and gall have made in verse and prose the comparison you have made and yet i can well understand that a father s sufferings may effect great changes in the mind of a son   115.2203287797235
then he mentally added still my unknown protector   140.72302111785535
she will advise him in the same letter to get rid of his two friends aramis and porthos at the same time   122.76436564393035
but i am really glad to have seen such a sight   103.43730999674364
exclaimed d artagnan does the queen surrounded as she is by such devoted servants such wise counselors men in short so great by merit or position does she deign to cast her eyes on an obscure soldier   137.10089244132493
the englishman was an original   132.03545268432518
athos went in quest of the englishman whom he found in the stable examining the harnesses with a greedy eye   57.98247561357223
certainly i shall albert as i have promised to do it   140.72827585308028
now madame danglars feared eugénie s sagacity and the influence of mademoiselle d armilly   156.2689967643979
returned the old man what hast thou done   9.487220890778858
but for such an expedition we surely ought to have brought our muskets   114.52398826056903
aramis had discovered the idea the lackeys   166.6359083060008
luckily the captain understood his business   65.10543300634751
why then should it be less daring in the future   120.10578982135414
what am i to do   113.75810704522088
fortune is precarious   106.10545472911848
you are four gentlemen said athos and we are four   83.25827811359798
then in order that he might have nothing to reproach himself with he directed his steps for the last time toward the residences of his three friends   2.0907568553696763
but continued aramis bazin is a well trained servant and seeing that i was not alone he discreetly retired   72.55302867226975
they might be said to be a procession of ghosts for they were all wrapped in white cloaks   175.71690734325693
you see your friends are wakeful   155.37531121925767
on the contrary i think it very easy   65.26968413675013
besides if they forget i shall take the liberty of reminding them   89.13533664287485
the footman was withdrawing but athos stopped him by a sign   115.01745894950137
more than that we shall have a tempest or i don t know what s what   116.0755312762629
general d épinay died five minutes after   181.32688906027408
while d artagnan was examining mme   75.24974545280014
this is his description benedetto condemned at the age of sixteen for five years to the galleys for forgery   142.4430991823589
i have not done so   178.81258404064522
i have an extraordinary means which i will not employ but in the last extremity to close your mouth or at least to prevent anyone from believing a word you may utter   89.09331179048705
the ferry across the oise   138.41452561777925
and where i pray you   20.45332268337411
well so much the better said the supercargo   63.64758934560647
the young lady went towards madame morrel   94.14377455730715
you are a lieutenant   136.91425919338232
may i promise your custom to the successor of father marteau my lord   116.36310099566985
in one hand she held her handkerchief with which she appeared to be wiping her face and in the other a bottle of english smelling salts   74.29479065324928
while porthos and mousqueton were breakfasting with the appetites of convalescents and with that brotherly cordiality which unites men in misfortune d artagnan related how aramis being wounded was obliged to stop at crèvecœur how he had left athos fighting at amiens with four men who accused him of being a coiner and how he d artagnan had been forced to run the comtes de wardes through the body in order to reach england   226.4081041310887
no no said fernand restraining him stay   90.49741536983086
you have already answered the question once but so vaguely that i venture to put it a second time   102.86371272544434
are you mad la ramee   132.52659081831993
he appeared to foresee all to divine all to anticipate all   154.6935459607554
cried milady forgetting her usual presence of mind   136.77855311517652
said porthos sobbing i believe i m crying   138.30282087042963
she asked in a tone full of mournful dignity   142.86328355833032
said the count with an air of surprise remarkably well counterfeited   133.75949165612656
upon which he offered to take cavalcanti in his carriage to the hôtel des princes if it would not be depriving him of the company of his son   76.70890899128972
albert rubbed his eyes ordered his servant to introduce him into the small smoking room on the ground floor dressed himself quickly and went down   103.3844557855191
ah my poor d artagnan   154.9106728850935
you are thinking i am sure of some kind speech to console me but do not utter it to me reserve it for others more worthy of your kindness   77.17055372909687
he saw from what fountainhead the ferocious hopes of the young man arose and he put his hand to the hilt of his sword   21.168301916766538
aramis had eight of them   118.84905601236545
but he will draw upon his head the punishment reserved for the damned   109.66917744052111
as your excellency may have observed your horse is in the great gateway ready saddled for your departure   84.22830072845483
life itself may be resolved into three words erat est fuit   109.89204058828517
you speak charmingly said porthos   144.65722954160842
and i assure you he seemed fully to comprehend that this mode of reconciling political differences was based upon sound and excellent principles   55.3905952399759
i did not perceive that there were three of us   196.3185416934703
so there is no chance of my escaping   102.02691134392352
but i will save him   58.437738758856234
but to his great surprise carlini arrived almost as soon as himself   77.38321177418288
my death then will not be to her as the death of a stranger   155.98126965769092
try to spend it all   174.10381120908306
the breakfast chapter 41   81.46114635129636
i can still say it is a dream   96.62556707450774
the fortune is not her gift but is inherited from my relations   149.5029906876261
what news   130.62554797408924
we have made a wager a wager which could not have been foreseen and of which i defy anyone to divine the true cause   49.51052665562764
certainly i will do so said the young man with a quickness which gave proof of his ready invention   68.88252042737678
thanks m   146.900935590385
pass replied d artagnan   68.91442326945216
very well said the prince   61.675840931282494
and despite the rouge with which her face was covered evidently turned pale and then and then   126.74028714383142
and there was a morrel who served in the same regiment with me when i was in garrison at valence   87.71314794741991
owing to the very judicious plan of dividing the two acts of the opera with a ballet the pauses between the performances are very short the singers in the opera having time to repose themselves and change their costume when necessary while the dancers are executing their pirouettes and exhibiting their graceful steps   103.50453244568709
god has supported me through all   84.06643495877731
cried mercédès shuddering   69.74319111412966
yes monsieur and it was he who taught me to lay a snare and ground a line   80.75200872661064
but who is to make four hundred pistoles   218.82010321705678
and at this moment i have absolutely nothing to do   145.79778473712676
at this instant the favorite attendant of madame danglars entered the boudoir   146.46384199204033
there is still hope   122.88646329269415
the same day he told his wife emmanuel and his daughter all that had occurred   85.56006413445988
lord monsieur   100.46693599511468
yes you talk like a child i repeat the word   9.223702201659492
you heard cavalcanti   59.12997003113573
and this this is my fortune not chimerical but actual   139.65692687737914
i did not know that replied m   153.07381105150498
afterward monsieur de tréville fought with others in his first journey to paris five times   219.2758830094768

farewell till the next time we meet cried chatillon and he set off full gallop   138.5640311818395
he wishes also to have faith in his queen   127.74061334959129
it s the same thing cried the young woman   52.93038714692202
thought porthos casting a glance at the three hungry clerks for the errand boy as might be expected was not admitted to the honors of the magisterial table in my cousin s place i would not keep such gourmands   14.764717619101646
make use of it then whenever you think it will be most useful for my eldest son s welfare   53.70504523202161
in that case take care   87.28519981508663
i was sensible that i could look for no support from a man disappointed in his hopes of an inheritance   87.43811344187534
why should i risk an imprudent step   104.9703170077752
the cardinal took a key from his bureau and opening the door of a secret stair descended into the court of the palais royal   120.44643755447407
but at the same time i perceive it would be overwhelming for me   119.94341044019589
and madame de villefort and sometimes i confess i have gone so far as to try to read in his eyes whether he was in possession of the secret of our love   95.08854419771956
out of the twenty musketeers sixteen when this took place rejoiced greatly at this relaxation   104.63316891232385
without passports   144.19445781204826
if my heart be petrified it is that it might sustain the blows it has received   131.4899656819033
from the count   17.055847878825062
you appear quite aghast   66.61441084153553
at length she rallied drew aside the curtain and leaning over the pillow gazed intently on valentine   85.79169283485082
in fact in addition to that yellow sickly paleness which indicates the insinuation of the bile in the blood and which might besides be accidental d artagnan remarked something perfidiously significant in the play of the wrinkled features of his countenance   129.46461617137143
and if the marquis chooses to be candid he will confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to him when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of your espousing his daughter   131.44425790786084
and porthos heaved another sigh   90.47611992798036
i forget how but i know he used to amuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it after his return from italy   167.99400258936032
in spite of his prudence d artagnan restrained himself with great difficulty from taking a part in the scene that was going on below   125.93337610888386
besides what would the sailors say   149.51678601656783
he then withdrew and as he passed into the courtyard he stopped near a lamp and dived eagerly into the bag of money   117.85027634705897
but scarcely were they out of the room before they were made aware of the cause of this noise   69.52659018853515

as he rose a flash of lightning that seemed to rive the remotest heights of heaven illumined the darkness   151.82090285407872

why do you call me baron   157.17007991478533
villefort leaped out of the carriage and saw that his servants were surprised at his early return   86.14981865888804
on the eve of battle   30.726104204689022
baptiste give me yesterday s paper cried beauchamp   109.11287845245612
beauchamp took the paper and read the article to which albert pointed in an undertone   90.33184675862853
bonacieux placing her hand upon her bosom my heart beats so i can not walk   148.3298853025745
olivain bowed and slipped the crown into his pocket   142.0129812848964
she appeared to take a great interest in him asked him whence he came who were his friends and whether he had not sometimes thought of attaching himself to the cardinal   157.6723658375364
mesdemoiselles noblet julia and leroux executed the customary pirouettes   86.74094213845413

athos found much less difficulty than he had expected in obtaining an audience of anne of austria   76.5501195486087
i have only one thing to say to you   91.41013318323849

and in her first paroxysm of terror she had raised herself from the sofa in the next stronger very likely than the other she fell down again on the cushions   137.6550592678641
i possessed a thousand francs   108.09930782774728
on my word said albert you astonish me by the extent of your knowledge   94.89887787534342
poor dear monsieur d artagnan said kitty in a voice full of compassion and pressing anew the young man s hand   65.59512380055551
why that is a fortune   91.1445218740932
tomorrow i will see you again to take my leave   193.74623660152417
is it true said the guard to the two cavaliers that the duc de beaufort has arrived in paris   132.32520399354834
he perceived then at a glance that this woman was young and beautiful   125.59713855970942
in the ray of light which entered by the narrow window of his cell he held open in his left hand of which alone it will be recollected he retained the use a sheet of paper which from being constantly rolled into a small compass had the form of a cylinder and was not easily kept open   115.24654365206023

oh yes she cried i do love you   94.44397071256147

well then you shall have it   114.07519253086129
perhaps replied d artagnan   97.85237899861534
which i have put on some vine leaves to please you wicked one   134.664999671467
but that is not all there is a codicil as i said just now   165.64179266285265
but the king soon again became dull and indisposed   171.58853112083938
returned the captain   71.3904163611812
in short why should i have any more to do with the affair   230.3937354986744
debray who both mount the minister s arabians   111.60518350473667

i concluded that by some singular chance the owner of the winning horse must live in the same hotel as myself   109.0820046220552
as bertuccio was leaving the room to give the requisite orders baptistin opened the door he held a letter on a silver waiter   111.08240128480017
said d avrigny struck with a sudden thought has it occurred to you noirtier did not let him finish   67.93297634117098
bertuccio crouched in the corner of the carriage began to examine with a feverish anxiety every house they passed   65.29590694866488
replied la ramee your supper is ordered   97.14865417877562
at this moment the same bell that had proclaimed the beginning of the mascherata sounded the retreat   73.73935707618976
d épinay must say that he is shocked and astonished that m   124.91553242364273
the striking points of his face were effaced   69.35646362107053
the musketeer leaped lightly into the saddle   159.5214214242538
and this is the reason monsieur continued maximilian of my sister and brother in law having only 25 000 francs a year   176.41451136811
and they pursued their road in mournful silence   58.958619788486125
yes since she lives   83.0906745520028
this affair like all those in which the count of monte cristo had interfered caused a great sensation in paris   161.76911658574284
he is the cause of all this misery i am quite sure of it whispered caderousse who had never taken his eyes off fernand to danglars   179.80070835901944
noirtier to prevent his granddaughter marrying   101.45226809649631
i am a straightforward simple man   201.0824388761303
as for porthos he looked inquiringly at d artagnan   118.24668408160052
that you must not fail to call upon him in the course of the day   76.7011748043484
and dantès knew it from the first to the last word   52.95169979488369
you shall be one   78.97649421068687
0263m if they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave he would allow himself to be covered with earth and then as it was night the grave diggers could scarcely have turned their backs before he would have worked his way through the yielding soil and escaped   157.34032368649704
no there is nothing in the world to resemble you in worth and goodness   88.65070206323891
that is quite my desire   74.98299035367108
they were ambitious and cæsar borgia soon found purchasers for their appointments   144.6437835332094

the king don carlos has not left bourges and the peninsula is in the enjoyment of profound peace   68.86565915577523
may you tell me whither   102.79232933786469
on hearing those two names the queen uttered a cry of joy which the two gentlemen heard   81.42382532110781
in the navy   75.03701273204291
why did you deceive me   187.31542851375136
the police think that they have disposed of the whole matter when they say a murder has been committed and especially so when they can add and we are on the track of the guilty persons   133.11714528135147
it was then he heard a voice exclaim valentine is dead   120.99810589501844
we were well placed and saw everything   86.70689021489702
well said franz this time m   57.420558838008155
morrel tormented his so effectually that they struck eight at half past six   11.782407291764414
well i fortunately recognize you   198.78254926971573

but the doctor is afraid some tendon has been injured   104.9457370456623
take these documents then   8.349781769516184
too late   132.81152789886593
the abbé began like you and in three days you will be like him mad enough to tie up   106.67963548138276
well if you will have the truth and me too   137.01647592846956
this was the orthodox phrase   110.0186934194508
danglars signature chapter 105   97.81374747108121
and therefore my friends will conduct monsieur le cardinal neither to de beaufort nor to de bouillon nor to the coadjutor nor to d elbeuf   126.89439373891281
the minister of police giving way to an impulse of despair was about to throw himself at the feet of louis xviii   118.4542056694693
it must however be confessed in his justification that the first use he made of his influence over kitty was to try and find out what had become of mme   157.8215523840882
and you say that signor vampa exercises his profession at this moment in the environs of rome   41.53038157216966
supper was to be served at three and the clock of st   131.54898561702336
cried madame danglars a man may murder another out of revenge but he would not deliberately drown a child   129.71490075875616
how should he be   116.50037187609833
and that very evening the prisoners sketched a plan of education to be entered upon the following day   24.573875107989565
lying dressed upon his bed the noise awoke him with a start and found a gloomy echo in his heart   141.19680480290913
the examination chapter 8   110.58785410428729
will monsieur remain long with us   56.12768314404571
a knife covered with rust and two letters one of which was stained with blood alone met his gaze   67.63052308753629
some one   130.3650964585002
there were collected and piled up all albert s successive caprices hunting horns bass viols flutes a whole orchestra for albert had had not a taste but a fancy for music   104.15106853414233
on looking around him however as he could perceive no threatening object as nothing indicated that he ran any real danger as the bench was comfortably covered with a well stuffed cushion as the wall was ornamented with a beautiful cordova leather and as large red damask curtains fastened back by gold clasps floated before the window he perceived by degrees that his fear was exaggerated and he began to turn his head to the right and the left upward and downward   89.05883879391428
at this moment the door of the guardhouse was opened and one of the soldiers was summoned away   107.2209114513647
what is the matter with him   122.13836059816194
your majesty is free to forget or to remember as it pleases you   144.9352102938272
indeed you are such an extraordinary person that i would not answer for it   158.89062217434451
search among your friends your oldest friends   146.7334208845156
well what have you to say   74.78779577832978
de villefort who appeared to be aware of all the circumstances detailed this morning should not have anticipated him in this announcement   108.29556669909134
ah you virtuous men   152.69543821381006
for my master   133.16706170016027
and as the old man slowly pronounced those words an air of profound resignation spread itself over his careworn countenance   87.26867192175928
and he saw the little yacht now like a sea gull on the wave continuing her flight towards corsica   178.73322318745852
he has returned said he   132.5434623815082
swear it   80.19788074175598
jealousy gnawed his heart   62.78050122430734
tis still a consolation that they were not wounded said aramis   141.25465443255155
the three valets passed without accident   41.96684703914934
yes and now i shall be more calm   100.31735015011589
and the young man s voice was choked by sobs   102.30517765703652
the choice is easy   147.96853569685965
julie wished to accompany him   152.56333804878977
at last it seemed to him that one part of the wall gave forth a more hollow and deeper echo   135.35508904516223
you mean george villiers   178.69083614036066
they then separated   90.92822171858127
the opinion of athos was that it was indeed she   104.91984011666057
you speak very much at your ease madame said bonacieux hurt at the little interest his wife showed in him   117.25195542268627
cried a hoarse voice   104.90222047141074
a most lovely creature upon my soul   133.00793894908497
as for me my heart is overflowing with happiness   97.72046777245447
it was indeed madame danglars and her daughter whom valentine had seen   109.62398320124551
and he added turning to porthos here s a gentleman who s of the same opinion as myself   217.68699552163343
sterlets said château renaud are only found in the volga   96.3469050640295
a summer ball chapter 69   137.72209534917448
repeated morrel as if awakening from a dream   80.75405546925313
everything considered i am not sorry to retain grimaud   47.81510663565936
he looked for his doublet of the year 1648 and as he had orderly habits he found it hanging on its nail   148.50888053612883
saying these words d artagnan went upstairs leaving his host a little better satisfied with respect to two things in which he appeared to be very much interested his debt and his life   92.66068013935654
no replied villefort   101.56636645252604
the parliament had a plea for calling mazarin to account for imaginary victories always promised ever deferred   71.51509415392024
i haven t been able to recognize you in this matter   148.69746719728698
nevertheless my dear count i found you this morning engaged in an occupation but little consistent with the notions you profess to entertain   90.32053336078039
i really think i must have been frightened   31.234771454813327
his holiness had an idea   86.62078544057385
i take that god to witness at whose feet i have prostrated myself daily for the last ten years that i would have sacrificed my life to you and with my life the projects that were indissolubly linked with it   119.45623071391378
danglars said   80.19089730490398
i had replied the count   166.77665938061196
adieu then to both my good friends said d artagnan   61.578493370603994
bonacieux had named mandé because mandé was in an exactly opposite direction from st   60.52092016596456
i have had greater men than you arrested guitant   120.35164892544583
i would not wish for a better to sail round the world   88.4839344420271
quiet was at length restored   115.98903905154249
you hear him   30.62107524932486
in order that there might be no confusion franz wore his peasant s costume   87.50213971092276
gondy raised his hand and demanded silence   95.15112968076922
a smile of incredulity passed over the pale lips of milady   51.678680520672685
many a long year has passed since any one has wanted to employ me   124.4698798382897
will you go up with me   139.7281542640507
ah i have been running very fast mademoiselle but i must do m   152.81707456540957
pray put no construction on my words i do not mean they should convey and give them no undue weight   97.2502285442055
this house is part of valentine s marriage portion and m   172.29255040609937
i foppish   45.95741131040644
sir cried morrel seizing the moist hand of the paralytic they ask me who i am and what right i have to be here   65.60066141244438
yes said aramis impart it to us my dear friend unless the honor of any lady be hazarded by this confidence   4.983313210139187
you were about to confide it to monsieur bonacieux said d artagnan with chagrin   103.99008414706408
one day when he arrived with his head in the air and as light at heart as a man who awaits a shower of gold he found the soubrette under the gateway of the hôtel   171.87810181780225
there duke said he you were right and i was wrong   136.1663024564333
because she flew into a great passion on receiving the letter saying that monsieur porthos was a weathercock and that she was sure it was for some woman he had received this wound   153.82203682380617
you are after all a good companion   83.2090226442256
better than ever   58.4632335037686
moreover other ideas much more enthralling occupied his mind   51.4986152480028
the dead are not agreeable company particularly when they have died a violent death   94.52481260242021
exclaimed felton on seeing the knife glitter in her hand   23.160072572350714
valentine was so pale one might trace the blue veins from her temples round her eyes and down her cheeks   120.89624270683163
cried several bandits from ferrusino pampinara and anagni who had recognized luigi vampa   121.04455710488313
but is she safe   146.8746614932587
asked d artagnan as they hurried along   145.17342278141518

the audience felt that a startling revelation was to follow this ominous prelude   103.90798205893344
well be it so let us part said mercédès folding around her shoulders the only shawl she had taken away and which accidentally happened to be a valuable black cashmere   79.35410438367819

and it appeared to her that the soldier who was on duty at her door did not march with the same step and seemed to listen   129.94945077783507
but what struck everybody was his extreme resemblance to the portrait debray had drawn   222.89400618299362
tis a last resource but let us not employ it till it is imperatively called for   102.04078817354494

he whom in paris you call the corsican ogre who at nevers is styled the usurper is already saluted as bonaparte at lyons and emperor at grenoble   233.9288577888551
d artagnan asked some questions about this prolonged melancholy   169.66764897715612
signor pastrini came to the door to receive his guests   128.73115958154563
then said felton who became impatient say yourself madame what treatment you wish followed   128.48139262258414
d artagnan then related the poisoning of mme   145.01990500317163
valentine blushed but did not answer   146.17904701440145

well he thought of me when he saw the king was taken and as they were passing before the house he begged in the king s name that they would stop as the king was hungry   168.8565306368811
i can refuse nothing asked of me thus   115.04960763908775
then listen to me   97.2110162095062
mazarin looked at the young man but at the fire which shot from his glance he bent his head   128.76306993409545

there again monte cristo was assailed by a multitude of thoughts   88.77315580438
in truth my dear captain i have a great mind to take away your commission and give it to mademoiselle de chemerault to whom i promised an abbey   167.6123800021802
monsieur de chavigny be so good as to lend me your cane   138.97179402980214
but it is already five o clock so make haste   146.67647856571014

i shall still take precautions   134.92038234225703
the news of the arrival of the pharaon had not yet reached the old man who mounted on a chair was amusing himself by training with trembling hand the nasturtiums and sprays of clematis that clambered over the trellis at his window   95.68657436225058
we shall soon see how to dispose he continued of the parliament   182.5903751767396
after some hours of repose the sleepers were aroused by athos   121.02574043756735

carlini raised her in his arms and carried her out of the circle of firelight   44.9946076456789
and i doubt as was the case with polycrates whether any fish will be sufficiently complaisant to bring it back to us   89.65235800988128
tell someone to bid her come here that i may have the honor of introducing her to the count   140.79308000375235
she then arose and with altered voice ladies said she wait for me ten minutes i shall soon return   114.44013202021449
you are a good fellow and a kind hearted messmate replied edmond and heaven will recompense you for your generous intentions   88.96247518488283
i will therefore proceed   14.042752053982227

excuse me albert sorrow on your account and delight with that noble girl thus pursuing paternal vengeance   141.70578172860084
but at all events listen well to this   107.890378899504
the cardinal pronounced the single word hanged   87.71791098989046
although professing diametrically opposite principles from those of the editor of the other paper beauchamp as it sometimes we may say often happens was his intimate friend   151.446263379153
beat the messenger   84.5366730234343
albert reeled as if he had been shot and fell on a chair near the door   168.5427631054348
he is really out sir replied baptistin   147.22253234597514
about five minutes replied the captain   84.66309310812059
at this letter the eloquent eye of noirtier gave her notice that she was to stop   104.83639941764037
i have the greatest veneration for the cardinal continued he and the most profound respect for his actions   134.9228607623386
why he is a very devil this béarnais   84.76644836330898
i tell you he will never return   132.0648773365989
adieu then sir and do not forget the prescription   71.39837721583797
but as i entered my apartments i beheld the very gold cup awarded as a prize to the unknown horse and rider   137.66377763880138
for you see the bright side of everything   58.420644649445194
here is my pass countersigned said the latter   133.42309249410403
what could explain athos s having re entered the world and the extreme sobriety he had observed at table   74.469025682389
i say nothing about blaisois for he is only fit to hold the horses   131.50423740534444
how will that affect you since mademoiselle danglars was not among the number here who thought of you   89.11872726371676
one word one single word more doctor   136.5275750385048
bring my new saddle and carry it along with those of these gentlemen   122.32394672628931
on his murderers   88.40346990387665
that is why i have filled this whole assembly with horror   165.68478557525202
and certainly no adequate notion of these stupendous ruins can be formed save by such as have visited them and more especially by moonlight at which time the vast proportions of the building appear twice as large when viewed by the mysterious beams of a southern moonlit sky whose rays are sufficiently clear and vivid to light the horizon with a glow equal to the soft twilight of a western clime   108.39856245961975
and you will leave the command to him   183.2980821493421
nothing more easy   120.17400388173412
aramis must have worn himself to a shadow of his former self by constant genuflexion   144.13763652693356
have the goodness to send mine to athos s residence   81.07854400463924
and the father and the lover began to dig at the foot of a huge oak beneath which the young girl was to repose   114.6378198622166
but it was soon known that they had joined cucumetto   139.6464921104991
to keep away from him every pointed or cutting instrument and to prevent his conversing any length of time with the keepers   64.01961321881592
they passed close by the unhappy being who concealed behind the damask curtain almost felt mercédès dress brush past him and his son s warm breath pronouncing these words courage mother   47.62110578207833
one of them lifted the plank took out a flask of wine drank some and then passed it to his companion   61.8503952751158
remember your oath   191.62191047795235
bonacieux uttered lamentations enough to break the heart of a tiger   131.39981729159612
interrupted the procureur shrugging his shoulders   89.21937673223223
she prevailed upon him to leave the country   99.76139372990019
after which ebullition he departed not however without walking several times to the door of the press room as if he had half a mind to enter   161.7096116772802
the count had spoken correctly   50.1455853489714
i do not often laugh sir replied the stranger as you may perceive by the expression of my countenance   170.79364429917658
with the greatest pleasure   95.31989628258974
the spring has been warm this year and strawberries require heat sir   136.55202882602828
i shall struggle to the very last   44.54836489840383
after they got along a few paces the passage widened   111.7661089406554
unless you are blind or have never been outside the harbor you must know   57.123705914043924
the lives of five men are not safe in my opinion as long as he is on the earth   113.43596233156498
and said madame de villefort i need not ask you if you share that fancy   90.02821552557745
continued athos   151.26825030765417
your fortune is therefore made if you remain with me and i am too good a master to allow you to miss such a chance by granting you the dismissal you require   54.93102027270215
inquired the traveller   119.0613612575813
the count however has commissioned me to assure you that two or three days rest with plenty of barley for their sole food during that time will bring them back to as fine that is as terrifying a condition as they were in yesterday   177.21593234841052
give him a lesson debray   165.3439448823853
every opinion was openly expressed and chorused so to speak of coming insurrection as the thousand bells of all the paris churches rang out the te deum   115.58278232299128
athos and aramis started with delight to find that the king was lying with his clothes on   81.65715890468408
the boy found him sitting where d artagnan had left him still overwhelmed by the coolness of his adversary   106.96353317851272
but your release can be managed   101.2285157544292
no but it agitates me   160.08263464371566
all said the major hastily swallowing his biscuit positively all   108.13701442847501
at the sight of carlini cucumetto rose a pistol in each hand   57.0117760515201
the frenchman made some resistance and nearly strangled beppo   129.59360542460934
chat between brother and sister chapter li   172.5192985078328
the abbé smiled and proceeding to the disused fireplace raised by the help of his chisel a long stone which had doubtless been the hearth beneath which was a cavity of considerable depth serving as a safe depository of the articles mentioned to dantès   32.24452199977429
and you understand what brings me here   171.5966716924003
shouted d artagnan   176.03074912514222
row porthos row   107.26389013449726
d artagnan looked attentively at the building   49.89114753271713
de tréville in practice instantly d artagnan directed his course toward the rue des fossoyeurs in order to superintend the packing of his valise   167.8430829371132
it is not exactly that sir said the notary which makes me uneasy but the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions so as to be able to get his answers   53.95923791762502
since last evening he added smiling you have done enough in my service and if you have any personal matters to settle it is just that i should give you time   89.17968685035495
he arrived at his usual hour with a proud look and insolent demeanor   130.51535321784897
i wish to consult you on this passage molli fugiens anhelitu you know it refers to a stag flying from a wolf   87.00082312168364

morrel concealed himself behind a door   103.9724588849421
no more edicts no more of the cardinal s guards no more de jussacs nor other bloodhounds   99.23023521969331
danglars shuddered at this unexpected attack and turned to caderousse whose countenance he scrutinized to try and detect whether the blow was premeditated   52.717326105068274
but he soon saw that she would pass like most vessels bound for italy between the islands of jaros and calaseraigne   108.18514319827555
morrel had not readily given up the fight   141.41943355712962
as for his wife he bowed to her as some husbands do to their wives but in a way that bachelors will never comprehend until a very extensive code is published on conjugal life   126.98681590645606
and as i have said the auditors seeming to have great deference for the narrator they every moment burst into fits of laughter   126.54635996667928
said bazin clasping his hands supplicatingly   85.54874024995205
the jailer though rough and hardened by the constant sight of so much suffering was yet a man   77.80779356304299
the waking when franz returned to himself he seemed still to be in a dream   60.17708278692224
aramis and d artagnan whispered to each other   132.13307215767134
but what are you doing   70.59902334363088
the siege once over we shall be able to make a tour in that direction   120.09424190269672
asked morrel arresting his hand   164.8769135797947
i find in it two poniards a ladder of rope and a gag   118.24345266538802
he is going to the opera   107.58573855373636
he remained there ten minutes motionless and dumb listening to the beating of his own heart   48.0497212550312
those on the other side had followed their example thus favoring the views of the four friends who preferred having them close at hand to chasing them about the chamber   67.04914042795615
my position is like that of a person wounded in a dream   139.74359398075916
but still we are forbidden to give you any explanation   107.8140425385668
as morrel and his son embraced on the pier head in the presence and amid the applause of the whole city witnessing this event a man with his face half covered by a black beard and who concealed behind the sentry box watched the scene with delight uttered these words in a low tone be happy noble heart be blessed for all the good thou hast done and wilt do hereafter and let my gratitude remain in obscurity like your good deeds   134.78465928745652
the prince awaited him there   52.84539863954082
he could do it in an hour and how many times had he for pure pastime continued in the water for more than twice as long   121.30518374590801
inquired a gentleman who had spoken to athos in the rue saint honore   32.783111318602565
the physician who prepared for me the remedy i have twice successfully taken was no other than the celebrated cabanis and he predicted a similar end for me   98.69935863483762
either i misunderstand you or you are very shameless   90.96227048799228
said d artagnan whom the positive tone of m   124.70643846859441
asked athos of porthos   74.3069838457425
in the corridor he met mme   116.3570412611256
well continued the cardinal in an indifferent tone the only thing to be sought for at this moment is some woman handsome young and clever who has cause of quarrel with the duke   223.28181408718257
as they went the citizens awakened left their doors and the street dogs followed the cavaliers barking   148.81198516136067
aramis uttered a cry of joy at the sight of the seal kissed the superscription with an almost religious respect and opened the epistle which contained what follows my friend it is the will of fate that we should be still for some time separated   81.83858145275002
yes continued the cardinal   25.16585330902859
but no the communication would not come through madame de villefort   103.50204108555417
that is a tenacious old grandfather said beauchamp   208.2044908726258
one day when oppressed with a mortal weariness of mind without hope in the negotiations with the city without news from england the cardinal went out without any other aim than to be out of doors and accompanied only by cahusac and la houdinière strolled along the beach   239.29995139048907
go and look for the comte de la fere   155.39327167759362
and then i swear your trial will be summary   167.80504408418682
will they dare to arrest a man in his majesty s service   127.59301563699766
the deuce you say   159.05043092678727
not out of my armory for at terracina i was plundered even of my hunting knife   203.02812685478716
certainly your excellency   150.5724401711202
noirtier seeing barrois in this pitiable condition showed by his looks all the various emotions of sorrow and sympathy which can animate the heart of man   95.37341275193972
they heard the cause of the disturbance   69.29584489690713
and the vessel passed as dantès had predicted twenty fathoms to windward   88.83678007115583
then you are vexed with the engagement   77.04563749889691
it is mine and i am at liberty to dispose of it   59.60379236102935
you were right my lord said felton with a tone of profound disgust which sounded to the very bottom of the heart of milady you were right my lord and i was wrong   168.27266246961014
the paths of which you were just speaking have been traced by all young men of ardent imaginations   107.40645438425969
yet i fancy as thou sayest that i see something   102.15197820077123
a single look at milady apprised him of all that was passing in her mind   37.05718825912355
besides your window opens immediately over the sea   143.22576072475755
there was a solemn though momentary silence which was broken by aramis   178.13004341216782
now is the time when baron porthos would be useful   62.912486637738695
he would not however yield immediately to the young man s request but made a few conscientious objections   66.59951469210671
chapter 32   45.44251958843327
his excellency does reside here replied the concierge   71.52727874256021
ten minutes afterwards general morcerf was seen on the steps in a black coat with a military collar black pantaloons and black gloves   174.11607507121875
but he could not help observing that they turned round to look at him and for the first time in his life d artagnan who had till that day entertained a very good opinion of himself felt ridiculous   89.54891135084841
i returned last night and here i am   149.9775848419533
un vent de fronde s est leve ce matin   68.56522407319386
could de rochefort have forestalled him with athos   177.7920176551027
then new concessions to the people then a constitution then liberty   88.10287257772491
morrel is in his room is he not mademoiselle julie   95.31946490009578
i congratulate you   150.61815870926668
madame this is precaution not impertinence   138.75226677356426
it was the cardinal then who informed you of this fête   151.078500141757
the battle soon became general and the coadjutor performed miracles of valor   82.62209716476427
no other than your friend monte cristo   80.19281395754793
she herself was not exempt from internal emotion and without having done anything wrong yet fully comprehended that luigi was right in reproaching her   100.31807290367618
what have you done   210.05660578234225
for the rest the storm which raged within her doubled her strength and she would have burst the walls of her prison if her body had been able to take for a single instant the proportions of her mind   99.57275522060026
but cried morrel this purse is not yours   84.91188194815082
count of morcerf said the president do not allow yourself to be cast down   71.40381595777802
i can foresee that we shall have need of it directly   116.424212421848
and that was you   53.78911290835798
when once in the saddle grimaud reflected on two things   207.14538804804675
cried the distracted mother rushing toward villefort   148.43368873462464
the figure advanced towards the bed and appeared to listen with profound attention   131.47287048768447
the steward appeared at the door   168.27527698716617
it appears to me that this is quite enough   150.4914869519948
that is difficult replied athos   89.96696247283214
before mercédès should die replied fernand with the accents of unshaken resolution i would die myself   65.17578039425682
d artagnan although he was not a musketeer performed the duty of one with remarkable punctuality   83.93074984179741
and then we shall see how the rebels will get on without either king or queen   83.6645777294129
let us set off   101.16667444620701
you judge yourself with too much severity   146.96561638746115
just so gentlemen   148.09343382300017
friend he said you have worked so hard with me toward building up our fortune that at the moment when we are about to reap the fruits of our labours it would be a ridiculous piece of silliness in you to allow yourself to be controlled by aramis whose cunning you know a cunning which we may say between ourselves is not always without egotism   169.02890675637428
continued the count be good enough to ask pastrini if he has received the tavoletta and if he can send us an account of the execution   131.63930554713062
thanks danglars that will smooth over all difficulties   77.10560295365009
but his sleep was a nightmare which might be guessed by the incoherent manner in which he sometimes snored and sometimes snorted   131.69838903431497
he probably had succumbed   169.94456393865468
but we know that for men like these there could be no question of danger   165.81527782123644
well my husband would never live in it   151.20298151317186
by my faith i ask no better cried bonacieux   132.12500618343267
and as it is not permissible to contradict a queen whether she smile or weep everybody expatiated on the gallantry of the aldermen of the city of paris   119.66282046633604
bonacieux in a voice almost caressing and pressing the hand of d artagnan who had not relinquished hers well i will not say as much as you do   100.95248968962356
everything is possible in this affair even a miracle   102.50126556697884
i have no time to lose   72.75978163293291
chapter 56   92.29711817644531
but scarcely was it known that the taxes were to be still further increased when cries of down with mazarin   117.65324663968099
will you allow me to speak to you of her   121.16994594193443
said to bear the name   95.36070720965938
900 000 francs   100.7523341535896
long ago this mysterious colony quitted spain and settled on the tongue of land on which it is to this day   118.53197501149862
and her son   105.11794928120106
and hence said villefort arose my affection for your father my dear m   158.59958713194357
whoever had selected this retired portion of the grounds as the boundary of a walk or as a place for meditation was abundantly justified in the choice by the absence of all glare the cool refreshing shade the screen it afforded from the scorching rays of the sun that found no entrance there even during the burning days of hottest summer the incessant and melodious warbling of birds and the entire removal from either the noise of the street or the bustle of the mansion   2.858952990145397
i want a hundred pounds and as for my own and he emptied them inside out   104.22780244622044
it was in the rue des france bourgeois close to la force   97.93998835907756
only seventeen months replied dantès   80.01049924965342
another the illustrious mazarin acting the part of ignatius loyola in a tragedy of that name   150.4316165881688
deuce take those italian princes   133.6866593447384
when he was left stiff as a rush in london   0.40733700183635335
cried porthos they have not even pursued us   73.09790360457103
edmond looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of a man superior to his fellows   106.28648070878418
all we have got to do is to keep our own counsel and remain perfectly quiet not breathing a word to any living soul   127.365962102571
when the police is at fault it declares that it is on the track   160.5789199803928
i must positively find out who and what he is said franz rising from his seat   243.6700341567365
and you say this young man behaved himself well   187.811218886883
here is a little article on colonel fernand which if i am not mistaken would render the explanation which the comte de morcerf required of me perfectly unnecessary   132.2890445380183
it is enough replied the prince   114.15961474134323
this skillful turn of the conversation would have seemed a sublime manoeuvre to any one who could have read the gascon s soul   115.62555692378615
what you had one   212.24313394607617
she could nevertheless make up her mind to renounce the world sir since it is only about a year ago that she herself proposed entering a convent   127.42064362736089
even ali who had hastened to obey the count s summons went forth from his master s presence in charmed amazement at the unusual animation and pleasure depicted on features ordinarily so stern and cold   136.72630310752123
all this looks suspicious   128.0354889234474
consequently you can understand that it is not at all likely i shall ever deny my parent   69.73289532869826
as for me said porthos i will see to the supper   158.9982657186377
for as i told you i expect someone at nine   147.1485069268018
i warn you that i will never again work in the dark and that i will know not only to what i expose myself but for whom i expose myself   85.71261940121062
with this sum he could manage to keep out of difficulties   145.03369663478665
ah said louise breathing freely here we are out of paris   147.3143771305946
i have always found them   154.10383101011578
observed valentine   202.58526729357249
a most active search was still prosecuted in the house near the hotel de la chevrette for the discovery of planchet   153.32467348458667
morrel of my desire to have these payments punctually and he has been here within the last half hour to tell me that if his ship the pharaon did not come into port on the 15th he would be wholly unable to make this payment   95.82657012013198
then to admit no one except major bartolomeo cavalcanti and his son   72.27836466689965
apropos she said as if to drive away thoughts that pursued her in spite of herself how is poor voiture do you know scarron   100.45709180242059
at pontoise he changed his horse for the last time and at nine o clock galloped into the yard of tréville s hôtel   107.80771567367496
it fills me with pride to find that thanks to a common sort of penetration with which i am endowed i am approved by a man like you fresh from the court   103.97923387522329
inquired the abbé with an ironical smile   39.96058316219879
he had been known in the circle of the musketeers to win in one night three thousand pistoles   137.0367320035021
he passed one leg over the wall and in a moment leaped down on the other side   127.45207241221334
noirtier raised his eyes to heaven as a gambler does who stakes his all on one stroke   123.15512742568846
the cardinal was acquainted with the activity and more particularly the hatred of buckingham   182.81269129021877
thirty francs   38.329825941731855
30157m i own that your question embarrasses me valentine for i can not say that the count has rendered me any ostensible service   182.76840404751042
not in the least since there is no danger that anyone can possibly understand what we are saying   96.97775480882542
said the queen to aramis   142.20794689354693
to his friends m   63.764943909787625
yes said aramis through an infamous act of treason   170.62699280600373
still i hesitated to wake him although i fancied that his face was flushed and that the veins of his temples throbbed more violently than usual   65.16439641039575
but it was very late   22.143685785605896
dear du vallon does one forget the happiest days of flowery youth one s dearest friends the dangers we have dared together   166.65959247973697
it is what i have just reproached you for   200.29870948442755
and everything considered it is our lot to risk our lives   121.70081889020426
and you have done well to conform in everything to the wishes of my friend sinbad   90.19467164653794
d artagnan looked at porthos   78.59165948377942
was haled by a strong guard before the high court which was to judge him   132.08698159868237
however those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occurred it was not to the vessel herself for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled the anchor a cockbill the jib boom guys already eased off and standing by the side of the pilot who was steering the pharaon towards the narrow entrance of the inner port was a young man who with activity and vigilant eye watched every motion of the ship and repeated each direction of the pilot   125.23139735499603
i shall not leave so near the queen that source of discord with which the deceased cardinal so often caused the anger of the king to rage above the boiling point   90.40444434885288
said d artagnan whose ears chafed terribly under the repetition of this word coiners   122.40635511246495
he dressed in the picturesque costume worn upon grand occasions by the inhabitants of the south of france bearing equal resemblance to the style adopted both by the catalans and andalusians   91.4897581863554
the crisis seemed past a low moaning was heard and he raised himself on one knee   40.407633256987125
cried he on perceiving d artagnan ah   41.696063933489455
my horse was killed this morning my lord and i am mounted provisionally on my lackey s   122.14244580558706
but either i was deceived or hell has resuscitated you   38.44843421094153
the blow was parried   123.74510003790598
and yet said d artagnan laughing it appears to me that from time to time you must make sorties   135.99318173486816
my lord duke tis the height of ingratitude   36.86743806838048
at length a slight color tinged the livid cheeks consciousness returned to the dull open eyeballs a faint sigh issued from the lips and the sufferer made a feeble effort to move   184.26953409440392
at your ball   169.98988844983313
it was here that the good old man whom you saved from death and dishonor threw himself into my arms   172.7258453952723
and you can not deny it   153.22065456133652
one takes away from him all claim to good sense another robs him of his poetry a third of his originality another of his humor another of his independence of character a sixth but good heavens   90.21072992204799
oh a day and night soon pass away   88.59028929568136
as to teresa her eyes sparkled when she thought of all the fine gowns and gay jewellery she could buy with this purse of gold   105.67710236215026
his granddaughter   141.74654740706535
well asked the president what is your decision   54.31847207448883
the furniture had been knocked over in the deadly struggle that had taken place there and the sheets to which the unfortunate jeweller had doubtless clung were dragged across the room   71.15833282391019
exclaimed villefort stepping back fearfully surely that is not the voice of the abbé busoni   155.1685480694525
you shall soon have something to drink   170.89166583141684
i have already told you it was impossible   116.3866489206956
he awaited mazarin s promised visit to get some light on his present situation   124.22364583887178
last february you were the first who told me of the haitian funds   42.10024194188509
the count soon heard andrea s voice singing a corsican song accompanied by the piano   118.4288066723889
i should think not indeed   109.95648636680346
here it is said he   140.58486101115415
in france chapter lxi   133.5695984936598
but i thought you were a catalan and they told me the catalans were not men to allow themselves to be supplanted by a rival   112.10383344272572
felton listened to this dialogue without speaking a word   68.49080997119819
you have either been working for me or thinking of me   108.1077242036091
oh indeed indeed sir he is innocent   81.43045217597653
what has happened to you today to raise all these melancholy ideas   92.37181003659911
do not forget this evening do not forget that promise   67.8452028345601
cried raoul   109.05334248892365
valentine uttered a cry of horror   165.77415171221884
exactly so said the young men   179.6574105759501
you have not played for a long time i said   130.940884967601
bonacieux shrugging her shoulders   99.6334460347514
well next some day you will be robbed   92.55961782372236
but she has not died of old age but of grief   91.46782851677914
instead of returning the ball to me when i call for it from the top of the wall he throws me another   106.78813975693177
is it from thee   87.28865542606604
why does my lord belonging to the church now receive me in the dress of an officer with a sword at his side and spurs to his boots   100.86475335505327
as for aramis he went off to the bishop s palace to see if he could possibly pass in with juxon to the king s presence   94.54096527836164
he rose gently so that his head was just above the round of the barrel and under the large hat he recognized the pale face of mordaunt   166.45507160738595
he was not insensible to such a proof of courage   156.7104445935732
i can not tell you how long we remained in this state   125.53378684095286
no i have never injured her   70.323965010246
and what did he say to you   169.96088823440184
then you have but one hope   139.91734502365165
the bandit s laws are positive   111.50928373847668
and andrea gliding through the court like a black shadow rushed out through the wicket leaving his comrades and even the keeper lost in wonder   90.0843009135001
he is not at home and i will carry away the key after having placed you in his apartment   73.43281488011499
d artagnan replied   120.39384001429858
to dispute over their evening game of chess upon the merits of their servants   139.92361683854165
athos reflected for an instant   151.70992365934245
was going when he was assassinated   211.87169651330615
i was hidden behind that door he said which leads into the next house which i have rented   112.80421586918891
but he was ever on the watch for it and he faithfully promised himself that he would not fail to seize it by its three hairs whenever it came within reach of his hand   174.8775064578216
the unknown waited for silence and then resumed i told you well that she would know me   107.06477087385515
a dull gloomy silence like that which precedes some awful phenomenon of nature pervaded the assembly who shuddered in dismay   118.30631273785721
and by your exclamation i perceive you have mistaken me for another and pardon you   136.83527466148277
they knew full well that this fugitive must be a bandit   20.42102864522657
he spoke elegantly although i thought from his accent he was an englishman   133.98182647584792
he signified assent   144.70262814984434
you think of everything said d artagnan   167.83586403480479
i have told you that i am prepared for anything   152.66777998365032
the poor girl almost fainted at hearing these words   121.6320877616269
i will leave you the torch sir   120.22337848623636
the cardinal has a weakness for these men which i can not comprehend   222.96039021594274
and do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning   118.13872155284615
and inquired dantès with some hesitation do you know how my father is   161.7164973635503
he stiffened in the last convulsions of death and expired   69.74235592631756
said d artagnan to himself and darted into the passage   83.5213368050758
it was the fever that disturbed you madame said villefort   196.84488996982597
but the favor of the queen was at the present time an additional cause of persecution and her protection as it was known protected badly as witness chalais and mme   140.28412565738512
for life replied porthos in the same manner   177.10814391248232
he gave orders that he should be informed as soon as madame danglars appeared   147.7806936306669
haydée answered with a heartrending expression why should he understand this my sister   195.09411837994864
yes but with a jovial partner and dice and guineas clinking on the cloth the night passes like a dream   104.49753391062633
athos assisted by porthos who lifted him up like a feather arrived at the top   79.5972277782566
at eccuis the same scene was repeated   129.64343367882793
ah said valentine in a mournful tone do let me see this man maximilian   53.85381549104874
they were kneeling on the lowest of the marble steps and in that manner intended making a rampart of the three others in case of pursuit   137.58435763822592
where is your wife in the first place   156.04682888430295
remember that in a quarter of an hour you will be safe   150.7612879332337
but at the same time the intonation was so soft that however strange the speech might seem it was impossible to be offended at it   156.32584402214357
good evening valentine said a well known voice   175.36784842102213
danglars was disagreeable certainly but i know how much you care for his ill humor   7.032212468655871
then he rang   68.14588527120978
my mother uttered a cry of joy and clasped me to her bosom   106.36699669063448
as an italian he is superstitious   58.834686559945816
you formerly lived i believe in the allées de meilhan on the fourth floor   108.98389180167682
how are they called who follow others in spite of them   19.191603146674424
three compartments divided the coffer   138.23041583435725
they glided from tree to tree till they arrived at twenty steps from the house unperceived and saw by means of a lantern suspended under a hut four fine horses   154.89528511644298
exclaimed raoul recognizing the young man as having seen him in the rue cocatrix spare him   98.01899178291258
these words were lost in the noise which the carriage made in rolling over the pavement of la villette   138.80839409562896
it is more difficult than i thought   125.59593644672155
but i don t know him said the countess   60.10645419720145
in italy sinbad the sailor   163.12981059954626
no he muttered the doubt i felt was but the commencement of forgetfulness   164.30764875899104
or mme   169.52737916000038
but why do you ask that   134.93542304853617
said andrea disappointed   112.00616355748143
i am indeed rejoiced said andrea   146.58816175166447
at that very moment grimaud drew back the cloak which hid the aperture and came in with his face livid his eyes staring wide open with terror so that the pupils were contracted almost to nothing with a large circle of white around them   101.99007520376766
endure nothing from anyone except monsieur the cardinal and the king   171.38321667325573
everything relating to this young man is true   155.87798805270282
i do not ask you for liberty as a guilty one would nor for vengeance as would a pagan   108.50389016371597
they are firing at the corpses replied athos   126.49558542389133
then whilst he fires make your horse rear   106.25971347051107
but i see you have other strings to your bow   118.24542565928931
d artagnan went out first as had been agreed upon   146.91234550830518
ah sir replied caderousse we can not console those who will not be consoled and he was one of these   97.97594729183812
they arrived at the drinking room of the parpaillot   70.29207740543964
well you guard the exterior and if he attempts to fly fire upon him   152.0387475150705
and you obeyed   222.68866246036202
very well show him to me   109.40797498670985
morrel had looked carelessly around and had probably noticed nothing   71.61868552423184
oh no said porthos it does not exceed two thousand five hundred livres   196.79639160232097
monte cristo ran down the steps and advancing towards the spot designated beheld villefort encircled by his servants with a spade in his hand and digging the earth with fury   133.17130722991354
patrick who knew lord de winter was in affairs of the service and in relations of friendship with the duke gave the preference to the one who came in his name   94.21538781176478
and when you have found you will tell me will you not   106.14540399038293
de buckingham will be prevented from setting out by some great event   141.66122882656538
the minister s wife pardieu   95.86193237865277
by the same sign which at the same time tells my right hand correspondent that i am ready while it gives notice to my left hand correspondent to prepare in his turn   88.41576797898789
well now she said let us see what you would do to prove this love of which you speak   121.78760822294669
do you see this firman   114.1933082424247
if i give you time   58.78534881347511
we were beginning to grow impatient said athos   145.5152984937506
which implies that we may die of hunger said aramis   98.26098816180813
i repeat it you must really be a very strange and superior man for my mother is so absorbed by the interest you have excited that when i am with her she speaks of no one else   166.6252482518444
he was a foreigner   45.65465439934445
the night was cold and still   92.97435968240404
the young man recollected his promise and was silent   168.77816977549344
musketeers   176.48001375115
i also know that her name is valentine and i have already prayed for her   134.55786843305108
5 scott of course the son of an ill fated sire and the father of a yet more unfortunate family bore in his looks that cast of inauspicious melancholy by which the physiognomists of that time pretended to distinguish those who were predestined to a violent and unhappy death   48.5500478814201
i am sure you would not have forced me to come   128.15579124302903
my dear friend we must take people as we find them   73.2676541395941
i know your prosperity is great you rascal   167.4884791767723
cried dantès his eyes sparkling with animation   180.29302000392485
it is a long time since we have had a battle eh porthos   80.13986697030873
the doctor pressed valentine s hand and while he visited her grandmother she descended the steps   135.2394404292062
pardieu if that is all i am hungry too   55.765847335483976
you have no right to beg at night said the groom endeavoring to rid his master of the troublesome intruder   44.74328825861488
felton obeyed   52.92851609226996
perhaps you did not know it   123.8916342936482
then arrive a crowd of policemen and constables   130.49570556175556
and when did he set out   68.4076247840164
it would be a still worse affair for mazarin whom he execrated for the greater offences he had committed   114.97320578668301
penelon put his hand over his eyes and then stared at the man who thus criticized the manœuvres of his captain   139.09843778400753
the day after tomorrow it will return signed by his hand and marked with his seal   169.65357916283364
exclaimed de winter seizing the arm of athos   145.38307715328304
he is right thought athos   62.659329217370356
as to the servant she had run away at the moment of her master s arrest   157.12345628924479
let us talk of your happy return my boy   116.91812121427424
will he be at home at eight o clock this evening   180.43377748350338
all cried together   109.46921033661111
this order to heat the irons made dantès shudder   159.97006406864918
besides his presenting you the cup under the name of lord ruthven oh but that is dreadful   49.59534226377184
indeed i think provincial air will suit us much better just now than the air of paris   140.41257282426534
i also looked at him   127.35774632432214
another souvenir of monsieur mordaunt   140.8337320044496
you see monsieur that you say it again   112.12093506141204
well what is there surprising in that   58.75708057398224
then he carried haydée to her room resigned her to the care of her attendants and returning to his study which he shut quickly this time he again copied the destroyed will   137.50894905190484
d avrigny returned with his associate   62.46505864279668
said he reasoning to himself according to the strangely easy morality of that gallant period there is one who will be equipped in good time   117.34756710422558
the wounded man sank upon his knees to again kiss the feet of his preserver   111.29336679732137
it will only cost you a discount of 5 000 or 6 000 francs   59.753315435122396
luigi and teresa again set forward   158.272330290144
know you again   69.19344002808376
probabilities are deceptive   23.710376700352867
because tomorrow haydée you will be free   103.3376200465649
d avrigny followed the invalid wrote a prescription ordered villefort to take a cabriolet go in person to a chemist s to get the prescribed medicine bring it himself and wait for him in his daughter s room   70.44093463733847
the count arose and unlocking a closet with a key suspended from his gold chain took from it a little silver casket beautifully carved and chased the corners of which represented four bending figures similar to the caryatides the forms of women symbols of the angels aspiring to heaven   96.26597006704088
de jussac turned the corner of the convent   45.35319413724751
keep back my lord said d artagnan   37.2312279217153
the position in which he had left him was critical   161.93619497736785
the morbleus the sang dieus the morts touts les diables crossed one another in the air   46.350169424692766
cæsar s commentaries said the bandit it is my favorite work   163.85220005612456
well that is all that i wanted and i will be guided by a counsellor such as you are said he extending his hand to monte cristo   132.54756008572352
i am d artagnan   91.88712265337256
ah stop   133.54541432327164
if you refuse me if you ask another for what i have a right to offer you i will say it is ungenerous of you to refuse the life of your mother at the hands of a man whose father was allowed by your father to die in all the horrors of poverty and despair   81.84664243444102
numberless groups paraded the streets and whatever d artagnan might think of it it was obvious that the citizens had for the night laid aside their usual forbearance in order to assume a warlike aspect   63.318210770079126
but when out of sight he turned his horse to the right made a circuit and came back within twenty paces of a high hedge to watch the passage of the little troop   22.94651802444973
d artagnan knew it was considered disobliging by an englishman to refuse to pledge him   155.70083767528132
the sentiments you air are certainly fine so fine that they are superhuman   183.87965600895245
the next morning therefore when broussel made his entrance into paris in a large carriage having his son louvieres at his side and friquet behind the vehicle the people threw themselves in his way and cries of long live broussel   62.3073426387941
how was it that a presentiment did not warn mercédès that her lover was within three hundred yards of her   58.901748355092025
at length a fresh discharge was heard and this time the balls came rattling among the stones around the four friends and whistling sharply in their ears   30.231143638994
command me   84.54171427003891
it was a good augury   139.74083907193233
yes yes that is he   85.91452307450741
he remained scarcely a man   156.23200943576308
that two executions of considerable interest will take place the day after tomorrow at two o clock as is customary at rome at the commencement of all great festivals   99.98783713379677
alas my friends replied m   120.99133537405868
i have arranged two plans   71.306745475778
she was dressed that is to say in dishabille wrapped in a long warm dressing gown   159.25250126016306
and cooks   129.92891861795147
will they not sign it   89.04263765115067
now said she listen to me   11.705229669237312
he had a haughty bearing a look either steady and impenetrable or insolently piercing and inquisitorial   58.7331645196204
do not be alarmed maximilian   220.0891228035925
the minutes passed   87.08843701341755
but my wife wants a gold chain and i want a pair of silver buckles   51.722348094445096
the men themselves were almost dead with fatigue but hope supported them   69.96913871526931
where are you come from sir   139.98148536454082
ah said cavalcanti to himself if i only had that britzka those two good post horses and above all the passport that carries them on   101.65678508819308
it is some time since we heard from his mistress said athos in a low voice   230.52730678089893
they seemed to understand each other so well said monte cristo with renewed energy   141.93778052678346
smugglers are not thieves   81.09610706745474
and where cabbages carrots radishes peas and melons had once flourished a scanty crop of lucern alone bore evidence of its being deemed worthy of cultivation   148.68863693635856
and athos bowing retired and remained leaning against the mantelpiece a spectator of the scene   74.46402483050957
but the clerks were not the dupes of this deceit and their lugubrious looks settled down into resigned countenances   35.77759582754027
stammered danglars   103.09326517689094
then when the officer was gone he sat down in the arm chair opposite the president and struck his boots with a little cane which he carried in his hand   102.48159724243824
here it would be dangerous   132.97585720915114
if you pass before a house which is being built look up for fear a stone should fall upon your head   158.39193737436926
monte cristo smiled with satisfaction   45.43788233270021
you have a friend monsieur du vallon whom i like much   73.04115983180526
absolution   143.0815857296178
those barrels i saw through the door   113.74049901452571
i can not recollect whether it was by steel or by poison   70.44110715252742
we will recommend you to him   116.57627456632031
this was in fact the worst complaint of louis xiii   68.96328538282981
on the summit of a rising ground a little in advance of the enemy appeared a short and heavy looking man   90.8735891638658
give my compliments to your illustrious luccanese cavalcante of the cavalcanti   158.99123563830764
morrel had fully anticipated and which cocles paid as punctually as the bills which the shipowner had accepted   120.38993754714396
an abdication   124.10328444375813
morbleu said athos as soon as they were again in motion reduced to two masters and grimaud and planchet   84.94916197874082
let me kill him   99.914812177646
this was the chance at which m   60.40892575382813
when you travel it is to see everything   86.06456077679738
then going around the house i placed grimaud at the other exit and here i am   63.7392577739589
mistrust everything in short even your own shadow   21.172913831644294
there were moments when looking at grimaud the duke asked himself if he was not dreaming and if that marble figure was really at his service and would grow animated when the moment came for action   144.08392404084557
danglars remained prostrate while the count withdrew   12.735531416142848
madame de saint méran has arrived and her husband is dead   130.09531696570616
why this woman was a monster   109.86712461103649
do not try my lord you can not guess who it is   123.87650375012049
so sir you wish to see all relating to the poor abbé who really was gentleness itself   51.93270922893838
d épinay can have displeased your father more than any other person   141.12793485619875
what is it you edmond back again   169.3522875145481
jewels diamonds gems   38.2852622849891
this however was nothing to a sculptor like vampa   107.805865991094
and it was not the magistrate slave to his duties but the friend the loyal friend who roughly but firmly cut into the very core of the corruption   83.5895279708106
replied eugénie with her usual candor   90.08662681175912
my lord said comminges i answered that to compose a ligue only one ingredient was wanting in my opinion an essential one a duc de guise   149.36317936875477
president how entirely you have read my thoughts said benedetto in his softest voice and most polite manner   138.63338581632203
broussel s son was there still furious and still bearing bloody marks of his struggle with the king s officers   143.60361016787022
while his wife was speaking villefort had narrowly watched the old man s countenance   45.79850760525795
well you see my dear d artagnan with what ill luck i play replied porthos with the most careless air in the world   145.09659160759895
why just think for a moment   115.17148361778047
i wrote to her to send me fifty louis or so of which i stood absolutely in need on account of my accident   27.842896247270218
be easy on that head replied athos   143.83984639470992
this pretended d artagnan was he not an emissary of the cardinal whom the cardinal sought to introduce into tréville s house to place near him to win his confidence and afterward to ruin him as had been done in a thousand other instances   124.29932361079209
polish up or make some one else polish my arms   110.7263796300857
do you expect news from him   75.19832217523415
because the person who is now in the gallery prefers being alone and never practices in the presence of anyone   83.05088187927419
de tréville what has become of your three companions   154.93053201752372
what fine words he uses   134.12239774513563
upon my word said caderousse from whose mind the friendly treatment of dantès united with the effect of the excellent wine he had partaken of had effaced every feeling of envy or jealousy at dantès good fortune upon my word dantès is a downright good fellow and when i see him sitting there beside his pretty wife that is so soon to be   86.94760894723629
but first of all athos begged that he might go to the hotel du grand charlemagne to see raoul   90.42920618254149
a piece of biscuit and a small quantity of rum formed his supper and he snatched a few hours sleep lying over the mouth of the cave   2.285763036187234
besides this he had seen as he called it all the remarkable sights at rome   63.550900214428154
franz added that his companion deeply grieved at having been prevented the honor of being presented to the countess during her sojourn in paris was most anxious to make up for it and had requested him franz to remedy the past misfortune by conducting him to her box and concluded by asking pardon for his presumption in having taken it upon himself to do so   161.23129807151335
and the house awakened from its long sleep like the sleeping beauty in the wood lived sang and bloomed like the houses we have long cherished and in which when we are forced to leave them we leave a part of our souls   98.14220277334934
it was expected by everybody that the campaign would be a severe one   77.47363695033351
upon my word monsieur said danglars with affected carelessness i attach no sort of value to such empty distinctions   36.77240081392766
but this not being so easily plucked as the orange tree pricked him dreadfully   135.21707520629448
the countess de winter as they rode along the duke endeavored to draw from d artagnan not all that had happened but what d artagnan himself knew   78.91096063304431
that s the advice i was about to give monsieur   94.4191058211672
do you insist on this retractation so far as to kill me if i do not make it although i have repeated more than once and affirmed on my honor that i was ignorant of the thing with which you charge me and although i still declare that it is impossible for anyone but you to recognize the count of morcerf under the name of fernand   127.87222955653105
he will allow you an income of 50 000 livres per annum during the whole time of your stay in paris   91.40741034594724
as for our two prisoners you can imagine that they are but little in the vein for conversation   60.756466791663634
a burst of laughter resounded from the other side of the ill closed door and the door reopened   83.22229789384042
20185m gentlemen said he although a companion is agreeable perfect freedom is sometimes still more agreeable   160.8646429735354
does he hate his majesty as much as he does us   74.97329747485932
do not alarm yourself my dear maximilian they understand   154.90533094078904
you will find me ready to follow you   62.26145355215236
and what did you do with this same letter while returning from porto ferrajo to the vessel   55.053332917443115
just so lucien returned morcerf   113.99948476435213
de saint méran like his own could be vastly increased and the marriage be still more suitable   10.509907416084388
for seeing that i hate drinking by myself you shall drink with me   109.95254629259955
in fact said one of the guards who had remained in the chamber and had been kept awake by a toothache brought on by the dampness of the atmosphere my lord has had a very restless night and two or three times while dreaming he called for help   119.60606117869283
this latter party was composed of ill looking fellows who resembled bandits more than anything else   167.77727053410138
he still doubts thought milady   71.70268331968555
ali brought the box to his master who examined the weapons with a solicitude very natural to a man who is about to intrust his life to a little powder and shot   76.99238700750175
seated opposite to him monte cristo watched him in the shadow and morrel saw nothing but the bright eyes of the count   158.3739001225777
come in m   151.77973018700635
i will kill thee on the honor of a gentleman   96.21950749743422
his quiet manner and the ironical expression of his countenance redoubled the mirth of the persons with whom he had been talking and who still remained at the window   113.43250366398522
if it s parry said the bishop i have nothing to fear   194.5025666536089
duty likewise on its part took a portion of that precious time which was gliding away so rapidly only they had agreed to meet once a week about one o clock at the residence of athos seeing that he in agreement with the vow he had formed did not pass over the threshold of his door   109.14401013988561
are you indisposed or have you forgotten the glances you favored me with at the ball of mme   102.0574842594491
as to planchet he thought of little or nothing but was happy as a hunting hound in his old master s company   116.19079098000998
ah you see that plan was not sure enough   160.88004435682723
tis then the devil that pursues   173.03691310566973
i do not feel remorse because had we allowed her to live she would have persisted in her work of destruction   150.60900150261466
but ere they had gone many steps they perceived a group advancing towards them composed of the betrothed pair a party of young girls in attendance on the bride by whose side walked dantès father   108.5226723137208
she pretended to be descending but in reality she was waiting for him   89.78640673336403
i prefer waiting here said the messenger with a smile   36.20756607818855
ah my dear athos i am greatly afraid i have drawn a terrible vengeance on both of us   97.78836658735459
beauchamp announced the servant   40.503175395361254
but what are they to do   130.9003728448647
athos had even gone so far as to question m   51.59973102468322
indeed it may be observed that it is usually unknown perils that inspire the greatest terror   131.8634427287231
it was half past nine o clock and the coadjutor required half an hour to go from the archbishop s palace to the tower of st   130.81889020310103
it was morrel s turn to become pale   146.88947694743482
ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the above mentioned edmond dantès who either carries the letter for paris about with him or has it at his father s abode   88.43003879873018
you do not know what felicity from heaven what joys from paradise are comprised in a moment like that   66.55128297375836
de tréville who had been accustomed to associate together   23.717996781427317
then a singular thing occurred   94.43063650678842
he sent us home in his own carriage   140.2070203602039
in the meantime said tréville seek him not if i have a right to advise you   127.58286190254937
de boville s study   140.74929797051485
a slight color mounted to his cheeks   52.8868892437043
and that house in which the plenipotentiaries are asked athos belongs to to monsieur de chanleu who commands your troops at charenton   106.64313285524595
how has this terrible past been recalled   184.78168861550935
this is the mode in which they manage these things and succeed in eastern climes where there are grave and phlegmatic persons who care very little for the questions of time in conjunctures of importance   132.27736667218306
they are perfect mother so perfect that they surpass by far all i have known in the leading aristocracy of the three proudest nobilities of europe the english the spanish and the german   67.46740256859738
i expected this letter   39.587433034929504
listen milady said the cardinal the affair is important   112.49167777419466
you love my mistress then very dearly monsieur chevalier   168.7723641202111
shall you see the king again   171.39668354225628
a good man a man holding religious office as does the abbé busoni could not condescend to deceive or play off a joke   140.33297915245655
whilst we thought you indifferent to our sorrows which you couldn t share without crime you alone among us have discovered what we were searching for in vain   111.30462782237456
they understood without speaking their organizations were so delicate and sympathetic   127.45618603282638
i think i have discovered my father   118.8259899556874
well my good friend returned the abbé in a tone that indicated utter indifference on his part you are at liberty either to speak or be silent just as you please   48.276783206551315
that is to say yes and no   109.73846172505488
be prudent athos said aramis   113.26325834973548
and have your notions changed   152.36923551155505
i should wish to keep my illusions concerning insects unimpaired   147.72318973506773
and this portrait had certain resemblances of lines with athos certain family likenesses which indicated that this great noble a knight of the order of the king was his ancestor   99.35575128115954
and those of the first floor   49.31834502214725
thereupon he returned in a lively mood to his room and sent to the swiss the things that belonged to him   106.95203284710936
planchet waited towel on arm   152.8496865240677
mademoiselle de villefort is not very fond of society and we very seldom go out said the young lady   49.3316950946685
and you have chosen this honest citizen for your steward said debray   110.20575438711343
because i judge it from the past   224.67215249557626
the count will come of that you may be satisfied   58.470959125638636
then when they had thus passed the day in building castles in the air they separated their flocks and descended from the elevation of their dreams to the reality of their humble position   69.53714081162457
oh be assured if the memory of my brother were not sacred to me you should rot in a state dungeon or satisfy the curiosity of sailors at tyburn   90.99192221851496
luckily for the rascal for i should have left him dead on the spot i assure you   129.4881033329222
pray come to my aid madame   132.02091918336134
he was particularly anxious to avoid marring the freshness of the magnificent baldric we are acquainted with   116.29731493032082
another time at my own house in the country in my château at when i had a château   163.03385831685674
age produces good sense and as i doubt not but that your master is on the road to salvation i want you to tell me where he is that he may help me to mine   21.86030012271509
to leave you   210.81077121111935
what i do care for now is to make my way into the jesuits convent   118.62975427429592
villefort pronounced these words with an accent which would have made the count shudder had he heard him   90.27317735499676
might it not have been the cardinal himself who had first traced them in order that they might serve as a guide for his nephew in the event of a catastrophe which he could not foresee would have been so complete   105.97524011567464
with this key i open the abyss   52.64142989432693
what think you danglars said one of the party turning towards him of this event   126.75626366652713
why she did not know but yet she did not the less feel that these reproaches were merited   62.932961061339356
and the scotch   94.23424663640427
but remarked madame de villefort all these circumstances which you link thus to one another may be broken by the least accident   90.00028459388594
the journey had seemed very long to dantès but monte cristo found it equally short   105.89384610207924
yes honest i can certainly say that much for myself continued the innkeeper fairly sustaining the scrutiny of the abbé s gaze   103.12398032184231
he followed a short distance close under the wall then crossed a path hid entered a clump of trees   24.30349982746131
noirtier again closed his eyes   86.51360746767813
my dear aramis said d artagnan if these are the prunes that are sent to you from tours i beg you will make my compliments to the gardener who gathers them   71.1585650240028
since you now know my face i wish to be remembered alone through the affection i hope you will grant me   135.41912188246604
child   147.1253242935093
the apparition chapter 101   129.29888571652648
d artagnan and porthos were now alone with a man who held by the bridles two horses   73.46726307916711
the secret cave chapter 25   92.27309027322607
at this challenge vampa rose quickly drawing at the same moment a pistol from his girdle   117.10733061539808
at his announcement d artagnan felt himself tremble to the very marrow of his bones   47.361472450699026
it is frightful murmured mazarin   240.11920652319287
he was wrapped in a large rough cape which concealed his form and partly his face   180.3549966165524
myself excepted and again mazarin smiled   175.27392211602097
then turning towards ali he said let all the horses in my stables be led before the windows of your young lady that she may select those she prefers for her carriage   122.52635595123297
then you must die replied the president calmly   144.4231289980465
two musketeers were pacing the court to whom d artagnan called by their names   144.02530391387236
consider maillard said the curate that i have recommended you to this gentleman who is a powerful lord and that i have made myself responsible for you   168.09544086806977
very well said d artagnan i shall discover them   78.84990270474255
profession artist   137.90268132716366
merely the 5 000 000 you have about you   150.5008267012297
in another week you will have left beaucaire remarked caderousse for the fair ends in a few days   142.74646069240316
the baron was to sign first then the representative of m   111.68065478503416
oh the deuce   172.35216860442847
de tréville and permitted him to distribute furloughs for four days on condition that the favored parties should not appear in any public place under penalty of the bastille   97.90942460929139
do you know that   137.2276278969663
you are my friend today   106.31884854649746
brave as they appeared to be the two english gentlemen looked at each other hesitatingly   64.26805949323649
and touching his horse with the spur he cantered back to paris   161.53887189885398
penelon nearly swallowed his quid   150.94237784437456
if a king he lost   95.19674436194056
signor pastrini interpreted the question and answer and the horses galloped off   84.15202421804203
at this sight franz felt the perspiration start forth upon his brow   99.7798007086345
asked d artagnan eagerly   115.92958455685334
both entered and found themselves in darkness   134.56809535179482
suppose he is dead and that this property now belongs to some one who bears his name   95.2512998897459
therefore i warn you and listen well to my words that they may be engraved upon your memory never to be forgotten this murder which has robbed me of everything this murder which has deprived me of my name this murder which has impoverished me this murder which has made me corrupt wicked implacable i shall summon you to account for it first and then those who were your accomplices when i discover them   77.93627609425354
that happens just lucky your excellency   91.31687268513852
you are the king of lackeys   131.16144372999673
now that way of joining them is not very attractive to me i confess   113.97940624384375
my friend replied porthos i leave fishing to mousqueton it is a vulgar pleasure but i shoot sometimes   116.88699836493058
oh the scoundrels   141.322720934962
that voice also was known to grimaud   88.95349326917534
the cardinal   155.71909647314527
said andrea throwing himself into a chair in a manner which implied that he would rather have flung it at the head of his host   133.586632839078
the young girl herself generally passed her time in the chamber at the farther end of her apartments   136.78931338399252
it is because at your theatres by what at least i could judge by reading the pieces they play they see persons swallow the contents of a phial or suck the button of a ring and fall dead instantly   160.94958892091736
what have i to do with politics   162.33464413171922
grimaud shook his head negatively   193.39773490987002
why you said answered mademoiselle danglars that you would be condemned to die like the worst criminals   143.28013503958948
all at once in a narrow pass they perceived that the road was partially barricaded by an enormous stone   141.3942744856613
the one was ali who smiling with an expression of the most sincere joy seemed amply repaid by a mere look from monte cristo   87.81724084559758
pardon me my friend if i disturb you said the man with the red handkerchief but i want to speak to you   135.2356365050936
a moment after those who surprised by this tumult had gone to their windows to learn the cause of it saw the door open and four men clothed in black not come out of it but fly like so many frightened crows leaving on the ground and on the corners of the furniture feathers from their wings   119.03921311351571
said d artagnan aloud   168.9136353034561
i know that i ought never to name the persons who answer my questions answered the child for if i do i shall learn nothing further   159.08537168143368
it is certainly the king said the man rising again   160.8021842291244
as to the second vessel we will tell hereafter whom it carried and how it set sail   129.4774783819043
courage take courage my dear mother   61.05872315190913
you know anne of austria   123.41453349039502
the tie is even more direct it seems to me   79.61471381800513
i see an abbé cuffing a man then bowing to a woman   40.61627919784654
but at the same time you are one of the most mysterious women   116.56753852612928
the sergeant saw that d artagnan was in earnest   215.26989968000373
but though he held the cardinal s promises as of little worth he affected to be completely satisfied for he was unwilling to discourage porthos   143.34717159060904
monsieur your friend pardon for not calling him by the honorable name which no doubt he bears but we do not know that name monsieur your friend having disabled two men with his pistols retreated fighting with his sword with which he disabled one of my men and stunned me with a blow of the flat side of it   73.33855303288598
exclaimed the queen frowning   124.75225804511516
you look careworn   128.85180411065284
by all means replied the governor and he signed to the turnkey to open the door   167.7064292937119
i never meddle in intrigues and if i occasionally become a confidant of the intrigues of others i am sure your eminence will approve of my keeping them secret   199.21268005642054
this mass of rock like the giant adamastor rose dead ahead a formidable barrier and intercepting the light that gilded its massive peaks so that the voyagers were in shadow   89.4044723647483
for their ears closely applied to the door did not lose a syllable of what he said while their mouths repeated as he went on the insulting expressions of the captain to all the people in the antechamber   116.36903055521945
felton was hers   96.50611427036104
you do not know him   131.8631393173422
we will try   148.8013940450695
give your orders and we will execute them   191.44213214049506
i took him to the rue payenne to exactly the same spot where a year before at the very same hour he had paid me the compliment i have related to you   107.5722007432091
i feel a general uneasiness that is all   145.42085087091783
madame danglars asked me for letters of recommendation for the impresari   80.81320617545177
you know about it   112.42831202509953
he immediately ran in the direction of portsmouth which he saw at nearly half a league before him standing out in the haze of the morning with its houses and towers   109.79220874544183
30239m nothing answered the baroness   76.71970884167715
my funds are deposited there and you can understand that if i draw out ten millions on the same day it will appear rather strange to the governor   145.95213452203313
the house in which you are shall not be a very hard prison and we will do all in our power to make you cherish your captivity   74.45904370949313
the wounded man heaved a sigh   225.22856040661043
ah truly   121.59015286569876
no i confess it   145.50621912821197
and taking up grimaud and blaisois they went on foot to the rue guenegaud   58.915775129487606
by the female side i believe   169.4452657051192
will you take charge of our invitation to messieurs cavalcanti   148.44826424658754
you have guessed it answered aramis   116.0116128880581
do you still wish to dispose of all   72.12693218246753
morrel rose and advanced to the door   43.99537877148492
no i really can not   73.49604047497478
chapter 97   100.89376451853047
paradise is at noisy le sec upon the site of the archbishop s chateau   86.74000779446297
he is a charming fellow i allow when his news is correct   118.9003995501496
are they spanish haitian or neapolitan bonds   83.03604079938411
said athos who never used thee and thou but upon very particular occasions what has happened   126.65141718604032
bonacieux was going   142.17206782508376
let him enter cried d artagnan   97.70578980979798
pardon me sir replied the valet   76.89515452660322
what will you do in a foreign land an enemy s country   138.48451591017403
does he wish to be a bishop   87.87163189271006
i think you are wrongly informed and know positively that on the contrary it is very fine weather in that direction   92.06717377629872
bertuccio sighed and went on first   129.7949584540719
but i should think the other must be dead i hanged her so effectually   169.51392779042766
de tréville s courtiers and this his first appearance in that place he was at length noticed and somebody came and asked him what he wanted   63.432487099669814
yes said mazarin as women suffer in avenging themselves   118.65509631448347
as for d artagnan he immediately repaired to the cabaret of the pomme de pin where he found porthos and aramis awaiting him   113.09431489257022
oh no replied monte cristo   155.1653908364738
but i was unable to accept your invitation having promised to accompany my mother to a german concert given by the baroness of château renaud   59.7512692765316
i am going to the queen   122.30955339508611
at the name of the count de guiche a blush spread over the cheeks of the young princess and the queen glanced at her with some degree of severity   75.94984948474385
this idea while darkening his brow drew several sighs from him and caused him to formulate to himself a few vows of vengeance   85.35701559798315
the few lines which had irritated him were certainly intended as an insult   130.43100552490077
here said the prince handing him a purse here is for rocroy   119.23690974218802
but said mazarin you did not make so many difficulties with regard to the king and queen   153.5980233860959
he was superintending the grooming of his horse and smoking his cigar at the entrance of the garden when the count s carriage stopped at the gate   85.22454868425575
have pity on me then and ask for me not intelligence but a trial   103.1307997137864
he attacked this wall cemented by the hand of time with his pickaxe   157.79172599368914
you are very fastidious said athos   146.69945215181525
i have been assiduous in attending church and those who formerly fled from me have become accustomed to seeing me   105.58393290200155
i will tell you mr   127.25516748165137
the messenger did not say   172.32556282026843
at the first blow the sound ceased as if by magic   164.95435414823527

the house is sold then   130.72836504107497
franz remained a moment silent and pensive hardly knowing what to think of the half kindness half cruelty with which his host related the brief narrative   181.29787430286353
it was mme   75.88246453775983

replied i allowing myself to fall and biting the carpet with rage   136.021629726223
athos and aramis took their leave but even in the ante chamber they could still hear the duke s cries   58.379859829802854

somebody replied that he was mistaken and went away   174.4469777455584
towards the close of the first act the door of a box which had been hitherto vacant was opened   173.39033861869578
the abbé s dungeon was forty or fifty feet distant from that of one of bonaparte s emissaries one of those who had contributed the most to the return of the usurper in 1815 a very resolute and very dangerous man   43.66654857854721

but in spite of all his efforts he could not refrain from uttering a deep groan which however was lost amid the noisy felicitations of the company   165.5152794890671
upon my word child   118.0975628393988
then to yours monsieur what is your name   114.65126236023127
said porthos at the sight of a pale liquid abundant but entirely free from meat on the surface of which a few crusts swam about as rare as the islands of an archipelago   107.09007105812415
that is to say he is dismissed by one half of france but by intrigues and promises he makes the other half sustain him   126.13760815755603
but said mordaunt it might have been some personal enemy of the king who had made a vow of vengeance and accomplished it in this way   141.91356232444096

the pedestrians ranged themselves against the walls   261.9491088656582
he has a royal heart and is essentially a soldier   22.50505790398428

woe to you m   85.75932893939415
joannes the jeweller   46.4643827262814
then bending as if she would have knelt and joining her hands she said with an accent of despair edmond you will not kill my son   145.81148125872838
you well know that our interests are the same   163.97774137817572
your strength will return   142.53836417324618
i have to weep over the grave of my father replied morrel in a broken voice   71.7943094805
for at that time villars cotterets was a royal residence   211.83897075879918
the clock striking eight awoke her   86.3953061303371
the cardinal bit his mustache and even his lips a little   244.892350653005
then he thought he was going to die   92.61701054909503
said d artagnan monseigneur knows very well that her majesty refuses him nothing   161.6001995058766
i want air that is all   99.52521036376568
what the devil would you have me do with that   91.09849872907351
but since then i have not heard it mentioned   161.25772711389686
oh no edmond it is myself that i blame myself that i hate   113.66757485751097
monsieur said aramis parodying jussac it would afford us great pleasure to obey your polite invitation if it depended upon ourselves   74.85227634479052
madame danglars uttered a piercing cry and seizing villefort s hands exclaimed my child was alive   100.31424347579312
said he in a jeering voice on seeing the prisoner sitting up and felton about to go out   9.174561682426912
in stuart s room   124.07434806124711
and you disinherit your granddaughter continued the notary because she has contracted an engagement contrary to your wishes   98.56474811074094
when you speak i seem to have to do with a madman   155.7658276125721
to conspire no doubt with your enemies the huguenots and the spaniards   174.3435784173255
it was her first and on what an occasion   73.31934235684173
but if i am to believe you sir the people seem to have thrown off all restraint   22.004652309395283
the next morning at nine o clock he entered franz s room followed by a tailor who had eight or ten roman peasant costumes on his arm   67.04286987648018
asked he although he knew it perfectly   97.73670897450853
then they exchange the two portions for which they each give a receipt   51.33588739599612
gentlemen said morrel reading all that passed through the minds of the witnesses to the scene i know what i am saying and you know as well as i do what i am about to say valentine has been assassinated   75.59145788029679
and now my lord will you obtain for me an audience with the queen   128.45125084204795
boisgoli let him send one of his best but not such a one as he made for la ramee   18.172045713969155
and whenever we find each other in whatever place it may be said kitty you will find me loving you as i love you today   114.61619471922783
i can sir said haydée drawing from under her veil a satin satchel highly perfumed   142.37634588748332
there was a moment s silence during which sinbad gave himself up to thoughts that seemed to occupy him incessantly even in the midst of his conversation   194.1519431507361
i don t understand you bazin   95.65069889845313
then you must know what her name was as a young girl   77.83627732310603
shall i drive you back to paris   106.9055897973039
noirtier looked at villefort with an almost sublime expression of contempt and pride   88.09524678441191
the second at the mansion of madame de chevreuse   100.78098653665897
tell him to come to me immediately if he has returned   113.24678805512927
he did his whole duty and even more at the siege of rochelle as at suze and perpignan   122.05329323696036
this fan awakened a recollection which darted through his mind like lightning   230.85599955947583
we have purchased permission to waive the usual delay   38.8917451821834
you are right d artagnan   107.12766234852153
albert led him first to his atelier which was as we have said his favorite apartment   198.08466322487484
and his predecessors   122.74280734006061
you know how much the queen loves dancing   72.24553492203938
yes madame chatillon stammered out   134.5805250509709
do you think to reassure me when you say that maximilian   82.13508183744639
he then asked with whom he played   101.0080691653958
but the duke will not yield himself without a furious battle   202.71354658028702
aramis contented himself by making a sign with his head   44.64285472993903
athos s eyes shone with joy   54.546459927422596
d artagnan no longer doubted that this was porthos s pleasant dwelling place   130.6349807415067
this evening you said   135.63819739573242
here we are at the camp   81.09506757592848
at the end of that time i shall come and say to you the assertion is false and i retract it or the assertion is true when i shall immediately draw the sword from its sheath or the pistols from the case whichever you please   93.9411012968283
d artagnan at once perceived the ground which the vindictive creature wished to reach   136.39576506607594
i hope so at least   59.1164832535115
i showed it to him   99.36413730313204
grief has stunned him replied d avrigny   149.52842967052925
his eyes rested upon the spot where had stood his bed since then removed and behind the bed the new stones indicated where the breach made by the abbé faria had been   27.583968593845654
all this happened long before you came into the country where this queen reigned   131.05064927980746
oh father i exclaimed you are very good   131.0090019843443
do not let us do things in a hurry   116.63130283536539
d artagnan could no longer endure this conversation which had made him bewildered   115.66742973360068
and d artagnan was forced to renew with the living voice the assurances which he had written   90.42809076595036
my strength is failing me   69.07052405450355
enough of this said cavalcanti   130.12766199946245
all my researches have been useless   102.88198962444322
cavalcanti to him   81.8240058628324

why do you stop here   42.175673509844344
the first sight that attracted the eyes of spada was that of his nephew in full costume and cæsar borgia paying him most marked attentions   66.54109081007057
if in the depths of the tomb there still remain something within us which can respond to the voice of those who are left on earth   156.8406114416548
if you have done nothing as yet you will do something soon replied athos   75.25141773333524
why didn t thou do as thou didst to the first man   102.2546662175447
the king made his entrance into paris on the twenty third of december of the same year   46.41524368235804
dantès took the hand of the abbé in his and affectionately pressed it   133.52109126745978
he yielded and contented himself with following morcerf   87.91125778809926
should we have the same presentiments if our existences did not touch at the heart   107.9892736218894
i am convinced that if i gave him a box on the ear such as i gave this morning to the little citizen who splashed me it would change the appearance of things   147.76558773882678
in a quarter of an hour we set off   156.11249485059992
the quick eye of albert caught the involuntary start with which his friend beheld the new arrival and turning to him he said hastily do you know the woman who has just entered that box   116.234462252446
it was there that my father ruined by the revolution and m   54.191818210211245
it was worth while truly added the young man with a melancholy smile to make war against the english for ten years and to die in his bed at last like everybody else   44.44203502764401
de tréville was the father of his soldiers   138.84402141111727
there they found a brig ready to set sail upon the deck of which they recognized mordaunt walking up and down impatiently   80.30086458691541
now in order not to presume on this and also to be beforehand with them i have if agreeable to you thought of inviting m   95.58358283887814
this woman has come back again into england for the purpose of conspiring against my life   159.35370041391718
did you think the punishment would be withheld because you are the wife of him who pronounces it   63.374753942425755
one more turn captain   57.07676642985479
i live alone   135.91513374210717
only dismount   88.38029595214041
i hasten to deposit these two objects in a safe place nor should i accept them if the resources of our ancient fortune were left to us but our estates are confiscated our ready money is exhausted and we are reduced to turn to service everything we possess   127.01339815431207

then winter took his place at the head of the first squadron and the king with athos on his right and aramis on his left at the head of the second   73.5569878812978
it was done on purpose for me i am sure of it   146.35483217350895
but his temper cooled down like his friend s   129.76732437522125
he again fainted   125.70464766288896
athos must have become an idiot by this time from drinking   125.32888435485697
in those ten minutes we shall have gained the road and the king will be saved   161.14554633685196
let us die then as de winter has died   130.30837479671226

edmond thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was without the owner knowing who he was   155.72638037124642
it is at this moment replied barrois with the same firmness that m   151.56984547399838

haul up the cable and draw the boat to us said groslow   90.3189265483179
it is a duel then   196.49767813674805
then raising his head he perceived with astonishment the number of persons present   148.34808236758786
he therefore went to bed placing his pocketbook under his pillow   132.27134851367722
oh that s nothing   129.6893837567616
for an instant it remained motionless as one of the stone decorations of the building then after a long sigh of disappointment the head disappeared   11.911542600384252
like many old houses occupied by a single family the room door was panelled with glass   153.19880344728165
the short one   51.3701910011467
in the commandments of god or of the church i don t know which   176.2046804447691
the order was executed   130.46054432807637
we are not at sartène or at corte   106.75125539661747
without answering he went out and brought in the blade of a rapier   157.94408143700238
i will give you three thousand pistoles apiece if i can have them by the day after tomorrow   166.19342109141377
the hand moved on with incredible rapidity he seemed to see its motion   109.22705703536981
but raoul was so happy that this reflection effaced everything else from the consideration of his guardian   164.51799150819426
exclaimed the latter the cardinal   193.50088563200455
his eyes burned under the blue veined lids and he tottered like a drunken man   123.03959758978644
he is as you see a very valuable animal said maximilian   113.21897867922878
the authorities were not in a condition to cope with serious revolt   130.664676215797
we hear from yanina if valentine could have seen the trembling step and agitated countenance of franz when he quitted the chamber of m   30.314895974815627

he laughs best who laughs last   49.67780268337229
dantès said i wish to die and had chosen the manner of his death and fearful of changing his mind he had taken an oath to die   157.07389932214733
besides should it be necessary monseigneur will show him how that formality may be avoided   144.10670352725035
asked lord de winter sternly   183.74769883478768
what do you say of him   111.7904052113721
it was too late for he had already drunk a glass of excellent wine placed for him expressly by the pope s butler   166.61430134223468
she loves him   105.3575623488514
as we had no doctor on board and he was so anxious to arrive at elba that he would not touch at any other port his disorder rose to such a height that at the end of the third day feeling he was dying he called me to him   163.13920511025327
and then supper sinbad hashish statues all became a dream for franz   112.71867575662412
the little troop without looking behind them or exchanging a word fled at a rapid gallop fording a little stream of which none of them knew the name and leaving on their left a town which athos declared to be durham   93.2006670082946
yes i understand that but what is the quarrel   113.5757864491144
listen my friends said the count i may call you so since we have really been friends for the last eleven years the discovery of this secret has been occasioned by a great event which you must never know   109.08229219227287

she did not invoke god we very well know but she had faith in the genius of evil that immense sovereignty which reigns in all the details of human life and by which as in the arabian fable a single pomegranate seed is sufficient to reconstruct a ruined world   163.4232434707218
he turned towards the sailor who during this dialogue had sat gravely plucking the partridges with the air of a man proud of his office and asked him how these men had landed as no vessel of any kind was visible   52.62744295795777
they were indeed two elegant horsemen with figures slight and upright noble faces bright and proud looks loyal and intelligent smiles   96.97322795592734
d artagnan made kitty promise to bring him that letter on the following morning   148.22827443337238
meanwhile what are you going to do   58.77077626798152
in twenty four hours d artagnan and porthos conducted mazarin to the queen   96.88803074922467
unfortunately there was one circumstance which created a powerful obstacle to the accomplishment of this threat   109.74416155271311
i love and esteem you because honest folks are so rare   90.85236009091336
what said the notary do you not intend making mademoiselle valentine de villefort your residuary legatee   155.35909196783547
no monsieur it is not aramis   129.81823175921866
this time i have merely come from cadiz   136.87773982726952
he had within his reach his pistols and carbine and ali standing near him held one of the small arabian hatchets whose form has not varied since the crusades   90.5744713940478
have you any suspicion of me rochefort   98.47298792030074
before he entered the merchant service had he ever served in the marines   93.66504631160323
and could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this we had better help a man who owes us nearly 300 000 francs and have those 300 000 francs at the end of three months than hasten his ruin and get only six or eight per cent of our money back again   91.54833804959512
this is a means of communication   138.945226912839
mind your own business wife replied caderousse sharply   56.378029537505
i do most decidedly   110.96189052929091
beauchamp hesitated to continue his narrative   221.63234990094588
the convent your honor is at the other end of the village   98.34484611513892
well mother i yesterday engaged myself as substitute in the spahis 25 added the young man lowering his eyes with a certain feeling of shame for even he was unconscious of the sublimity of his self abasement   146.29408853792543
oh your eminence knows him well cried milady carried away by her anger   104.88009456087968
and it is to this person i am bound to discharge my debt of gratitude   41.499129629028275
i thought replied the young girl with all the frankness of her nature that i would give half my life for a costume such as she wore   146.9317647261813
franz and albert made some difficulty alleging their fear of depriving him of it   130.84526507866016
yes madame replied the coadjutor gravely   129.94911032084556
how fine it is to be called condé and to be so worthy of such a name   95.45091256075362
at least replace the diamond in the ring said la carconte sharply   191.41706799911276
but will you be able to follow me   77.63128041853768
we owe nothing to our enemies   152.63728061263822
your family appears to be a very happy one said the count as if speaking to himself   176.20237515924526
ali reappeared   54.76123138838972
and the cardinal saw at once that he had recovered by a single blow all the ground he had lost   136.03809300808186
what though she has lost her own mother at a tender age she has had the happiness to find a second mother in madame de villefort   137.330203083861
he then took the greatcoat with the large collar which the groom had left behind in the tilbury and put it on his back   111.76275177818084
from the wounded man s room replied the host   256.1128380061496
i came to rome to see the carnival and i will though i see it on stilts   128.96348982291246

the day after tomorrow he exiles me among the infamous   134.39874803816147
and what are your feelings   127.16417988065899
he relates that he met at brussels rochefort the âme damnée of the cardinal disguised as a capuchin and that this cursed rochefort thanks to his disguise had tricked monsieur de laigues like a ninny as he is   170.49678445316852
where is he gone   19.310805220614938
as the mayor had foreseen the sight of the guards had exasperated the mob   193.93183641645703
it would be wrong to judge the actions of one period from the point of view of another   139.47231534398466
learn to know the heart of men and henceforth make yourself less easily the instrument of their unjust vengeance   67.72044525055557
and what on earth are you going to do with it   187.77489295727966
you think m   171.69470258092028
said the man in the cloak   87.41527750965204
i left with mingled feelings of sorrow and delight   87.51809557322598
a fine prize friend mordaunt   94.62062269883116
your excellency knows him   39.058116674548415
i saw him at the ministers houses   116.74210608411431
well said the count astonished at his perseverance which he could not understand and looking still more earnestly at maximilian let it begin again it is like the house of the atreidae   56.62950300838959
will they never bring that emetic   18.04191060184523
on reaching the capital athos and aramis found it in arms   32.54681065983206
again condemned to silence again face to face with nothingness   116.55486749361498
lord de winter believed all that was told him with so much the more ease that it was his interest to believe it   170.15644184116616
quick kitty quick   176.87142246521768
can he have and she stopped   48.81158423289888
but athos heeded not his advice   86.6024893003684
i don t care to be shot in a box   126.18100120511336
many small donations 1 to 5 000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the irs   27.04855828985201
in the morning as he was mounting his horse d artagnan who felt at the bottom of his heart a partiality for the duke took planchet aside   23.825688771347558
said athos pointing to mme   124.73300925634743
they were indeed admirably received by mazarin who paid them numerous compliments and announced that they were more than half on their way to obtain what they desired namely d artagnan his captaincy porthos his barony   189.6054393259259
total   186.03505562106233
but i shall probably soon make his acquaintance for i have a credit opened with him by the house of richard blount of london arstein eskeles of vienna and thomson french at rome   127.95282198880292
gondy related to them the insults he had received at the palais royal and retailed the jests of beautin the count de villeroy and marechal de la meilleraie   97.55348289772326
it was your granddaughter then was it not   155.94979330570146
0177m what is he doing there   76.2737964302807
what a splendid business that last case of yours was my dear villefort   98.0595686313426
d artagnan took the soldier s arquebus made him go on before him and urged him toward his companion by pricking him behind with his sword   155.37051872705064
my lord said d artagnan your eminence sees that we wish to act with all formality and due respect   107.57666332668974
does he wear them   44.24069215955326
call mr   139.03177051235704
to return after the death or disgrace of the cardinal perhaps   93.18287346733143
then as lord leven and the other chieftains recoiled before this unexpected rescue which seemed to come from heaven for the prince they already thought was their prisoner athos and aramis dragged the king from the perjured assembly into which he had so imprudently ventured and throwing themselves on horseback all three returned at full gallop to the royal tent   122.4155434314382
you are sure   113.32018258999292
let him accompany you   100.28392917976468
athos said d artagnan getting rid of his female garments and appearing in his shirt prepare yourself to hear an incredible an unheard of story   108.405507453965
you are right he is worth us all and we avow it to you   79.77616951060138
come in gentlemen come in called d artagnan   106.22031886611194
the servant went out   113.23601268357966
bazin has read history gentlemen he knows that sixtus the fifth became pope after having kept pigs   131.30858826881953
for it was very old and dull too   109.38472650049948
i can not endure the modern school of painting   79.88018916926643
d aguillon his mistress and mme   173.584811063598
i can not wait till tomorrow   17.88185700693751
how many have you then   29.830602603492636
your friends will be proud of you and m   111.1403431175086
and so our division is made mother said the young man affecting ease of mind   63.71435620103695
grimaud tendered twenty guineas to the captain and at nine o clock in the morning having a fair wind our frenchmen set foot on their native land   113.07765193888105
and then some fine morning he will arrest d artagnan and for fear he should feel lonely he will send us to keep him company in the bastille   111.97870279762239
d artagnan seized the hands of athos with an anguish difficult to be described   28.121829839306926
do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence   86.44197196197275
athos chose a black coat which gave him the appearance of a respectable citizen   33.2589853779633
i sold myself for more than i thought i was worth he added attempting to smile   122.54106173021789
d artagnan felt inclined for an instant to pursue master friquet but not wishing to leave raoul alone he contented himself with taking a pistol from the holster and cocking it   108.02961409332876
at once if possible nothing easier said peppino   89.90786495766278
but my affection for them is calm and tranquil in no manner resembling what i feel for you   93.52201555851177
if he comes to france will you accord him hospitality   147.88874418495232
it closed an old account   139.52600942638213
take all then take all i tell you and kill me   92.08552458924937
athos arose   80.19860970725202
but milady stopped her   98.9666255265941
and the sergeant who began to see that he was the victim of an artifice was almost in a frenzy of despair   83.74061782213394
indeed morrel saw with surprise that the men who had brought him had left without being paid or uttering a word   130.4673541329038
she was married   134.0728656744357
all at once great cries resounded in the pavilion and a woman came to the window and opened it as if to throw herself out of it   132.8225263664727
he sends me for that purpose and here i am   136.5959970478874
if it was not you it was your purveyor said d artagnan   142.34891218209913
ah to be sure i have not answered you   131.296203739791
i like a favorable reception   133.18715009295826
then patting the young girl on the head he continued haydée is very courageous and she sometimes even finds consolation in the recital of her misfortunes   119.88218973549331
i know you gentlemen said the cardinal i know you   175.6514054632001
stolen   33.83883237064232
he applied his imitative powers to everything and like giotto when young he drew on his slate sheep houses and trees   66.81433352893782
you are the notary empowered to sell the country house that i wish to purchase monsieur   116.17790922601036
he has perished by the poniard   197.18023342408486
take in the studding sails and stow the flying jib   143.6053773750255
you madame remained under the arbor   151.1832299714021
said the sailor   143.35554539186106
on the evening of the ball teresa was attired in her best her most brilliant ornaments in her hair and gayest glass beads she was in the costume of the women of frascati   90.33480247402301
i had speedy proofs that the excellent abbé was engaged in my behalf for the rigors of my imprisonment were alleviated by many trifling though acceptable indulgences and i was told that my trial was to be postponed to the assizes following those now being held   83.94577915295159
chapter 62   159.3307529664106
then among them glided like a pure ray like a christian angel in the midst of olympus one of those chaste figures those calm shadows those soft visions which seemed to veil its virgin brow before these marble wantons   124.24771398045546
let us see what this letter contains   133.43216100968885
andrea drove past the last house in the village without saying a word to his companion who smiled complacently as though well pleased to find himself travelling in so comfortable a vehicle   134.6802764760631
a pleasure boat with striped awning was going by   65.94732164178978
added he strongly interested in the route milady followed   57.208851817476564
tut tut   62.730876289654795
exclaimed the queen when the last of them had quitted the apartment you would yield to these limbs of the law these advocates   192.87514080164348
to attain such a point the blood must be heated to thirty six degrees the pulse be at least at ninety and the feelings excited beyond the ordinary limit   107.34203674449046
they went the whole length of the garden without uttering a word   173.77370835375655
d artagnan had more than once related to his friends his adventure with the stranger as well as the apparition of the beautiful foreigner to whom this man had confided some important missive   91.96340891053737
that is good to see said aramis   94.46662900630103
i will remain here rush on the first person that opens the door strangle him and then they will guillotine me   100.92211053136488
my body alone suffers as you may suppose   75.36825145164667
of the arabian nights   142.99172000029012
but where the devil do you get such horses   118.63637127305397
hold your tongue said he and let me answer   96.62175586190494
de tréville that his young compatriot having something important to communicate solicited a private audience   53.12919083644761
monsieur he carried on a trade which i have always thought satisfactory   77.63527117348204
and now in what direction did they set out   101.31205987377328
the passageway sloped in a gentle descent enlarging as they proceeded   175.48914559649575
arrived at this last hue it changed no more   94.6122645481818
the streets were crowded for it was the day of pentecost and the crowd looked in wonder at these two cavaliers   182.38836413882166
villefort thunderstruck fell upon his knees   103.78330446313734
it is with n that we have to do then   108.42914287703397
he immediately fell backward   147.17998993625932
d artagnan i am your prisoner treat me as such   88.4671550786393
there said la carconte as she placed a bottle of wine on the table supper is ready whenever you are   138.0845805020861
broussel was a thing not a name   93.07732907165416
ah continued caderousse speaking in the highly colored language of the south the world grows worse and worse   102.63467812505178
bazin appeared on the threshold dull and spiritless   86.27614896919926
you mount the step to embrace me a last time   124.94029079513528
but the latter sapiently imagined that dantès wished to conspire or attempt an escape and refused his request   76.91013237986786
cried the magistrate with an accent of horror and consternation are you still harping on that terrible idea   123.64173892706216
descending from the cab she approached the door with trembling knees and rang the bell   116.22388182763174
and mercédès raised her fine eyes to heaven with so fervent an expression of gratitude that the count fancied he saw tears in them   156.92145089676401
at last there was waterloo and morrel came no more   70.56126935685242
you made paper pens and ink   90.77459318190043
the blaze illumined the sea for a hundred paces around   151.21052947019845
this was in fact a custom familiar to him   75.67122505652694
athos and aramis were beginning to close their eyes which they half opened when their companion came in again   75.41506977069824
aramis rushed to the hotel de ville where madame de longueville was sojourning   77.1861409834905
be assured of that you poor spoiled monk you poor converted soldier who has cut his uniform out of a monk s frock   125.20968656379252
athos raised his sword   100.76388340761837
why you poor short sighted simpleton can you not guess who this noirtier was whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed   101.95642604338592
it wounded the pride of the parliament which supported by the citizens replied by declaring that cardinal mazarin was the cause of all the discontent   147.71860547433954
many attendants or apparent precautions would prevent the villain from the attempt and m   171.57401814311723
at last it became so narrow that the fugitive tried in vain to proceed   67.31101502145336
but the first lines aroused his attention   108.56715075508372
d artagnan almost leaped with joy   180.8701320720358
and at these words the musketeer in irreproachable costume belted as usual with a tolerably firm step entered the cabinet   182.10664690319956
as all this however bore some resemblance to a duel d artagnan began to recover himself little by little   140.43043130528213
it is an axiom of criminal law and consequently you understand its full application   57.01120972940059
for approaching the animals who had been got upon their legs with considerable difficulty he rubbed their foreheads and nostrils with a sponge soaked in aromatic vinegar and wiped off the sweat and foam that covered their mouths   155.29248127961733
it was in this costume and bringing back to jacopo the shirt and trousers he had lent him that edmond reappeared before the captain of the lugger who had made him tell his story over and over again before he could believe him or recognize in the neat and trim sailor the man with thick and matted beard hair tangled with seaweed and body soaking in seabrine whom he had picked up naked and nearly drowned   147.82037754510645
felton was a puritan   131.12131347087336
and d artagnan received the penetrating glance like one who had formerly sustained many a searching look very different indeed from those which were inquiringly directed on him at that instant   87.71800689860993
i thought it was understood that we should not talk of that until tomorrow   203.85101297975316
thanks murmured the invalid extending one hand   115.68853686258682
that is exactly what i want   120.90860804270633
the king then was condemned in advance   102.47334403553967
the other drank it only by accident and although barrois is dead it was noirtier whose death was wished for   75.32878938766189
that is very true   61.11316638964005
juxon   138.03218970892328
as your excellency pleases said vampa as he left the cell   186.4090761052218
i shall try in the latter case alas   13.00146184919619
you will have the more time to learn to draw it only when it ought to be used   106.39191600966494
your offer however smooths all difficulties and i have only to ask you my dear m   109.3320683314795
see my father see   100.77387007712508
raoul had been there about ten minutes during five of which he was lost in reverie when there appeared within the circle comprised in his rolling gaze a man with a rubicund face who with a napkin around his body another under his arm and a white cap upon his head approached him holding paper pen and ink in hand   125.17836284529004
that s the thing   98.37590821703787
you do not propose anything   30.698866268510102
faith my lord but indifferently   31.17701166121283
danglars have their limits   125.28467492918985
from which you must allow that one runs considerable risk in purchasing   84.12308529753858
ah yes said château renaud   103.41932669282623
it is not you who should apprise m   85.71592694385765
speak italian sir   144.7493449715493
well it is true   171.73310039813666
on the other hand as the two friends approached to enter they showed them every kind of civility thinking them deserters from the royal party and wishing to bind them to their own   132.40424146593756
all gascon as he was d artagnan could not bear alone the weight of that falsehood   168.95276068769127
oh what is the matter   79.8882631779424
are you a large party   194.27735354368505
cavalcanti three times and he took no notice of it   102.46051637213327
i can not believe such was the case   97.3741479552646
and bentivoglio who were poisoned   70.27750371645594
on the contrary her eyes sparkled with greater pleasure than usual under her ebony eyebrows   121.76584635128982
but by the holy name of the virgin i swear that no one is more devoted to your majesty than i am   179.09131103946453
then all three windows will have yellow draperies   139.73264493912006
make sure of it and if they want it have them burnished up   105.2324062167628
at the same instant the gun was fired and he heard the whistling of a ball pass over his head   21.08535705017563
he was besides charged to hang five and twenty flags taken from the lorraine party as well as from the spaniards upon the arches of notre dame   120.61804385597746
if caderousse had invented the story relative to the diamond and there existed no such person as the abbé busoni then indeed i was lost past redemption or at least my life hung upon the feeble chance of caderousse himself being apprehended and confessing the whole truth   142.540685199699
barrois said valentine shut the door and let no one come in   110.8316372171052
indeed i should expect misfortunes   109.62206091938612
the grand marshal did   97.58239413328539
this was the scene which presented itself to my view as i quitted my father after that last kiss   158.96267265752306
there s nothing to do in paris now there s no fronde   107.31211598828513
and then accompanying the glance with explanatory words that is but too just said she tenderly   167.8330420592334
ah that would indeed be infamous   142.41830902864467
my child said monte cristo coloring allow me to take back that purse   77.90805937568047
i am about perhaps to discover something here   156.28662464658186
very well cried d artagnan at last furious very well since you wish it let us leave our bones in this beggarly land where it is always cold where fine weather is a fog fog is rain and rain a deluge   122.48212323551476
but as the second turned around and placed his finger on his lips parry started back in amazement   215.9048447362639
my dear fellow i invited them to a dinner the next day replied aramis   121.00137780175142
oh that is very easily arranged   53.36762169651975
but as his occupation is sanctioned by the governor he will soon resume it   189.79692765737528
at what period can that have been   119.94073919196858
tréville understood admirably the war method of that period in which he who could not live at the expense of the enemy must live at the expense of his compatriots   149.84052158468933
if you wish i will inquire   45.16568062113207
she is going to leave her house said the steward   57.497570140950096
cried the unfortunate woman   106.76081697874368
well i will avenge you of this wretch replied d artagnan giving himself the airs of don japhet of armenia   119.09674395432137
monsieur de richelieu would have said five hundred crowns for the councillor   68.24566235302966
oh no for when i had taken out the thread i required i hemmed the edges over again   94.07411292113926
when she arrived at that letter the paralytic made her understand that she had spoken the initial letter of the thing he wanted   65.49706995425412
they jumped into the ditch and prepared to scale the breach   149.98000214145483
hearing the noise of the fight resumed the duke i fancied you had about twenty men with you so i came back with those around me tired of always running away and wishing to draw my sword in my own cause   112.9937406034394
in the street facing your window in the embrasure of that door a man wrapped in a cloak   140.36337053207743
the brigadier had put his eye to the keyhole and had discovered andrea in a posture of entreaty   53.543888290012575
bonacieux in the convent of the carmelites at béthune the trial in the isolated house and the execution on the banks of the lys   188.82038484149263
that perhaps might not be considered a large sum in paris especially said the count   79.08085868194401
with the assistance of blaisois and grimaud the friends succeeded in turning the stone over   126.73146724565134
my dear sir said château renaud allow me to tell you that you do not understand that manœuvre with the eye glass half so well as debray   100.28864923756504
one of my bitterest enemies the faithful friend of cardinal richelieu   108.57511208144614
i was as i told him resolved to die of hunger   143.239451692282
down with the officer   109.28049401567894
as to conditions you would soon see how moderate and reasonable we are   149.49577922141262
well would you believe it   124.98478259467389
at this appeal d artagnan drew kitty quietly away and slipped into the chamber   128.88578608147625
how can i if her husband fails in controlling her   152.36239082127747
and what can we do there   123.91822724877248
still the idea of seeing our dear valentine again inspired him with courage and notwithstanding his illness he would leave   170.64284830547075
let us hasten up   158.525023730256
am i or am i not the queen   73.53476023844115
had not villefort in his presence destroyed the fatal letter the only proof against him   131.70331478041072
he had advanced at first but stopped at the sight of this display of force   91.92761000269435
she ran lightly upstairs and with an aching heart entered her apartment contiguous as we know to that of eugénie   114.07591408354286
alas sir said monte cristo this spectacle is neither strange to my eye nor my thought   132.2044261992698
this is what had happened andrea had very cleverly managed to descend two thirds of the chimney but then his foot slipped and notwithstanding his endeavors he came into the room with more speed and noise than he intended   29.312004107876106
albert de morcerf to return to paris and franz d épinay to pass a fortnight at venice   130.6325053506888
let monsieur grimaud go in monsieur mouston   77.85734193692345
be so good as to show us the way and we will follow you   188.6395852622069
but it is not my fault as i shall endeavor to prove   105.42029007918264
today is the 30th   46.57282366685581
well you can throw out the draft   95.81499991844572
the duke saluted and retired   190.4985247252618
so you renounce the world then forever   111.74365297722436
at that moment a man appeared in the doorway almost as pale as those in the chamber   68.72888545618659
no sir he died of brain fever in dreadful agony   137.11377892431034
they would have an easy bargain of four isolated men   97.1051759768819
thus your crime known by two persons suspected by many will soon become public and as i told you just now you no longer speak to the husband but to the judge   165.96859336204722
but for the moment let us separate   75.17558492531548
in the name of heaven run call   106.87220711559343
the horse and cabriolet were concealed behind a small ruin where morrel had often waited   14.673947334364613
as he came within two or three hundred paces of the grotto he thought he heard a cry   105.40586685977081
well now i have an enemy much more to be dreaded by me than this little madame bonacieux   176.6119849569994
yes but they will make you then sign your declaration and confront you with him you have denounced   49.86696800321203
her temper was uncertain but she came at last to accustom herself to my little ways and understand my little wishes   144.66533785695015
cried all the brigands when they saw the chief   114.551636041857
a priest can understand a father s grief   171.77961240772177
well i will do better mercédès   125.55048317988027
you have continued your course of villany   113.864113714783
without reckoning that he dresses as nobody else can said porthos   42.912222910609415
i am sick of it my mind preys on itself   104.67486510858863
ah you see well what does that prove   52.47891205501976
ah noble fellow   138.4385324649684
commissary   25.438429296405033
well said felton only promise till you have seen me again   44.963195944958244
if i were but learned in theology i should recollect what it was he used to dispute about with the curate of montdidier and the superior of the jesuits when we were at crevecoeur   65.60016707325411
said others   63.97764655883568
monsieur you act wrongly in endeavoring to mortify me said d artagnan in whom the natural quarrelsome spirit began to speak more loudly than his pacific resolutions   78.07771026834584
my faith said d artagnan to athos you had a triumphant idea   139.05694526017598
the count of morcerf alone was ignorant of the news   131.83711496833223
he will perhaps hold me in greater esteem than the money itself seeing that i sacrifice everything in order to keep my word with him   158.24496677973707
like the gulf between me and the past there is an abyss between you edmond and the rest of mankind   135.05875572950328
determined to bear it no longer she arose and left the room   89.20762115365594
it was because you loved me was it not count   107.69927170615824
yes yes madame you must   49.442052389451206
well said athos when aramis and he were in the boat again are you beginning to be convinced that we should have done a bad turn to all these people in arresting mazarin   70.17005871801314
or if she did it was only in the same way in which i think of her   126.26141425477314
a vast crowd filled the apartments of saint germain   90.66421908993628
then he had been seized upon by danglars who with a rapid glance at the stiff necked old major and his modest son and taking into consideration the hospitality of the count made up his mind that he was in the society of some nabob come to paris to finish the worldly education of his heir   154.9235767763656
noirtier even she would have been constrained to pity him   112.77891616780805
these were his own words of that i am certain   140.49984259745634
you can not go wrong the road is bordered by trees on both sides   82.63713896127898
certainly continued danglars the sacrifice was no trifling one when the beauty of the bride is concerned   62.896781577831376
monsieur has promised me not to open his mouth about the procurator s wife and not to say a word of the wound   58.02321237063738
replied d artagnan why don t you give yourself up directly feet and hands bound to that wretch   107.14503627413183
the soldiers you believe to be dying with hunger worn out with fatigue ready to desert gather like atoms of snow about the rolling ball as it hastens onward   147.80669684462998
you accept my proposal   81.80918884197158
one of the gates began to yield   91.05208288182111
as she was coming down she thought she recognized the french officer who had been sent to constantinople and in whom my father placed so much confidence   133.84410200654975
there was a brief silence   160.96747031310815
at the other end of the town   101.69876046479712
he invited me to a hunting party on his property in the month of september 1646   130.15016235726893
but cried the bandit that is only another way of killing me   121.64306392764313
this speech was heard by porthos in the same sense as if it had still been in the year 1640 and related to the true cardinal   144.16059243808246
i am a frondist from my heart   142.157105441122
at his first coming he had not said a word of love to mercédès   155.03708631578135
hunting for the equipments the most preoccupied of the four friends was certainly d artagnan although he in his quality of guardsman would be much more easily equipped than messieurs the musketeers who were all of high rank   144.43973691377792
the parisian army had organized with the promptness characteristic of the bourgeois whenever they are moved by any sentiment whatever to disguise themselves as soldiers   170.5063213808611
only unfortunately i did not curve aright   162.33904969571824
i thank you d artagnan   133.14046400798574
confess that it is for the sake of making me talk that you invent this story and create this personage   132.3499321794792
i am condemned to witness those gentlemen every day said beauchamp   155.0729734282821
however the two culprits advanced and as they approached their faces became visible   126.28506917116955
and so much the more readily as a letter received this morning from my father summons me to paris in consequence of a treaty of marriage my dear franz do not smile i beg of you with a family of high standing and connected with the very cream of parisian society   108.0869637854974
d artagnan the elder an honor to which remember your ancient nobility gives you the right sustain worthily your name of gentleman which has been worthily borne by your ancestors for five hundred years both for your own sake and the sake of those who belong to you   134.3214094669739
0341m i understand you allowed matters to take their course that was all   69.37831933405383
we might say that was his dream   99.97398821714384
you know madame how suddenly i snatched him from those phials which he so imprudently touched   154.5580349008194
meanwhile madame danglars veiled and uneasy awaited the return of debray in the little green room seated between two baskets of flowers which she had that morning sent and which it must be confessed debray had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his absence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman   78.16451653522276
in his time they armed gentlemen not disarmed them   107.4011640920738
dantès went and cut the strongest olive tree he could find stripped off its branches inserted it in the hole and used it as a lever   109.17724494741547
i shall kneel down to pray   60.12642126107997
after having sought for a few minutes he stopped at a leaf which had several notes and compared them with the deed of sale which lay on the table and recalling his souvenirs auteuil rue de la fontaine no   58.662270481295494
villefort astonished at this reply which he by no means expected started like a soldier who feels the blow levelled at him over the armor he wears and a curl of his disdainful lip indicated that from that moment he noted in the tablets of his brain that the count of monte cristo was by no means a highly bred gentleman   52.737481513279654
dantès endeavored to renew the subject   117.16826738500458
he hopes so maximilian   141.59894099447854
we have lost a year to no purpose   117.10227316854885
i will no longer detain you m   49.60095667799544
said mazarin breathing more freely   97.50725502719266
nevertheless monsieur de tréville s company of musketeers alone can not maintain a war against the cardinal who disposes of the forces of all france and before whom the queen is without power and the king without will   181.71674968982728
eugénie ordered the porter to put down the portmanteau gave him some pieces of money and having rapped at the shutter sent him away   55.68242304549561
to himself my friend to himself   142.5770149321281
if not before louvres thirty   126.24004612629506
he is now in his fifth year of captivity   134.43309852970887
the three presents of d artagnan the elder on the first monday of the month of april 1625 the market town of meung in which the author of romance of the rose was born appeared to be in as perfect a state of revolution as if the huguenots had just made a second la rochelle of it   76.58856424420479
ah sir said he tell me what is the matter with me   22.436723240469192
she listened and she heard nothing   138.48675608132197
oh so much the better we will fire the first shot together   72.55993650235925
well sir what do you require of me and what document is it that you wish to be drawn up   72.73847656977537
we have made our calculations with spartan economy and we each require fifteen hundred livres   127.73746316347169
the monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious foundation and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground   150.93520112296977
morrel a sailor is attached to his ship but still more to his life so we did not wait to be told twice   168.52413423481153
did you ever see anything more perfect than her acting   67.33491979642969
but will you not go up   57.41810623905871
impossibility   119.6976145070446
act prudently   93.61619975500129
madame de villefort merely cried be still edward   108.00961539707998
i think he is about to leave paris   159.08924346737115
on the first story do you see there is the anteroom and the drawing room   125.08386031188108
these gentlemen are with me said winter   131.2018995178604
but exclaimed the abbé suddenly you were there yourself   126.76972880163822
i m hit in the other side   32.65315988999494
now sir i am listening go on   90.70687650128669
is it not true aramis   12.523455860683043
you have done your duty and your conscience will be at rest   91.74028998996589
bonacieux throwing herself between the combatants and seizing the swords with her hands   80.46921947264894
and why in this solemn drawing room when the study is so comfortable   140.0770004579293
the breakfast hour arrived but m   76.70506461676004
friend the cardinal although such a genius could never have done that   63.27664428442837
thanks monsieur said monte cristo   174.02714281193246
here are the august signatures of your majesty s hand   65.60189848873361
years of grief have created an abyss between those days and the present   138.58174406753525
the other day for instance when you tried to kill the turnkey   166.7162284076902
i thought that calumny was stifled or extinct   176.53909005363738
and these two mortal enemies were in as close an embrace as if they had been brothers   63.60283770455875
well then   140.61568412188404
danglars any reason   61.76853863799115
but whence did these impediments arise   76.91218331618106
cried caderousse raising himself on his elbows   77.99380027004642
there is constancy   86.12176981813646
but scarcely had he expressed his request when the unknown who remained standing before the musketeer drew back with signs of terror and refused   135.79892526593204
so that now thanks be to god we do not want as monsieur can testify for partridges rabbits carp or eels all light wholesome food suitable for the sick   81.8555439907114
at the door franz ordered the coachman to be ready at eight   80.21700194870664
porthos i doubt if you can wear it   97.25041668595357
the falsehood would then lie at my door and as i am not a gentleman i may be allowed to lie   240.11170455895203
scarcely had i finished my repast when i felt myself sink by degrees into a strange torpor   122.64737614931532
then you don t believe me   52.21723418579757
then you accept his offer   99.15047029577504
it was nearly eight o clock when they set out again   100.07398658116719
lions of roman crowns and which he   145.4901890075319
morrel does not know my name   28.127719280623126
but d artagnan confined himself to telling them that m   60.41601189375748
added d artagnan   111.27528432073827
i am for you not only a protector but a friend   179.30734957596056
the part she plays pardieu   158.51870359268983
anne blushed and buried her face in her hands   75.3960037877796
the coachman as we can well understand made no resistance   115.7871943293234
but my dear count has m   141.48771547542228
cardinal mazarin   101.76023389113801
i was mistaken said the host he s not quite dumb   82.64268541117478
it is through my grandfather s room   174.81821003146243
chastised monsieur   105.65489059739522
good thought d artagnan   161.94493277976622
they are all entirely black with the exception of a star upon the forehead   55.99392708947977
your eminence may believe added d artagnan that we would have come to meet you if we could have supposed it was monseigneur coming toward us with so few attendants   77.94977990547814
i believe if she had not been laden and i had been her master he would have bought her   109.40655360756693
was an accomplice of the duke s and escaped along with him   82.4912208361311
alas to many the path is traced by tears   170.49222704498771
the officer obeyed   103.31029660010685
when landing at portsmouth milady was an englishwoman whom the persecutions of the french drove from la rochelle   57.497776621145874
noirtier has received without any detriment to his mental faculties   165.40196037553278
still as he was the very perfection of a door keeper he made up his mind not to tell his wife   122.01589978273194
it became necessary therefore to destroy this last bulwark of calvinism a dangerous leaven with which the ferments of civil revolt and foreign war were constantly mingling   108.18942308442244
toxicology it was really the count of monte cristo who had just arrived at madame de villefort s for the purpose of returning the procureur s visit and at his name as may be easily imagined the whole house was in confusion   139.87395618218753
40212m sir replied danglars pale with anger and fear i warn you when i have the misfortune to meet with a mad dog i kill it   123.73471375867732
i have already told you father that woman under that angelic appearance had an infernal soul and when i saw her when i recalled all the evil she had done to me to you   36.05685986996269
no objection was raised but they pointed out the asylum which was situated at the upper end of the rue d enfer and after having taken the precaution of cutting the linen in two pieces so that one of the two letters which marked it was on the piece wrapped around the child while the other remained in my possession i rang the bell and fled with all speed   218.13333742459622
oh what a magnificent jewel   101.05411410990769
i play with monsieur du vallon every night   173.53469170883594
i should like however to know what this letter addressed to tréville contains   144.13880497700114
de saint méran s oldest friends and chamberlain to the comte d artois that the holy alliance purpose removing him from thence   121.37630642586046
and how is your wrist   122.2113466478398
d artagnan was known to this valet de chambre who was no other than bernouin and he had during the last six or eight months introduced the gascon a dozen times to the cardinal   120.83667235070419
light me m   57.049271339747015
he acknowledged the extreme kindness which had been shown him by the banker s family in which he had been received as a son and where besides his warmest affections had found an object on which to centre in mademoiselle danglars   151.4376571313871
who would have come to the assistance of two strangers two unknown persons   108.74023912897995
they had passed the tête de mort were now off the anse du pharo and about to double the battery   152.19981851780088
there are only fifteen feet more from the top down here and the grass is soft   18.027396751153645
but which i must impart to you monsieur for you alone can assist me in the mission i have just received from her majesty   138.20419360310484
now when i am an abbé i say as few masses as i can   141.56191810009614
he looked at albert he was as white as his shirt and mechanically cast away his cigar although he had not half smoked it   123.66609948622482
but when aramis had presented that peace to her in a true light that is to say with all its advantages   148.8179331220217
dear friend said porthos you appear to be in a somewhat better humor to day than you were yesterday   125.74079045488871
albert remained quite bewildered with all that he had seen and heard   150.53215291269922
there may be spies about   146.20362552956303
but on taking this knife felton a terrible idea occurred to me   147.8895951658021
but sir he has fled   91.93269081158206
that evening the three musketeers were informed of the honor accorded them   112.72313389233038
scarron turned his chair toward the door raoul blushed athos made a sign to aramis who went and hid himself in the enclosure of a window   123.43866449580794
that she might not appear to fail in her promise to maximilian she proposed to mademoiselle danglars that they should take a walk in the garden being anxious to show that the delay which was doubtless a cause of vexation to him was not occasioned by any neglect on her part   164.3835432801593
well we shall find their muskets their cartridges and their flasks   11.373914733348599
he told me to watch you   142.6877561695658
and now madame till i see you again   140.75063825829926
i am sure that whatever you do is well done   206.0689153819522
the queen shook her head despairingly   133.7588512474778
that is another thing he was recommended to me by a good abbé who may be deceived   71.2941571570667
i have promised to escort to the académie a greek princess of my acquaintance who has never seen your grand opera and who relies on me to conduct her thither   172.08004654928538
come count said raoul who seemed instinctively to dislike the vicinity of the augustine   83.53605374001026
fortunately he recovered   98.39457536906029
and what is this cause   50.21668501584339
now said d artagnan you wouldn t be sorry to understand the plot would you porthos   91.35005346106544
asked the groom   104.18740783984221
therefore my dear mr   88.72986918219937
but as regards poor unfortunate creatures whose only crime consists in having mixed themselves up in political intrigues why that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit   124.48068890107896
remember my words if you return home safely i shall believe god has forgiven you and i will forgive you also   90.45314625047108
porthos was resplendent with joy and pride   142.2265401276213
if they kill you english justice will be under an obligation to me for having saved it trouble   181.20895340656125
i succeeded in deciphering your name under the blood with which the letter was stained replied monte cristo amid the general outburst of amazement   200.1224300201639
and the letter he had received from the young woman and her passage along the road of chaillot like an apparition were now explained   84.32810002161492
raoul turned toward the side whence the cry had sounded and shaded his eyes from the glare of the setting sun with his hand   71.55940010327095
take this pen and paper and write what i dictate   191.58218319525105
sire sire murmured the minister for pity s approach m   87.80564786328932
it happened that on this particular night the minister s box was placed at the disposal of lucien debray who offered it to the comte de morcerf who again upon his rejection of it by mercédès sent it to danglars with an intimation that he should probably do himself the honor of joining the baroness and her daughter during the evening in the event of their accepting the box in question   126.65614461166487
there said the young man handing kitty the letter sealed   103.07930790812328
it appears so sir replied monte cristo   165.34715505412456
twenty minutes afterwards a carriage stopped at the house a lady alighted in a black or dark blue dress and always thickly veiled   118.4421074865741
this woman entered and approaching milady s bed offered her services   57.21867132796871
0141m so then he exclaimed turning pale with anger seven conjoined and allied armies overthrew that man   94.4845668542447
the epithet as may be easily understood resounded to the very bottom of d artagnan s heart   30.02838494486049
mousqueton opened his great round eyes to the utmost astonished to find in blaisois qualities for which he did not give him credit   44.25113135411617
well said interrupted château renaud   227.86672805219723
to be sure i do furiously   65.74906399529452
thank you monseigneur he said drawing back   185.34425999844493
and had started again on his journey saying that he should sleep at noyon   66.55408588002788
what shall i promise   85.34834681195858
yes indeed there it is truly said the italian looking on with astonishment   115.07579350304114
they were in the majority   115.7470310342877
my good friend as in all probability i own my present safety to that influence it would ill become me to search too closely into its source   107.04641860008061
and what was the end of this worthy man   89.8047226591422
a visitor   109.14036079638659
if you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the question i believe there is nothing to say against him and that you will be content with the way in which he has performed his duty   144.8370730498071
he found pleasure in feeling the water trickle over his burning brow and over his body agitated by feverish shudders   133.11251499414723
yes replied beauchamp   149.19788344199918
then he drew from his breast a little cross set in diamonds which like the order had been the gift of henrietta maria   187.2106570988126
that is true monsieur replied d artagnan and whether drawn by myself or another i assure you i shall always view with regret the blood of so brave a gentleman   55.61132403243298
and then there was a burst of brutal laughter   19.24682841884956
good morning emmanuel   49.474219238901426
i acknowledge myself guilty of all the young man has brought against me and from this hour hold myself under the authority of the procureur who will succeed me   134.47373153469545
30309m never   153.0695230113946
a weak obstacle is sometimes sufficient to overthrow a great design   142.63945880864227
you who love and are beloved   158.0383331948666
you raised the whole district so they told me   16.5046567918327
it was about four o clock in the afternoon when raoul arrived at compiegne   48.131504757023265
follow him said villefort to dantès   164.05868576934745
ah ha that s it is it   163.1210003310328
and your majesty has in him so firm a champion that it was he who gave jussac the terrible sword thrust which has made the cardinal so angry   165.15904792531504
what is to happen   127.7626308556963
i can not tell you monsieur   195.01616353706547
she was charming   109.75522773621525
though the lord owes them this miracle in recompense for the manner in which they supported the pretensions of the king your father   57.92952721515639
at the same time i felt inclined to learn dancing of the danseuse who acquired such a reputation in london   104.43937587567997
half past seven   160.10183402174667
the ring a token of his good will which is here   115.51804507820427
my dear dantès said he swear to perform what i am going to tell you for it is a matter of the deepest importance   102.82025234248607
madame danglars seldom allowed remarks of this kind to pass unnoticed but to the surprise of the young people she pretended not to hear it and said nothing   76.08060196832564
he would have been discovered by the beating of his heart if by any mischance the jailers had entered at that moment   87.82636254404416
and can you find him   121.39285550102844
these things always come on us more severely when they come suddenly   121.17321293878311
and her eyes gazing on vacancy indicated that she was mentally contemplating the green summit of the pindus and the blue waters of the lake of yanina which like a magic mirror seemed to reflect the sombre picture which she sketched   74.65501501490917
must you know all   102.68723819721538
by my father s tomb said he extending his hand over the head of the young girl i swear to you haydée that if any misfortune happens it will not be to me   88.4736421611733

get on it   137.19459367347736
the evening was no longer joy but delirium   164.9145154912199
by count de fuonsaldagna general beck and the archduke   106.47735780326795
then that is agreed said the king and that is all i had to say to you   128.0601478856257
there is an excellent tavern at compiègne well remembered by those who have ever been there   150.36059389952524
you understand that you are in no way obliged to go with me   95.68579868723175
morrel reddened for his own conscience was not quite clear on politics   209.1016498468216
assuredly   95.13395986376521
oh it is a proof that the lord is on our side felton replied milady   130.59470761796314
zaccone son of a shipowner of malta discoverer of a mine in thessaly now visiting paris for the first time what interest i say can he take in discovering a gloomy mysterious and useless fact like this   157.53773981437834
i indeed   111.97884738601927
this letter is not in your table nor in your secretary   54.649880987284035
i have however a wish to go and pass a day at blois   116.95496702074213
sire the kindness your majesty deigns to evince towards me is a recompense which so far surpasses my utmost ambition that i have nothing more to ask for   110.75471199487227
chapter lxxx   133.19438957485028
they told you then that m   172.54141483062278
dantès examined the various articles shown to him with the same attention that he had bestowed on the curiosities and strange tools exhibited in the shops at marseilles as the works of the savages in the south seas from whence they had been brought by the different trading vessels   106.7079191544521
but you are not the men to allow sword wounds to be inflicted upon you thus said the cardinal   192.8206171813079
cried d artagnan who was afraid of disheartening his friend by telling him that the cardinal had not breathed a word about him   185.5796062314292
porthos left the service and in the course of the following year married mme   177.49581997507516
nortier resumed villefort that what he demands is impossible   98.90844314140803
execution it was near midnight   109.65666708460107
what is now called the lower town did not then exist   95.22226543026183
during the scene of tumult andrea had turned his smiling face towards the assembly   112.69103100536897
to a convent   101.3830506882569
we had been to lucca to take in oil to leghorn for english cottons and we ran our cargo without opposition and returned home full of joy   172.10604669425942
the prophecy which the wounded man had just uttered recurred to grimaud who turned away his head   140.26737429658235
why how fast you go on father dantès   95.04860617750525
have no society no neighbors   119.83879751309873
she looked marvellously beautiful in her deep mourning dress and morrel experienced such intense delight in gazing upon her that he felt as if he could almost have dispensed with the conversation of her grandfather   87.37368058896845
disappeared said caderousse yes as the sun disappears to rise the next day with still more splendor   77.92881418904244
still he dared not to enter as they might have left some turnkey to watch the dead   102.3870195014338
explain to me how it happens that following so peaceful a business you had such warlike inclinations   71.00322296324526
then said albert this pious pilgrimage in behalf of the prisoners was your first remembrance   200.9658309987699
the general was stout and tall the president offered him the side of the railing to assist him in getting down   137.81187766261587
however as it became dark and i could no longer see i fell asleep   66.49853503743827
low born fellows   180.328122848571
whilst making this reflection chance seemed as it were to give him the lie direct   39.92976330190689
the scotch chieftains looked at each other in their turn with frowning brows   67.8321628439706
independently of every selfish wish his heart palpitated with joy when he saw that tall form and martial demeanor which recalled to him a good and brave man   120.72401470003277
he attempted to ride over those gray cloaks but the gray cloaks held their ground and the marshal retired toward the rue saint honore leaving four of his guards dead on the field of battle   82.2492372763496
you should furnish him with some of course replied monte cristo   83.24484931992535
so much the worse for her if she is found   164.51255296838914
well then it is a settled thing   89.4203320567324
you were with her then   57.7808777942159
surely the diamond was as large as a nut to be worth all that   87.83034193829945
and does she try to make you dislike me   123.43269272465774
the trees of the garden were easily seen from the steps of the street door   116.71348624570751
the master was to get all this out of leghorn free of duties and land it on the shores of corsica where certain speculators undertook to forward the cargo to france   85.49448301839806
cried he he has given us anjou wine instead of champagne and fancies we know no better   134.9739395637454
there are situations which the heart of a father or a mother can not be made to understand   147.86761022980008
poor queen already fallen   155.00051516814256
oh his name his name   124.3255797393723
at the end of an hour he heard a faint noise which increased   117.35687692037003
morrel muttered albert morrel who is he   143.72553395272863
you want something   178.48560392579526
they were armed with their long guns inlaid with mother of pearl and silver and cartridges in great numbers were lying scattered on the floor   105.65179232118206
in truth at that moment a terrible murmur was wafted to them by the night breeze   60.43148131837798
there was no more to be had in saint germain   88.3265539366671
there is a visitor in the drawing room   42.77649791664821
before he could be possibly set free the cardinal would be dead   120.99847771493376
he added in a low tone to porthos   96.33152114732424
wait said valentine   121.43698151900955
she met with judges whom her hideous crimes had evoked   228.51001169074115
said mousqueton who had ridden by the side of d artagnan without speaking a word on the journey you may think what you will sir but i can breathe now for the first time since my departure from pierrefonds   116.21198232852038
that is not all   99.55531182970329
no don t be alarmed although it is to a lady that i am going to present you and i am anxious that you should love her the young man looked at the count with a certain uneasiness but at a smile from athos he was quickly reassured   217.27310323846544
how happy you are in being exempt from all this   120.69241543721441
and you would arrest him   64.78209688752989
some hours afterwards it began again nearer and more distinct   106.99359185680026
that is to say replied d artagnan that you will wait until i have proved myself worthy of it   67.59495316808332
attorney but how do you know all this   125.71842442296585
and knowing everything he had advised danglars to write to yanina   92.82882746672216
who wrote to yanina   87.43450591840606
it was towards this kiosk that we were rowing   70.02791027583866
repeated the inspector   147.21236091755964
said mordaunt to d artagnan and porthos   53.58792407353612
at this strange and unexpected demand m   82.1557886877168
patience madame i am coming to it   205.87646878444554
he is but not willingly   136.1868055654325
those are really aces and twos which you see but my shots have turned them into threes fives sevens eights nines and tens   110.74465321044761
then d artagnan who had never seriously thought of this impossible duel endeavored to turn the conversation   202.09709518531145
your devotion does not commit you too far monsieur de rochefort   152.3720331492066
and one by one he sent away the guards on various pretexts   144.28206837801008
well said he to me have you made your mind up to take the oath i requested of you   120.33727596070143
that is precisely the fault of the age   149.92586017630478
what do you wish   111.44397966800665
if he were to lose them well and if he were to lose them   124.9365718381853
if not why there would be no promotion   70.22478194018211
30139m if you wish it my son said the major   88.56970302246728
call upon my treasurer and get the money   83.67938567841807
he glanced around looked in the bed shook the curtains opened the closets and finally stopped at the chimney   59.200077439720225
i feel my head a little confused   189.9195357942682
not locked he cried   122.53873505783476
he rushed toward d artagnan with eyes fixed upon him and clasped him in his arms   94.19059178327996
anne of austria had never appeared more brilliant than on that day radiant with grace and wit   115.62168207288764
they traced her to châlons and there they lost her   243.57044059879735
nay your excellency it is you who should tell us what you want   134.54405229655129
the departure the recent events formed the theme of conversation throughout all paris   103.04290695911632
unfortunately that is true   159.0383063708264
madame de chevreuse was not queen murmured anne of austria overcome in spite of herself by the expression of so profound a passion   90.06571019074967
how grateful will m   50.92300732336234
haydée turned her eyes towards monte cristo who making at the same time some imperceptible sign murmured εἰπέ speak   28.141160895971453
the eyes of noirtier lighted up with rage and d avrigny prepared to speak   144.48319791863764
and now said la ramee i must ask your highness s pardon but it seems that monsieur de chavigny is to be away for a few days and he has sent me word that he has certain directions to give me before his departure   145.14164852912788
be quiet you rascal   67.54687954514127
no felton no my brother said she   105.90590359800926
at last d artagnan thought it was time to try one of his favorite feints in fencing   139.7132505136937
40204m then remarked the president the count of monte cristo knows nothing of your present proceedings   130.44155400673762
i know an inn little frequented but of which the host is entirely devoted to me   80.04596355637695
then he took off cavalcanti s hat which he placed upon his own head and finally he assumed the careless attitude of a servant whose master drives himself   211.1913196589012
he has consented to enter the service of your keeper and to shut himself up at vincennes with you in order to prepare and assist your escape which we are contriving   227.1086619962794
whenever her majesty has need of me replied the coadjutor bowing her majesty knows i am at her command   123.79359386914913
it was written and signed by albert   73.89731355829437
mademoiselle valentine   83.51438971519482
maximilian you are no ordinary man   88.24275002859177
but what do you require of me then   88.39007763605942
that is true that is true my child said the queen you are right   108.6385793739842
can it be on account of the amours of madame de bois tracy   70.92379144325604
porthos do not lose sight of his eminence   109.9084446089316
valentine looked at her watch   10.234387103905803
athos s horse where is that   173.51658730130103
then father said raoul forcing himself to convey a respect by speech that did not come from his heart if you are a priest you have an opportunity as my friend has told you of exercising your vocation   43.2550256847593
without courting danger he never shrank from an encounter   135.7546781652191
if it were nothing but a sword thrust why then i have counted upon you on this occasion monsieur   8.151585168626255
i don t remember him   117.9483975413791
no said monte cristo   116.75182294354818
then let us sit down said villefort impatiently for it will take some time   109.6333495604822
never till then had a more brutal accusation or meaner insults tarnished kingly majesty   47.95791450586701
escape had never once occurred to him   35.385724458942036
the first arrivals wore long cloaks in whose drapery they were carefully enveloped   95.28343815971087
0315m still dantès could not view without a shudder the approach of a gendarme who accompanied the officers deputed to demand his bill of health ere the yacht was permitted to hold communication with the shore   109.51148055409855
and if you can find another employer enter his service   96.96412018981177
in spite of the gross flattery and coarseness of this address madame danglars could not forbear gazing with considerable interest on a man capable of expending six millions in twelve months and who had selected paris for the scene of his princely extravagance   114.33316648978675
in a few words porthos and aramis were posted as to the situation   161.9958429783517
oliva corsinari   114.56514847370177
ready said he with his usual curtness   161.0798542084292
nor was that surprising   106.23234217515339
danglars reflected for a moment   120.40568620988391
morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless   189.45389398239718
i did not send for you i think   148.6546760569645
there will be in all times and in all countries particularly if religious divisions exist in those countries fanatics who ask nothing better than to become martyrs   145.81953655180175
the order was obeyed   121.10299896067644
i have no fear of ghosts and i have never heard it said that so much harm had been done by the dead during six thousand years as is wrought by the living in a single day   73.00432491966922
the new sentinel commenced his walk in the corridor   64.5335329747511
i have barely escaped   86.70012079561282
pardon for whom   146.55857131517493
said aramis with a grimace of disgust   81.26726175986377
she is called the fair indian   104.06084769332624
20079m alas   86.86241303532482
the hand which has retreated for a while will be again stretched forth to save me at the very moment when i shall think myself sinking into the abyss   158.21836108514157
he was pale and his eyes were red and swollen   89.88098092152784
he did not take in the paper containing the defamatory article and had passed the morning in writing letters and in trying a horse   142.64494199636704
and desirous of putting an end to the interview he pushed by her and closed the door as if to exclude the pain he felt   121.6359866253661
all the world has not the secret of the medicis or the borgias   157.0664495592225
at midnight my dear monsieur louvieres   121.51886961514438
these studs can not be trusted to anybody   135.1002662703056
milady trembled   40.653464581159355
resounded   145.73840235251456
a gendarme is one of the most striking objects in the world even to a man void of uneasiness   42.49395902440598
the countess dashed the grapes into the nearest thicket with a gesture of despair   139.67647337504164
at these words uttered with the most exquisite sweetness and politeness madame de morcerf replied it is very fortunate for my son monsieur that he found such a friend and i thank god that things are thus   47.26243323912988
the count of monte cristo i believe   106.41028265580964
you desire to fathom this horrible secret   52.112043603278146
asked jussac   71.5737316264026
then you comprehend it would be only a question of time a sort of race which should arrive first   154.66860946883824
what a gourmand you are growing   132.5079661041574
while by giving up broussel your majesty will strike at the root of the sedition and will gain the right to punish severely any revival of the revolt   87.0941241042864
doubtless although less evident monte cristo s joy was not less intense   126.79245558984223
he said looking at the stone this is the work of either hercules or porthos   127.3156246393795
15 rue de nouailles   79.79164799136332
athos took the letter from the hands of d artagnan approached the lamp set fire to the paper and did not let go till it was reduced to a cinder   111.86673343717088
50090m chapter 103   99.3924398143759
without waiting for the permission of his host d artagnan went quickly into the house and cast a rapid glance at the bed   90.64921306931997
all gazed at him searchingly   181.9818539707972
i passed the night on a chair starting at the least noise for toward midnight the lamp went out and i was again in darkness   93.87953620211323
that s my concern   147.82537139401472
thy treasure for his widow   36.89007570409599
wait it ought to be there in my pocket   135.1953408159495
sire said aramis will not your majesty acquaint some of your friends of this   115.08358822243046
besides she had a thousand precautions to take a thousand counsels to give to her defender in order that he might avoid explanations with the count before witnesses   60.47603579781397
it would be very kind of you   109.76608094999702
i see that you require someone to answer for me   73.8577048668106
the king had not yet returned from hunting   112.50805022079125
i waited a month or rather i suffered for a month   110.09249156169642
to troyes in champagne i answered   156.91652341698955
who are they   151.0052057347121
brave young man   99.29613943596183
i carried the infection of crime with me and she has caught it as she would the typhus fever the cholera the plague   194.52357784591595
you can occupy haydée s apartment and my daughter will at least be replaced by my son   112.04648277673138
madame will be tired tonight continued monte cristo and will no doubt wish to rest   55.244319800140325
he was evidently accustomed to see his prisoners tremble before him and yet here was one whose gay temperament was not for a moment altered   43.566848364617826
and who   61.16752174317727
for as the carriage of the two friends passed her she threw a bunch of violets   158.65441220382885
how kind you are exclaimed the young man pressing his guardian s hand   115.42475953923378
i will go and discuss the matter with the queen   186.66704212359087
i will retire madame   169.0054872261389
thus from fondi to perusia everyone trembles at the name of cucumetto   92.7460228006516
guard her   129.60599607562602
nothing will ever go well with us hereafter   175.0717047607462
bonacieux kissed his wife s hand and set off at a quick pace   165.42637043946604
behold for what end the wretched mazarin has made use of you   90.90381604766222
teresa and luigi reached the summit and all at once found themselves in the presence of twenty bandits   151.06024601598298
to monsieur noirtier rue coq héron paris   89.8846790769099
to wait at monte cristo for the purpose of watching like a dragon over the almost incalculable riches that had thus fallen into his possession satisfied not the cravings of his heart which yearned to return to dwell among mankind and to assume the rank power and influence which are always accorded to wealth that first and greatest of all the forces within the grasp of man   49.379720675284815
but pardon me are you free   130.7175766365414
corpo di dio   112.82989245561872
d artagnan looked with surprise at his friend   143.07075765529441
monsieur mordaunt   105.6465590155786
the old man sank into a chair   70.53980573162087
you must not confide in anyone not even in your father   123.82763838634068
well then said the host your young master was here a quarter of an hour ago   114.47317151633163
said louise going to listen at madame danglars door   72.76397589285253
go for i see how impatient you are   111.93632660878933
never commit such an imprudence as to try to escape except in your dreams   40.763820340926145
john lateran   146.388050628661
adieu my lord murmured my mother determining quietly to await the approach of death   128.8509556311338
he took the papers and presented himself here as the emissary of the cardinal and in an hour or two a carriage will come to take me away by the orders of his eminence   73.86343084291178
but i but i cried olivain pale and disconsolate rushing about on the shore how shall i cross   114.76280507289954
my first visit is due to my father though i am not the less grateful for the honor you have done me   163.27318545953818
he described the youth of monte cristo who he said at ten years of age entered the service of one of the petty sovereigns of india who make war on the english   55.25593022324057
who then has counselled you to take this step one for which the court is deeply indebted to you and which is perfectly natural considering your birth and your misfortunes   86.55927869077681
and the two englishmen who were nearest to them fell mortally wounded   122.41448689010974
o peccato   61.7644611188376
i know nothing about it continued aramis but the cleverest the bravest the most devoted of us four said to me when i left him tell the king that to morrow at ten o clock at night we shall carry him off   178.73687554330024
nevertheless believe that i heartily pray that i may not become to him a father however much i might be proud of such a son   67.05241028037523
maximilian sprang down the staircase and threw his arms round his father s neck   46.109017111171
next week i hope my duties will afford me a little liberty and i will take advantage of it to come and put things in order here as they must necessarily be much deranged   82.14517201247725
in all other respects she was the same mad creature who threw over her amours such an air of originality as to make them proverbial for eccentricity in her family   102.32005357496114
all this was said with such exceeding rapidity that there was something in the conversation that seemed like the beginning of delirium   136.00302937425633
that is i   129.63851880927547
villefort became livid   119.53347635108089
de villefort s house and a long file of mourning coaches and private carriages extended along the faubourg saint honoré and the rue de la pépinière   120.95854399948169
albert de morcerf is no coward   266.5634834027349
come come said the sailor i have a better opinion than you of women in general and of mercédès in particular   105.1032979205266
i never heard you mentioned and i did not dare inquire for you   109.54756774906647
the pickaxe that had seemed so heavy was now like a feather in his grasp   78.13044642664643
i had the honor of asking you why you altered your costume   126.811437608461
true remorse   78.52846197074976
when de winter perceived them in his turn he advanced toward them with surprising rapidity   105.70753186190466
you will my lord duke easily comprehend that the honor fairly doubles the pleasure one enjoys   121.09204245711096
toward midday lord de winter entered   66.86638094910303
you look there for your outfit i think you said   135.53408862881824
raoul put his hand in his pocket   130.00240697734944
danglars then without taking a crown from his pocket could save morrel   165.32310999362136
and at the four corners of this apartment which was oblong were four magnificent statues having baskets in their hands   35.04472445221258
into normandy if you like   42.20067658519824
as he entered the wicket of l echelle ten o clock struck   150.87953432656428
and his eminence the cardinal   154.83461034691112
all this must be prepared against   75.66618903944561
at the door the count was met by the two notaries who had just completed the act which was to disinherit valentine and who were leaving under the conviction of having done a thing which could not fail of redounding considerably to their credit   147.45038531979725
this village constructed in a singular and picturesque manner half moorish half spanish still remains and is inhabited by descendants of the first comers who speak the language of their fathers   29.629048886411795
still the walls seemed to be closing on him   105.4031897773394
a confession   150.93490084168144
you speak first   101.00479501202503
here is a letter i have just received on the subject   107.47505263240161
if i am not yet a musketeer said he to his new friends as he passed through the gateway of m   104.88512068661608
listen there were in truth at that epoch four devoted hearts four loyal spirits four faithful swords who saved more than my life my honor ah   184.91012918705206
reassure yourself then and say to yourself at this moment a friend a father who lives for my happiness and that of maximilian watches over me   114.79547179448727
the attack which has just passed away condemns me forever to the walls of a prison   94.28645907878965
to whom did he give up his sword   132.91481428132158
there are people who laugh at the horse that would not dare to laugh at the master cried the young emulator of the furious tréville   46.244134023287344
but monsieur commissary said he calmly believe that i know and appreciate more than anybody the merit of the incomparable eminence by whom we have the honor to be governed   131.1576677852461
the officer leaped to the pier and offered his hand to milady   58.079201781214415
well continued mazarin the time has come to put to use your talents and your valor   48.25430715888113
there are many stories related of him and among them this   153.7396995349016
i hastened to the innkeeper   90.9514302354748
at dice   75.94928686155433
she is still in her chamber   131.38320607222684
just then the carriage rolled on something harder than gravel road   60.42546271086543
set your mind at rest replied athos   139.06684395588996
it is astonishing said he   76.50890930948682
it is the longest road but certainly the most amusing   156.23500440423186
well listen to me then monsieur the abbé   118.9485330822424
for pity for mercy s sake do not deliver me up   104.02709207031793
have patience but one day longer   135.12416105243435
but why mother   168.6012830896436
but out of that sum i ought to leave fifty for raoul a young man must live respectably   105.63793837319321
both the great king and the great poet ought to have known woman s nature well   126.71944540032364
if he were minister and i were his d artagnan instead of belonging to that beast of a mazarin mordieu   43.28827852685505
i hasten to do so   146.97737399024078
then came a skirmish the more terrible because it had no definite object   90.40719522822704
but when i visit a country i begin to study by all the means which are available the men from whom i may have anything to hope or to fear till i know them as well as perhaps better than they know themselves   191.1473566098893
valentine looked at the young man   158.95951935345852
and yet he said i must admit that i sent for you to appoint you to quiet service   84.75610839306273
yes i own it   91.62058360573491
then it became the turn of athos porthos and aramis to mount guard with d artagnan when he was on duty   48.65193848595105
he is not a gossip i hope   98.50270365298893
so i put it off until the next occasion and in order that nothing should escape me i took a chamber looking into the street bordered by the wall of the garden   99.44230310341483
cried morcerf turning livid with rage   68.13212511363331
i did not like to go to him without first seeing you   137.87840463302294
well said he extending his hand to monte cristo i suppose you have come to sympathize with me for indeed misfortune has taken possession of my house   64.3746741071383
if we go from this place we shall never find another so suitable   132.7146815391696
to lose them even to the gold embroidered belt for gala days win all this again with the addition of a hundred louis without his beautiful eyebrow being heightened or lowered half a line without his hands losing their pearly hue without his conversation which was cheerful that evening ceasing to be calm and agreeable   127.2638078164008
the chief s mistress   57.21921436108885
well i swear to you all three that had the executioner of bethune was he not of bethune   98.7389473785122
oh your excellency your excellency   139.65116236157482
the brigadier calm and dignified as the law he represented passed through the crowd without answering the thousand questions addressed to him and re entered the hotel   109.56053255788474
one day your father equally desperate wished to kill himself too   142.2992007746605
he took a quill wrote the name of d artagnan in the commission and returned it to him   4.841489900964959
unfortunately said monte cristo one s title to a millionaire does not last for life like that of baron peer of france or academician   116.46121172423855
as to what may lie before us it is perhaps less serious than we at first thought   121.03782504806551
do not attempt it   49.84647404501386
the general was pacing the room the third time when in turning he perceived monte cristo at the door   87.76369693668343
the young man stamped impatiently and ordered all sail to be spread   91.66777215581571
decidedly my dear athos said d artagnan i should like better not to risk anything   92.18845621980705
i would fain fix the source of it on man that i may no longer vent reproaches upon heaven   52.64897500620319
i have punished him for his injustice that is all   117.4781987765385
yet through a singular impulse it was neither to her mother nor her brother that she applied but to emmanuel   145.82913177978466
while you are fighting if there is a fight he must flee   97.9076439476205
this reply was too flattering to allow me to insist on his departure   93.38609396434947
seven thousand livres in louis of twelve francs   135.64121577430296
milady therefore continued her voyage and on the very day that planchet embarked at portsmouth for france the messenger of his eminence entered the port in triumph   87.50824302375207
larboard your helm cried the captain to the steersman   141.55362696206822
come then and take it friend said the gascon   50.70203328918882
yes yes to mine   85.95506360530237
i am much obliged to monsieur for the crown he has given me and i promise him to follow his instructions exactly   100.96683248820588
if you have any preference you can point it out to me   47.2612376815987
repeat what i have told you   111.38904652394913
changing our clothes   85.74043417584159
for all evils there are two remedies time and silence   84.84481888611822
if he is a prince he is wrong not to maintain his rank   113.71871451009986
but the connection will be seen by others and therefore i will have the article contradicted   57.11123435382666
asked the inspector   24.230304249679307
but it must be admitted upon something widely different from ambition   89.33298508022008
her opera glass was so fixedly directed towards them that franz saw it would be cruel not to satisfy her curiosity   149.56123189767203
he dragged himself towards the child s body and examined it as a lioness contemplates its dead cub   138.2384358055391
you have to know me yet   177.13319670284167
with an instinctive hatred of matrimony she suffered andrea s attentions in order to get rid of morcerf   17.81609635521521
he causes a disturbance in your hostelry which respectable people can not put up with   143.58330968977077
will your lordship do me the honor to sup with me   59.32679305663048
do you find the means i will execute it provided it is not to kill the man for mercédès has declared she will kill herself if dantès is killed   106.71974341923222
everything was here arranged in perfect order   44.123528069128454
as soon as she was seated in the vehicle she drew from her pocket a very thick black veil which she tied on to her straw bonnet   132.29750864628275
asked mme   94.81011824077929
let him be interred in holy ground   65.60965836217072
this reckoning his loss and what he had missed gaining made the difference of a million to danglars   122.43161025705997
a capital blow you gave   177.33373796479924
then the count knelt down by the side of the bed which death had converted into an altar   82.3681589646279
oh i would fight for such a cause   8.831222959495207
the major awaited the conclusion of the postscript apparently with great anxiety   129.18362367594807
it would be but an unsafe retreat   103.04843325263106
the judges themselves appeared to be stupefied and the jury manifested tokens of disgust for a cynicism so unexpected in a man of fashion   74.9938790967724
it will be too late   26.246597825656565
at the sight of the little letter the heart of d artagnan bounded for he believed he recognized the handwriting and although he had seen that writing but once the memory of it remained at the bottom of his heart   164.80651173862003
ah said morrel falling from the height of excitement to the abyss of despair ah you are playing with me like those good or rather selfish mothers who soothe their children with honeyed words because their screams annoy them   163.6653881035345
one of the oldest of my parisian acquaintances and they will not find you at my house   176.92915061986847
is there nobody from whose house monsieur laporte can come and fetch you   87.54461167636794
still his sister did not seem uneasy and told me that though she had not seen him for two or three days she was sure he was well   73.7877851245639
alas i understand   93.90623271324102
the owner did not wait for a second invitation   163.9963694005396
if we were to make ourselves known we should be sent to rejoin our friends in some deep ditch from which the devil himself could not take us out   55.150865880448585
and aramis drawing in the ladder closed the window   89.75269106228316
the queen held out her hand which they kissed and she said in a low tone to de winter if you need money my lord separate the jewels i have given you   63.602784379044955
i will not be caught like a fool at a first disclosure by a rendezvous under the clock as they say at the opera balls   138.65847314377038
you have seen that he would have thrown his glove in my face if morrel one of my friends had not stopped him   54.69401190908085
monsieur duke i must have those letters   85.3547432229115
i am brave when i set about it   114.60052667290037
replied d artagnan closing his hand with a nervous spasm   43.95284016055635
at the usual time morrel had presented himself at the little door leading to noirtier s room   75.4594435431527
so much the better for the dogs said monte cristo   127.95957825599811
it is true they might have taken others but there was a great forest to pass through and planchet as we have seen had no liking for forests after dark   72.13043813249905
nothing else than i say search   193.76257109529047
but how foolish all this is   164.37933319476136
the frenchman entered leaving in the anteroom his guide who immediately entered into conversation with two or three of the industrious idlers who are always to be found in rome at the doors of banking houses churches museums or theatres   121.5191463497273
did you observe that man s eyes while he was speaking to us   194.3512161105886
since my convalescence i have so many affairs of this kind on my hands that i am forced to regulate them a little   102.89259441975878
we must do him justice he had had a great many frenchmen in his house but had never been able to comprehend them   130.1909084849623
it is the way of weakened minds to see everything through a black cloud   144.73036309231273
i have worn my cuirass these twenty years kept down in this inferior rank without going forward or backward hardly half living   12.757374262862598
anyone else would have rushed on with a cry of joy   224.92765074150293
raoul had desired to be awakened should grimaud arrive but grimaud did not arrive   103.35874921568706
a family affair chapter xlix   171.36842333249479
and besides i am on my guard   111.85168053289017
this was the name given the cuirassiers whom cromwell had made his body guard   142.77119769278005
would to heaven   91.53455652541082
so long as he was surrounded by his friends he retained his youth and the poetry of his character   144.6785839738954
when they were within ten paces of him d artagnan who in falling had taken care not to let go his sword sprang up close to them   34.61201423672716
that she is called so   92.41687145442634
be assured answered mazarin that i shall attempt nothing   44.2383837750332
do you suffer much   67.82022519895622
but oh how i passed that time   186.50499758562023
well answered the old man by closing his eyes   198.19818799464713
this order i believe i have accomplished with all the exactness of a soldier but also with the courtesy of a gentleman   102.49707552753227
place the hands repeated the curate with a gesture   152.3050068544382
did you anticipate the accident which has happened to your granddaughter   102.59702648970026
i don t know english athos said d artagnan   135.40056809576998
he found beauchamp pacing the room   19.27887452719399
the squares were broken to shivers   31.560383233009162
i will tell you what that is   121.29729633974304
i do not despise bankruptcies believe me but they must be those which enrich not those which ruin   162.29862576893922
then suddenly in order not to give too uncomfortable an importance to this observation see raoul   1.0238064154760593
the opinion of a swordsman can have very little weight replied d artagnan who began to be uneasy at the turn things were taking and you had better be satisfied believe me with the knowledge of these gentlemen   92.75913848789541
tis nothing nothing   82.97582537191678
this second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of terrified silence on the part of those who were left behind   69.06732654350793
i think i have seen you and known you formerly   139.59426057674
i would have done it for half that for twenty thousand for fifteen thousand   156.0957594686397
i am called said andrea   83.81136527086667
but the poor girl swore upon the crucifix to d artagnan that she was entirely ignorant on that head her mistress never admitting her into half her secrets only she believed she could say she was not dead   75.9794912676256
then cries of men who were knocked down were heard   171.2385868468451
he had entered villefort s office expecting that the magistrate would tremble at the sight of him   158.83912431079708
i suffer less because there is in me less strength to endure   86.88460096385379
cried the novice   106.28047923841082
i must explain to you said the major that fully confiding in the signature of the abbé busoni i had not provided myself with any other funds   154.42229659041874
and how much does he give you monthly   106.04823711913166
and the queen at what time is it her wish to start   109.15947357650668
and now he said after today you will come and live with me   168.21891424184847
there were sentinels a guard in the court stacks of arms and horses saddled   138.39481802345452
you to be sure   71.4726341156809
if you succeed i do not say that you will save a king   120.11555717606517
he never spoke to him except under the most extraordinary occasions   95.8488556738243
do you think it will be long before he comes in   128.3418040032127
and taking out his handkerchief he gagged him   151.97343559417456
what say you duke   9.447277772719104
i have great power   125.40354477387127
de tréville after meditating a minute   154.52512929470907
oh my god my god cried mme   62.774452677801236
asked gaston d orleans with a forced smile   116.08552474650853
he fixed on him a look of greater assurance than before and said you may perhaps be better satisfied that i should not go farther into particulars   76.6747335675849
perhaps i am   168.88883548128578
would it be better to remain here said athos and take a turn in the bastile or the dungeon of vincennes for having favored the escape of monsieur de beaufort   134.60199522496086
i have been heaven s substitute to recompense the good now the god of vengeance yields to me his power to punish the wicked   162.61399156532707
the keeper retired   191.4798048492408
the executioner searched his face with the quick glance peculiar to those who are about to die and have no time to lose   141.41173388815557
eugénie looked at danglars much surprised that one flower of her crown of pride with which she had so superbly decked herself should be disputed   137.3424923352755
relate it said monte cristo pressing his hand to his heart to still its violent beatings   151.99820091227787
grandpapa noirtier can speak now then said edward with his habitual quickness   28.1468511819933
that the day after tomorrow i shall have to draw upon you for about four thousand francs   28.826787982890806
why what ails you   119.19373906596013
they are mistaken   68.85070278076965
he then saw that he must make another struggle against the grief of his friend and taking the hands of emmanuel and julie which he pressed within his own he said with the mild authority of a father my kind friends leave me alone with maximilian   200.53936029428866
what now remains to do is in the department of the minister of war   74.9851781547449
it is lady fairfax herself said d artagnan   183.2167428820657
you do not know at all and in this way they will chase him to paris without drawing a trigger   99.1532533277653
at this moment the screams and ringing were redoubled   97.42364641093444
la jeune amélie left it three quarters of a league to the larboard and kept on for corsica   154.26986137564697
pardon my eagerness for my life depends on your answer   116.4522448036549
what has she written to me   38.118478625140284
why do you not apply to them if you stand in need of help   165.18900263864495
i do sometimes soldier though i am   53.530127981906524
but this time a fresh inmate was left with dantès hope   132.98076607579017
no she was french but she had married in england   132.05914579463072
more than fifty private carriages followed the twenty mourning coaches and behind them more than five hundred persons joined in the procession on foot   89.09429245866079
they then came to a massive door which after the introduction into the lock of a key which the young man carried with him turned heavily upon its hinges and disclosed the chamber destined for milady   228.2760958757963
you can speak before me said franz   185.65664816428435
the host sat down after having made each of them a respectful bow which meant that he was ready to tell them all they wished to know concerning luigi vampa   159.36233657233285
the two friends turned off into a side street to avoid meeting the prince and so reached the saint denis gate   107.05034299338362
the poor girl promised all her lover desired   77.88136727577361
water water   64.30133517588806
simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand   122.70024480286162
murmured milady in english   63.519031823043754
he was thereupon constrained to admit that he was indeed awake and that his bloody dream was real   108.6554235441125
i speak as one who admires you mademoiselle   224.63242275629298
do you not recollect morcerf his telling us so at your breakfast   157.29791467474402
they appear to be numerous   143.67384308047107
and knowing your strict punctuality have collected all the bills bearing your signature and charged me as they became due to present them and to employ the money otherwise   116.02651663079872
anne colored slightly   94.07023916695005
the sounds of wind and wave the frightful movements of the vessel   63.307895708098975
you are ungrateful d artagnan said athos   137.90467823516119
besides d artagnan has not told us his idea yet   101.46190918098328
you are only responsible for my body is it not so   131.0450728281953
leaning against the tree he gazed thoughtfully for a time at the upper stories of the shabby little house   122.80011952865513
that s it said the duke now make me a little hole in the floor whilst i go and fetch the culprit   89.81333331370614
but these tears flowed for another   167.25670596354053
i am fatigued with reading and all this latin confuses me   78.03626766929767
fernand mondego vicomte de morcerf   145.8451342795969
henceforth dispose of it   87.9854149895599
sire   38.04664331225371
i see that i shall not only go alone to the duke of bracciano s but also return to florence alone   75.30632588947745
certainly it is not mine   103.28441009513917
at the end of a moment s conversation in which porthos hinted that a lady of elevated rank had condescended to relieve him from his embarrassment mousqueton entered   111.33926037429191
it seemed to him as if he had not taken a sufficient farewell of his beloved daughter   107.55150932250818
i tell you what my dear fellow said château renaud i can not imagine what objection you can possibly have to mademoiselle danglars that is setting aside her want of ancestry and somewhat inferior rank which by the way i don t think you care very much about   154.53913916419478
there is a god said monte cristo of whom you are a striking proof as you lie in utter despair denying him while i stand before you rich happy safe and entreating that god in whom you endeavor not to believe while in your heart you still believe in him   73.07424858600427
you are not happy porthos   115.74460071163581
my first visit was to the thicket   62.0786884482819
in truth madame do you think that can be possible   8.260501971288818
at yanina   127.38259253152579
in fact i am dead   62.78289862514953
the tempest was let loose and beating the atmosphere with its mighty wings   121.7873057189853
pass on your way then   16.844331814204253
inquired raoul   163.81137511701908
a felon named caderousse   169.69132884739722
it is not their fault that they are bandits but that of the authorities   59.16281494412992
when will it take place   173.77118610655384
himself captain himself   92.94351705997587
morrel to come and claim me at my own hands   16.053033784321713
probably if ever i get out of prison   145.40862025136906
i do not like anyone to deny his origin   72.82342819925569
in my house murmured he in my house   158.05221419675894
therefore sire your majesty sees that they are come quite contrite and repentant to offer you their excuses   102.45549197238192
all england is tired of your iniquities   25.518757947327956
who is in command here   85.49501352066825
13 paris   181.78552382081045
he had no longer any doubts as to the nature of the conference   121.84127778317229
false gentleman   166.92414956203572
she was sent by her mistress to the false de wardes   99.69929918996029
four shots replied to them almost instantaneously but much better aimed than those of the aggressors   113.57196066611877
but he knows it all now interrupted caderousse   73.09325136908825
the young count witty and caustic passed all the world in review   147.25105208785394
days even months passed by unheeded in one rapid and instructive course   165.20994198932578
the count is here said the officer and requests to speak with your eminence instantly   107.13666397799764
why you knew it porthos said aramis   57.74788032740358
we have made ourselves the constant guardians of our men and while i sleep monsieur du vallon watches   115.17358075951924
i am king of all creation   137.80488987628928
morrel seven   102.19517454876741
but to you i shall be merciful   104.0836937551155
the three young people were talking together   102.30302273378425
and that man what has your eminence done with him   124.54676958252202
i will try   114.13375626254904
those were the count s windows   105.3155725625941
at the same time they saw the reflection of a torch on a carbine barrel   118.87837619667253
are there not some places where we seem to breathe sadness   183.66421850591323
he brings an irreproachable name which maximilian is likely to render glorious since at thirty years of age he is a captain an officer of the legion of honor   82.77904132413187
besides it were better to die than to continue to lead this low and wretched life   138.86942303581063
mousqueton thy pistols said d artagnan   99.07320994607338
then with a hasty movement he tore open his coat which seemed to stifle him and flew from the room like a madman   175.71010019132046
but god has supplied man with the intelligence that enables him to overcome the limitations of natural conditions   97.01016303383727
conceal your wounds when you have any   117.80012950333565
love me then haydée   140.89314446893607
but d artagnan whose anger already excited was much increased by recognizing in him the englishman of amiens who had won his horse and had been very near winning his diamond of athos caught at his bridle and stopped him   26.39535909832243
i said to myself that a minister is never loved but that with the genius this one was said to have he would eventually triumph over his enemies and would make himself feared which in my opinion is much more to be desired than to be loved d artagnan made a sign with his head which indicated that he entirely approved that doubtful maxim   21.913303823505686
i wished to see what villefort was going to do there and i remained motionless holding my breath   81.24500692585869
the clerks who as it appeared had smelled unusual perfumes in the house were of military punctuality and held their stools in hand quite ready to sit down   157.7376017112582
30315m villefort thought it would be terrible to reply that valentine was at a ball   99.08898626072667
how is it possible for a poor mercer who detests huguenots and who abhors spaniards to be accused of high treason   139.78198918897624
one might believe the queen was about to speak   161.8880900103094
you have selected a most unfavorable moment for your first visit   90.98116812934528
he replied however in a tone of deep interest i entreat you m   78.5484862391671
but he will not wish for only one harness   122.25499802398944
he said falling on his knees   121.31485272311272
by a musketeer   35.31834097089731
oh excellency   147.65763334581538
he assembled his keepers and notwithstanding his well known difficulty of utterance addressed them as follows gentlemen   2.42971767117686
he had not tasted food for forty hours   64.01505832738532
this is indeed a house of mourning said valentine   67.49103045192477
beauchamp was breakfasting when he read the paragraph   104.55270834187343
then the door of the closet in which d artagnan was was opened and mme   75.885088271733
and who charges me with this monseigneur   70.84873309394501
it is true that every step in our lives is like the course of an insect on the sands   167.96683330332672
come and roll me to bed   140.3973804359362
mazarin hesitated for one instant but d artagnan was firm   89.77323291892873
standing well at court whether the king regnant was of the older or younger branch whether the government was doctrinaire liberal or conservative   126.25306825460287
and fernand said caderousse with a chuckle   111.42994257088388
to fall continued king louis who at the first glance had sounded the abyss on which the monarchy hung suspended to fall and learn of that fall by telegraph   87.47391495603135
i once bore another which you knew but you have certainly forgotten it   107.80547879837104
and for that reason he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate and to clear his memory should any foul spot or stain have fallen on it   53.57564975629136
grimaud showed his closed hand with two fingers spread out   103.77436894595023
i knew there were smugglers but i thought that since the capture of algiers and the destruction of the regency pirates existed only in the romances of cooper and captain marryat   90.02328359157954
have you seen the woman you loved giving her hand to your rival while you were perishing at the bottom of a dungeon   98.80449557324941
monsieur d artagnan said the cardinal sitting down on a fauteuil you have always seemed to me to be a brave and honorable man   129.70134291907092
oh father father   119.76702937186812
that evening he had a long conference with several friends   98.10717720939326
however she offered the cardinal laporte s place which he accepted and went from one carriage to the other   224.44811236770448
at ten o clock the guns of the louvre announced the departure of the king and then a movement similar to that of trees in a stormy wind that bend and writhe with agitated tops ran though the multitude which was compressed behind the immovable muskets of the guard   166.8488359900268
the latter had received most peremptory instructions from monte cristo to treat haydée with all the deference they would observe to a queen   128.47573125335546
he has just left me replied de winter after telling me all   138.06170862550331
bring your comrades here one and all   114.41179227988293
and that the latter almost always left them valuable and durable remembrances as if they essayed to conquer the fragility of their sentiments by the solidity of their gifts   85.2648818118603
besides d artagnan was but twenty years old and consequently had not yet forgotten his schoolboy habits   157.5883562665301
at first on arriving at the door through which mazarin had passed d artagnan tried in vain to open it but on the powerful shoulder of porthos being applied to one of the panels which gave way d artagnan introduced the point of his sword between the bolt and the staple of the lock   73.1364289882357
your mother your sister   115.68018703603065
luigi pushed the stone behind her for on the crest of a small adjacent hill which cut off the view toward palestrina he saw a traveller on horseback stopping a moment as if uncertain of his road and thus presenting against the blue sky that perfect outline which is peculiar to distant objects in southern climes   111.09888600764457
compression is needed to explode gunpowder   139.99634502427688
i should dread some disagreeable encounter if i were to go home   100.98460556096147
ah you knew that   144.8148874323872
just reflect a little what an agitation the queen s mind must be in for her to have remembered me after twenty years   186.49622049010918
aramis confiding in the address of bazin made a pompous eulogium on his candidate   129.53090746315516
we are first said morrel looking out of the window   96.68970072421021
and a thousand francs a year   82.03338244942067
the goldsmith has heard nothing of it   110.37903123035655
then in the evening i shall go to the theatre   174.4743618776105
utterly impossible   96.1881970544435
she was a perfect linguist a first rate artist wrote poetry and composed music   62.652936197837384
a friend maximilian   43.62403961951857
cried mordaunt who coming up out of the hatchway rushed to the stern waving his torch   136.31806420529213
so that decidedly this handkerchief is as likely to have fallen from your pocket as mine   141.42093207644564
mordaunt one of my secretaries will remit this letter of introduction to his eminence the cardinal mazarin in paris   149.3634675173129
de morcerf even wished to take him to the chamber to hear the speakers   150.56541351753782
and for my part gentlemen i admire you   150.041308345946
unfortunately they are well mounted   107.09111609460928
i will consent to share this dreadful secret with you but i will not allow shame and remorse to grow and increase in my conscience as crime and misery will in your house   83.25724720901178
and dame nanette sprang to the window threw it open and in such a piercing voice that it might have been heard in the square of notre dame help   79.11637853550104
the young man standing up before her gazed upon her with that filial affection which is so tender and endearing with children whose mothers are still young and handsome   193.99735204674846
i will not answer for them   144.16758727807206
nothing more simple returned the count   95.90568284409828
you are a worthy fellow   100.66609239595297
only leave him in the ante room as i wish to speak to you alone   148.10227642025373
asked danglars of monte cristo   96.68391034619194
noirtier again made an affirmative sign   150.51815198525955
i swear it was time for you to come back la ramee and i was eager to see you again   66.99383771446178
said the queen ironically   111.30018592509118
perhaps when all is considered you are right   182.28416035624753
is this the reason why grandpapa has made me share all his beverages during the last month   169.8770465475552
do you not perceive that we are opposite the hôtel d arguillon which is full of the cardinal s creatures   68.68797000265761
that is true said mousqueton glancing at his friend s long and thin body you will pass easily   158.2585739620796
what took place at portsmouth august 23 1628 chapter lx   213.8065320911881
indeed her brain was only the seat of vague ideas and confused forms mingled with strange fancies alone presented themselves before her eyes   85.37304619808161
the door at length was opened and a man appeared of high stature pale complexion and black hair and beard   122.97837428933842
how did these letters come   81.0187580197856
during the reading of this which was long the public attention was continually drawn towards andrea who bore the inspection with spartan unconcern   79.80942947151577
the next day m   179.65134422770808
his visage marked with brutal cruelty did not indicate age   124.27960197753654
no material obstacle separated them   105.12365070469659
you suit me very well   108.12917146604659
de villefort attracted by the noise appeared on the threshold   136.22709974390554
yes sir i know it replied the duke dipping the quill in the ink   152.3480971495705
but when it becomes known that he has been for eighteen years in the austrian service all that will be pardoned   103.25284538786637
and he pointed upwards   124.5935784319543
oh he won t return   107.02770695075716
he will not desert monsieur the cardinal be assured of that   122.8411762494418
be prudent in any event said the countess   125.86568032173022
i shall remain in italy for another year or two   89.22983733741192
the steward could not restrain himself   136.95343669550465
40252m that is quite my opinion said the gentleman   60.243377906768195
join the escort   116.95507801864561
he had asked for crawfish for his breakfast on the following morning   129.93607741290597
we shall then have six months before us   134.71090361383756
porthos smiled   110.23790143889896
she blushed and that she might not answer clasped her beautiful hands till her sharp nails almost pierced them   159.99581937082246
asked hermine trembling violently   104.55394719497315
aramis resumed his own attire and left juxon with the assurance that he might again have recourse to him   145.6949606979187
in the meanwhile franz was considering the singular shudder that had passed over the count of monte cristo at the moment when he had been in some sort forced to give his hand to albert   163.01370159461567
the host had not quite so good a bargain as he at first hoped for but he made amends by slipping in two bottles of anjou wine instead of two bottles of champagne   38.367014307831965
it was mousqueton who having no straw to lie upon had helped himself to that of the horses   12.13448456725861
ah my god my god   53.21264598106504
they are aiming they are going to fire   5.31636937723475
i not only permit i desire   92.83265999574765
and here we are at the ninth   67.94062075689575
faults or crimes responded monte cristo with a negligent air   205.4390307512652
doubtless answer me   49.886966312858334
poor queen   107.82271165558512
you seem to reverse ordinary customs and come home at the hour when other people are going out   191.55435058960643
at that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor and with many bows and courteous smiles the host of the pont du gard besought his guest to enter   139.1551415254948
how comes it that all do not retreat in aversion at sight of that flat receding serpent like forehead round vulture shaped head and sharp hooked nose like the beak of a buzzard   156.80361045758298
the evening at amiens   136.2445933431078
athos shuddered and turned pale   159.72820153698018
d artagnan would have remonstrated at this   52.562922483811164
do you hear nothing   123.73229776542709
the night gradually drew on and the foliage in the garden assumed a deeper hue   44.31883727943436
you did well   33.327609319581654
i think he is either a dull provincial person or a spy in search of information   156.04383244302758
20211m well said the count turning towards franz i told you there was some mistake in this   91.2517219063494
a rogue does not laugh in the same way that an honest man does   26.737596329736533
that gentleman appears to be well dressed for the first time in his life   138.89156862257127
the apparition as the procureur had told madame danglars valentine was not yet recovered   136.26900822241515
and if you do not give it up well   162.7589475994915
these three others fenced against him with their agile swords   86.29959693917696
said the young girl passing her hand across her burning forehead   79.60590661274351
monsieur he said after a moment they tell me great things of you   64.00374289977508
the blow was sped by d artagnan   162.55634398744652
noirtier did not lose a word of what valentine said   95.4249375586721
this is all very fine dear aramis murmured d artagnan   100.82395519852817
he described the death of the other soldier and the perils they had encountered   110.96098601815821
he stood watch day and night with a lance provided with a lighted slowmatch in his hand and he had orders to blow up everything kiosk guards women gold and ali tepelini himself at the first signal given by my father   117.85442534523821
monsieur said the baron to the duke all the servants of his majesty must approve of the latest intelligence which we have from the island of elba   93.8375117265694
no you will not die   80.85184965907504
really said madame de villefort whose eyes sparkled with strange fire at this conversation   137.62608993416785
yes forever   119.02662162818801
said d artagnan pulling up his horse which shied   63.356577515081966
let us drink to the prosperity of your establishment   115.06656545193484
go now at once or i shall have you put out   198.45210192733884
i don t very well know what but still something   121.16146501890546
i descended to the garden i dug a hole and then flung it down in haste   125.57550010257977
all foreign artists for as you may perceive i think but very indifferently of our french sculptors   99.26536749104217
it is my mother who dissents   149.69264052101678
baptistin said the count have the other fish brought in the sterlet and the lamprey which came in the other casks and which are yet alive   92.42911354435594
if you mean to buy any horses get them of devedeux and if you purchase a phaeton go to baptiste for it   151.72720474023845
he is a man of from fifty to fifty two years of age dark with black eyes covered with shaggy eyebrows and a thick moustache   76.3216038431175
i leave you to judge how far your nerves are calculated to bear you through such a scene   248.14522276736795
one only chance was left me that of beseeching the magistrate before whom i was taken to cause every inquiry to be made for the abbé busoni who had stopped at the inn of the pont du gard on that morning   78.70472488178366
the abbé s chamber chapter 18   118.45538191390872
pretend to sleep louis said she   100.88292022628708
the window whence the noise proceeded was opposite the opening by which the count could see into the dressing room   50.335209495008066
albert was silent   159.75771880835796
oh is this true what you say   95.04561955160634
and he returned d artagnan the ring without however ceasing to look at it   86.51789066042559
the beacon bathed with light the little strait through which they were about to pass and the rock where the young man stood with bare head and crossed arms   114.9083455199337
but now he s as gentle as a lamb and sings gascon songs which make one die of laughing   190.19342589571698
let me act as i please felton let me act as i please said milady elated   83.88463942544594
your majesty is well aware that there is a truce between us and the english army   71.28735232963146
what you find in your trunks   76.51527926086335
the whole army talked of this expedition for a day and monsieur paid him his compliments upon it   99.4021947679773
the sentinel was unwilling to leave his post but allowed parry to pass   193.92765203215674
there can be no more doubt on that head   74.15295885010902
mind aramis d artagnan smiled as he spoke since we are together again let us agree on one point what age shall we be in future   224.05520569183267
cried the crowd   166.9507695287939
all these corsicans are mad on my honor replied m   86.61548432633178
conspiracy chapter 5   143.4288762069452
my people could tell me nothing on that head   130.25063700106034
he had sent away his carriage with orders for it to fetch him at two o clock   124.56812946986697
ah my dear friend said madame danglars with the same simplicity we before noticed it is a fact   56.01934085731934
50231m maximilian said the count you should not look on the graves but there   87.82208152751825
go on go on said he between his teeth expend your ardor the first day   213.88770570746746
besides said aramis what prevents our being distrustful and going aboard at the same time   92.08847027107888
i wish you may my lord replied de rochefort   107.88720076618722
and look too though he is a prisoner how carefully he is dressed   176.4511170326327
the latter seemed to have resigned himself   111.86959906970796
ah madame danglars had risen and stood before the procureur whose hands she wrung in her feeble grasp   64.27963959136775
albert bowed with a smile to mademoiselle danglars who did not appear in the least disturbed and returned his bow with her usual coolness   97.33261342236165
a barrier had been placed between dantès and his old friend   193.75722751158088
they did not dare to ask him how he had slept   86.59513594087018
at any hour you will   164.4223821364314
in three days i should have been twenty   145.9146339874241
come let me show you my plan   65.40693720911709
when will it be our turn to think of these things   106.07130997813822
i do not know for i have never had it madame   118.66957632685279
wait till that time arrives and find out your friends   136.35538084599716
to find such a wife as my father found   168.81360611772223
well said he i will ask you the same question which charles ix   111.32414680673315
i inured my body to the most violent exercises my soul to the bitterest trials   84.10854491970485
d artagnan raised her by passing his arm round her waist   143.606245820842
then he remembered that these caves might have been filled up by some accident or even stopped up for the sake of greater security by cardinal spada   157.15420765805214
namely that the same day a great agitation was manifest in the house of peers among the usually calm members of that dignified assembly   164.4562911398091
but this creature must be a demon   68.77265821529953
to be sure i remember it all now   97.9444281500153
i hope you have no repugnance to accept me as your guardian in the interim   39.07610158994187
it is evident he has been brought up in a good school   94.81418407109261
dantès house you will be at rest   140.87234091340258
now guess what the young one did   107.28789982897675
she screamed my master is being arrested   140.55631837367514
there you see exclaimed danglars   170.03887112220738
his visits were tolerably regular though occasionally he appeared a little before or after his time but generally both in summer and winter he took possession of his apartment about four o clock though he never spent the night there   104.00220913918403
caderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand and swallowed the contents at a gulp   124.497452734513
adieu chevalier   124.77633003576133

can i trust in you   147.37865433873907
steel is for gentlemen   145.43372991082637
your quarrels with the parliament your noisy dissensions with the princes who fight for you to day and to morrow will fight against you the popular following directed by the coadjutor president blancmesnil and councillor broussel all that disorder in short which pervades the several departments of the state must lead you to view with uneasiness the possibility of a foreign war   146.1307118565559
it is now noon   89.14030838682292
she was pale and looked fatigued either from tears or want of sleep   95.24378008087866
your child your son your andrea   126.96084798819454
be satisfied monsieur said planchet you shall see if confidence can be placed in me   70.96646109124599
so that if this fail i am ruined completely ruined   91.9304085480083
noirtier although almost as immovable as a corpse looked at the new comers with a quick and intelligent expression perceiving at once by their ceremonious courtesy that they were come on business of an unexpected and official character   169.0266396434591
only he represented his action as one of simple vengeance   35.218043434565615
d artagnan and planchet spurred their steeds and took the road to paris   59.062106385540424
i understood that i had nothing to fear that i should neither be seen nor heard so i decided upon descending to the garden   76.38816988711015
then an invincible and extreme terror seized upon him and he dared not again press the hand that hung out of bed he dared no longer to gaze on those fixed and vacant eyes which he tried many times to close but in vain they opened again as soon as shut   68.9912010779232
monsieur baptistin especially   98.61021133686788
and in exchange for the sacrifice that you make gentlemen i promise not to reward you i believe that word would offend you but to love you as a sister to prefer you next to my husband and my children to every one   86.270293970982
that is also possible   134.24305458289683
a charming young man   79.3862445925364
then i have nothing more to do here   92.60818343349672
exceedingly replied franz   87.32478863765303
the old man died as i have told you   88.29762879443625
i will tell you replied the young girl for it is but right you should know   79.58992836868674
no said bonacieux but yesterday i went to st   163.69056950691532
why do you not join our party my dear beauchamp   50.06428929115352
by the aid of the lightning they perceived the village of erquinheim   128.4254110096708
but supplicants for favor know how to accommodate the expression of their features and the daughter of henry iv   140.30472214429372
wherever they are that s my business   86.3739670307487
and ready to be agreeable to you in any and every way replied dantès but ill concealing his coldness under this cloak of civility   88.30005070061378
haydée is a very uncommon name in france but is common enough in albania and epirus   3.3595540025572745
go upstairs she said to the doctor   56.747044829777245
replied the young men in chorus   117.7965635850664
you are speaking you scoundrel   19.699438669319306
grimaud had heard all this if he had not understood it   40.213021237054704
and she resumed her seat as if plunged in reflections entirely personal   31.513448849844792
and what name does the young man bear meanwhile   86.40115045481073
and it was milady who this time did all the honors of the evening   82.15260819299172
i have now been six years with m   74.88591758543359
doubtless too the horses on their part appreciated the eight hours of repose and the abundant stabling which was granted them   154.81943220612226
she is speaking said porthos   181.1296742786797
toward the end of the fourth day of the journey athos and aramis reached nanterre which place they cautiously passed by on the outskirts fearing that they might encounter some troop from the queen s army   17.624768465461315
these words were pronounced with that imperturbable phlegm which distinguished athos in the hour of danger and with that excessive politeness which made of him at certain moments a king more majestic than kings by birth   84.1988331487241
we have a precious fellow here   62.678518610129956
do not forget for a single instant that we are watching over your safety   166.04172226633295
i dance   27.065210004667065
i did not lose sight of him for an instant   119.4023304732312
but sir said planchet with a look of shrewdness i know where bazin is   130.44012258858837
what does he ask   46.12385038386414
yes i will tell you all   89.44019949213616
either the diplomatist must give his lessons gratis and i will tolerate him or he must never set his foot again in my house   105.21126815283206
and she remained in bed with her eyes fixed   80.95584630311312
continued caderousse   110.31393927555673
d artagnan put his hand to his sword motioning to porthos to follow his example   47.468405526117806
beppo has taken in plenty of others   154.95833506200037
the two serving men waited without   53.362992096659205
it was then that ali tepelini after having sent to the sultan a french officer in whom he reposed great confidence resolved to retire to the asylum which he had long before prepared for himself and which he called kataphygion or the refuge   134.7780510381919
but the words you have just spoken the hope you have almost given me will have richly paid all were it my life   103.0345432847966
he looked to me but tis impossible   96.04520497762644
his father was also a shepherd who owned a small flock and lived by the wool and the milk which he sold at rome   62.35698115544494
have you had it sent where we are to go for it   112.16985894389093
everyone is free to ask what he pleases   62.77156761116419
but since you go out with haydée and sometimes even take her to the opera well   139.72715405172286
he led the way toward the hill of saint roche   147.09363014334045
but you pay the score   86.37183590560042
nobody but ourselves replied caderousse   113.15869749718136
ah things go on gaily then said porthos   202.0512584833004
wild dreams had disturbed his repose   72.61119777013343
and by whom   127.2572781136581
felton walked into the sea up to his middle being unwilling to trust his precious burden to anybody   138.97152341230034
the king again shook hands with all three exchanged hats with winter and went out   65.5501090229397
some of those liquids are not only dangerous to taste but even to inhale   167.62106341307864
and placing the food on the rickety table he withdrew   117.37387517723309
the point was then to discover the hidden entrance   81.69712177597049
50271m then he said aloud listen morrel i see your grief is great but still you do not like to risk your soul   114.84133335640671
i then was ready to dismount but it was too late   199.1390916757075
he has come then as they told me   98.70342968649935
but i think that god has not pardoned me for the memory of that execution pursues me constantly and every night i see that woman s ghost rising before me   65.21809403120855
at the hour agreed upon aramis arrived   109.53611066344631
because answered the gascon we were sent porthos and i by cardinal mazarin to fight for cromwell   114.53175243293843
and when he shall know what you have done he will advise what you have to do   151.51352305968584
i wish to speak with this gentleman   119.82323493947328
i ask as your unfortunate companion appeared to me to belong to the church   119.16195972612715
bonacieux who convinced by what she had just said saw nothing in this woman whom an instant before she had believed her rival but a sincere and devoted friend   139.95430379876493
but the first was repugnant to him   77.06258777700357
i don t call those friends who betray and ruin you murmured the wife in her turn in a low muttering voice   72.45450080138677
well i who am a bonapartist also declare one thing to you which is that i will kill you   110.79574316568454
you have been preparing long enough my lord for it to be welcome to you now   116.99472607097368
decidedly aramis said athos i think i was wrong not to let you fire   86.7518419076405
the moment the hand of bonacieux sounded on the door the two young people felt their hearts bound within them   203.31909879899825
and whose horses are these   36.51058370297862
but consider the matter seriously eugénie   89.7391860230685
this fortress was his post as king s attorney all the advantages of which he exploited with marvellous skill and which he would not have resigned but to be made deputy and thus to replace neutrality by opposition   113.68577647761616
the count is in fashion   98.8410660099012
it is immediately and by a thunderbolt that i must repel the flash of lightning which for a moment startled me   110.36647213052316
of five millions and a half   161.5141803973202
what i have heard then from our good mother is true   155.07061797389474
but to their great surprise he took a glass in one hand and a flask in the other and filling it your health diavolaccio said he calmly and he drank it off without his hand trembling in the least   128.92293873885396
but what an awkward inelegant fellow he is   126.53512596128671
it was through haydée that the chamber was informed of his father s treason   134.51516202856294
how did this happen   46.37636260186939
but it is not they who taunt me with the most wounding reproaches but i understand   111.14640902565051
and he retired into his room without even asking the cause of so much noise   133.60878721748455
oh i have been base cowardly i tell you   103.43710388147048
chapter lii   149.53045994977558
tis done   85.41740188772856
you are to remain   137.78501350493573
the bandit raised his head   94.5983988990003
i wished to ask you if you ever feel any emotions of terror resembling remorse   152.14694179853376
you will do much better to open the window and let down some bread a chicken and a bottle of wine to your friend planchet who has been this last hour killing himself clapping his hands   68.08797257018125
yes my brother was her first lover and she caused his death   178.41371176180894
besides kitty would not like to live in the rue aux ours   108.07837887151572
his speech therefore was so well turned that in spite of the great wish felt by the courtiers to laugh they could find no point on which to vent their ridicule   176.59401873115354
do you recognize the carriage   104.2832135710926
laugh at the chance which has brought your friend near to you and monsieur du vallon instead of being in the depths of despair about it   97.92223493013546
so that in the last dose i ordered for him there were six grains   147.31733565817333
the swiss became as purple as a peony   153.49608617783247
but never mind   157.99950802262265
albert held his head between his hands   116.00378346653591
in the first place he had made rough work of it   98.98949667642887
idiot that i am though i have been trying to find it out for five years i never found it out   202.6685782710424
no i would wish you to reflect   115.87210370702175
the telegraph m   110.02957978962876
cucumetto   108.19452672994117
they will be gone   141.2698131454058
said felton passing his hands over his brow covered with sweat as if to remove his last doubt   63.202352307410386
he saw that the duke was searching for a means of making him accept something and the idea that the blood of his friends and himself was about to be paid for with english gold was strangely repugnant to him   123.586162506183
the piercing eye of peppino had noticed all   204.42510090837663
yes you will much oblige me   161.85048424738557
then turning to grimaud very good my friend very good   82.25099639040509
what he is   217.85800014772497
then caderousse feeling that he was leaving him raised himself on his elbow and with a dying voice cried with great effort murder   57.70624544293318
yes thought planchet to treat me as a prince   84.2845751562953
d artagnan thought it was some gossip who wanted news from the capital   20.241348532794817
the scotch army stood motionless and silent seized with shame at sight of these preparations   83.62332827276448
to speak to you about me   19.771177565919814
in military dress he was indeed as we have stated a very handsome man   122.74693317410858
but the queen would never forgive us and it is she whom we have to consider   148.93889962148478
he furnishes it it is true but he does not know that he has that honor   77.07465582576131
you know my theory regarding duels   69.67132831463243
what are we to do maltese   109.2725014015665
she belonged to one of the first families in italy i think did she not   86.98949909426169
decidedly said danglars with the perspiration on his forehead i must be under arrest   98.77185199761195
give up broussel   42.885270199220955
cried morrel in such a paroxysm of terror that monte cristo started he whom the falling heavens would have found unmoved   122.1987588988647
thank you i understand   102.70591005477526
yes said danglars but i confess i didn t quite comprehend its meaning   149.33843215365167
de morcerf i am referred to you said the countess   77.71680930678096
then said the prisoner let s think who it can be   126.62183597655884
father and son chapter 3   76.19662700372076
go to your father   104.0205955099467
said the procureur   48.75440967054434
i am come to fetch you monsieur d artagnan   119.1870090293844
the sepulchral depths of the descent were dimly lighted by a silver lamp on the lowest step   77.08264020893483
i only say they cost a load of money to hang and what is the use of them i should like to know   127.71356891551434
well go quickly   122.6871817657096
they gave all their fortune to the hospitals   90.41631305448757
much money to be gained   92.08876567182907
half a pistole if you can find out said d artagnan   140.81826491640095
well said the count you do not get out m   74.06064513296242
to do what   66.4573028325504
oh the voice of nature said monte cristo   155.89078142032756
you see there are two wanting   128.10248106323814
that admiration is on the contrary so great so real madame returned mazarin without noticing the change of language offered to him by the queen that if the king charles i   150.3016602957916
you are going sir   98.8991528848133
pray who may this famous luigi vampa be   115.91738832230992
he cried you have your promotion and i my barony   92.71686498870851
they had no plan ready they must think of one   69.74944768751777
was not faria s fate the better after all to solve the problem of life at its source even at the risk of horrible suffering   104.19814122236455
but at length became afraid that the duke if exasperated would commit some folly   104.47569808099675
thank you she said   134.0969518720757
at the same time the door of the study was burst open and a man covered with dust rushed into it exclaiming my lord the cardinal   65.78575754730636
but poor mousqueton whose only wish was to be called mouston was it not cruel to snatch him from the delightful state of peace and plenty in which he was   117.47374164102604
said gaetano with a smile   33.13214306855491
besides we can be on our guard   113.43717360242353
at last they lost sight of each other   150.07947221925974
i fear he may have been an ancestor of your eminence   152.50244068506194
in his mother s laboratory   119.50425772294803
however if i am not mistaken i must be close to tiboulen   39.53676103483407
the man who had performed this daring act with so much indifference wore the transtevere costume   124.65715547271562
d artagnan swept up the money that he and porthos had lost and buried it in his huge pocket   229.1793528694091
what could they take from me   82.60391410363658
asked the gascon   147.72271732659283
bravo athos   148.51431964527356
the marquis de saint méran i think the concierge said   182.16393994906588
while his name is not morcerf   157.21806896180527
said d artagnan planchet s recital agreeing with his own observations   201.98681322899017
i scarcely know him   58.87774880448527
de tréville much as he thus became certain that no foreign suggestion could insinuate itself between m   116.6326128200878
you have a good memory said mazarin   127.03453412558122
oh mercy mercy monsieur   55.24980401505723
our béarnais was a prudent lad however young he might be   85.32878051370123
well go and fetch them and come to my apartment   70.86267472054492
tis a very expensive wine said blaisois shaking his head   177.15236962692256
i go out   124.57812280656033
marseilles the arrival chapter 2   145.44605863555864
having delivered himself of this pompous address uttered with a degree of energy that left the baron almost out of breath he bowed to the assembled party and withdrew to his drawing room whose sumptuous furnishings of white and gold had caused a great sensation in the chaussée d antin   122.89329774765235
chapter 69   171.07363361029994
the major was about to speak when andrea continued in a low voice nonsense i am going to set you an example of confidence they give me 50 000 francs a year to be your son   125.39613804372631
at the same instant the woman inside drew a second handkerchief from her pocket and exchanged it for that which had just been shown to her   130.41599276422656
there are here no procurators who regulate successions beforehand   76.49672088649358
and does he imagine that the coadjutor will put himself out for him   164.69507064773632
the sign of the red dovecot meanwhile the king who with more reason than the cardinal showed his hatred for buckingham although scarcely arrived was in such a haste to meet the enemy that he commanded every disposition to be made to drive the english from the isle of ré and afterward to press the siege of la rochelle   77.87230632433145
then sight returned and with it feeling and grief   112.38285703422666
the carriage went off at a quick pace escorted by the three horsemen and all was over   101.92861131189575
at times the state into which i had fallen appeared so strange that i believed myself dreaming   75.72388148589296
the traveler made a sign of assent   145.03585034033435
his majesty has so good a heart that he can not understand hatred   91.93838689108276
golden dreams   211.57697614042536
that is quite another thing   140.01026881349745
and he let the corpse drop into the depths of the waters which closed over it   86.6066244525352
through you i again take hold on life through you i shall suffer through you rejoice   133.65183812579377
aramis blushed excessively and snatched rather than took the handkerchief from the hand of the gascon   160.33760193023846
what is the use of going to day to learn something else   109.14037482639368
what do you say athos to that proposition   92.09861539854717
this was more than poor bonacieux could endure depressed as he was by the successive emotions which he had experienced   173.54061697129566
this look of porthos s made the gascon regret that he had summoned the brute force of his friend to aid him in an affair which seemed to require chiefly cunning   79.24488952570076
a credit opened by thomson french of rome   41.15449043292978
having kings and better still queens to protect parties to unite elections to direct   142.946079986142
my chaise broke down coming into lilliers   145.19389545011512
the steward entered   110.47503273772637
in order doubtless that he might not be disturbed while fulfilling his sacred mission the priest rose as soon as d avrigny departed and not only bolted the door through which the doctor had just left but also that leading to madame de villefort s room   101.77803121193041
but would you believe it he was not receiving   63.139177500449506
yesterday for two hours i was at the church of saint philippe du roule and for two hours i prayed most fervently   72.23673337782682
but how can i pay them   118.05080521227448
a soldier of the french army   113.97089119167244
at the same moment an explosion was heard and the flooring of the room in which my father was sitting was suddenly torn up and shivered to atoms the troops were firing from underneath   61.412569959777244
he soon left the pathway of the patrol descended across the rocks and when arrived on the edge of the sea whistled   187.89005021298829
ten minutes had elapsed since the nurse had left   109.34510611469769
however i had better find him out first since he can t want money   138.26448136082723
yes continued mme   153.687207063019
he took her to his château and made her the first lady in the province   47.39666148707806
truth compelled franz in spite of the dislike he seemed to have taken to the count to confess that the advantage was not on pastrini s side   182.60788312195484
then observing in the countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded he deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show and therefore said speaking with a strong italian accent you are i presume m   125.49560790811063
and since he has sent for me it is doubtless to question me on what happened there   42.53835409779836
d artagnan turned toward her saying then send him away madame   52.95016366857746
i enjoy beforehand the face the cardinal will make   120.00617275671983
a fine thing indeed   121.24221096636298
no because i passed the night writing letters five and twenty despatches   176.04253302124351
two men wrapped in their cloaks appeared   11.805708183802182
d artagnan was still in deep thought when some one touched him on the shoulder   92.94076605913759
on the contrary you were in excellent spirits when you arrived at the count s   138.43465507763958
for though the night was well advanced when they reached the door of the hotel aramis said that he had certain important visits to make and left athos to enter alone   66.82266160049537
then a window was opened and when they saw and heard they were convinced   139.77805164708883
and also to remember that to you i am indebted even for my life   121.70066675526454
good day monsieur d artagnan said planchet proudly   89.6789263888488
when she saw him so miserable and heart broken having passed a sleepless night and not touched food since the previous day she wished him to go with her that she might take care of him   44.5542875324857
then de wardes to whom i have given three sword wounds   188.63816136267585
my lord do you remember the little goat pasture of the luxembourg   93.53768507308294
the king s closet at the tuileries we will leave villefort on the road to paris travelling thanks to trebled fees with all speed and passing through two or three apartments enter at the tuileries the little room with the arched window so well known as having been the favorite closet of napoleon and louis xviii   81.29085884282534
and the third time made this large wound   108.52699825703066
well i am come to ask a favor of you   8.291456209109683
one of your boarders   89.82124399089183
if i am not mistaken we have to do with a gentleman   113.38383126938008
was the reply i can do that when we get there   156.84650103742803
during the drive night had set in and darkness gave the surroundings the artificial appearance of a scene on the stage   118.92364707664801
sit down my dear friend and let us talk   33.071945416459116
eleven o clock sounded   109.26635862521809
and was he not the person who was assassinated one evening on leaving a bonapartist meeting to which he had been invited on the supposition that he favored the cause of the emperor   74.35566147332311
who went out this morning   115.71500290494753
you see i have been a soldier ever since i attained manhood   145.76818627139613
d artagnan added m   89.86915529214996
another i disarmed or wounded i don t remember which   127.90889680777099
then why did you smile   35.2401984234605
come sweep away all that for me   128.67416051909214
you can not tell me   4.818485236927643
i will read you the first canto   135.94241705703647
one arm was hanging out of the bed   122.23901479004171
foils boxing gloves broadswords and single sticks for following the example of the fashionable young men of the time albert de morcerf cultivated with far more perseverance than music and drawing the three arts that complete a dandy s education i   85.4472675093808
i fancy i perceive around us faces of different officers in the royal army   132.02824359110562
not so bad said beauchamp   182.29725900252294
porthos gave a start that shook the room   113.91945438223694
on leaving these ladies he found himself with danglars who had advanced to meet him   103.83838394985617
do you know why   161.00465536067955
this is where the mad abbé was kept sir and that is where the young man entered   147.25023328992543
well my dear mouston he said rest satisfied   111.75714750597608
ah haitians that is quite another thing   101.35180382114567
my dear beauchamp i wish you to contradict this statement   131.3463397513371
still by one of your forty methods your highness   56.57163075572057
your hand madame your hand and i depart   32.22700838136204
i called to you but you did not answer me   60.25018555152036
villefort looked at the count almost with terror   98.00509897608333
and two or three heads carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment appeared through the openings of the tapestry   201.70888371333507
d artagnan blushed with pleasure and bowed a sign of assent   133.7002532110873
but she was cruelly and promptly undeceived   141.99951288392455
i would make your fortune   86.45589445612893
at the moment caderousse quitted his sentry like watch before the door the road on which he so eagerly strained his sight was void and lonely as a desert at midday   72.03622547942143
yet one wants some one besides you for that my fine king s cockatoo   175.38247758320978
the sentinel opened the door   164.8564268473438
the miraculous return of napoleon has conquered me the legitimate monarch is he who is loved by his people   196.47200627365635
but we were not captured by fair means   137.79235205757638
as soon as there was room for rowing his companion rejoined him and the boat began to move more rapidly   140.9015359984046
lock and padlock were fastened   117.31012358799066
ex major in the austrian service   88.89856512356508
you are a simpleton said athos   88.25071527207238
he cast his eyes around and saw the horn full of powder which his friend jacopo had left him   182.7388236799828
the father of m   112.27775905772887
and i he said i feel that my place is not in the judge s seat but on the prisoner s bench   148.48351316419604
as he spoke two horsemen advanced at full speed   59.55146957340291
the clear and vigorous intellect of athos would render him more open to conviction than a less able man would be   99.03675177657227
as the last stroke died away i saw a faint light shine through the windows of the private staircase by which we have just descended   171.21592441163375
go monsieur duke and return often   105.82372653456923
at the noise of m   70.31028260690903
i know she was loaded with cotton and that she took in her freight at alexandria from pastret s warehouse and at smyrna from pascal s   122.18354641941826
the smugglers left with edmond what he had requested and set sail but not without turning about several times and each time making signs of a cordial farewell to which edmond replied with his hand only as if he could not move the rest of his body   144.92237141239974
no certainly not and from this moment i will endeavor to model myself after him   113.59703207115183
i am going to give you a proof replied the count and he rang the bell   197.84330643143628
he therefore found d artagnan alone and as it was nearly eight o clock he took the young man with him   45.8410068314011
now continued penelon you see m   79.04424060913735
why is not grimaud the taciturn grimaud here   102.44467698014249
he was dressed in violet tinted velvet trimmed with silk of the same color   71.02184569832505
dessessart s men   120.18445588874148
he s a fine looking fellow said another   83.18572566007373
yes so it is between perfectly upright people   176.04966078144787
her hair was raven black but its natural waves seemed somewhat rebellious   132.76030308796334
and i did not recognize them   175.96753924487496
perhaps by the time you return to paris i shall be quite a sober staid father of a family   56.20850065502755
the cemetery of père lachaise m   164.50179578646419
do not fear i will bury my grief so deep in my heart i will disguise it so that you shall not even care to sympathize with me   82.022797190884
we want men of talent   53.67959882057471
he seemed to fulfil the duties of a host by sitting down with his guests and awaited their departure to be served with some strange or more delicate food   160.1696183298733
they proceeded to the rue saint denis   170.38696772897794
he was not exemplary for piety he was not easily impressed but valentine suffering weeping wringing her hands before him was more than he could bear in silence   215.8704747496055
imagine to yourself a don quixote of eighteen   67.50692690760502
so that day and night the bell was ringing full swing announcing the extreme desire for mortification which the penitent experienced   183.58171693440428
de tréville entered   169.04206551662247
from london   154.72095730707196
it had been said that evening a hundred times and scarron was at his hundredth bon mot on the subject   118.89322361249654
each was anxious to gain admission before the other   194.35155766121278
suggested athos   137.78589273372572
chapter 11   113.94177485516167
de tréville slept still worse   154.14818775786057
go and lose not a moment   100.6843212735684
well at twenty nine i saw valentine   129.60432037159887
dantès paused a moment then said this is it word for word the king s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion that one edmond dantès mate on board the pharaon this day arrived from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo has been intrusted by murat with a packet for the usurper   107.38160873221706
d artagnan departed scarcely knowing what to think but as he was a youth who did not easily lose his head while continuing to pay his court to milady he had framed a little plan in his mind   110.15900957928723
full dress   90.22288942635184
i can recognize the flavor of the alcohol in which it has been dissolved   86.6741846259273
yes replied all the members of the committee of inquiry with a unanimous voice   134.23758937762963
as for andrea who was calm and more interesting than ever he left the hall escorted by gendarmes who involuntarily paid him some attention   112.51921647544336
the king and his escort have gone this way   161.41599001490397
and du vallon   93.15708187091207
but in what then shall we place confidence if not in the most beautiful work of the lord   84.88937923168407
here is my bed replied planchet producing a bundle of straw   106.68095564314015
meantime his eminence continued his melancholy ride murmuring between his mustaches these four men must positively be mine   79.60470319311997
nothing but the recollection of his oath gave him strength to proceed   120.46265458759979
i thought there were four of you   78.29989197966427
but you know how the theologians in their collegiate chairs and philosophers in their controversies occasionally say cruel truths   170.61911167073993
then tell me who you are and get along with you upon your journey replied the duchess with the gayety which made her so charming for i am sufficiently in bad odor already without compromising myself still more   67.70068285227609
i made the tenant sign the deed of resilition and when i had obtained what i so much wanted i galloped to auteuil   135.9420524219766
may not barrois the old servant have made a mistake and have given madame de saint méran a dose prepared for his master   58.603677447711405
he remembers that i saved his life and as he has a regard for his head he feels some gratitude towards me for having kept it on his shoulders   35.85657550008828
asked he of edmond   92.26906903579065
we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance   145.5663623018226
i trust you will allow me to recompense worthily the devotion of your man   38.31847119663219
sir returned the young man with a reassurance of manner make your mind easy on this score   113.37832939655065
those at the side   68.61924747316147
of course complete ones   101.49270099291334
what did the cardinal say about me   134.94895910688638
you are a demon escaped from hell whither we send you back again   163.1182757643016
danglars again became pale and hastened to conduct the count out   155.9328068445765
those in whom the king has confided lord leven s highlanders   144.02697047262293
that is to say an active and gallant cavalier already weak of body but sustained by that moral power which made of him one of the most extraordinary men that ever lived preparing after having supported the duc de nevers in his duchy of mantua after having taken nîmes castres and uzes to drive the english from the isle of ré and lay siege to la rochelle   118.97389372634709
d artagnan watched over the youth as if he had been his own son   67.014549858888
the idea of resisting her father her grandmother and all the family had never occurred to her   114.16994681618462
he waited in order to allow pure air to displace the foul atmosphere and then went on   96.88462956625446
then monsieur said planchet you must buy me a watch   94.09718830380348
the aperture of the rock had been closed with stones then this stucco had been applied and painted to imitate granite   18.745066733356353
but on the contrary the particulars which are given prove that fernand mondego raised by ali pasha to the rank of governor general is no other than count fernand of morcerf   124.74582921647557
sire stammered the baron   201.56865350202324
but who is she   115.79118567487457
but alas this attempt to attract notice wholly failed   61.65815233793657
have i not told you already that i had nothing to do with that   27.602991671192157
don t you remember porthos we saw her at general cromwell s   136.85447590713957
as you please sir said franz   99.72183155420397
she appeared much dejected   113.86853820053449
it being at the same time perfectly understood that he should have been duly fortified against the poison to which he had not been accustomed   134.05413352997104
six months afterwards continued caderousse the marriage took place in the church of accoules   85.25058093429392
he resolved then to defend the door bravely   164.5984299581627
i ruined   71.8169887129356
the request was granted   126.98293194557596
i swear i will by heaven   94.14811786621814
it is nearly eight o clock and at nine i expect a visit   95.40781640508476
look at monsieur mouston see the honorable wounds he has received observe how his habitual valor has given dignity to his countenance   43.41614544694254
he stopped at the end of the corridor and said i can count upon you gentlemen can i not   94.4221063110212
exclaimed athos anxiously   43.14355119768635
it s true though said porthos   37.89931744572469
thomson french   32.195977294224534
then mine is the boat you want sir   109.66388614701773
a door that communicated with the palais de justice was opened and they went through a long range of gloomy corridors whose appearance might have made even the boldest shudder   151.78882357278718
listen then lord winter   72.8396041642703
the count hastily descended presented himself at the already opened carriage door and held out his hand to a young woman completely enveloped in a green silk mantle heavily embroidered with gold   140.16566679728808
with a word d artagnan reassured them   203.77326419984632
ah don t touch me pray don t   105.91831832650186
from france   118.27545749121514
monsieur i followed them from curiosity so that i saw the combat without the combatants seeing me   99.05926702701504
allow me porthos said aramis   130.17658217493542
peace brought her abdication   143.4933368246581
when the wretched man again opened his eyes the count looked at him with a mournful expression of pity and his lips moved as if in prayer   90.07881484060503
my lord said d artagnan i have an appointment in two hours which i can not miss   75.64026493895483
you came through meung where something befell you   91.3508533733627
it was one o clock in the morning   117.58156988156868
his eyes dilated and a shudder ran through his body   61.27751919328945
why has she not written to me then   157.7772008390715
now recalling former times of mutual distress i send you half my purse   126.98949667515485
de morcerf approached her   173.03275375193087
perhaps you will think sir that prosperity has spoiled me   121.76840974676469
ah my dear fellow excuse me   79.29085358898
it is not for nothing we are but twenty years old above all if we were born at tarbes   77.90800891109708
she wept abundantly   243.35504454568087
i have served always in the infantry   82.98107637140399
morrel repeated   89.71969162429251
then it will be tomorrow   123.39488742743238
penelon said the captain i think we are sinking give me the helm and go down into the hold   161.92630512862814
the vision had fled   165.2133918187689
george villiers duke of buckingham mme   91.49944567706218
this morning i awoke at six o clock   119.37832226758319
one of the officers went to the place i directed   154.25743246495733

i go said he   166.79738344419374
he wants to be sure that i go away said d artagnan to himself   84.8438370741851
that is he that is he   170.99591600538793
yes but when once they are hamstrung our necks will be strung next   148.08527512120196
at this moment danglars who had been incessantly observing every change in fernand s look and manner saw him stagger and fall back with an almost convulsive spasm against a seat placed near one of the open windows   115.48487338098144
what do you think of it my little fellow   123.35591062184604
i am going on a journey dear child said monte cristo with an expression of infinite tenderness and melancholy   184.15548006208297
sooner said aramis   151.8912488087562
flourens in consequence of the rabbits cats and guinea pigs they have killed   47.67028541293678
i faith no said d artagnan   144.8214934536129
had his majesty asked he any intention of holding this hunting party yesterday   103.22092951757654
you may join me at the hôtel des gardes   148.82795873157318
she gave so much vehemence such magnetic eloquence to this exclamation that felton in spite of himself advanced some steps into the room   158.2790061735292
that is not the custom excellency said peppino   119.73445616944672
you want the cardinal to come here   123.00879954892201
hunger made viands once repugnant now acceptable   161.0664664886909
has any horse got loose   115.64348372193076
wait wait young man   167.13765787696408
bertuccio s forehead was covered with perspiration   93.16015039402302
we shall arrive at eight o clock   79.6286460946153
i will go immediately and inform him of your arrival   118.43830056897302
he looked around him and saw mme   132.81890061598386
had a thunderbolt fallen into the room villefort could not have been more stupefied   78.58004805175068
maybe the same fate awaits us two paces hence   68.16384822793518
summoned by m   168.00112023564463
you see therefore continued the cardinal perceiving d artagnan s composure that as i have told you the welfare of the state is placed in your hands   141.8387070207894
morrel my thanks are due   74.63794815748295
my life belongs to my cash   140.93362838148914
besides do you know what is our situation and whether mazarin s arrest wouldn t be rather an encumbrance than an advantage   134.79250666352203
i had announced you beforehand to my friends as an enchanter of the arabian nights a wizard of the middle ages   169.84619610082572
you have no idea what a false look you have particularly when you are afraid   153.5334092154901
at length he said then you abandon all hope of escape   137.113959973525
such as at the commencement of the repast had not been able to seat themselves according to their inclination rose unceremoniously and sought out more agreeable companions   123.9139619321598
now we are on the right scent   66.79046765288726
so i have been told already monseigneur cried bonacieux giving his interrogator the title he had heard the officer give him but i swear to you that i know nothing about it   28.890595742179087
your majesty continued the coadjutor pitilessly is about to take such measures as seem good to you but i foresee that they will be violent and such as will still further exasperate the rioters   142.70355442122548
said rochefort you are right   129.6930122205749
i must refer again to the club in the rue saint jacques   70.54763239301609
the gnawing pain at his stomach had ceased   66.06939337560732
you are captain mordaunt   101.97491492105472
well then let us sup   106.48960629527693
courtiers becoming every instant more numerous succeeded one another day and night in the little house of the bridge of la pierre in which the cardinal had established his residence   116.62938591376876
at seven o clock he and raoul directed their steps to the rue des tournelles   166.47030486385069
chancellor said the queen turning to seguier our old acquaintance you will open the conferences   129.34054711135312
they had agreed to see the carnival at rome that year and that franz who for the last three or four years had inhabited italy should act as cicerone to albert   79.95031148425412
he is dead my lord   13.205906896425589
i must live henceforth without rank and fortune and to begin this hard apprenticeship i must borrow from a friend the loaf i shall eat until i have earned one   129.73729219611133
athos remained alone in the vast chamber where according to the cardinal s directions he was treated with all the courtesy due to a nobleman   100.13140606069595
said villefort with a sneer   138.6865716953476
charles was impatiently awaiting his return   124.64572569800791
andrea cavalcanti to m   48.962186948129904
you know the marquis of saint méran died a few days after he had set out on his journey to paris and the marchioness a few days after her arrival   156.43372388260596
my arm and my life belong to you like my love   167.71654576934264
you refuse me my liberty   60.47138542317513
the host approached with hesitation   176.93252431234487
faria smiled encouragingly on him and the young man retired to his task in the spirit of obedience and respect which he had sworn to show towards his aged friend   137.47387932361642
think it   169.01409503626806
where were you placed   96.02810083691496
the felucca went on the boat continued stationary rocked only by the swashing waves   101.44143441163584
i must go to paris   184.6416691224686
and the king went out of the room without either embracing his mother or even bowing to the cardinal   144.8432446173653
no madame replied monte cristo   80.8022048891657
one morning my father sent for us   94.34434588725317
you know what is agreed upon between you athos and me   93.58879233554612
instead of following the knot of prisoners that were being taken into the town mordaunt turned his steps toward the rising ground from whence cromwell had witnessed the battle and on which he had just had his tent pitched   165.56861410363598
now as i dislike him and hope his railway his electric telegraph or his search for baths will ruin him i am watching for his discomfiture which must soon take place   83.97855309704526
then turning to faria i inquired if you are well fed   112.25004601935314
who told you that   64.52839637265484
porthos and aramis regarded each other not understanding this assurance of athos   106.51005018511593
you are all mistaken gentlemen answered athos gravely   176.00077023112863
one never knows what may happen   83.63849726718887
maximilian tried to speak but he could articulate nothing   151.08703929272312
beware d artagnan beware said aramis   117.68251356710552
explain to me why going out of this chamber isn t everything   91.99930886752037
now is that all   127.75098830226476
he has composed two or three comic operas written four or five articles in the siècle and voted five or six years on the ministerial side   144.16896622443363
yes pardieu   85.70149687315431
fear nothing there is a watch over you   61.51378990749902
oh do not deny it   138.37284156921044
non inutile desiderium oblatione   145.60046470547363
but he did not appear to notice that he was the object of general attention but began to arrange with so much cleverness nicety and gayety his straw bed that the mouths of all these poor creatures who could not go to sleep began to water   49.088852729336786
interrupted porthos   136.50798108081855
you see that we are very humble monarchs sir   138.83372401969834
0133m sire i listen said de blacas biting his nails with impatience   87.21720505898188
never fear   153.68430822880882
since you demand my resignation i retire   24.161888942913635
she wished to know when her lover would meet her a second night   54.878348693462534
of how many does it consist   93.16055283845583
as to athos he remained unmoved   85.42235275455259
you are indeed the most beautiful and most noble woman i ever saw   132.26232401855663
well have you tied the knot   85.80706922608411
i am not obliged to read any breviary   138.9907494910697
you go to madame de bois tracy s the cousin of madame de chevreuse and you pass for being far advanced in the good graces of that lady   109.62583891761268
number 34 and number 27 chapter 16   121.30492975163347
the shot had frightfully lacerated her throat leaving two gaping wounds from which as well as the mouth the blood was pouring in floods   63.56214586276203
ah i know her by name   139.09368343759758
the musketeer was introduced to m   125.60782314532888
behind the luxembourg   128.60922051624198
on your honor is that true   129.830493784834
my steward transacts all this business for me   134.57433622682316
and without adding another word grimaud profiting by the astonishment and terror into which he had thrown his auditors rushed from the room   127.77651234167311
felton and he addressed patrick the duke s confidential lackey at the same moment   104.66633557752697
she did not please   127.98742354255631
edmond it is not madame de morcerf who is come to you it is mercédès   113.52308964208326
selim had also recognized him but the brave young man only acknowledged one duty which was to obey   131.88112461090566
but he was continually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion and anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy   91.25077056397379
not even for fifteen years wages   39.88169156295679
recollect our only desire is to carry out in a fitting manner the last wishes of our friend   129.34751735669664
but they appear to speak french with a very pure accent said danglars   179.150611387963
from whom may the letter be you bear to his eminence   176.72818949798946
but you will not leave me   147.57182692731928
then they drew near to each other and smilingly exchanged their letters   87.60729628688135
that is the misfortune   119.35120662572257
have me arrested on the part of the queen said he and i i will appeal to his eminence   24.950764172356443
those beer drinkers are too clumsy and awkward   81.71354058844439
the voice that implored aid was so piteous that it awakened pity in the heart of athos   64.12119351291308
the king took advantage of this favorable moment to tell her that he had the intention of shortly giving a fête   105.20022084267131
yes my lord replied the servant m   165.944407232835
i want to be enlightened on a subject   63.60254825842633
you would not have me marry under such sad auspices   147.28712693098595
i know that he is in high favor with charles i   68.82485513869585
edmond and mercédès were clasped in each other s arms   153.33683512702126
these three hundred livres he reckoned upon putting snugly into his pocket   96.08880144658745
it alarmed d artagnan more than a menace would have done for it was a warning   146.98192495554218
he composed with a little groom named john and who only spoke english all albert s establishment although the cook of the hotel was always at his service and on great occasions the count s chasseur also   92.69878606885854
let me look at that sapphire again   93.6193506372111
this is all i know but i know not count how you contrived to inspire so much respect in the bandits of rome who ordinarily have so little respect for anything   87.84704390706614
the soldiers interposed their bayonets for they thought that he was about to attack the inspector and the latter recoiled two or three steps   94.76007603778915
only he begged his former master to set out in the evening for greater security to himself   112.83211189152563
d artagnan returned to change his workman s clothes for his chestnut colored suit and porthos to put on his red doublet   70.02034317194514
he no longer possessed strength will power or feeling   72.88965893719629
the workmen   39.594413148551965
i think so truly   123.04807058877964
i will tell him my gloomy story   107.75312950527966
a dungeon   157.71818864296813
do you think of escaping in the same way   82.89033890618572
but thanks to this diamond replied the young man   74.561354555117
such learning is very rare among ladies   243.6297978359442
while he was doing this d artagnan having no better employment amused himself with beating a march upon the window and with looking at the musketeers who went away one after another following them with his eyes until they disappeared   61.849302659696
for my own part i protest that should i ever go to corsica my first visit ere even i presented myself to the mayor or prefect should be to the bandits of colomba if i could only manage to find them   163.63594178792096
the sea immediately rose to his waist   128.81260117793346
the abbé replaced the large spectacles which covered not only his eyes but his temples and sitting down motioned to his visitor to do the same   37.7438289366187
now if i die say to d artagnan that i love him as a son and embrace him for me   97.0171077403986
de tréville which proved to be in the rue du vieux colombier   65.37990043781735
thank you la ramee said the prisoner   148.69987156259555
your lordship may be assured that it requires more than the tricks and coquetry of a woman to corrupt me   31.029536489154907
and setting the example he plowed his oar into the sea   132.01308095928823
at these cries all who were in the hôtel rushed out and fell upon the four companions who on their side cried aloud to the rescue musketeers   89.9766514233973
well sirs   131.8072905760715
now said monte cristo that you have fortified yourself against all painful excitement prepare yourself my dear m   148.76055925977184
none whatever replied the other drawing his sword and resting the point on his boot   85.58790777015876
noirtier had once made a will against you against your family in favor of the poor in fact   135.9065121961304
said the concierge   27.41175993067617
imitate me   188.38483776826413
the balls might be heard peppering the facade of the palais royal and one of them passing under d artagnan s arm entered and broke a mirror in which porthos was complacently admiring himself   148.64832379969556
both laid themselves down on the divan   47.0158317556384
what do you want of me   88.67576992091409
is there any officer belonging to this company in the ante chamber   118.25078384674426
i have been looking for him but without success   113.8443858056867
for i believe if he does not pay us we shall be well enough paid by another party   158.11275117152928
then ring at his door if you please and request him to be so kind as to give me an audience   142.65026172813552
de tréville launched it with knowledge of his cause   160.77783273471533
you love me   173.6317805424394
when you please said d artagnan   172.08273208906934
her mouth was small and rosy   134.35535157331663
as for the count of monte cristo he had never for an instant shown any appearance of having been moved   92.60708273917851
indeed do not be alarmed if i do not come at all   122.22512381469781
you surely are not in earnest   94.27219083465965
i will undertake that   57.704251131001236
one word more said monte cristo   111.27262903267528
and what is the most important affair to a woman of twenty five   162.00979171908588
ah said d artagnan is that the way you return to your apartment   129.82136219365412
50155m well be it so   142.39863457026038
grimaud meantime undid the means of escape   57.81746403009359
what do you mean monsieur   232.12493513425213
do you not know that we italians have eyes only for the man we love   127.08986415190115
but it appeared we had chosen an unlucky moment for at the first word on the subject he sent us to all the devils   3.813075824300526
no gentlemen it seems to be the result of certain propositions which mazarin made last night to the parisians   157.90185296705067
it will be sooner over than devouring me piecemeal   136.76480668790703
save me gentlemen for the love of heaven save me   108.60870715619829
going along d artagnan shaking his head said i know that my going to athos is useless and absurd   113.32551684329923
you saw the person   46.706010608502055
and what have i to do with your ill humor   141.1665112297458
eh no   96.63217411189343
oh my king said parry with tears in his eyes and in a tone of supplication do not look to the left as we leave the hall   132.21365481601742
repeat your story saint laurent replied the man turning to the originator of the tale   94.66332051302372
as night closed in they arrived at thirsk   110.1269323430906
cavalcanti and gives him fifty thousand francs for it   85.8185635412885
you only know that this money exists   158.7215016980566
this was the abbé scarron always laughing joking complimenting yet suffering and toying nervously with a small switch   163.99496099691225
but as for me by holy truth i did not know it and i thought i would give you good advice   78.8572106461178
such was the count s yes   42.76982325415473
matters are going all right   134.6418763347158
you are wrong my lord   78.13787557772216
in that case we are as well off as we wish   133.9640605104203
when we observed this to him he told us all to trouble ourselves about our own business as this horse belonged to him   106.22773569154904
there is quite a style about them   64.02818902402316
then she suddenly cried oh no no   126.19632482977796
when ali was wanted one stroke was given two summoned baptistin and three bertuccio   138.84053525873304
the young men looked at each other   125.80439244153727
the timely arrival of d artagnan in paris   160.41073845108772
suddenly a voice was heard at the wicket   28.110731117718004
his excellency did not charge me to purchase this house   155.51037998561696
i understand it   148.46501589804802
they say joy never hurts and so i came to you without any warning   111.80117889707508
meanwhile barrois had returned for the first time to old noirtier who having heard the noise in the house had as we have said sent his old servant to inquire the cause   175.27019804979267
not so loud father i entreat of you for your own sake as well as mine   65.98643269448516
i carried it in my hand   140.02296999934052
what influence can i possibly have over a bandit   168.3049674177974
sir let me see my right hand correspondent   130.57661114327385
perhaps you may not have to retract   117.168021875152
the mourning in her heart forbade her assuming this simple ornament though she had not yet had time to put on the outward semblance of woe   106.52227905821374
asked monsieur de cavois   97.52078174005766
but pray sit down   110.04427538688444
albert had followed the footman and hearing the order given forced the door open and followed by beauchamp found himself in the banker s study   110.62598228503117
at this speech of aramis the brow of athos became clouded and he bit his lips   94.65437247850241
milady frowned slightly   183.19353258989025
i will tell you in two words sir   105.40173634881458
he clung to one idea that of his happiness destroyed without apparent cause by an unheard of fatality   118.06568864881729
where must we place him   123.33864711374923
the baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt while her husband affecting not to observe this unconjugal gesture turned towards monte cristo and said upon my word count i am quite sorry not to have met you sooner   158.6794436153127
athos and aramis were more and more astonished   111.69874753931249
and one of the great military enterprises of the cardinal   135.52331014389446
inquired the priest   31.80164617524646
this time there was no longer any doubt   62.444861780814826
it will be the surest plan   84.76510168078586
my faith monsieur with great pleasure   120.71742256938845
it is well for albert he is not in the army said morrel   129.02203841269483
ah monsieur bonacieux i never did love you much but now it is worse than ever   120.41402309211851
in consequence after having traveled all night at seven o clock she was at the fort of the point   170.8608149188587
in a few minutes valentine re entered the garden alone   149.42822824629974
what more   126.5000182446579
i am no longer astonished that you knew me not   45.09946302628346
de tréville s hôtel at least i have entered upon my apprenticeship haven t i   166.48211273646243
but the partition was so thin that one could hear nearly all that passed between the two women   107.81601796424049
the rest concerns myself   149.57449361978286
i can not resist doing so   103.99276897189296
but tell me said andrea am i to remain bareheaded   44.9107274841528
it was this that while you had related to me all the particulars of your past life you were perfectly unacquainted with mine   118.28364362515526
they mounted again at once whilst looks of admiration passed between them   47.946134789538036
the very animals we were speaking of harnessed to the count s carriage   107.29153005349663
we may well pity the poor fellows   192.23255180711152
monte cristo took the pistols he held in his hand when mercédès entered and fixing an ace of clubs against the iron plate with four shots he successively shot off the four sides of the club   216.2934187614733
here they found only one inn in which was consumed a liqueur which preserves its reputation to our time and which is still made in that town   72.03865050823045
felton then had spoken in her favor since lord de winter had not been willing to listen to him   119.25624051079527
villefort rushed upstairs to fetch him   112.40350289817495
but beyond this he was ignorant   200.2888832032455
and yet i have punished her i have dared to tell her i have repent and die   121.58669558682419
they passed to the third story   57.66798645810424
then d avrigny spoke   127.8315998474345
and were it not for the windows at the palazzo rospoli by way of recompense for the loss of our beautiful scheme i don t know but what i should have held on by my original plan   98.2475013753795
how is it arranged   108.571972748268
the count s tutor was well acquainted with the country   188.16996663087397
they use force the scoundrels   172.04824718536122
at this instant m   162.5338262107383
his colleagues looked at him and doubtless pitied his prospects blighted under the perfumed breath of a woman   123.74132149806675
to saddle   45.08201318730427
we will be his guards monsieur upon our word as gentlemen   85.42026930548721
have you been to the general   168.15310987096242
you will excuse my leaving you said the count turning in the direction of his box   69.21846565837726
the blood no longer flowed from his wounds   102.42519213891974
18 lake maggiore   107.94350129342047
ah said d artagnan i did not see that   89.69043859130059
and had they not known it for a fact this would have told them that de chatillon and de flamarens had been there   38.41450950289499
i fancy i have seen him before   44.337991976865894
it was said that she had poisoned her second husband   117.3409574766583
at once   11.482257773909623
it is an unheard of fatality   48.40886471026273
in contrast with the old man who is dragging his way to the tomb are two children just entering into life valentine the daughter by my first wife mademoiselle renée de saint méran and edward the boy whose life you have this day saved   156.50577547642536
she takes a pleasure in my conversation   9.852679252984174
it is to be to morrow said aramis hastily   39.71152345097889
it was like having a spy in the enemy s camp   151.78023236681736
he returned thus formidable and implacable advancing with his arms crossed on his breast towards the general who could not understand why he had disappeared but who on seeing him again and feeling his teeth chatter and his legs sink under him drew back and only stopped when he found a table to support his clenched hand   92.58062497790257
no madame replied the novice only i thought i had chosen my time ill   142.83833098509982
i am not a fighting man at all monsieur and i am afraid of the bastille   185.5743815447097
everything conspired to prove to d artagnan that his presentiments had not deceived him and that a great misfortune had happened   115.54222149276009
she dreamed don carlos had returned to spain   89.77380321712644
cried she is it you   175.23468558112924
repeated a voice behind the count and why   176.93343555342022
tis well said athos i will take care of that   144.95336811664026
and he hastened to the door   163.25765326814997
d artagnan nodded his head and bazin retired after placing on the table the spanish wine   90.99910014409814
the worthy man restored to perfect health was tasting the fine fruit which madame de longueville had sent to him   151.71541494176944
he followed him   76.56791312381452
the count is very temperate   117.3929011800166
well sir the rupture of a blood vessel on the lobe of the brain has destroyed all this not in a day not in an hour but in a second   81.47300262856118
take him alive   160.05695183437635
the man was wrapped up in a large cloak   107.19952893785381
ah that would be a great pity said villefort   97.31727285022879
only some said he was worth millions and others that he did not possess a farthing   177.97207332259745
firstly i wish to communicate   124.60738214096853
i should be glad to know what connection there can possibly be between your sickly sentimentality and the affairs of the state   140.22590169222764
in something else in something else   70.80786711388254
it turned out as d artagnan had foreseen   99.33093446539841
one might believe this is an allusion to the queen mother   136.14178266996805
then as the half hour had already glided by he crossed the gallery and knocked at the cardinal s door   75.16830586453108
we had forgotten to say that jacopo was a corsican   81.01220026548093
a violent convulsion shook his whole frame his eyes started from their sockets his mouth was drawn on one side his cheeks became purple he struggled foamed dashed himself about and uttered the most dreadful cries which however dantès prevented from being heard by covering his head with the blanket   101.30339764989068
to danglars monte cristo also wrote requesting him to excuse the whimsical gift of a capricious millionaire and to beg the baroness to pardon the eastern fashion adopted in the return of the horses   145.28281049735835
why you know i told you replied danglars that i considered the circumstance of his having anchored at the island of elba as a very suspicious circumstance   71.85789618709201
but who are those others   98.74556649421908
what has become of them   156.6465604886092
coquenard repaired trembling to the cloister of st   151.01683938758083
our gascon knew by the first glance of his eye that his billet had been delivered and that this billet had had its effect   182.8662442820359
the young girl kissed her grandmother and left with her handkerchief to her eyes   141.43663680545362
you believed that you would fly from me by returning to paris   48.59319460432164
the count s brow became clouded   123.06881994069083
de villefort followed them   149.38386003399597
it does not concern me the more so as i have not a livre left   134.78322068140707
no cardinal   45.38851603235865
but the well oiled hinges and locks told quite another story   97.07826668597247
then your father ought to have met with you on the road for it is exactly the same route which he himself took and that is how we have been able to trace your journey to this place   150.24741223083427
here doctor said he is what you sent me for   163.69894494405364
while thinking and walking athos passed and repassed before the pipe of the stove broken in halves the other extremity passing into the chamber above   155.27916625185327
then those who dwelt in bonacieux s unfortunate house together with the nearest neighbors heard loud cries stamping of feet clashing of swords and breaking of furniture   43.66473325760309
let us withdraw   186.7002784646077
the count in return for his gentlemanly bow received a formal though graceful courtesy while lucien exchanged with the count a sort of distant recognition and with danglars a free and easy nod   154.6917868708136
but i have a passion for the occult sciences which speak to the imagination like poetry and are reducible to figures like an algebraic equation   160.8116260055851
there is your proud and selfish nature   150.99808195689593
i am brother to parry his majesty s lackey   129.09750755642148
but the voyage was not ended   122.46607058819899
without a thesis   78.60440894338188
madame i have pledged my word and unless you order me to be arrested i shall be forced to return   108.73387717428344
essed of ingots gold money jewels diamonds gems   83.38664088661163
the marshal made no attempt to force that barrier and returned up the quay   88.43495984758934
but this was not so easy a matter for the streets were thronged with people and rome was already a prey to that low and feverish murmur which precedes all great events   153.00225804073645
d artagnan related how he had found porthos in bed with a strained knee and aramis at a table between two theologians   42.3843350459551
if we are so it is because we generally judge under the influence of excitement   180.85018170880966
let us visit them said the inspector with an air of fatigue   160.01492303336823
the night after that battle he was sentry at the door of a general who carried on a secret correspondence with the enemy   113.90442466289248
that when my coachman was about to harness the horses to my carriage he discovered that they had been removed from the stables without his knowledge   207.101181523854
bonacieux who saw she was regaining some little influence over her husband   147.49669591248792
madame danglars was carried into the adjoining room   58.07943445203032
i will forget even your name and be happy   73.14281600238706
and yet at the very door the musketeer began to entertain some doubts   86.05093967084122
the two latter followed their captors in the humble guise of captives without arms   114.57813621326315
i do not offer you a million because i have it not   159.0949149486034
i say sir that with the eyes fixed on the social organization of nations you see only the springs of the machine and lose sight of the sublime workman who makes them act   125.14226363768006
you are exactly in the spot   112.89076295851287
i denounce the crime   165.9602989858469
there were in all six thousand piastres but of these six thousand albert had already expended three thousand   128.16018469927027
then the porter raised some difficulties but the count of monte cristo produced a permit from the governor of rome allowing him to leave or enter the city at any hour of the day or night   138.1356199951494
every time i see you is a fresh diamond which i enclose in the casket of my heart   79.88637627004798
never shall i forget your sublime courage when having returned to consciousness i dragged myself to the foot of the stairs and you almost dying yourself came to meet me   9.177895510879893
the queen entered her oratory which was lighted by a single lamp of venetian crystal she saw d artagnan who stood expecting her   73.9113754093735
my friend said monte cristo with an expression of melancholy equal to his own listen to me   128.35956144043925
luxury has everything   197.48514191519592
adieu my friend adieu my father   110.32798225835187
she will receive five shillings per day for lodging and food   88.09976449503455
in that hotel   144.61412027685594
but why not address yourself to your sister the queen   59.27299330378811
said athos that s a proposition that pleases me   114.97088906387506
and she placed her hands on her brow as if to force the fugitive ideas it contained to concentration in a moment   108.52443810889488
it appears that in falling continued athos with some hesitation he broke his thigh   36.6161441911444
and the shore from the point of l aiguillon to the trenches was at every tide literally covered with the wrecks of pinnacles roberges and feluccas   111.09590343095635
mercédès burst into tears and as villefort strove to pass her again addressed him   115.24619581752093
he will be a dead man in a month   75.26996235528469
a singular introduction   180.70815282324529
your excellency said the captain that was the land signal will you answer yourself   41.55310333522523
athos changed color   168.7591802876696
i will turn abbé   95.34100909983403
your arms my lord what arms   157.61305998792955
i shall pass through those who attack me   108.98873053272561
she felt by intuition the flame of the opposing passions which burned with the blood in the veins of the young fanatic   115.76838148461738
said d artagnan who as we have often said never stumbled at anything   99.68674862870843
now madame said debray you have a splendid fortune an income of about 60 000 livres a year which is enormous for a woman who can not keep an establishment here for a year at least   116.0275332862634
my heart is that of a musketeer   147.02076810012542
the footman opened the door and announced monsieur le comte de la fere   103.00260496742622
yes but you have at least this consolation that you can say to yourself she has not quit you voluntarily that if you learn no news of her it is because all communication with you is interdicted   77.54345615717864
to a look of interrogation which they made milady replied by a sign that it was he   95.6959945008744
where is that armentières   152.6734691756327
he will of course have an escort   112.866414835427
at this moment a shadow passed rapidly before the opening   176.86542503518407
but should you want anything write to madame turquaine at la chevrette rue tiquetonne and draw upon her purse as on a banker with economy   78.96397849874148
where and how   85.38698412433855
and this said monte cristo is your opinion of your intended spouse   157.5771236668901
he smiled   77.10604556117181
in the meanwhile the promises of m   127.62559110362503
we have princes who set up a personal and egotistic opposition who will draw from mazarin s hands only a few ingots of gold or some shreds of power granted as bribes   60.526106839655576
noirtier the redoubtable was the next morning poor m   135.66317990470077
he remembered that all the first part of his life had been embittered by a woman and he thought with alarm of the influence love might assume over so fine and at the same time so vigorous an organization as that of raoul   55.20305159324331
asked the girl   91.88410571020118
if a question in heraldry were started athos knew all the noble families of the kingdom their genealogy their alliances their coats of arms and the origin of them   114.9970926341433
she found m   122.73423259353359
they fled together into berry and there he obtained a little curacy   55.992980232749225
my dear count said morcerf i beg of you not to apply that title so prematurely   98.71195271470032
d artagnan was passing along a lane on the spot where the rue d assas is now situated breathing the balmy emanations which were borne upon the wind from the rue de vaugirard and which arose from the gardens refreshed by the dews of evening and the breeze of night   132.9526796861843
the dominions of kings are limited either by mountains or rivers or a change of manners or an alteration of language   122.68874565706015
de château renaud asked beauchamp how is morrel   118.37621517160252
i wish to consult you about some thing   179.88259526435465
noirtier de villefort one of the most fiery jacobins of the french revolution   3.8362713717644255
but unfortunately the thing is impossible monsieur de tréville has forbidden it   83.17173439444993
the marchioness drained the glass at a single draught and then turned on her pillow repeating the notary the notary   155.45852301614184
oh morrel pray love him for all his goodness to us   147.9800164960345
the cardinal said so   74.55153648105181
everyone hastened to purchase moccoletti franz and albert among the rest   213.71769649820033
andrea cavalcanti s solicitude his manner of listening to the music at the door he dared not pass and of manifesting his admiration   148.32364046123217
you have seen me twenty times   143.18226771308946
truth my friend   81.14621215079114
no matter observed caderousse replacing the box in his pocket someone else will purchase it   103.30252135551567
well then you ll build some   172.428477636806
take the hand you expected to possess once more within your own and then separate yourself from her forever   162.68385061349164
and suppose you can not pass through them   132.00056713279497
we had better take the opposite direction eh   131.52244307972512
he removed his seat into a corner of the room where he himself would be in deep shadow while the light would be fully thrown on the narrator   129.55497824799536
true said monte cristo the loss of a sum of money becomes almost immaterial with a fortune such as you possess and to one of your philosophic spirit   41.71676826872182
villefort and franz returned to the faubourg saint honoré   86.76566701856866
but imagination has the wings of an angel of light and travels safely through or over the seas where we have been almost shipwrecked the darkness in which our illusions are lost the precipice whence our happiness has been hurled and swallowed up   159.95688963233698
but what astonished franz who had treated gaetano s description as a fable was the splendor of the apartment in which he found himself   93.9250589145022
albert extended his hand   14.615274393034795
trousers said grimaud still squaring his accounts   83.3770073372352
they trust to fortune and rely upon some unexpected event in some way to justify their predictions   109.14724215789045
for a thousand pistoles just that amount the beggar   77.39580745701028
quick quick   117.456789895407
there was yet no one to be seen   122.80695212289432
my father is not engaged in this fearful plot is he sir   154.50000767485835
debray stepped forward and cordially pressed the hand of his interlocutor   169.983485779079
a private room had been prepared for the king and another for monsieur   98.6415130301956
how could that be monsieur   199.2735538974395
he stopped at a short distance from the house and alighted   68.13981868509362
eight thousand crowns amounted to 48 000 livres   113.4803059211097
this posing at the piano and over the album was only a little ruse adopted by way of precaution   64.86090162210922
du vallon next me   179.2227177693345
the only thing that was pleasant to him in that odious tableau such is the instability of the human mind was the sullen face of grimaud for whom he had at first conceived such a hatred and who now was all his hope   29.33565478019051
this time the blow was so well aimed and hit so directly that lucien and the baroness were staggered and they interrogated each other with their eyes as if to seek help against this aggression but the irresistible will of the master of the house prevailed and the husband was victorious   147.33933314406747
i love him   85.17906690552876
my son said anne of austria pointing to the musketeer calm standing uncovered here is monsieur d artagnan who is as brave as one of those ancient heroes of whom you like so much to hear from my women   73.71141166059064
this give us sounded revolutionary in the deputy s ears   178.55333467340157
the queen made a sign for every one except mazarin to quit the room   115.87100922081801
and people are wrong d artagnan   119.05093987578235
you laugh d artagnan   122.87739599271177
villefort as we have seen belonged to the aristocratic party at marseilles morrel to the plebeian   148.46917035844479
then he exclaimed turning to his men let them pass   138.52809073756407
valentine had approached or rather had placed her lips so near the fence that they nearly touched those of morrel which were pressed against the other side of the cold and inexorable barrier   143.68529231171905
he is traveling on business and will return ere long   191.1552389678841
said caderousse astonished   100.14326828937392
beware monsieur   69.56612077547965
perhaps this evening madame bonacieux will visit the conjugal domicile   33.40850545617103
at all events i could not guess that you would invite me to dinner   167.88195433715435
watch everything hear everything interpret everything   135.99626760225155
months and years rolled on   98.80419937066156
the ladies received the offer with too much pleasure to dream of a refusal   64.25000598733672
the ballet lasted an hour and had sixteen entrées   182.15495395443415
go my dear boy said old dantès   177.41395117151458
mercédès who will detest you if you have only the misfortune to scratch the skin of her dearly beloved edmond   254.7068098524996
unhappily in an instant he fell mortally wounded   102.77725163232716
as he passed the table on which the axe was laid he stopped and turning with a smile said ah   98.62582692521592
there was so much serenity coolness mildness even in the voice of the young man that milady felt reassured   140.2436132745214
mazarin had left his lamp in the gallery to make people believe that he was walking about but he had with him a waxlight to help him to explore his mysterious strong box   132.81418189089368
but in spite of four letters written in the most alluring style he invariably answered my eccentricity may be great but it will not make me break my promise   78.84599324328447
d artagnan picked it up and offered it to lord de winter   73.25865070253262
you will not   105.06708217260538
let us call one of these lackeys with a demi pistole in the left hand   121.54981016217454
silent caresses heartwrung sobs broken sighs burning tears were all that passed in this sad interview while madame de villefort leaning on her husband s arm maintained all outward forms of respect at least towards the poor widow   168.9445051551122
precisely madame replied monte cristo   148.78841218474136
and the name of this lord   156.6959435073735
thus m   98.26845514565528
for my part i always thought his poetry detestable and i think i know something about poetry   130.39333282779225
he began by moving his bed and looked around for anything with which he could pierce the wall penetrate the moist cement and displace a stone   40.43651680967416
morrel and this day and a half was lost from pure whim for the pleasure of going ashore and nothing else   69.86603156614746
i perceive its utter impossibility   99.34723265176606
then my strength gave out and i fainted again   52.38425355398779
it evidently was there i had turned up the ground   82.45305181125006
said gondy laughing   119.44403894819742
d avrigny accosted the priest   110.86190171605607
oh yes yes cruelly   120.69315490791976
nevertheless or find some one else continued d artagnan turning his back   138.5126960417288
and your present happiness has it softened your heart   140.24836417193163
it was given to you by that veiled lady i met you with the other sunday near the gate st   169.73795264158593
my lord you are right and i am glad to see that you do justice to the count at last   142.44199140960245
and supposing valentine to be disinherited by her grandfather she will still be three times richer than he   120.59956206460417
i am ready said maximilian   91.51259016462868
murmured my father   117.30892174829854
bonacieux saw that she had gone too far and she was terrified at having communicated so much   123.04623362203604
i was reflecting upon the rapidity with which the blessings of this world leave us   123.69298132432435
never had anne of austria appeared to him so beautiful amid balls fêtes or carousals as she appeared to him at this moment dressed in a simple robe of white satin and accompanied by donna estafania the only one of her spanish women who had not been driven from her by the jealousy of the king or by the persecutions of richelieu   165.42348990115795
perfectly safe and sound my good host   76.05652437242094
it was already too late   104.27056795431474
to travel   80.46446101978033
the lemonade morrel was in fact very happy   140.8915585451226
i might even say that we have some reason to praise him   139.71708393933883
in the midst of all this a mask is lifted and as in callot s temptation of st   196.04020803046257
at last said athos the first to speak by this time i think all must be over   182.83470401998466
the corpse was found on the bed next day and the whole truth was guessed for the men who performed the office then mentioned what they had not dared to speak of before that at the moment the corpse was thrown into the deep they heard a shriek which was almost immediately stifled by the water in which it disappeared   69.51721812302347
dessessart s valet came to d artagnan s lodging and gave him a bag containing seven thousand livres   61.204980655553
what do you wish me to say   123.86527207621214
the chancellor entered half smiling half blushing   97.89771587310484
so it is my dear vicomte said athos laughing to make bad ones   103.34437864777043
seeing however no one there except a musketeer of his own troop he fixed his eyes upon the supposed soldier in whose dress nevertheless he recognized at the first glance the cardinal   107.59318924900877
kitty who was to set out that evening for tours was waiting in the next chamber   142.12565318448014
you are a perfect amazon eugénie   101.97719848898849
franz and albert were like men who to drive away a violent sorrow have recourse to wine and who as they drink and become intoxicated feel a thick veil drawn between the past and the present   113.18429100854542
mazarin endeavored to circulate among the people a report that troops had only been stationed on the quays and on the pont neuf on account of the ceremonial of the day and that they would soon withdraw   135.59177567173435
you will see me talking with one of my friends the abbé d herblay of whom you have often heard me speak   253.19551595536024
come then thou regenerate man thou extravagant prodigal thou awakened sleeper thou all powerful visionary thou invincible millionaire once again review thy past life of starvation and wretchedness revisit the scenes where fate and misfortune conducted and where despair received thee   193.60916383972864
at the end of three months he had learned to read   35.086413892519246
tell me sir could you have the courage to do so   157.02622327039367
it was not known whether after the taking of the bastion the rochellais had evacuated it or left a garrison in it   78.00839873197606
i don t see what is to keep me here   90.83649920772001
go then and take the waters of forges or any that may be more agreeable to you and recuperate yourself as quickly as possible   134.87629031127895
does he still live   158.88602687205116
as for himself he declared that he had only need of a little rest and that when they returned he should be easier   164.4265978479341
every article of dress hat coat gloves and boots was from the first makers   168.0570820152365
the officer waited for his reply and seeing it so long coming he burst into a laugh turned upon his heel and re entered the house   145.88716378762547
said athos oh no it is impossible   170.8951089465629
it was easy to see that no doubt now remained in the young girl s mind as to the reality of the scene   59.43136006063321
23 germain pillon was a famous french sculptor 1535 1598   129.1403191327632
because as porthos was talking louder than the rest of us he took him for the chief said d artagnan   83.33997679230416
and eventually as he was stupid enough to be vexed at this change of position the queen had had him arrested and sent to vincennes in charge of guitant who made his appearance in these pages in the beginning of this history and whom we shall see again   131.17663569252448
there now shall we start   150.10078494950062
to the tower saint jacques la boucherie   135.80807832340184
it remains here   164.7658465550801
replied the queen in a low voice   115.1270726105588
you are too charming said d artagnan sorrowfully   105.08269222255903
by this smile m   174.02412645656787
edmond did not lose a word but comprehended very little of what was said   94.37891419324546
then the demigod vanished   213.159487515801
0279m under pretence of being fatigued dantès asked to take the helm   76.19726281786403
i have never interfered in your affairs excepting for your good   103.04415466642885
asked the cardinal with a smile of disdain   85.38193506788478
ah well exclaimed château renaud who because he had seen his thirtieth summer fancied himself duly warranted in assuming a sort of paternal air with his more youthful friend you young people are never satisfied   107.720034964339
laugh then said monsieur de retz   61.04398313976825
one of the sailors leaped on shore a cord creaked as it ran through a pulley and dantès guessed they were at the end of the voyage and that they were mooring the boat   138.05740621919173
your eminence may be perfectly easy replied d artagnan   149.494586928778
he asked the sergeant   108.63793620495954
but of what are you accused   182.3772412635857
adieu sir adieu my beloved protector   110.26879067139356
you are aware what huge whitings are served to us on maigre days   126.34802784591483
the conversation took place in english a language which d artagnan could not understand   185.69855932875225
at this word the three friends leaped from their horses and entered   180.22555724289742
nevertheless you have still the power of banishing from your presence those whom you do not like   185.11234699634602
nevertheless it was the rendezvous of the great world and all paris went there   91.19182121776274
oh i comprehend now said the astonished porthos   99.99492830006255
and yet since the amusement seemed to me rather tame i proposed to chevalier de rieux that we should be spectators instead of actors and in order to see to advantage that we should mount the bronze horse   90.92687114773764
i was going to say if i were in your place well   100.78431796875415
i am then your prisoner   43.620568636431585
no monsieur quite the contrary   179.923598115435
to involve me three governments must crumble to dust   62.42140936924699
at the expiration of ten minutes the clerk returned with a beaming countenance   35.07771489604717
d artagnan said nothing but after having gnawed the flower stalk he began to bite his nails   82.60526265251482
he then sat down in the corner until his eyes became accustomed to the darkness   63.04178124461895
the king don carlos has escaped the vigilance of his guardians at bourges and has returned to spain by the catalonian frontier   82.77188657504024
besides it has perhaps been her majesty s calculation to seek on this occasion for support so lowly   44.448364129552445
the carriage is at the door   44.26013094405678
tis very dear living in england my lord especially as envoy extraordinary   132.22598687350478
arranging your papers apparently   170.7169351932368
no sooner had this idea taken possession of him than he became more composed arranged his couch to the best of his power ate little and slept less and found existence almost supportable because he felt that he could throw it off at pleasure like a worn out garment   58.71129230782423
the queen shook her head   78.03410705167687
the waistcoat and the letter were both what is termed circumstantial evidence   117.00192389776117
his eminence can not see the letter without the bearer of it replied the young man   193.2379395002365
on coming near the bank she jumped lightly on shore and took to flight   51.22709497754105
grimaud approached with a very sullen expression on his face   213.26336448380343
thus d artagnan entered paris on foot carrying his little packet under his arm and walked about till he found an apartment to be let on terms suited to the scantiness of his means   69.35128026895524
but they were not alone your musketeers   87.28943377115795
the count patted him gently on the shoulder his usual mode of praising ali who pleased and gratified with the commission assigned him walked calmly towards a projecting stone forming the angle of the street and house and seating himself thereon began to smoke his chibouque while monte cristo re entered his dwelling perfectly assured of the success of his plan   87.2980114664451
yes my lord he replied   141.79340112800145
he must know where his master is   82.34636630579143
not too well   81.85665346250114
repeated the cavalier a second time letting his cloak fall and leaving his face uncovered   67.9862577406266
these proceedings made d artagnan and porthos draw back   109.68703605344373
what is his folly   145.96386181636007
even he added in an inaudible voice even that the procureur be not dead   90.73335453757208
he is afraid i have come to borrow money thought d artagnan   184.89843672789328
no replied the latter   135.91811600974222
debray rose smiling and was about to contradict the baroness upon this latter point when the door opened suddenly   120.83883548010085
this door communicated with a subterranean passage leading under the street to a grotto in the garden of a house about a hundred yards from that of the future protector   111.95374109050375
the captivity of mazarin alone guarantees my life   20.55453613349154
as soon as possible   50.32506250220603
whence comes that money   35.93930652581953
this is torture to me cried athos   187.65733511261203
the rest of the floor was hired by a very rich gentleman who was supposed to be a sicilian or maltese   125.17920286800681
the same password   67.16653839708214
mazarin especially yes do you know i am very glad to hear you give that testimony   125.87182315183483
i trust we shall never find it so in our experience   74.66852623057206
the more so as it will be the prelude to a better   42.783568252818654
oh no athos   157.6335396077806
d artagnan entered after the cardinal and behind d artagnan the door was guarded   108.97402088601976
and by what gate did they go out   79.6860194480902
i said i wished to be alone he exclaimed on seeing the young man   154.2556329824939
ah my lord   175.99045334571827
well in spite of that d artagnan said athos you are not sorry that you were useful to her   71.25522648488386
if i durst say what i believe on that head what you believe   85.19526376036528
it had disappeared   170.4938059937031
as if all the world did not know who the countess g was   125.30891075082882
the count bowed but stepped back   136.24734768478282
if you wish me to enter upon the more difficult part of the business you must assist me by the most minute information on every point   58.79863024196386
yes i understand it well   129.27620713353897
he appears to be a resolute fellow   60.37373192563457
no dying   83.55352098806301
when we parted at the pont du var you told me you were going to travel through piedmont and tuscany   91.98425893994207
in the front room the follower was also still asleep her head leaning back on the chair in all respects worthy of her mistress   116.69990787378956
the cardinal referred to that man whom d artagnan upset at the corner of the cimetiere saint jean in paris and who was no other than the councillor broussel   145.77299108181134
comminges bowed and returned to athos who was awaiting with apparent calmness but with real anxiety the result of the interview   72.59491841433422
said athos phlegmatically   73.30843101008149
did you inquire the names of those three musketeers   44.904591549391085
lafitte   129.34881100863635
so porthos sat down to table without another word and ate with an appetite that did honor to the confidence that was ever inspired in him by d artagnan s inventive imagination   164.64666076703574
because before you could escape you would have to be turned into a bird   146.88340248409017
de tréville how the affair came to pass   132.1370510927328
if so i will give you a letter of introduction to him   74.78871758889483
what think you of citizen luigi vampa   98.73671298563846
but tell me what woman has a lover more truly in love   147.79958799855393
and what are you going to do in paris   72.0250545200069
oh by the house of fenzi one of the best in florence   136.65366640019738
mordaunt bowed   124.83131096173672
go then sir and god keep you   126.8060849878518
i now understand why you are in the service of cromwell   205.70539837534716
and he rushed out of the study   42.577312761047025
athos porthos and aramis after having had an entertainment at my house and enjoying themselves very much created such a disturbance that the provost of the castle a rigid man has ordered them to be confined for some days   105.01423065239247
only i fancy i could pass the time less painfully here than anywhere else   108.08970559486791
of this treaty at least i have been warned   157.1520302896752
the profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused over his features a refined intellectual expression   141.01686930565216
i wish to forget it myself   69.1734333165341
i resist my father s order and my dying grandmother s wish   150.57533191437042
i see him   171.55512798084933
this is the abbé of whom i spoke said the doctor to d avrigny   125.5361331749824
well is all said   83.67496251276688
how few to day exist   76.13579209921657
well asked anne of austria when d artagnan reappeared what does it mean   123.97090369795558
twas so then twas so then murmured the abbé   50.59077017677702
d artagnan believed him to be dead or at least insensible and went toward him for the purpose of taking the order   178.2387205560986
the others followed   96.4357355981369
maximilian who was paying them a visit listened to their conversation or rather was present at it plunged in his accustomed state of apathy   55.86558704341343
ah traitor cried buckingham you have killed me   46.59299685732542
cried the cardinal looking at the clock   66.31381628616087
aramis continued and yet while i do belong to the earth i wish to speak of you of our friends   80.56838064306874
morrel who had already gone some few steps away again returned and pale with joy extended both hands towards valentine through the opening   115.61425076805533
then obeying the orders given him by athos he headed the small procession bearing the torch in one hand and the musket in the other until it reached de winter s inn when pounding on the portal with his fist he bowed to my lord and faced about without a word   155.99091854842337
then we are to have no more pistols no more despair   82.55433350254442
do you know signor pastrini said albert lighting a second cigar at the first that this practice is very convenient for bandits and that it seems to be due to an arrangement of their own   118.99337584329916
said he i see   77.77359853751372
i respected your father very much said he   99.56104082088638
paris has been sufficiently punished   255.81830677277026
he was profoundly versed in hunting and falconry and had one day when conversing on this great art astonished even louis xiii   4.137357592194164
and caderousse rattled his glass upon the table   139.66840578918018
if it is i whom your majesty interrogates replied the coadjutor in the same calm manner i reply that i hold monsieur le marechal s opinion in every respect   179.13747583539543
peppino had a little spare time so he had a game of morra with the facchini lost three crowns and then to console himself drank a bottle of orvieto   104.71749299465567
their masters are dead   192.91777255983996
what is the matter with your highness   104.40576753755181
well asked he as soon as they were by themselves tell me what it is   112.0882914889289
we shall re enter london place him securely on his throne and he will make us dukes and peers said porthos whose eyes sparkled with joy at this imaginary prospect   133.29695875785566
it is at once cruel and unjust   134.0769430780052
monte cristo went to a secretaire opened a drawer by a spring from which he took a paper which had lost its original color and the ink of which had become of a rusty hue this he placed in the hands of mercédès   142.27834553114184
suddenly mousqueton uttered a cry of delight taking from beneath one of the benches a bottle of wine   87.05794024213048
athos rose and offering him his hand be welcome my lord said he you are one of us   92.47887523551859
now really let me ask sir have you   170.38085237705042
i say that she is a hostage for the parisians answered the cardinal   140.7698397872992
i went out as if to fetch wood passed through the subterranean passage into the cellar and whilst parry was gently bolting the door pushed up the board and beckoned to the king to follow me   43.43582780674845
raoul blushed again   75.82101163586616
happily i vanquished death   115.9483004396892
i know a man who will find the means of taking me from paris a man i have too long forgotten   128.67101803144664
the carriage rolled rapidly onward   76.31002460308899
well am i to rush into his arms and strain him to my heart crying my father my father   148.32475718912997
the four crossed the public room and proceeded to take possession of the best apartment in the house which d artagnan occupied with authority   111.12918680708977
said d artagnan they will miss me   139.42898150275047
very well said the gentleman   120.223000515229
yes and up to this point i know all said the priest   150.4836381741613
gentlemen gentlemen said d artagnan do not let us lose our time in jesting   115.1030835549456
desirous of seeing how far the discretion of the good abbess would go she began to tell a story obscure at first but very circumstantial afterward about the cardinal relating the amours of the minister with mme   65.4221659700715
said the duc de beaufort to himself every man in order that he may lose his heart and soul must receive from celestial bounty one of the seven capital sins perhaps two   65.74586493246795
cries of live the king   121.95751035635939
the queen on seeing him uttered a cry of surprise and asked him what was going on   77.9376252198202
and i smile with pity when i reflect that if the names of those gentlemen are unknown to you it is because the queen has forgotten them who ought to have made them the first noblemen of the realm   72.34487029218994
so so said he in a hoarse and choking voice to danglars this then i suppose is a part of the trick you were concerting yesterday   91.30313832313786
monsieur mousqueton   93.27427454999744
at that instant there was such a rataplan of musketry that one might have imagined the infernal regions had opened   114.34038881583228
third rate said danglars rather humble what do you mean by that   146.89906413978156
alas my dear friend said faria in a resigned tone you understand do you not and i need not attempt to explain to you   83.20123861885247
dead all marseilles will follow me in tears to my last home   172.1154609941331
save me i am pursued   131.26339953925827
20293m it was the end of september   153.86323509448948
shall i see you again ere my departure   194.37135239479875
don t you see they are aiming   14.84081918256264
while faria restored by his alarm to a certain amount of activity pushed the stone into place with his foot and covered it with a mat in order the more effectually to avoid discovery   150.29857476708588
monsieur d artagnan repeated louis   97.9843159706865
as the eleventh hour struck he entered with a swaggering air attended by two of the most dissolute and reckless of his boon companions   139.24458338910603
his mocking laugh and threatening words passed over their heads carried by the breeze until lost in the depths of the horizon   127.40924215506588
the note is changed   53.89242530127021
but the parisians are so subtle in paradoxes that they mistake for caprices of the imagination the most incontestable truths when these truths do not form a part of their daily existence   147.13762075103975
i shall follow your advice not because you give it but because i had before intended to quit france   113.09727812088141
in the meantime the mousetrap continued in operation and likewise d artagnan s vigilance   169.59831190157965
the opportunity is favorable to avoid an explanation   133.97977673328748
you do well to boast of it said andrea who without becoming angry as caderousse feared at this new extortion quietly resigned the ring   84.92247002023305
i hate this life of the fashionable world always ordered measured ruled like our music paper   41.947754861910596
i know it sir   132.09346763862376
oh heavens said the young man oh heavens what are you saying count   156.50936328191125
your friend s soul must stick tight to his body   66.98776584332867
very good signor pastrini said franz   150.71970950484925
i imagine anyone may write to yanina   89.51486644914564
i recollected that i was stabbed just as i was trampling the ground to fill up the hole   132.52281763406322
with me you will be as safe as in a temple   187.61174187243012
oh it is simple enough madame   117.84355424707736
look round you then   152.7078900682311
two long hours he waited in terrible inaction   153.65638533241474
i must at least have drunk for my part a hundred and fifty bottles   131.51629276344616
excuse me said the implacable young girl monsieur albert claims and well deserves his share   67.57718686823722
and since it is my function to give them to others i am rather averse to receiving them myself   162.2481897933465
and five hundred feet from here is a small hunting house   178.66053459326776
but a pistol shot is easily fired from a carriage which goes at a gallop   81.34963714964675
do you come from the end of the world   119.65123124256294
the fair indian astonished at the sensation her observation produced looked down and resumed her air of naivete   115.91403749184344
sobbed forth mercédès   129.01037166745937
truly a byronic hero   84.38777655411774
one is the equality that elevates the other is the equality that degrades   133.25941120657134
the officers were full of thanks and took away their prey   193.24409415046807
the island of tiboulen dantès although stunned and almost suffocated had sufficient presence of mind to hold his breath and as his right hand prepared as he was for every chance held his knife open he rapidly ripped up the sack extricated his arm and then his body   28.440830050528362
the major s eyes sparkled brilliantly   160.3812963846885
50281m morrel opened the letter and read my dear maximilian there is a felucca for you at anchor   137.5736089968638
morrel allow me to present to you m   80.09967319562418
hold your tongue imprudent man   165.50131196770732
you understand me replied villefort affectionately   181.35284870303036
listen to the voice of your heart morrel and ask it whether you ought to preserve this melancholy exterior towards me   31.516305721880556
remain here and i will send you your clothes by the boy   186.88140213661572
to no class of persons is the presentation of a gratuitous opera box more acceptable than to the wealthy millionaire who still hugs economy while boasting of carrying a king s ransom in his waistcoat pocket   138.59107767993524

my dappled grays   148.12641328150363

the world is a sepulcher   143.7726696383379
the discussion is going to begin again   151.029047901159
the two favorite studies of my youth were botany and mineralogy and subsequently when i learned that the use of simples frequently explained the whole history of a people and the entire life of individuals in the east as flowers betoken and symbolize a love affair i have regretted that i was not a man that i might have been a flamel a fontana or a cabanis   99.36653848950422
as i rode by the count s house i perceived a light in one of the windows and fancied i saw the shadow of his figure moving behind the curtain   61.18247489726201

said bonacieux protruding his lip   186.59748798299165

gentlemen   64.7617516458288
be it so cried aramis   93.21948382415725

all that however has nothing to do with my obligations to you and i now come to ask you whether in my own person my family or connections i can in any way serve you   45.335559410829106
both went into the bedroom and as the door of communication remained open d artagnan could hear milady for some time scolding her maid   126.88491232661137
sir he said you are a profound thinker and your plan was sublime   96.82573547495646
as perhaps our readers are not familiar with the slang of the rue de jerusalem and as it is fifteen years since we applied this word for the first time to this thing allow us to explain to them what is a mousetrap   51.02592547654932
where we have orders to lead you   144.8658686384943

he was a tiger hurt unto death gnashing his teeth in his wound   105.07215324235061
it is impossible to say whether charles who kept his eyes constantly closed had noticed the insolence of the puritan captain but the moment he heard the clear tone of d artagnan s voice his eyelids rose in spite of himself   166.27429570088628
his fearless deportment his words so firm yet dignified the shades which by one word he had evoked recalled to her the past in all its intoxication of poetry and romance youth beauty the eclat of love at twenty years of age the bloody death of buckingham the only man whom she had ever really loved and the heroism of those obscure champions who had saved her from the double hatred of richelieu and the king   145.4574638947525
the fifth part of the profits from this stone belongs to us then does it not   113.96627889323042

monsieur de rochefort said gondy laughing are you a boy to play with firearms   158.8342694210989

cried the viscount springing towards her   149.32779299835607
this reasoning seemed to d artagnan so satisfactory that he no further insisted   52.811873638448496
listen whispered villefort to valentine who could not conceal her joy   216.7567087842194

how much have you left of your hundred pistoles d artagnan   143.17400649429482
my poor friend i had forgotten you were in love   88.48282736820643

he looked again through his glass but even then he could not distinguish anything   104.41947116998914
asked the enraptured villefort   59.86314694864272
milady opened the window and made a sign to mme   179.78384855405272
said villefort do you mean to say that valentine is not interested in your will   149.88461220053642
as hope however is the last thing extinguished in the heart of man he finished by hoping that he might survive even though with terrible wounds in both these duels   128.9350192386458

and here is andrea cavalcanti s baptismal register given by the curé of saravezza   141.53253340994289
in two hours in four in six hours at latest planchet will be here   142.05433509113973
thank you for the compliment my young friend replied aramis we can see from whom you learned courtesy   85.91517347915706
which means that i have just been duped sixty louis for a horse which by the manner of his gait can do at least five leagues an hour   181.98717798547824
as to that said aramis we are witnesses   50.34639101002244
i am nearly thirty seven   3.310304901909447

monk or priest it matters not provided only that he has received from holy church the power of absolving in articulo mortis   117.74193053805202

the baroness returned to the hotel with as much caution as eugénie used in leaving it   138.50078250669534
he tore his hair   141.39482838287898
your mother can be of no use to you in this world henrietta said the lady turning around   119.40474515772642
it begins to develop itself said d artagnan   96.54179460427125
charles shuddered   255.29329188448332
he felt the stiffened limbs   31.415779607999113
but still to speak to a man even though mute was something   134.1430489616067
and your precautions were successful   79.28722742419738
i confess observed monte cristo that i have some difficulty in comprehending your objection to a young lady who is both rich and beautiful   131.57580933580914
no everything is all right now   83.53269424285334
there is no desert where a bird can not pass over one s head where a fish can not leap out of the water where a rabbit can not come out of its burrow and i believe that bird fish and rabbit each becomes a spy of the cardinal   44.47759828800683
gondy withdrew distributing benedictions on his way and finding a malicious satisfaction in causing the adherents of his foes to prostrate themselves at his feet   118.18736435533327
you hailed me i think   152.7060091116295
only this time it was addressed to m   78.42328842907105
said another   125.48075038977498
oh let us have no gestures no screams no modern drama or you will oblige me to tell you that i see debray leave here pocketing the whole of the 500 000 livres you have handed over to him this year while he smiles to himself saying that he has found what the most skilful players have never discovered that is a roulette where he wins without playing and is no loser when he loses   191.11153858860632
certainly after witnessing the culpable indolence manifested by m   53.75988064282358
the coachman raised his whip   152.53547948999795
it contained my fortune   143.13034682293906

when the maltese for so they called dantès had said this it was sufficient and all went to their bunks contentedly   65.48020108404475
very well at half past ten   88.30284264156768
five seconds has scarcely elapsed after the disappearance of the officer when the door opened and a new personage entered   89.272800215238
now another object not less terrible suddenly presented itself   172.32459816933903
edmond was again cleaving the azure sea which had been the first horizon of his youth and which he had so often dreamed of in prison   119.26165395788827
the king as we have said was to follow as soon as his bed of justice had been held   122.34451699615731
no but her mother   65.73957895977242
it is impossible a gentleman could have written such a letter to a woman   127.97837322862893
this manifestation on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the music produced not the slightest effect on the two young men who continued their conversation   156.99191826360376
but we have also known unhappiness and few have ever undergone more bitter sufferings than ourselves   110.03584851493903
since then i have demanded my liberty from the italian and french government   139.75320178038234
at the palais royal the crowd which had flowed in from the adjacent street was still greater   114.09635583508063
he says that through me he will suffer through me who would yield my life for his   112.51282054294914
perhaps we shall meet on our road   53.46793353965473
he now calls himself the count of morcerf and ranks among the peers   143.6840672101379
we will be with you at that time said the major   139.7200724068676
now on such a day i can neither eat flesh nor see it eaten   83.8184877375725
ah reverend sir tell me do you wish me dead   179.93457126855714
is there any secret meaning concealed beneath your words   44.64950051453506
and unless a man be endowed with that admirable instinct which causes louis xiii   96.4911452904085
50039m oh the magnificent hair   127.2900335313578
this enormous fortune made no great appearance on the table   100.45229199752175
and who told you i had no affair with a lover   118.72441352717155
danglars asked for a knife and fork   76.40181052967418
the abbé d herblay resumed de winter is one of those gallant musketeers formerly belonging to his majesty king louis xiii   141.0066524349937
for one second d artagnan thought the man had some evil design and he put his hand to his sword   112.40874481901231
it was time and he sealed his will with three seals   88.97161067787405
do you then really suffer   188.7692542419241
therefore when at dessert upon a sign from d artagnan porthos had sent away his servants and the two friends were alone porthos said d artagnan who will attend you in your campaigns   133.01768327715058
voices unheard except on days of revolution were distinguished   73.86077942365353
a more material interest stirred his blood   113.45089637612169
i assure your excellency said he that at least it shall be my study to merit your approbation in all things and i will take m   116.14801628772156
we enroll no one against his conscience but we will compel you to act generously even if you are not disposed to do so   70.47969577699692
to her majesty the queen of england who has desired me to present you to her   141.20167278727476
he considered himself an outraged betrayed and ridiculed lover   138.03167986919235
i will do nothing of the kind   33.293520384233844
life is so uncertain that we ought to secure happiness while it is within our reach   47.193381786769734
more than once he had reached that part of the garden where the famous boarded gate stood overlooking the deserted enclosure always returning by the same path to begin his walk again at the same pace and with the same gesture when he accidentally turned his eyes towards the house whence he heard the noisy play of his son who had returned from school to spend the sunday and monday with his mother   160.86713501218122
the heat of the day had gradually decreased and a light breeze arose seeming like the respiration of nature on awakening from the burning siesta of the south   114.80233499855001
morrel allowed his hand to fall into that which the count extended to him   118.62263394557883
read said the old man   159.88064009465677
porthos murmured d artagnan look well at that priest   142.84900446512273
besides which in a short time resumed d artagnan we shall have set battles cannonades conflagrations and there will be great variety   108.8005485490686
i was wrong a hundred times wrong   130.83780270251725
my name is edmond dantès replied the young man calmly   149.66271418340693
and i am afraid you will refuse me the favor i come to ask if you do not know to what end i ask it   54.057571654986035
have you tied the knot   160.9804316845171
40270m chapter 93   144.49184441083855
it was at the moment when she was plunged in the deepest and darkest of these reflections that the door of the chamber opened and the king entered   176.4788006753687
and turning off he entered the drawing room by another door   105.36003325181893
well this man   91.33232011712201
i tell you she loves that infamous buckingham   122.72393934798444
and there was no fear of being taken at his word   51.581114854430794
god keep me from it my dear monsieur mordaunt   64.72967718564196
but said villefort who was the first to break the silence i consider that i am the best judge of the propriety of the marriage in question   111.66770988876331
my dear count said albert i will endeavor to return your politeness at rome and place my coupé at your disposal until your own be ready   18.29482217337501
i do not know only he has followed your grace from the palais royal stopped at the louvre to wait for you and now leaves the louvre with you   73.66881230025315
i was uneasy about him   45.61961652385607
the only thing to mislead the investigator would have been belief in all the good things he said of himself   54.94473866846033
i saw your vessel and fearful of being left to perish on the desolate island i swam off on a piece of wreckage to try and intercept your course   57.054989985477796
she placed the poniard in his hand   78.86618453653992
but fortunately i do not want for anything   14.082137081019496
d artagnan whose inquiring disposition we are acquainted with had not whatever interest he had in satisfying his curiosity on this subject been able to assign any cause for these fits or for the periods of their recurrence   66.5801324896188
at length they reached it but it was not the friend   237.084896661554

you arrive and your presence was likely to afford me delightful company   103.74370249071474
not for a kingdom   116.05436809559849
these two newly enlisted soldiers marched gravely after the valet de chambre who opened the door of the vestibule then another which seemed to be that of a waiting room and showing them two stools your orders are very simple he said   85.50151580848492
you know i have made the most of my arms though i never forgot my origin   175.49104783600382
pardon me madame for having by a trick unworthy of a gentleman provoked your anger   146.69441197616922

oh the wickedness of man is very great said villefort since it surpasses the goodness of god   130.38366413009592
asked the guide in astonishment   84.32545893273735
i live retired in the house of my noble protector but i do it from choice   91.38020158804134
the woman had had a relay of horses and continued her journey   100.43991617800518
no sooner said than done and i lost the horse   68.51278367029931

night came the two women had watched hoping that when he left his room morrel would come to them but they heard him pass before their door and trying to conceal the noise of his footsteps   152.91147505131357
the usurper converted   121.92502286060574
well then to the king your nephew   132.45946260877355
it may be easily understood that in the present disposition of his master nothing could be more disagreeable to bazin than the arrival of d artagnan which might cast his master back again into that vortex of mundane affairs which had so long carried him away   145.2369019034565
no my lord i still plead   128.85900598133975
have you gone mad my dear friend   82.03629535477585
and maximilian was patient and employed himself in mentally contrasting the two girls one fair with soft languishing eyes a figure gracefully bending like a weeping willow   20.4067487791079
you see i am calm and strong   118.19251913961162
she closed the door after her took the duke by the hand and after a few experimental steps grasped a balustrade put her foot upon the bottom step and began to ascend the staircase   156.2634295813021
no let us belong to no party but remain friends   169.27108411350264
i don t know them but the four other noblemen called the englishman my lord   143.2233949592871
danglars looked at the two men one after the other the one brutalized by liquor the other overwhelmed with love   84.7088466579002
should you meet on your journey a certain monsieur mordaunt distrust him in a letter i can not say more   88.05392490132604
truly they are murmured the count in a lugubrious tone   88.37902174733105
oh no no   116.82571627862522
well i selected the cartilages of the heads of these fishes and you can scarcely imagine the delight with which i welcomed the arrival of each wednesday friday and saturday as affording me the means of increasing my stock of pens   127.88888526386152
act then as you think proper   151.37284587707333
the count stood alone and at a sign from his hand the carriage went on for a short distance   103.17229627579863
he had not the courage to again visit the death chamber   121.33499419877707
then follows the melancholy chant of the priests mingled now and then with a sob of anguish escaping from some woman concealed behind a mass of flowers   151.82778572874673
i am at home there   81.130673099255
he then drew two crowns majestically from his purse and gave them to the host who accompanied him cap in hand to the gate and remounted his yellow horse which bore him without any further accident to the gate of st   89.03731200606998
it is my happiness my treasure my hope   108.38767587979727
so suiting the action to the word d artagnan thrust the remnant of his sword into its scabbard picked up his hat and ran down the stairs followed by the others   73.60227879882541
to save yourselves to scamper away to flee that is good for the king s musketeers   102.60196328939026
she has been dead a year and you know fernand i have subsisted almost entirely on public charity   96.61537321229866
gentlemen he said addressing the two musketeers accompany the royal carriage we are going forward to look for lodgings   111.66300496938295
madame said he if i dared in my turn advise would it be to give up broussel sir   89.4799037139762
but viscount since we can not perform the journey in less than seven or eight hours do not keep me waiting   78.39719402301058
asked morrel with a sickness of heart   112.28197512459914
he could hang himself with his handkerchief to the window bars or refuse food and die of starvation   65.69039490498318
the friends urged on their horses and arrived in fact at about five o clock in the morning   142.43584953746497
grenoble and lyons are faithful cities and will oppose to him an impassable barrier   168.2115911937592
but we must say at the present moment d artagnan was ruled by a feeling much more noble and disinterested   108.56627285802817
then it will be but charitable to inform him   109.49453621951547
here edmond was to undergo another trial   103.4103325446805
sir replied the queen closing the coffer and leaning her hand upon it if there is anything to be said it is that i have always been ungrateful to the brave men who saved me that i have given nothing to that gallant officer d artagnan you were speaking of just now but my hand to kiss and this diamond   97.07061200597077
ten parts of a hundred pistoles each in ten throws without revenge   89.10416480796854
a lieutenant in the corsican battalion   110.51863306173477
i can imagine the effect i do not see the means   113.01082929093211
asked mazarin turning pale   51.40815094330096
de boville who took it without ceremony and quickly drew up the required assignment while the englishman counted out the bank notes on the other side of the desk   82.532986952907
we can die but once   180.51462534475075
how madame said she i have scarcely seen you and you already wish to deprive me of your company upon which i had counted a little i must confess for the time i have to pass here   114.84375179996636
that of the patrol going their rounds   140.41160885925692
come parry said the king cease your tears   108.09502026898187
the young men made inquiries and ascertained that the enemy was advancing by way of houdin and bethune   158.64187087340787
he thought of the moment when from the top of that wall he should protect the descent of his dear valentine pressing in his arms for the first time her of whom he had yet only kissed the delicate hand   103.87203721252988
she knew him   92.32108992561999
brave athos   168.08170950353127
at the fourth the count knew what to expect   101.15403939328003
count replied maximilian with an air of gravity those are our most precious family treasures   168.25842260281667
is it you baron   44.67462014447028
fortunately as regarded this circumstance at least his painful past gave to his countenance an indelible sadness and the glimmerings of gayety seen beneath this cloud were indeed but transitory   63.07412790887131
all faithful hearts with me   110.18138817954001
marriage   166.50490809647192
morrel we shall see   80.24012361113027
i could extend my occupation as a fisherman might get a place as clerk in a warehouse and become in time a dealer myself   94.42450301882921
morrel looked at his watch which wanted a quarter to ten   146.651228910184
a sign from grimaud put him on the alert   87.37721380431233
monsieur passed along the front of the line   136.863272434725
any other person would fail   78.10259670087672
the baron entered slowly sending a scrutinizing glance from milady to the young officer   15.280296297630898
the conduct is infamously violent   204.55933863478535
and i know my son had good reasons to wish to fight with you and to endeavor to kill you   70.74942318118663
then i speak at random   139.20896752079597
do you not remember him   58.52788083707795
but when you have drunk give me your opinion   71.13991656029651
enjoining in case of disobedience on his part all the subjects of the king to pursue and take him   169.971855330481
he said i am then to die   98.74618713522011
and let us burn this letter which no doubt announces to you some fresh infidelity of your grisette or your chambermaid   25.133052269170193
i have my plan   121.23360043204175
i give you absolute power therefore   88.27369798636585
my horses said monte cristo   53.341146197080384
chapter 112   183.77305361488555
d artagnan glanced at the dinner service   103.25033517417091
he soon perceived that a slope had been formed and the rock had slid along this until it stopped at the spot it now occupied   44.240108594648774
i have dined many times with him and the count of morcerf so you see i have some high connections and were i to cultivate them a little we might meet in the same drawing rooms   72.11337384147726
you shall place it on that table and you may remain between it and me   137.52740129362206
now this is not all he said   168.95735902302528
he was for some time without reflection or thought for the divine charm which is in the things of nature specially after a fantastic dream   85.38486296075592
d artagnan saw clearly that he would get nothing out of this man who was evidently telling a falsehood in his pretended ignorance of the abode of aramis but whose lies were bold and decided   29.445227721060633
it would be rendering a service to her future son in law   147.31828811396724
his haggard eyes glanced around as if in search of the traces of some terrible event and with his clenched hands he seemed striving to shut out horrible recollections   189.4007553243995
he continued to press the raising of the famous dyke which was to starve la rochelle   60.94110159504076
i believe in you and i would have all the merit of my devotion even if that devotion were stupidity   125.6224105951194
aramis returned soon with a man from the hotel de rohan who was saying to him you swear sir that it is not so   149.08823480188312
exclaimed d artagnan picking up a louis and displaying it   114.97756475240315
the plan of changing their clothes was unanimously adopted   35.70553569363881
this box contained an unctuous substance partly solid of which it was impossible to discover the color owing to the reflection of the polished gold sapphires rubies emeralds which ornamented the box   111.32563556718848
but at the present moment i can only do for you that which i just now offered   27.45773545690996
here was another frondeuse to persuade and she was even less open to conviction than her younger rival   53.9873832836886
my jeweler and my secretary   103.56848396988032
let us break the carriage   23.88257306275804
then as he went in he saw the fair madeleine his hostess standing on the threshold   170.34268010130216
volume four 40010m 40012m 40020m chapter 74   81.30662478165158
and the third the duke de longueville and the prince de conti brother and brother in law of condé   167.24446092068723
these are all so many empty words my dear sir said morcerf they might satisfy a new acquaintance but the comte de morcerf does not rank in that list   131.22462727842878
by whom is it commanded   125.1563690531763
but for one whose privilege it was to agitate that ocean of human waves how many were received with a look of indifference or a sneer of disdain   94.76837322033064
like benefactors in romances i should have left you without seeing you again but that would have been a virtue beyond my strength because i am a weak and vain man fond of the tender kind and thankful glances of my fellow creatures   99.17902998428906
you will hear again from me   75.84341453673925
i should like it early as i am going into the country tomorrow   109.34340018668429
forget even my name and be happy   45.87084944030775
take planchet   139.47534390318728
i am thinking sir of those desperate looking men who were drinking in the inn where we rested   30.896172670734586
god save the king   104.84323117969672
he had fainted   142.56536932643124
really i think you are going mad good bertuccio said the count   136.59916930045117
scarcely so much   38.7160087466676
promise me i say   109.5889199209309
i forget   72.24883693386343
and he struck out with the energy of despair   182.62755089178899
then we set sail to night   81.94090390193574
in god s name answer me   92.89471290924186
we appointed to meet at la chevrette   134.14950063323062
monsieur bonacieux there was in all this as may have been observed one personage concerned of whom notwithstanding his precarious position we have appeared to take but very little notice   95.05750209215248
yes at the time of her relations with monsieur de buckingham   141.63771961691666
you know porthos i could not give him the particulars without naming our friends   72.2503436616538
and you will place the king and queen in safety also at saint germain   47.799228668853345
meanwhile kitty when we are about to separate and you are no longer jealous of me monsieur chevalier far off or near said kitty i shall always love you   93.48315039676581
that is to say athos will be chief engineer porthos purveyor in general and aramis governor of the fortress   142.16282117240127
colonel tomlison said charles kings can not yield   113.29757095456945
there it is then said monte cristo as he stepped out of the carriage   105.60659614277724
cried mazarin almost choked and clasping his hands   112.87417866900614
every evening either in the antechamber the corridor or on the stairs he met the pretty soubrette   52.36872918548987
he ran to porthos and threw himself into his arms   158.81672736192894
and to remove all suspicion if she had any milady repeated to the lackey before her the latter part of her instructions   169.93934808237972
the duc de beaufort made his entrance at court receiving ample reparation for the wrongs he had suffered and all the honor due to his rank   103.22710366039624
while the flatness of his forehead and the enlargement of the back of his skull which rose much higher than his large and coarsely shaped ears combined to form a physiognomy anything but prepossessing save in the eyes of such as considered that the owner of so splendid an equipage must needs be all that was admirable and enviable more especially when they gazed on the enormous diamond that glittered in his shirt and the red ribbon that depended from his button hole   102.05792523376753
that is true and that will redeem us a little in the eyes of posterity if posterity ever looks at us   86.34007514686714
and so aramis you are decidedly going into the church   110.74209875586125
drink then and do not meddle with what we are discussing for that requires all one s wit and cool judgment   113.62816169782324
shall i knock   142.75295061728173
so after a thousand questions which met with only a word in reply la ramee fascinated by this sobriety in speech rubbed his hands and engaged grimaud   33.69735724306129
shouted d artagnan or you are dead   139.48732030460081
it had taken him six minutes to perform the distance but these six minutes were sufficient to induce twenty young men who knew the price of the equipage they had been unable to purchase themselves to put their horses in a gallop in order to see the rich foreigner who could afford to give 20 000 francs apiece for his horses   127.62122055737346
that it is only the pope who is infallible and that this infallibility does not extend to cardinals   188.73834575825526
who could ever have believed it   85.38597223109343
lover and husband chapter xix   78.3648476457903
but we know very well what had become of edmond   116.04184714958073
he then went out backward and when he was in the antechamber the cardinal heard him in his enthusiasm crying aloud long life to the monseigneur   86.25223060112832
raoul remained silent for he was not prepared for the dignity of the bel esprit   139.27507161479912
de villefort in a hoarse voice   23.145013935481344
i will do without a promise and voluntarily all that i can do to serve the king and be agreeable to the queen   57.87365486488698
you would be the happier for it at home sire and i do not doubt you would be the greater for it abroad   92.71783333861669
she heard him enter but she did not raise her head   140.19338454376663
you are vexed are you not that he thus gives a clew to the labyrinth   84.49472245740169
well that has happened friend porthos   46.607402652873816
and the casualties though not mortal were painful as are all wounds inflicted by the weapon of ridicule   146.63882306161685
come come continued he patting edmond s shoulder kindly you did very right dantès to follow captain leclere s instructions and touch at elba although if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the marshal and had conversed with the emperor it might bring you into trouble   54.61584623183901
in every country where independence has taken the place of liberty the first desire of a manly heart is to possess a weapon which at once renders him capable of defence or attack and by rendering its owner terrible often makes him feared   24.897765737753673
the portcullis was therefore raised the porter had a louis for his trouble and they went on their way   137.40768597806726
by him we obey   134.008581831922
no monseigneur no it is not he   69.28077998721868
you shall not do that d artagnan said athos coolly   116.13321570653703
what papers   116.54177086597936
oh that s simple enough   115.5869946151888
if we reach compiegne we shall stop at the peacock   180.72232990297147
during the evident preoccupation of madame de villefort monte cristo scrutinized the features and appearance of the boy she kept folded in her arms lavishing on him the most tender endearments   98.42527125657242
i saw her put to sea the same evening we quitted marseilles   70.24089748020583
but this relation you mentioned do you wish me to speak to him   132.4716977853181
oh this time it is too much   117.5010669495422
but he was too weak and exhausted by the effort he fell back again almost senseless   57.17642101744002
chapter xv   77.2464198509827
you know poisons become remedies in certain diseases of which paralysis is one   165.39658223918707
however well disposed a person may be why you see we leave off after a time seeing persons who are in sorrow they make one melancholy   133.98269112674726
that which i have to say of her can only be heard by yourself my lord   175.08450242540076
i ask pardon of your eminence said d artagnan but i was so fatigued don t ask my pardon monsieur said mazarin for you fatigued yourself in my service   104.21994681063056
and if you were inclined to fly it only rests with yourself to do so   69.61085462287177
i lost a battle in spain i have been defeated in trieste but my naval army in india will have taken some galleons and my mexican pioneers will have discovered some mine   209.40749642598666
travelling with his sister   101.50497142454799
at the hour appointed lord de winter and the four friends repaired to the convent   111.89634423968354
cried d artagnan is your first witness monsieur porthos   114.37387927801575
this man might after all be a greater scoundrel than you have thought possible   88.61909107937184
cheer up said she to noirtier   135.35460170798436
i want to find out who was the man in the mask who so obligingly offered to cut the king s throat   84.39101655040886
why good god   69.20736181573547
you asked me the cause of my being late and why i come disguised   123.60998913522317
and for this very reason said danglars with a smile which he tried to make sardonic i prefer m   64.6996171293467
at this time that is about half past twelve madame danglars ordered her carriage and went out   108.19733058625471
we want said athos charlotte backson who first was called comtesse de la fère and afterwards milady de winter baroness of sheffield   194.72620806629754
this did not prevent the king from being as complacent to him as possible whenever he met him or from asking in the kindest tone well monsieur cardinal how fares it with that poor jussac and that poor bernajoux of yours   171.78231722197646
did she stay long there   105.08453383993373
my prisoner   125.42541719889024
cried the sentinels   50.14462731376443
the horses were at the place fixed upon and they leaped lightly into their saddles   91.7571904544192
i give you a hundred i give you a thousand times to guess monsieur the visit i received in your absence   55.71263102629405
we are getting to the story now   76.46299791006257
stop said selim seeing that she was about to go out   172.55583940323132
he soon became calmer and more happy for only now did he begin to realize his felicity   117.93353169148573
father he said do you reflect that you are bidding me to live   65.12725999718612
as you are my commander it is my duty to obey   115.05272266369859
the king was lying on his bed resting on his elbow   136.23468598814682
and i am yours body and soul   130.08448898574431
good my child   47.92370825095155
who is madame   226.48486522674466
porthos was cursing the infamous parliamentarians   191.48970732166651
then you advise me to accept   31.48917790153837
he placed his letter in the hands of the usher on duty who led him into the waiting room and passed on into the interior of the palace   96.21852143322005
some condemned soldier perhaps suggested athos whom they have pardoned at the price of regicide   150.57132193666945
that we have as you well know good heaven   110.34648495823741
what doest thou here good for nothing   80.71642994218584
murmured he clenching his fists and his teeth chattering   16.49804595905765
you were recognized and the cardinal named you   142.9970647979109
anne of austria ran to her jewel case   149.74392685207113
as you have several times since declared yourself the friend of that person he thinks it his duty to respond to that friendship by sending you important information   188.4642648718704
then he said aloud my dear friend your attack has perhaps fatigued you   112.70156670165754
his languishing looks and modulated tones when addressing mademoiselle danglars fully proclaim his intentions   101.78853305326493
who by their valor have got the better of his guards and spies   54.668888368915674
i don t suppose that our friend d artagnan has added any of his own to the amount   147.55789406444137
the other was that which laporte had placed in the hands of the duke of buckingham warning him that he was about to be assassinated   89.72509634539978
when the procession stopped this shadow was recognized as morrel who with his coat buttoned up to his throat his face livid and convulsively crushing his hat between his fingers leaned against a tree situated on an elevation commanding the mausoleum so that none of the funeral details could escape his observation   103.90851699501509
no no doubtless he was deceived and it was but one of those dreams that forerun death   75.0722608369797
well said he in a voice perfectly calm and no muscle of his countenance disturbed well my dear vampa it appears to me that you receive a friend with a great deal of ceremony   73.27084938853099
he had divined in the past of this woman terrible things which his red mantle alone could cover   56.13872985863454
as soon as the door of gondy s study was opened a man rushed in   209.92422087034873
if we are arrested it is a matter of the place de greve   124.1042794876198
but services such as he had rendered could never be too often acknowledged   85.68580562978443
said château renaud shaking hands with each of them   130.35461143911525
the door closed and dantès advanced with outstretched hands until he touched the wall   61.74375725626505
monsieur the abbé said he do you like blows with a cane   196.01611044804287
and how do you like my wine   32.20826375015024
that other was absent had disappeared perhaps was dead   81.84140747475901
the procureur exerted himself to reply   99.04206111793796
and lastly because i fancied i had found my cæsar borgia in a crowned simpleton who feigned to enter into my views only to betray me   110.53405882328244
do not think i wish to turn you out my dear debray continued danglars   80.16756641358404
desideras diabolum unhappy man   136.57980018479788
i have no part to play   137.03166022838946
as long as your brother was with me he kept me up   113.57314903144011
now as you are one of the whole world i mean to say that you also are deserting me   143.44643161192522
they thought that nauseous   196.3968954995097
i shall compliment mademoiselle danglars on her cameo while the father talks to you   57.80511910415184
no replied madame danglars i am too ill   153.07402990619008
but no one answered the servants having as we know deserted the house   116.65294054026805
the food is the same as in other prisons that is very bad   154.05853606494765
a slight movement of surprise escaped dantès   93.43745223993913
d artagnan received him as he would have done a friend of twenty years standing   79.52971297465542
three men standing silent formed a triangle of which he was the centre   66.50244307513768
i have made money at the same time by speculations which have succeeded   49.993561131533674
it was impossible that bazin should go out of the cathedral without his seeing him   111.90469383334693
an agreeable one   118.00536950189125
well monsieur laporte placed her near her majesty in order that our poor queen might at least have someone in whom she could place confidence abandoned as she is by the king watched as she is by the cardinal betrayed as she is by everybody   76.59591106264949
but as regarded grace delicacy and nobility of external appearance no one in these points was to be compared to the comte de la fere   197.88899238857323
said porthos haughtily   97.1462916419939
he shall die then since you condemn him   36.91209489641197
and your friend has nothing more to ask for madame de longueville   103.2059400641553
the procurator s wife was piqued   61.9990913649205
who will give it to you your prince   140.32392548999968
he is the most estimable the most trustworthy creature in the world and i will venture to say there is not a better seaman in all the merchant service   134.84822443594805
it is true she speculates with her own money not mine   77.36498815034354
she cried out but d avrigny paid no attention to her   224.01768858039713
she for a moment contemplated with fright that stupid countenance impressed with the invincible resolution of a fool that is overcome by fear   87.11138053250461
why prithee   61.56388792575336
la ramee was in ecstasies at having beaten a prince of the blood   70.34552645238205
the latter knew that this officer who was so pale but who appeared so determined would keep his word   97.27514607412809
this example was imitated by the rest until the room filled silently as if these men had been the humblest most devoted courtiers   99.14581286652644
you know it must not   34.103880853181124
the wise man my child has said it is good to think of death   97.7618588976952
and as a far higher encouragement it brought him into close intimacy with a woman he adored   143.8146267298134
there edmond dantès   66.08243791868996
cavalcanti something of the state of your finances   154.90221153496984
yes yes dantès good health   55.746813350791165
speak then   135.79396701939947
how well you reason   65.24879921505749
you cursed host   101.40602900782477
that this house which has remained uninhabited for twenty years must have some gloomy tradition or dreadful legend connected with it   93.99554676692222
bah said beauchamp he played the prince very well   220.71192233700856
she stopped and slept at an inn   88.02730992577179
to be imprisoned   135.77355632416737
cried morcerf parodying the banker as the selection came to an end   91.82882513383696
athos who imagined that he saw him move was the first to go up to him   98.5659107695755
the popular banker found that it answered better than count   83.99239567667969
he was a statesman of high standing and you may or may not know valentine that he took a leading part in every bonapartist conspiracy set on foot during the restoration of the bourbons   70.31217104833101
d artagnan put his forty pistoles into his pocket without any scruple on the contrary thanking his majesty greatly   71.97536418049285
i madame replied he follow monsieur de la fere wherever he leads even were it on to death without demanding wherefore   79.79368322392875
cried aramis is it not a warlike encounter that we are going to   83.19557191301593
therefore athos had invented the phrase family affair   12.506197829513567
but there is the cardinal always at hand who does not leave me a moment s repose   54.04313727955235
but his eyes darkened by death encountered only the knife which had fallen from the hand of felton still smoking with the blood spread over its blade   166.2375476125814
why it is as good as a century   50.358526609227475
but can i continue to visit madame de chevreuse   61.39952997936392
what has he done madame   146.7641920053469
said mazarin looking fixedly at d artagnan   242.9291594971183
from whom comes this letter   132.00993091414583
the dappled grays volume three chapter 48   61.88289901709393
you will find here moreover the young woman of whom i spoke who is persecuted no doubt in consequence of some court intrigue   147.67795498724635
often   102.35142301078324
the steamer waits and in an hour i shall be far from you   139.30732450027256
the exclamation appears quite theatrical and affected   129.7252623326017
friquet had a quick eye and a fine ear   70.06831434686518
magnificent my dear fellow magnificent   80.59910720221572
d artagnan had judged correctly   143.43988567807716
but tell me count will your people take care of my horse   167.04957036075803
yes she of whom you told me one day at amiens   141.22966226566868
june   86.10353443509999
i wish monsieur du vallon to sup well more especially as i have news to give him that will improve his appetite   129.105756220905
four of the guards who were constantly near the prisoner assisted in picking up the tennis balls   108.68402002764464
madame said he with dignity there will shortly be a ball at the hôtel de ville   84.97045338974749
and you honest man have ever since been asking your heart and sounding your conscience to know if you ought to expose or conceal this secret   63.02335962507431
do you know whom i have encountered here   91.86320091066032
de tréville of the letter with the great red seal and the cardinal s arms   26.822725499614734
there is no prison here   141.52221213309915
the night watch evinced the same terror refused in his turn to accompany athos and only pointed with his hand to the road he was to take   106.16061088784059
tranquil on this important point aramis continued his way with d artagnan and both soon arrived at athos s dwelling   191.35227061403197
during the evening two men engaged for the purpose had carried noirtier from valentine s room into his own and contrary to all expectation there was no difficulty in withdrawing him from his child   111.72346511774192
i am not willing it should be known i have left the camp   98.09070164611114
au revoir   97.05458698866111
at length valentine ventured   64.4168594272058
monsieur shall see that upon occasion i have some left   81.33316816416908
she was his mother   117.06863818203476
oh be easy   112.00721639268596
chapter 89   103.57222157235921
his lips again moved   102.51642106628945
milady held out her hand to him which he kissed tenderly   161.6759839989836
valentine seized the count s hand and in her irresistible impulse of joy carried it to her lips   108.54498410913806
a committee of twelve members was chosen to examine the proofs brought forward by morcerf   52.514563468970586
do i look so   81.90556295133155
besides i shall be there   114.40497335190977
and i know not what you mean said d artagnan bowing   126.40108787381277
let me blush for the faults you know and perhaps perhaps for even more than those   91.60867015329458
god has so willed it   52.875975164790844
and the worthy captain who on his side felt a lively interest in this young man so brave and so resolute pressed his hand kindly wishing him a pleasant journey   104.74609874527235
what do you desire   75.23225625269772
then i can speak without fear of tiring your excellency   89.94731565349723
sometimes their play degenerated into battles and in these battles the king was not always the stronger   183.39506124611165
i must then remain here   101.7500340620508
now the italians and the gascons are too much alike and know each other too well ever to trust what any one of them may say of himself   159.96621385065401
ah your pardon said dantès frowning in his turn   32.823509699390144
meanwhile the prisoner had remained impassive and as if he had no understanding of what was taking place   150.39858911315554
he was compelled then after having swallowed the contents of his bottle to pass the time as well as to evade suspicion to fall into the easiest position in his corner and to sleep whether well or ill   84.57930215169696
and having got out all he wanted he paid for the hypocras which he did not drink and went quickly back to the rue tiquetonne   171.02580182098495
therefore albert had not an instant to lose in setting forth the programme of his hopes expectations and claims to notice   182.92550186782802
well then resumed faria with a bitter smile let me answer your question in full by acknowledging that i am the poor mad prisoner of the château d if for many years permitted to amuse the different visitors with what is said to be my insanity   138.7466941091095
the magistrates freely discussed their political views   163.59616919847664
we shall be very unfortunate if after meeting so often this evening we should not succeed in meeting to morrow   131.1375467528184
said one   46.64378861877489
he forgot that besides his friends of his own sex a woman strange to say had remembered him   95.63414103670416
what the devil makes you think of bonacieux   17.124979231079777
and when he had finished she said in very good french monsieur i should with great confidence place myself under your protection if the person with whom i quarrel were not my brother   69.16246617528213
the poisoner was terrified at the contemplation of her own work   97.13453967420777
ah i can understand how the sight of him struck you replied lord de winter   124.42135031486168
you are a born diplomat returned franz   174.8285612905104
is it not so madame   257.7648104708995
she bore me rapidly away   136.88768591195807
cried friquet don t you see   44.755050242752716
but asked the sailor where are your companions   139.39847136012554
but with his simple musketeer s uniform and nothing but the manner in which he threw back his head and advanced his foot athos instantly took the place which was his due and consigned the ostentatious porthos to the second rank   156.91837485880046
thanks monsieur said the monk with one of those smiles that made bragelonne shudder   98.49335875468513
exclaimed valentine half believing herself under the influence of some feverish hallucination   66.46202192922848
but that happiness was denied me   86.83379855783761
said d artagnan this is rather warm   165.79898926834733
all very well said porthos but i should like to understand   178.304821947738
you are not a priest you are a musketeer   61.90786898832483
but he added in a despairing tone perhaps no one will dare to come for it is known that the spaniards are ranging through the country and i shall die without absolution   159.78897153618124
formerly he would have approached the queen as a young man who bends before a woman   21.465480213419383
this event had hastened the resolutions of the cardinal   99.57204969611732
and what is serious is that it will certainly spoil his face   91.62240855555359
sell it then   136.49867732206565
if there is a sentinel within the apartment kill him without hesitation   159.86834963917718
he is i think the son of general d épinay   160.19535047182464
morrel was kinder to his wife more affectionate to his daughter than he had ever been   48.023053466646374
but i who only understand my own figures know nothing more than that one day these figures deceived me   117.11408036674898
then of his wife the noble and courageous woman who had sustained him to the last moment   89.35905825245094
till now i have watched over his education and i have made him i hope an accomplished gentleman   153.6010179992394
the phial contained perhaps twice as much more   145.26663186442232
his aim was to elude the examination   74.53372108998173
the emperor now king of the petty island of elba after having held sovereign sway over one half of the world counting as his subjects a small population of five or six thousand souls after having been accustomed to hear the vive napoléons of a hundred and twenty millions of human beings uttered in ten different languages was looked upon here as a ruined man separated forever from any fresh connection with france or claim to her throne   119.40338865216847
athos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to fasten the door inside and to make them a sign to come and listen with him   63.69504942695149
but i know   141.82701837590594
for women have infallible instincts   80.22046692289547
but if i had pocketed his pistoles they would have weighed me down like a remorse   111.53662991010792
i promised to come said felton and i have come   184.05078168393774
grimaud thereupon presented himself with his smooth exterior at the donjon of vincennes   137.26095276659083
it was he who drove disguised as the coachman replied peppino   126.96863858415804
surely you will not refuse a comrade   160.11630397036254
it is six o clock said madame de villefort evidently agitated   76.75885663284879
then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged   140.0478629419128
my pastry not good   60.23851182940184
capital isn t it   167.54308698327515
meanwhile if the count should come in will you beg him not to go out again without seeing me   103.81211781329776
the sergeant had not the courage to reply   113.48319841406708
the impression was the same on both of them and the tone in which morcerf had just expressed his thanks was so determined that the position would have become embarrassing for all if the conversation had continued   102.9438292296744
gentlemen said the count springing out when you are tired of being actors and wish to become spectators of this scene you know you have places at my windows   60.98344337861098
is he much changed   160.27931859815848
it will be even more difficult to descend   39.12081556352804
but return to your question   148.21762169960857
oh you ll know it someday aramis   49.00932676650301
the man or rather the ghost for he trod so softly that no sound was heard then poured out about a spoonful into the glass and drank it   78.09511264103868
35   72.3156034989528
we are observed   138.38992920871652
he tried in vain to remember the faces or dress of the assassins   136.40376441593898
i almost hesitated though replied the sailor   136.31244936325152
what you do not know   213.12720842629136
have you traded it for your diamond   136.39054879681038
whispered aramis to athos did you see   105.06326480939485
the case was therefore prepared owing to the incessant labor of villefort who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming assizes   57.246310939767625
she was in a little boudoir hung with blue damask adorned by red flowers with a foliage of gold looking upon a garden   141.3735400418507
albert left the cab in which he had come at the count s door intending to take a turn on foot   98.07658760437792
and i have no inclination to play   187.0945090351898
cried the two friends   178.98099390679468
in the rue saint honore athos fell in with two gentlemen whom he did not know on horseback like himself followed by a lackey like himself and going in the same direction that he was   56.76197286136802
but withdrawing his anxious look from the chest and fixing it upon porthos he contented himself with saying monsieur our cousin will do us the favor of dining with us once before his departure for the campaign will he not madame coquenard   159.4257478431288
and who are you that they should have made so deep an impression on you   137.62292187188677
30137m go then into the drawing room my young friend where you will find your father awaiting you   16.788914708605787
exactly so said the delighted major   147.3087160357345
the sight of albert produced the effect which might naturally be expected on mercédès   86.15765201718145
i am a ruined man lost destroyed   149.1340277278457
would not m   81.52157325767575
four men traveling together would be suspected   102.68325299643843
have pity on me and do for me what i am unable to do for myself   128.16571513529556
we are admired i faith answered porthos   166.39196190374912
do i regret life   126.54865411996045
cried the young girl   144.10034484572606
this man was armand jean duplessis cardinal de richelieu   98.61267265928637
said porthos why separate since we are all together   139.71569627651266
the officer who had stopped in front of her and studied her with so much care might have been twenty five or twenty six years of age   132.38548919432574
gaetano then exchanged a few words with this man which the traveller did not understand but which evidently concerned him   87.20511692389572
and you sing chorus replied guitant laughing   161.29165799270783
but what s the matter raoul   97.35758050617186
the procureur   147.70830726758248
can i not like pasta malibran grisi acquire for myself what you would never have given me whatever might have been your fortune a hundred or a hundred and fifty thousand livres per annum for which i shall be indebted to no one but myself   136.04614691946017
she cried as d artagnan finished you dare to tell me the details of your crime to give me an account of your treason   116.41730541075025
i was passing by and drew up at this inn to rest my horse   190.57460742601953
my mother begs you to come   118.56607145137136
you here sir   69.8286140036517
they have been speaking of my marriage have they not   193.4063472151959
d avrigny put his hand to his heart and placed a glass before his lips   193.14352075532142
order it as you please sire   32.85585039829445
you expected my son would be a coward   72.29424209182136
d artagnan but that till that hour he had been at m   37.99572462964849
one of the notaries sat down the other remained standing   135.8628405307532
and when is the wedding to be   137.58682038417132
morrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken barrois s situation and in noirtier s name gave that order   65.72435228319799
de tréville or whether he should only ask him to give him carte blanche for some secret affair   47.36481254391873
for my part dear mother interposed renée i trust your wishes will not prosper and that providence will only permit petty offenders poor debtors and miserable cheats to fall into m   94.6332922191807
an exclamation of satisfaction indicated that the grave digger had found the object of his search   94.28382638864004
he was about to see in reality a certain coffer of which he had twenty times beheld the image in his dreams a coffer long and deep locked bolted fastened in the wall   80.86639172971012
de monte cristo is almost an oriental and it is customary with the orientals to secure full liberty for revenge by not eating or drinking in the houses of their enemies   95.29977308365804
i escaped the morcerf only to fall into the cavalcanti   109.48106413040684
athos cast a glance over the epistle and to disperse all the suspicions that might have been created read aloud my cousin my sister and i are skillful in interpreting dreams and even entertain great fear of them   129.19277592766514
but it seems you have come back rich my boy continued the tailor looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which dantès had thrown on the table   117.03733588807896
he had sent to engage a box at the teatro argentina   160.87521692309224
what is monsieur voiture ill   127.35857176488747
perhaps you are an officer that i am detaining here   105.01752641440838
i will name you the lucretia of england   148.1172214029382
ah here is one of them i believe   73.84034122337076
dantès began to fear he had delayed too long ere he administered the remedy and thrusting his hands into his hair continued gazing on the lifeless features of his friend   97.00458697318444
well there s nothing bad in that it seems to me said porthos   126.15439354551543
now attach him to our party   174.56428153243323
you can not mean that   100.41790655195328
men of the robe and men of the sword on the day after these events had taken place athos not having reappeared m   107.61502547399019
but instead of going into the saloon with the rest of the crowd he asked to be introduced to m   171.73562117580195
continued d artagnan   98.55740190888368
i confess this staggers me   117.06327227280669
he took the arm of madame danglars and conducted her into the garden where they found danglars taking coffee between the cavalcanti   96.95050613266815
but it appeared the servant did not find him   100.8071501694733
so you will say nothing   58.953814628814655
said monte cristo sighing   135.69307002535484
i come to bring and to hear bad tidings   114.04471846509036
yes replied de comminges more especially if it could reveal how monsieur d artagnan for this last week has been anathematizing him   113.82866014073578
it was night when the two adversaries reached the field of battle   135.45448194976436
he did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought me into this scrape   117.52165034611981
added villefort extending his hand toward her as though to seize her in the name of justice   108.67031417445085
i have my full power   209.01534042088002
woman s yes   143.07062637785884
inquired the grave digger who was looking on   66.10003192097932
this tunnel was dug no doubt with an intention of escape   47.86801858082369
and the father and son previously informed that it was through danglars the one was to receive his 48 000 francs and the other 50 000 livres annually were so full of affability that they would have shaken hands even with the banker s servants so much did their gratitude need an object to expend itself upon   112.8785413262261
both were very handsome but of quite different styles of beauty   94.70226567416849
but where is my old friend winter   110.90852369366486
i have heard of it   128.10173460988597
yes said villefort closing the door after him it is i who am come in my turn to ask you if we are quite alone   55.28537502087029
in the evening on his return franz found a letter from the embassy informing him that he would have the honor of being received by his holiness the next day   48.079498964114904
there was a profound silence   143.42407924152684
never had flora the fresh and smiling goddess of gardeners been honored with a purer or more scrupulous worship than that which was paid to her in this little enclosure   134.04434697589787
i confess i have seen nothing but the fire   85.92788564041943
and you say in his leisure moments the worthy man was a poacher   160.38176130364582
50101m do you wish to see him   110.28758980816126
both descended to the chamber in which the wounded man lay   42.90341408022836
to be a bishop   140.83401010204955
mademoiselle said the stranger one day you will receive a letter signed sinbad the sailor   164.0883186829986
yes i passed the evening at the cardinal rospigliosi s and there mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two men   51.73405146455245
my dear albert he said if you will make haste we shall yet have time to finish the night at torlonia s   79.10356739157571
well i m sure said morcerf this is indeed news   10.262876771922961
oh misery oh vanity   125.89022607469303
it is true then he said rather uttering his thoughts aloud than addressing his companion it is true then that all our actions leave their traces some sad others bright on our paths   108.28923884658967
stand off the road   79.30224347132754
but if i am not hungry   82.78917668947997
you know his father s name   165.3303713125317
i neither approve nor disapprove my lord   18.780955036920233
cried the cardinal astonished   146.43096209113537
he took the full glass and a biscuit   108.47150864752975
one of my brothers is about to die and i come to prepare him   140.5395906763775
he let off his fire at but four paces   176.35460441743533
yes your purveyor godeau the purveyor of the musketeers   58.13325527441478
besides do you see that door athos   137.4978186762629
he therefore hastened to the palace to congratulate the queen on the battle of lens determined beforehand to act with or against the court as his congratulations were well or ill received   129.29049868305938
then observe too that the woman with him is altogether unlike all others of her sex   127.00089337727567
at least i have thought so   60.87949693696444
they are below sire and with your permission la chesnaye will bid them come up   135.49767750422018
that is to say two hundred more a hundred pistoles for you and a hundred pistoles for me   70.90862555457895
the gentleman who receives us   155.68234589265154
behind this figure glowed a vast fireplace alive with leaping flames   27.44001153131289
why there is nothing to prove that the general was murdered   32.27507788640635
nor me either said athos   73.93875105595296
evening came   186.3793143144732
guess   20.689390258271686
asked raoul astonished   106.87144441842486
remember that his name is all my secret   81.4800430778491
and this costume a ball costume doubtless becomes her admirably   94.29833814174532
my mother only answered by sighs to consolations which she knew did not come from my father s heart   118.10017904965908
in an instant from the door of the cabinet to the street gate the whole hôtel was boiling   143.95093889160154
athos had desired blaisois to try to speak to aramis himself   113.02647107982565
to be sure we will replied aramis and porthos with admirable promptness and decision as if that were the simplest thing in the world to be sure we will get you out   95.01506967233928
let us speak of my affairs said mazarin since you will tell me naught of yours   155.62165347517504
it may be supposed then franz did not wait for a repetition of this permission but took off the handkerchief and found himself in the presence of a man from thirty eight to forty years of age dressed in a tunisian costume that is to say a red cap with a long blue silk tassel a vest of black cloth embroidered with gold pantaloons of deep red large and full gaiters of the same color embroidered with gold like the vest and yellow slippers   114.55838772732068
perhaps i may have heard them mentioned and might be able to aid you in finding them   180.0601569663699
if they knew anything they would not question people in this manner said d artagnan to himself   167.5060446706221
a hundred francs   67.34161264170955
ask me to lend you half a million and although such a loan is somewhat rare on my honor you would annoy me less   138.91059845623118
like one of those drunken satyrs in the pictures of rubens   124.11509528503086
he lives at the end of the yard on the left on the third story   16.471411837639934
open the gate he cried   84.24692877679726
permit me to inform you count said he bowing that i have received a letter of advice from thomson french of rome   162.9184057285942
what vessel is that   114.28822542199904
each was accompanied by two priests   183.22714930845683
the nobleman to whom he applied being a friend of porthos was very ready not to sell them as was proposed but to lend them   202.88756504052353
the conversation had now turned upon a topic so pleasing to morrel that he was ready to accede to anything that valentine thought fit to propose and he likewise felt that a piece of intelligence such as he just heard ought to be more than sufficient to content him for one day   33.43433986720183
i had designedly taken this direction   50.00978906757676
the charities present themselves to you through me   116.50579780057495
i was afraid not of a struggle but of a failure   92.28613573364618
they pitied the young king who was unconsciously ruining his country and threw all the odium of his proceedings on mazarin   74.62898545764646
they told me that you were the man i wanted   117.68750992286539
do not attribute to me more than i deserve sire that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first opinion you have been pleased to form of me   105.90986828934788
the young girl had freshness and beauty which many duchesses would have purchased with their coronets   156.21061065559826
monte cristo wiped the perspiration from his forehead but drew back when the waiter was presented to him   94.06847406719442
louis at st   56.34212013793496
fortunately the affair was not managed so secretly but that it became known to the queen   104.26190609828267
they hate it   103.09391400067044
morrel was seated at his right hand danglars at his left   35.036362574817986
supper was served   88.77299590440167
asked porthos in a self sufficient tone   135.90927187813128
you came from a country where he must be very much talked of and i know that his armaments against france greatly engage the attention of your friend the cardinal   119.31982991722398
and at ten yards from them the boat was at anchor undulating gracefully on the water   62.526764690095085
the count never plays he only drinks pure water tinged with a little sherry and is so rich that he can not without intending to laugh at me try to borrow money   69.94662468524238
the staircase creaked he descended into the room below approached the fire and lit a candle   91.2421176705276
oh have pity have pity   165.03483477584874
you were saying you wished to leave this place   129.50663992275204
let s see   84.17602011422005
i entreat you continued villefort   130.85854476760076
hush here is our man   57.705890761146264
you will not be pitiless   95.07828346198667
a hundred   125.16338471284186
but listen to me valentine and i will tell you all about it   75.76733140058316
pale as if he had been gazing on a serpent he fixed his terrified eye on the agonized sufferer   85.057069289792
the face of the first was lost to parry in the darkness   0.08699392951477591
your advice is wrong so i shall not follow it   144.17557970182585
we should be so on this occasion if only to be faithful to our oath said aramis   110.09644794863807
well why should not we too belong to a party   86.8717376453554
well then you understand beauchamp that we begin our search immediately   37.99992460599155
but i m his cousin   59.914226344150414
because sir said the president you have insulted a man and that man will not go one step farther without demanding honorable reparation   147.64808054738143
when shall we land in england   121.59685723605823
valentine named all the letters of the alphabet until she came to w   28.439610431959053
gad   77.30396941545237
was he placed here when he first arrived   105.52833481057799
yes dear friend athos replied but you said a word the other day that was more than reasonable it was noble and generous   135.89576653061428
come here my lad said la ramee and hear what i have to say   132.67440964254476
oh no sir   38.41469564398584
not at all madame but here sleeping in his bed   126.25309108772426
athos remained a musketeer under the command of d artagnan till the year 1633 at which period after a journey he made to touraine he also quit the service under the pretext of having inherited a small property in roussillon   82.239967636767
the man cried out   96.46608139899816
speak said the queen   175.2622850478198
let him come up   127.58317775183363
monte cristo looked for the entrance to the enclosure and was not long in finding a little wooden gate working on willow hinges and fastened with a nail and string   86.083754230837
i know an excellent method   111.8875952910169
a lamp burned in the chamber occupied by the priest   121.93143189495284
oh sir reply i entreat you is not the comte de la fere a noble whom i remember handsome and brave a musketeer under louis xiii   121.85459884618547
no returned the chief she is thine   105.33346252136651
that will suit me to a dot   51.642614368908625
as a punishment   62.308086894981514
they sought even more thoroughly than the august heirs had done but it was fruitless   83.67027518874673
and nodding to planchet he went out   102.07415227453727
mother said the young man looking alternately at madame morrel and her daughter what has occurred what has happened   81.25553860102737
no truly   119.10833597560149
he like porthos has obliged his peasantry to call him my lord and to dignify his pettifogging place by the name of chateau   140.92652314769327
a rope ladder   104.52944315370361
but you must not think of that athos   110.36312535497365
i have provided for everything   94.44716608779471
at the same moment a well known voice above him pronounced these words colonel i want to speak to the people   171.69221630354704
is this a snare or not   132.01545269035
it shall be so   160.31559968335137
ah yes that is the name certainly   136.42675636256465
can one hour have sufficed to prove to an architect that the work upon which he founded all his hopes was an impossible if not a sacrilegious undertaking   122.67484368088228
de tréville who as we have said were that evening on guard   110.4055370420539
monseigneur i was furnished with a description of your horses your lackeys your countenances nothing was omitted   60.80882797576113
that is not in listening to the music but in paying visits and conversing   86.65929467078993
is that the master whom you propose to me   113.39283996831941
here are ten thousand more francs he said with the fifteen thousand already in your pocket they will make twenty five thousand   50.81593703623437
marechal de la meilleraie returning without a hat fontrailles with his arm in a sling wounded guards horses bleeding   169.4721087112417
i never lose a note of this opera if i can avoid it   83.88341529447084
the count became pale as death the blood rushed to his heart and then again rising dyed his cheeks with crimson   132.86933532012085
i will have done with her   165.16262535108294
remember   108.8598077564385
after a momentary examination during which the queen became as white as the cloth which covered the altar on which she was leaning he put it back into the coffer with an involuntary shudder   5.7736025399513835
in an adjoining room andrea saw also a tolerably clean table prepared for two two bottles of wine sealed the one with green the other with yellow a supply of brandy in a decanter and a measure of fruit in a cabbage leaf cleverly arranged on an earthenware plate   129.60652116965008
from time to time his nostrils dilated as if eager for the smell of powder and he panted like a horse   50.01700109863631
ah that is different   127.8966772862026
not having seen him for a long time i could not make up my mind to leave him sooner so i hope this will be sufficient reason for my having made you wait   127.39919831749106
and already you contemplated crime under the excuse of want when god worked a miracle in your behalf sending you by my hands a fortune brilliant indeed for you who had never possessed any   48.357459307313135
you have a calm strong mind maximilian   105.03755281177254
and who am i to nourish such ambition   120.21043057904609
as he saw the abbé rise from his seat and go towards the door as though to ascertain if his horse were sufficiently refreshed to continue his journey caderousse and his wife exchanged looks of deep meaning   214.009325836711
she is cowardly said villefort   148.60866887402412
but it is probable said the light horseman that they will send pioneers this morning to repair the bastion   174.5305533214071
come step in said the young man   110.08185032099281
and the three friends did not exchange another word till they reached their quarters except to give the watchword to the sentinels   105.80584649399782
in arithmetic   114.60994006790206
before ten minutes had elapsed the child returned   177.69762591622026
you know what i have done   155.01398450809816
and of this be well assured that if you love me as a father i love you as a child   125.86137785752736
feeling certain that i intended to pass the night there he had returned to summon his comrades who just arrived in time to hear the report of the pistol and to take me in the midst of such circumstantial proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of proving my innocence utterly futile   161.58021118721072
far from wishing my lord to quit paris i hope he will stay there and continue to be prime minister as he is a great statesman   128.2848503325613
take bazin   94.99142671550185
not that i am aware of replied the young man unless indeed any ill feeling might have arisen from their being of opposite parties your father was as you know a zealous partisan of the bourbons while mine was wholly devoted to the emperor   61.784647931863205
my friend placed a bottle at the distance of thirty paces and at each cast he caught the neck of the bottle in his running noose   136.74371660000608
20189m come two or three more such adventures and i do not despair of seeing you a member of the academy   111.89754828332694
the groom heard him with humility took the bit of the impatient animal with his left hand and with the right held out the reins to andrea who taking them from him rested his polished boot lightly on the step   36.27455258346086
now said monte cristo as to the mother of the young man as to the mother of the young man repeated the italian with anxiety   119.09836476891029
the governor of the bastile was monsieur du tremblay the brother of the famous capuchin joseph that fearful favorite of richelieu s who went by the name of the gray cardinal   121.82744062452505
be punished alone for the first miserable man   122.65367944868439
every one thronged around mademoiselle paulet for she was always very much the fashion   117.75496031195755
this movement was accompanied by killing glances at mademoiselle danglars and by sighs launched in the same direction   126.28524868686368
that broussel shall be given up to them madame   163.05669641953483
exclaimed dantès his heart wrung with anguish   107.449565763545
old dantès was dead and mercédès had disappeared   183.40099806103626
but can he understand you   55.7657839437301
with regard to athos he leaped lightly into the saddle and set out at full gallop   50.023007000859934
he had received in the chest the bullet of d artagnan s first adversary   38.48520622316616
answer for i have many things to tell you too   82.26757591068821
yes saved saved   66.16619698201441
but if they are numerous observed mousqueton tis not we who have them but they who have us   70.85178315497694
how did you manage to escape that scoundrel mazarin   101.6053494760715
kitty will conduct you to my chamber   84.62958904529735
cæsar and his father searched examined scrutinized but found nothing or at least very little   80.0300470688312
how and why   77.62514492508546
i forgot there were three more steps before the landing   180.7647723399121
you never open your mouth but the stockbrokers immediately stenograph your words   113.88732804611492
said d artagnan with that jeering manner which our readers have so often observed in him since they made his acquaintance   207.75468502890686
the vessel was making way under a blue sky at great distance from the coast   156.93038147895504
now said d artagnan i ve one last favor to ask of you monsieur de comminges   147.14316404711758
albert could not understand the banker s look and turning to monte cristo who understood it perfectly did you see said he how he looked at me   119.8802648140501
everything depends on you   79.6098474373079
andrea turned pale but said nothing   124.84377524577599
my deduction is replied villefort that my father led away by his passions has committed some fault unknown to human justice but marked by the justice of god   137.42048114813628
and pray asked the baroness am i responsible for this loss   183.5138555933803
i thank you for having recognized me sir   105.33150148976736
this treasure belongs to you my dear friend replied dantès and to you only   92.5079392082868
i thought i had crushed you madame   103.71929713441054
but i do   42.91058646299648
it was likewise an indelicacy   129.02574409859744
caderousse went to the window touched the glass with it and found it would cut   184.51604272683204
and must i tell you my lord what they wished us to cry as well   198.46641809279777
an hour passed away and the old man gave no sign of returning animation   82.27506572729368
his despair when he found himself vanquished and the sensation when the muzzle of the carbine touched his forehead all these were brought before him in vivid and frightful reality   124.62566731437268
d artagnan awakened planchet and ordered him to open it   38.395733357900255
for a half league they proceeded thus the cannon shot sounding so near that they expected at each discharge to hear the hum of the balls   87.23621515640599
why then did heaven make the mistake of placing that manlike soul in that frail and delicate body   119.15819934357455
it is a magnificent charity   169.56191793358497
he mounted noiselessly into the chariot and pulled the silk cord which was attached to the coachman s little finger   94.68732163852577
then you have thought that barrois was poisoned   137.77484453934244
the two young men arose and entered the breakfast room   177.66043402796328
so saying the countess quitted franz leaving him unable to decide whether she were merely amusing herself at his expense or whether her fears and agitations were genuine   87.43290229536247
monte cristo returned her smile   133.03613497413622
porthos turned rather pale and drank off a large glass of wine   65.48992172607646
my cousin knows nobody but bazin and places confidence in nobody but him   204.0197943912209
and do you think she is in the least interested in me   64.07719355128177
our chimborazo is mortmartre our himalaya is mount valérien our great desert is the plain of grenelle where they are now boring an artesian well to water the caravans   80.13583543970724
at that moment he cut it   138.56405876309736
therefore i do not doubt what you say monsieur athos i do not doubt it for a single instant   205.16951885216122
my livery will be known replied porthos   75.35012647548764
according to the laws of dueling at that period d artagnan was at liberty to assist whom he pleased   59.17197341026766
although he felt himself ably supported the young man was not without a little uneasiness as he ascended the great staircase step by step   56.33938926427639
gentlemen and citizens set me free   104.1732814975072
but they eluded the vigilance of the guards and made a passage from one dungeon to the other   106.40505175904492
the doctor analyzed the symptoms of the malady to which the prisoner had succumbed and declared that he was dead   84.05055941533942
think of your joy mother when you see me return with an embroidered uniform   179.3023216476044
de tréville himself   99.85020338209199
madame danglars was rooted to the spot   151.24685888790822
he soon felt that his ideas became again collected he could think and strengthen his thoughts by reasoning   45.60055000742187
he followed with his eye each movement of teresa and her cavalier   128.00784758856236
excuse you for what   142.57936184363143
little flirtations perhaps and that s all   95.46227663458913
welcome to ye   155.94012023611194
valentine also knew the truth but she did not answer   111.71322811990616
i remained in the room and waited   130.12527573619042
between the two baskets he placed a small silver cup with a silver cover   139.83990188859113
we will spend with him a guinea each per day   100.4056250399056
god s blood   96.28016942569363
no said winter then he paused   122.34710394742169
selim made ready his lance   70.66528580078486
mercédès read albert while showing you that i have discovered your plans i hope also to convince you of my delicacy   182.06788291935032
in spite of his habitual silence the poor lad this time found his speech   155.4994290307721
whilst supper is being prepared he said smiling you will not my friend be sorry to have the mystery which so puzzles you cleared up   59.89327845379956
it was round and a large divan completely encircled it   63.7839560513204
porthos and mousqueton each took a horse by the bridle and proceeded to their post   102.06029113569224
on this assurance the two friends fell asleep   106.66929801776719
swear to nothing   54.5726035772586
still that idea of death madame said villefort   129.17644813335508
i own that this woman terrifies me   119.31014902093463
come said the wretch is not peace much better than such a war as that   96.34721822794124
windows   85.8074499032773
and the young girl kneeling on the top pressed the two parts of the portmanteau together and mademoiselle d armilly passed the bolt of the padlock through   98.88908133464936
never did a gamester whose whole fortune is staked on one cast of the die experience the anguish which edmond felt in his paroxysms of hope   159.0502029968377
your mission is accomplished but ours is not   132.54700466387882
no i have for the end of the month these bills which have been assigned to us by the house of pascal and the house of wild turner of marseilles amounting to nearly 55 000 francs   153.99828897311238
they were caught   95.3542179720589
the stranger touched his mule with his heel and continued his way   123.74289380966579
eugénie danglars   115.12685758026448
you will accept his judgment   132.791677985143
milady recoiled uttering a cry   143.82783575515637
i do not wish it said the eye of her grandfather   140.95475405868672
ten or twelve thousand travellers will arrive replied franz which will make it still more difficult   94.41987925930223
d artagnan s eyes sparkled with joy   142.6211693154816
this answer and especially the tone in which it was uttered chilled the heart of poor morrel   137.55007709037957
morrel examined the ledgers opened the portfolio and counted the money   91.68817517402724
they walked from one end of the chateau to the other porthos looking with wondering eyes at d artagnan who was counting on his fingers   55.62016138939912
his dialect amuses me   98.23619341182187
but this time milady lent a more attentive ear than the first and she heard their steps die away in the distance of the corridor   115.90193443980625
i see them about twenty paces behind my lord   62.08248940263191
do you wish to see me again   128.62071707712465
dantès recollected that his hair and beard had not been cut all the time he was at the château d if   105.34360943070199
i have a very good cook and he is not to be my heir   48.67081329273985
remarked d artagnan   111.30518909273589
i am the only guilty person am i not   109.77854930315628
he took his army to the priest s where they devoured as much provision as would have lasted him for two months and to the cornet s who performed wonders   188.23611352151636
have i sir comprehended your instructions   145.710305598426
with much pleasure your excellency if it would amuse you   166.0747638101269
then in my turn i also say very well   31.971614946005985
she then went on to describe the persecutions exercised by the cardinal upon his enemies   115.01464508645047
danglars will pay you the amount you may rest assured   175.99601026064263
yes yes said lord de winter who perceived what was passing in her mind   66.21262813603582
the past chapter 114   126.60026982861422
and now am i to rely upon an avowal extorted by religious or physical terror   76.01056919235515
then leaning with one hand on the oaken rail of the dock in the most graceful attitude possible he said gentlemen i assure you i had no idea of insulting the court or of making a useless disturbance in the presence of this honorable assembly   34.24761385355434
the first prince of the blood the king s uncle   97.24482103599115
let us go said athos and aramis   166.108087769196
leave him with me replied the duchess   109.92559743576484
four o clock   100.97151286272266
cried the marquise napoleon the type of equality   74.5756245371094
that is not his biggest scoop said morcerf   151.12457758294227
one of the last as you see   182.81739027809533
having crossed paris it passed through the faubourg du temple then leaving the exterior boulevards it reached the cemetery   203.40129490744738
come if one can t always eat one can always drink a maxim of poor athos the truth of which i have discovered since i began to be lonely   109.99316301970723
he loaded them looked at the priming and waited quietly   151.01247542686616
i have not breathed a syllable to them   54.76752506758545
so that since that time replied d artagnan totally unable to refrain from laughing at the pitiable face of the host   168.36659553561293
and on the other hand my lord you have lost it and now in accordance with the law of war sir you must buy it back again   146.76338624937264
he was safely sheltered and yet he felt dizzy in the midst of the warring of the elements and the dazzling brightness of the lightning   229.45391590412913
danglars wishes and at the same time to pay all due deference to his position in society donned his uniform of lieutenant general which he ornamented with all his crosses and thus attired ordered his finest horses and drove to the rue de la chaussée d antin   128.25175675769987
i have induced you to take a charming promenade   92.44607782292117
according to his conviction she was some creature of the cardinal and yet he felt himself invincibly drawn toward her by one of those sentiments for which we can not account   144.74638060875796
when you pay me a visit in my cell my young friend said he i will show you an entire work the fruits of the thoughts and reflections of my whole life   137.16862980378207
he answered her summons as an humble soldier obeys an illustrious general   71.5054983980726
felton stood before this strange apparition like one petrified   157.12257151334575
50265m give way said the traveller   131.64784485730613
the house in which aramis dwelt was situated between the rue cassette and the rue servandoni   48.10556651480812
i think that if you would take the trouble of reflecting you could find a way of simplifying the negotiation said franz   135.58541893258297
the carriage stopped   47.63392869636421
i will come directly cried valentine aloud   148.18064187748385
because i was arrested at piombino and i presume that like milan and florence piombino has become the capital of some french department   164.50008135947382
if he be a sensible man he will prove it by renouncing of his own accord the hand of his betrothed and will secure my friendship and love until death   97.32521835945698
i must speak freely to her accuse myself and say he approached the door touched the crystal handle which yielded to his hand   110.88774287735748
de laffemas whom he never ceased to designate during his account by the title of the cardinal s executioner and expatiated at great length upon the bastille the bolts the wickets the dungeons the gratings the instruments of torture   115.02750189417243
d artagnan felt himself bewildered   117.17741702324919
monseigneur is correctly informed said d artagnan   94.33886151564916
cried porthos and aramis   103.74919704942184
he however kept a good countenance holding his hat in his hand and awaiting the good pleasure of his eminence without too much assurance but also without too much humility   120.12956817528742
yes cried bonacieux recalling all his remembrances of the circumstances yes that s it   107.22362632478895
my faith yes said d artagnan   109.45832356293005
with one spring he flew from the chamber of milady into that of the maid and quick as lightning he slammed to the door and placed all his weight against it while kitty pushed the bolts   26.526112981024923
cried d artagnan to the coachman   68.35373123287563
he swam on still and already the terrible château had disappeared in the darkness   48.51475417587383
gentlemen said the president when silence was restored is the count of morcerf convicted of felony treason and conduct unbecoming a member of this house   46.7067067620159
the two young men shuddered for the same idea had more than once occurred to them   129.428937296373
go away now mouston   240.76150621916366
but perhaps he whom you await is inconstant or if he is not the sea is so to him   182.4372612966747
he folded up the accusation quietly and put it as quietly in his pocket   79.05738820474208
madame replied the marechal i have left three men on the pont neuf four at the halle six at the corner of the rue de l arbre sec and two at the door of your palace fifteen in all   201.69582898764259
you may retire   54.897761720480815
no on the contrary we shall not answer   120.33335407132992
on the contrary it would tempt me were i any other man rejoined aramis   32.23251276873674
the penalty of death i greatly fear   3.9758372491870944
i dislike these quarrels among men of the church   14.360115260454506
and then i feel the loss of my house tis a long time since i visited my castles   124.33923028546891
yes and give them a chance of escaping said d artagnan   121.47332477195862
franz is not expected to return home for a year to come i am told   44.63466826385407
d artagnan had his sword and placed two pistols in his belt   131.65740033884563
retorted the count   71.72596356572753
d artagnan released the hands of athos which he still held clasped in both his own and hastened to her   66.30230249534017
night   196.10049746284065
milady perceived that all was lost unless she gave felton an immediate and terrible proof of her courage   134.02282415559512
we were merely joking   119.771780696752
oh you are a just man   132.43047246662593
possibly nothing at all   104.67502922397887
but d artagnan was too far off to hear him   217.39652062347682
but in this world we must risk something   139.05007405395847
yes he said there is the stone upon which i used to sit   89.43882063063728
with these words the young man went out and descended the stairs with sufficient calmness to pass unobserved   94.67086913890815
asked his friend   105.40643519158367
it means that i have just returned from yanina   92.9148552428951
at least not at this moment for without you i could not discover the others   142.08349075679732
i agree with you entirely sir   150.8686241089749
to be sure why not   92.14139500468889
most of my readers are aware that the second act of parisina opens with the celebrated and effective duet in which parisina while sleeping betrays to azzo the secret of her love for ugo   128.83967297923274
mazarin shuddered but he reflected that a man who had the least intention to betray would not warn first   67.49245816420498
you are somewhat blasé i know and family scenes have not much effect on sinbad the sailor who has seen so many others   113.79795875807174
ah as regards aramis that is another thing said porthos and it wouldn t surprise me at all   128.98163199443468
here there was evidently nothing to seek or to apprehend and they passed rapidly to examine the third compartment   184.59733208554036
after giving me the plan of this house doubtless hoping i should kill the count and he thus become his heir or that the count would kill me and i should be out of his way he waylaid me and has murdered me   76.60923746515076
let us not lose a moment   127.37684399175541
mount my lord said d artagnan to mazarin who sprang into the carriage without waiting for a second bidding   87.31935951335032
i have spread a pair of white sheets on your bed   131.31838209495947
that is to say she was in the full splendor of her beauty   110.59219509096293
ah valentine tell me if he ever looked on you with one of those sweet smiles   38.32777413831133
in the first place i warn you that that letter is for monsieur de tréville and it must be found or if it is not found he will know how to find it   144.92723561918726
he can turn his coat inside out   177.5127331982893
sir she said to morcerf you are most welcome as the friend of my lord and master   13.398376201349237
you must obey the king   184.6460894991382
how do you feel barrois   51.509945280446296
indeed your excellency i had very considerable difficulty in obtaining them and as it is they have cost an enormous price   97.76718144477726
the notes reminded the men that the children women and old men whom they allowed to die were their sons their wives and their fathers and that it would be more just for everyone to be reduced to the common misery in order that equal conditions should give birth to unanimous resolutions   98.04057192783706
this marriage added madame de villefort is quite agreeable to the wishes of m   143.07862302256729
have you by any chance been in the bastile   143.08722486909934
why watch me   99.89205158040977
he is going to fall   156.82102874419607
which means   79.457968204754
who was your brother   152.71640760614642
ah said villefort smiling i confess i should like to be warned when one of these beings is in contact with me   107.20804300772292
whom god preserve   141.98315203117969
you will hear me to the end my lord   45.24920457603426
valentine smiled but it was evident that she suffered   71.99223295709956
from his eminence cardinal mazarin presenting a letter   109.29302037912075
aramis swallowed a hasty mouthful gulped a glass of wine and changed his clothes   107.86126140874983
major bartolomeo cavalcanti and count andrea cavalcanti announced baptistin   123.67268366436633
this man goes to give his last orders   130.02597093612485
i come from a land where there is not a cloud in the sky   71.49501942645503
now kiss me   192.98683497182353
cried d artagnan springing forward in his turn after the servant   134.37588949195015
i have never seen her from that day   146.5493893874982
you think this house pretty do you not   83.65350888089205
the horses could not be more than a hundred and fifty paces distant   78.1787644160541
de tréville alone remaining with the wounded   135.13532716212188
to every argument they replied we must go for death is in this house   83.32030822691698
they begin to morrow   135.30030185884314
one morning he took this man on one side and had succeeded in speaking to him when grimaud entered and seeing what was going on approached the duke respectfully but took the guard by the arm   118.56919714336848
the good captain leclere is dead father and it is probable that with the aid of m   186.95167355373295
presently said d artagnan   123.46190614137404
debray who has not trembled before me   71.09800040003948
an apartment as we have said had been retained beforehand and thus he had but to go to signor pastrini s hotel   88.35296444367188
the young man you speak of said villefort abruptly is a great criminal and i can do nothing for him mademoiselle   100.04757006900877
and then her thoughts cleaving through space like a bird in the air rested on cavalcanti   79.34536082349436
well it is the same with hashish   94.57044830445139
why was i a prisoner   107.2251639672383
although perhaps that counsel is as good as any other   141.64802698546092
see that cluster of persons collected around poor ali who is as much astonished as themselves   145.9273116333274
require our parole and give yourself no uneasiness   112.55741085359952
for the rest the orders had been issued by the count   112.48234127872819
and then there is a human being killed according to all the rules of art and skill and of whom justice learns nothing as was said by a terrible chemist of my acquaintance the worthy abbé adelmonte of taormina in sicily who has studied these national phenomena very profoundly   121.98825722773904
poor kitty hoped to speak a few words to d artagnan when he passed through her chamber   159.6789413293131
god preserved me but a man named brisemont died in my place   118.97183758148317
when she wakes she can sup   129.08291964157715
but yourself monsieur said athos who began to be annoyed by this inquisition give me i beg you the proof that you have the right to question me   58.47277381234323
meanwhile time was passing on for the prisoner as well as for those who were preparing his escape   150.68590716127116
but said danglars thoughtfully how is it that your patron m   139.23351283824016
like all persons of real genius milady knew what suited her nature and her means   86.51567653569221
don t stir whispered monte cristo and put down your hatchet   10.165204493798981
the aspect of external objects is often a mysterious guide communicating with the fibres of memory which in spite of us will arouse them at times   141.9636280819478
you hear d artagnan   87.33329921077856
but you may easily comprehend felton that the more superb the prison the greater was my terror   65.47562030576395
you see very plainly that there is still danger for you since a single word makes you tremble   71.54502413743977
help help my friends   160.17935407412108
noirtier my master wishes to speak on important subjects to m   81.29192400269336
a fine idea that of his said danglars shrugging his shoulders   109.98836392333618
he felt afraid of hearing his own history   78.70956218488809
say this to him sire you are deceived as to the feeling in france as to the opinions of the towns and the prejudices of the army   175.1877321296206
upon these conditions i will pay for the pen the price of the bottle and for the ink the price of the pie   238.47169478464002
the young man and young woman perceived they were watched and redoubled their speed   113.19159752680456
they told me the executioner of bethune was here and wounded when you uttered two piercing cries   83.60289560468588
the young man advanced rapidly into the chamber leaving the door open behind him and making a sign to milady to be silent   162.36110047355743
they weighed heavily upon your stomach   77.39944144121218
what can have been the reason of so singular a difference in parties and politics   60.98576715004655
for the major like a prudent man in case of any accident happening to his bank notes had immediately converted them into an available asset   109.29832258708007
the same day they came for me and took me to the bastile   77.40064806846979
be satisfied with being a plain straightforward citizen and turn to that side which offers the most advantages   197.35821489504616
i say two because in such circumstances monsieur du vallon who is rich always gives me his prisoners   125.46712383565517
your crime   147.7305773532472
but pray sir continued aramis who seeing his captain become appeased ventured to risk a prayer do not say that athos is wounded   51.73205650995082
his thin but wiry legs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings evidently of english manufacture while from his three cornered hat depended a long streaming knot of white and blue ribbons   68.0491798200509
he felt it was no longer to be a butchery but a fight and he resumed his usual good humor   134.02566584928618
a horse for your lackey   150.43024802317785
on the contrary it seemed to be a delicate attention to be gratefully received   113.64226110976924
no one ever asked her where she was going   116.57459379145956
noirtier s look continued to interrogate   121.77708053469532
risked our lives twenty times for your majesty   112.71580192008112
cried the steward struck with terror at this threat if that is the only reason i can not remain in your service i will tell all for if i quit you it will only be to go to the scaffold   83.37002765459273
with such a heart as yours and such a sword one passes through the valley of the shadow of death a dozen times unscathed and unalarmed   81.95171283730383
hear me maximilian said his father   114.3729357943098
oh how beautiful you are thus   72.5806857717715
he made up his mind not to take a single step to equip himself   158.32165653545826
then you came here to defend him   148.38931667373598
i love zaccone and he hates him   155.24340257762992
said aramis with that mildness of language which was observable in him every time that his ideas were directed toward the church   20.541154701727166
that is true said the duke   183.40009300176283
you don t know i quit the seminary   144.70955588740466
it is the talk of all paris   234.80686485940242
and monsieur du vallon added the other   57.54389032251834
gentlemen said he let us drink to him who presides at the repast   117.58979659897362
my time is not my own   85.51664949954238
cried dantès eagerly quitting the table   80.03786617770896
the second contained the duke and duchess of orleans the tall young mademoiselle and the abbé de la riviere   133.2276439502719
i neither know nor wish to know him   103.49793169624462
d artagnan started alone on his journey without other escort than his sword and with a simple passport from mazarin to secure his admission to the queen s presence   203.11521104485476
he remembered that the old association of musketeers was composed of four persons   111.53625627424188
but you come from england   177.18155921584523
i came to pray over the body of your daughter   107.38696382482881
i have told you   87.56246866081854
but your mission will not be accomplished   204.44762628177043
valentine gave him a look full of gratitude and remained as docile as a child   167.13721991591947
i present them   168.62156921112037
de chevreuse   109.11546574662377
yes monsieur i believe so   111.50913526509802
you are here   91.7245825054125
monseigneur replied porthos he has gone as a scout on account of some words of our host which made him believe the road was not safe   51.71023721649423
the pope had also need of money to bring matters to an end with louis xii   39.45815261555657
cried d artagnan what matters it to me after all if cromwell who s an englishman revolts against his king who is a scotchman   143.8206358838813
and with his fine countenance radiant with joy and happiness a more perfect specimen of manly beauty could scarcely be imagined   143.8870470474735
but this is not to the purpose our business concerns valentine let us leave the dead in peace   106.5637083099998
well said he do you still doubt   98.18087311301122
dantès hastened to his dungeon where he found him standing in the middle of the room pale as death his forehead streaming with perspiration and his hands clenched tightly together   66.31410880377034
cried milady seeing the interest which the young officer whose soul seemed to hang on her lips took in this strange recital   96.23971489339068
what she threatens she will do   141.85516257217404
emmanuel received him   92.83604105387319
for you and nobody else as the horse which paws the ground is mine and the other horse which is caracoling belongs to athos   77.21838465410642
look at the arms   129.28095979435778
monte cristo raised his head once more and this time he was calm as a child awaking from its sleep   127.43054764904167
he having seen them crossing the yard took care not to answer and they rang in vain   175.62284195950627
what hatred she distills   66.21545791897111
hence it resulted when d artagnan proceeded to draw his sword in earnest he found himself purely and simply armed with a stump of a sword about eight or ten inches in length which the host had carefully placed in the scabbard   62.76592565671723
i have read so in petronius said the count   115.18903382485944
but villefort interrupted him   63.14311943557803
go into my study here and i will show it to you   44.768931940523856
true said aramis so as i am in a minority i withdraw my proposition so far as it relates to the voyage to rome and monseigneur s resignation   145.46784876037924
last year i had four apricots they stole one i had one nectarine only one well sir they ate half of it on the wall   175.93787990323682
the dog again shook his head as if to say no   130.550692110194
i have but you in the world haydée   37.98011293689706
athos smiled but did not reply   184.67522554786876
i understand said athos   90.31889583743074
milady arose as if moved by a powerful spring and her eyes flashed lightning   65.5097249243158
morrel amazed let fall monte cristo s hand   114.76155963287066
for you porthos who carry matters in such a magnificent style and are a god to your valet mousqueton   120.71785251550594
but i see that you have preferred commending yourself to me by giving me good counsel   74.10241296488601
till we meet again then dear traitor   114.30883278662675
i thought he was philosopher enough to allow that there was no murder in politics   104.13011518292534
i only know that there was a conspiracy to rescue the king   117.57820996427714
you oh heaven you   100.62198254373743
in his escape alone apart from his plans for the future which it must be admitted were for the present sufficiently vague and uncertain there was a beginning of vengeance which filled his heart   119.86560944581592
that the new landlord gave them their choice of any of the rooms in the house without the least augmentation of rent upon condition of their giving instant possession of the two small chambers they at present inhabited   29.255123502997122
let us first see said he whether it is possible to remove the traces of my entrance here our future tranquillity depends upon our jailers being entirely ignorant of it   51.81526076581341
and that you alone amongst the men whom you do not recognize as your brothers for you have said so observed villefort in a tone that faltered somewhat you alone are perfect   119.45434218962534
from the time d artagnan took quarters in that hotel the mistress of the house a pretty and fresh looking flemish woman twenty five or twenty six years old had been singularly interested in him   48.15035331022598
it appears said cromwell that this improvised executioner did his duty remarkably well   183.06367144976997
his eyes were fixed on those of athos and perhaps he comprehended all that passed in the heart of the man who was awaiting his awakening as a lover awaits the awakening of his mistress for his glance in return had all the tenderness of love   116.89820331849847
i do not understand you baron said morcerf   127.26012584336786
i ask for mme   159.8733588401481
so said the cardinal in a tone that contrasted strongly with the severity of his words you have constituted yourselves judges without remembering that they who punish without license to punish are assassins   93.7085438771471
while in that service he had discovered a silver mine in the mountains of thessaly but he had been careful to conceal it from everyone   100.92355466268468
mademoiselle eugénie   168.46185903167242
and twice or three times he even saw the shadow of a person intercept the light   182.99959774980312
but being obliged to go against the current he advanced but slowly   116.83771432881599
said morrel in a hoarse voice   85.21039991627802
franz hastened to inquire after the count and to express regret that he had not returned in sufficient time   4.335301595218354
and as since that which you have said is too clear to require any explanation replied d artagnan in a low voice i beg you to follow me   112.0322498893246
a half hour afterward d artagnan returned with the two thousand livres and without having met with any accident   111.80556154013392
let her go free and i will exact nothing else from you   130.83903335713453
and so connoisseurs in wine as we are we have sent you some anjou wine   17.815688380777047
twas that low fellow bonacieux   59.35656381313349
sir my instinct told me that those people were assembled there for some bad purpose   107.20494841157071
believe me madame i feel most grateful for your kindness but i got out of my travelling carriage at your door this morning and i am ignorant how i am installed in paris which i scarcely know   154.58267184473652
what is the matter my dear m   55.61735139764327
by my soul you had made me forget all that dear constance   75.43097221795131
on turning round the owner saw danglars behind him apparently awaiting orders but in reality also watching the young sailor but there was a great difference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the movements of edmond dantès   91.52701298974904
he felt that he had passed beyond the bounds of vengeance and that he could no longer say god is for and with me   113.3923593104024
let us unfold them first and then pass on to the private plans which perhaps had not less influence upon his eminence than the others   130.24855935182174
because i bent my arm and rested my hand on my elbow so   122.00157732933772
our host   114.65116225502501
at that period of his life i lost sight of my young comrade   45.056442098317305
my father was not a bit behind yours in that sort of talk   49.20366404157977
and you fellows resumed mousqueton stay near monsieur le comte d artagnan and pay him every attention in your power whilst i go to prepare my lord for his visit   73.84465473438837
but since they served your eminence so well why are they my lord cardinal in prison   135.29502105899243
how do you feel this morning   143.17145217337793
you say we are going to see athos now and if you will come thither i beg you to make haste for we have lost much time already   149.94769080795055
the next day on awaking the count perceived raoul by his bedside   177.70316837747117
excuse me madame said debray coldly i had your permission to do so and i have made use of it   120.67308643687983
but you have been traveling these four days as you told me yourself   120.78237966339212
the journey monte cristo uttered a joyful exclamation on seeing the young men together   102.38368481745184
but the real adieux were made in mme   69.72805286097643
asked the queen who did not understand or rather was not willing to understand   95.36392167068297
it appears that after having challenged m   72.85682548274067
at these words he gave a signal and as if only awaiting this signal the yacht instantly put out to sea   145.92238047005327
my terror overcame me to such a degree as i approached the thicket that i took a pistol from my pocket and armed myself   205.11065697770556
edmond welcomed the meeting with this fellow who had been one of his own sailors as a sure means of testing the extent of the change which time had worked in his own appearance   165.0124396874146
she advanced some steps towards the staircase and listened   109.43429332491442
the dose has been excessive but she has only been shaken by it   43.80530486964631
but never mind i will put up with it for the sake of remaining with you   93.04450259749112
he then set himself to work to count his fortune   75.02428344143138
of latude from the bastille   39.48960905373551
scarcely more   105.96433513759689
no matter replied de boville in supreme good humor at the certainty of recovering his two hundred thousand francs no matter i can fancy it   159.37797706660857
twenty five thousand francs a bottle   55.70954028411287
and what is your business   146.02952685024408
said mousqueton the letter was very consoling   131.81953188526458
he seems besotted said danglars pushing caderousse with his knee   5.517586549422944
you may reckon upon me and so may your friend   86.75006516451388
but he held too tenaciously to his projects above all to this one to change the program which he had laid out in advance   88.46721726365712
when madame de beauvais appeared at the door and announced the cardinal the child who had been absorbed in the pages of quintus curtius enlivened as they were by engravings of alexander s feats of arms frowned and looked at his mother   105.60620069187705
a silk waistcoat covered with embroidery   99.14563177837223
silence be silent   126.3049478763138
delirium   101.59917927153074
she would look far better if she wore fewer and we should then be able to see her finely formed throat and wrists   123.91583966455664
of the caresses of children so pleasing and so sweet especially when one is parting from his children never to see them again   65.46844417126405
i shall stop and conceal myself a few leagues hence until my brother can rejoin me   114.99469959929804
and he lives   178.3721722505307
and i the duc de beaufort by his white plume of ostrich feathers   71.74180712718226
i felt a great chill at my heart and at the word fire which resounded in spanish from the enemy s ranks i closed my eyes and thought of you   44.77763917992526
the noise had ceased   179.7913623088162
on this occasion he began his rounds at dantès cell and on leaving him he went on to faria s dungeon taking thither breakfast and some linen   103.7110083014381
laughed the apparition every gentleman seems to have the same fancy for not a quarter of an hour ago a young lad well mounted like you as tall as you and of about your age halted before this clump of trees and had this table and this chair brought here and dined here with an old gentleman who seemed to be his tutor upon a pie of which they haven t left a mouthful and two bottles of macon wine of which they haven t left a drop but fortunately we have still some of the same wine and some of the same pies left and if your worship will but give your orders no friend replied raoul smiling i am obliged to you but at this moment i want nothing but the things for which i have asked only i shall be very glad if the ink prove black and the pen good   36.35802739870881
but you received it with enthusiasm   131.74484325956774
come sir said he addressing broussel silence that woman and follow me   156.64551551214277
the gentleman raised his eyes slowly from the nag to his cavalier as if he required some time to ascertain whether it could be to him that such strange reproaches were addressed   147.83163644983352
the ballet ended amid the applause of the whole assemblage and everyone reconducted his lady to her place   157.41415703963497
if he spoke hastily and owns that he did so you ought to be satisfied   145.4011497767449
but why did that man attack porthos rather than any other one of us   120.93357868479555
said the cardinal knitting his brow   102.50724838362584
it is a snare to prevent your making any resistance when they come to fetch you   138.69523900126708
turning towards monte cristo she added count will you oblige me with your arm   129.39967239511617
gascon headed man will you have done   159.91310920745659
you understand then monsieur resumed planchet that if it were for some enterprise like that undertaken against monsieur broussel that you should ask me to take my carbine no don t be alarmed   163.9009687098117
then thinking the deposit might contain some treasure he turned up the ground and found me still living   22.387951999544867
porthos was not very quick to understand the language of glances but now since the name of athos had suggested to him the same idea he understood   138.2399067417323
planchet added grimaud   234.4242968570819
on my part i will go out with my hands in my pockets that nothing may be suspected   112.60099733972987
but i do not mean my friend that we were right in what we did   171.07944772415655
then in spite of my cries in spite of my resistance for i began to comprehend that there was a question of something worse than death the executioner seized me threw me on the floor fastened me with his bonds and suffocated by sobs almost without sense invoking god who did not listen to me i uttered all at once a frightful cry of pain and shame   101.86325878407979
i hope soon to see you again my dear edmond   160.71117533256358
many curious faces had already appeared at the windows and the people attracted to the end of the street began to run first men then groups and then a crowd of people   136.87916290679365
valentine cast down her eyes   129.1334021221582
the trap once replaced over his head you being on the trap dead or alive they will need at least ten minutes to find the hole by which he has escaped   147.66716750751777
franz paused for a moment   185.30667422384448
so that now continued caderousse he owns a magnificent house no   142.8488233477668
dantès had entered the château d if with the round open smiling face of a young and happy man with whom the early paths of life have been smooth and who anticipates a future corresponding with his past   82.20710994344189
then you will be besieged   110.01245494188852
there was not a blade of grass to be seen in the paths or a weed in the flower beds   112.93428825693975
i said without your laying out a sou   120.25186681179748
farewell saintly martyred majesty lisped athos chilled with terror   185.462193434802
a telegraph   124.58143306758046
the three musketeers therefore did not hesitate to make a step forward   99.36404491306257
and as if the shrieks of anguish had driven away the clouds the veil which hid the moon was cleated away and the gray sails and dark shrouds of the felucca were plainly visible beneath the silvery light   125.20025126733765
its flickerings awoke him and he found his fingers as damp and purple as though they had been dipped in blood   102.7413774906475
consider also that i fully believed i had accomplished the end and aim of my undertaking for which i had so exactly husbanded my strength as to make it just hold out to the termination of my enterprise   197.48141522687675
albert was accompanied by lucien debray who joining in his friend s conversation added some passing compliments the source of which the count s talent for finesse easily enabled him to guess   140.3342817139884
i know it sir replied monte cristo   121.08614280073935
we every day pass through the air hole some bread at the end of a fork and some meat when he asks for it   38.175038481782906
it was precisely at this moment that m   158.99134191956685
i am going to take my patient into the next room to bleed him   87.25945531403588
allow it to die tranquilly and honorably of old age and if you make a campaign with it take as much care of it as you would of an old servant   174.80541474170857
those are indeed holidays to me   137.01640692437735
as danglars had hitherto contented himself with being called a baron he felt rather flattered at the title of excellency and distributed a dozen silver coins among the beggars who were ready for twelve more to call him your highness   107.14396436072165
the title attracted me   162.64784612896662
thanks to m   130.7074383400604
it was now athos who turned pale   99.39532366270475
see gentlemen said m   105.98351176128688
oh madame do not think that   19.85722428872195
they had told him to hope for it but had not told him what was to be hidden in the mysterious pate   90.54262713254272
d artagnan seized the hand held out to him and kissed it ardently   64.99957289583864
raoul without dismounting called to the host and announced that a wounded man was about to be brought to his house and begged him in the meantime to prepare everything needful   105.28362613244795
danglars is accustomed to play at gaining or losing 300 000 francs in a day   98.96788729525625
oh you do not mean that said he   146.3552887133829
this time you have an idea   64.41045301438508
and is it your cook who prepares these pills   171.9788600724503
monte cristo was engaged in examining this portrait with no less care than he had bestowed upon the other when another door opened and he found himself opposite to the count of morcerf in person   112.26073306147799
yes replied morcerf but that will plunge my mother into positive grief   168.61479851295454
the ninny   95.61656788777705
rising and retreating to the very wall   77.05059451895076
milady concealed her face in her hands as if she could not endure the shame which this name recalled to her   19.615014802188853
you here at this hour   74.23949958815592
do not forsake me   87.67044158708295
oh yes my friend   60.04746409597583
yes my lord said the marshal you have divined all that was possible to human genius   52.96224242379485
but is not your eminence going to the queen   184.90656668869144
the plate was magnificent old and appertaining to the family   170.90984579393307
he stifled therefore the feelings of compassion that were rising composed his features and sat down grim and sombre at his desk   52.91124653270051
if by chance our amphitryon changes his mind and receives only porthos and myself why then we must resort to heroic measures and each give two strokes instead of one   199.35211251564195
and he concluded his speech with a deep sigh   46.05121329099805
monsieur de gondy would pay a hundred thousand francs for such a secret   161.84731777506494
this cry was generally heeded   83.57863430168368
i will describe my captivity   110.5087737765744
ah reverend sir i tell you the simple truth   138.66421257803867
the most humble clerks such as our deacons and sacristans bless with holy water sprinklers which resemble an infinite number of blessing fingers   164.99214129419119
nine tenths of the english people are horrified at what you say   106.48962138385978
and what have you done with your ecclesiastics   129.09303598326497
and we are even a little uneasy on what account   60.26272389502257
this was too much for the procurator s wife   66.40250775859025
there and elsewhere   130.2967974481637
it was then into the midst of this tumult and disorder that our young man advanced with a beating heart ranging his long rapier up his lanky leg and keeping one hand on the edge of his cap with that half smile of the embarrassed provincial who wishes to put on a good face   85.14899165235832
mazarin who at the words it is not the queen with whom the people are displeased had pricked up his ears thinking that the coadjutor was about to speak of the cries down with mazarin and pleased with gondy s suppression of this fact he said with his sweetest voice and his most gracious expression madame credit the coadjutor who is one of the most able politicians we have   125.6282510580532
observe said villefort smiling i do not mean to deny that both these men were revolutionary scoundrels and that the 9th thermidor and the 4th of april in the year 1814 were lucky days for france worthy of being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil order   144.03113664584228
look at england madame   43.76201646085711
at length the shutter closed   53.61207868429397
from the comte de la fere said aramis   182.28041904791095
marvelous   155.07918144028636
it was agreed in a brief council held among them that julie should write to her brother who was in garrison at nîmes to come to them as speedily as possible   87.75287428975831
a great pity said monte cristo   135.46135902681928
yes you know the amount   152.2501209429004
it would be a curious idea and maybe i should find my friend under the name of achilles   100.4874623128079
fie madame fie   93.07767092116401
to what do you allude monsieur   202.18216005125493
oh unhappy woman   205.84942809950562
come just acknowledge that i could eh   81.15398519117343
in honest truth raoul   93.15079884387427
nevertheless the keen glance of athos perceived at once it was not rogers who stood before them   75.43497715237898
villefort went himself to find her   70.95470534150019
i should like to have seen you in my place   39.23135543572664
the hostess threw herself at his feet asked his pardon and held him back with a sweet violence   184.35195091685006
ah i shall know how to make you leave your home   21.34142823210695
the servants passed gayly along the fine courtyard   99.1350947980449
have a care how far you pledge yourself my good friend for i may remind you of your promise at some perhaps not very distant period when i in my turn may require your aid and influence   99.05624405937422
your brother   91.43217497212171
i give you my word of a gentleman   176.72954172713133
it is nevertheless the truth monsieur the pure truth the truth of the good god   148.82786116200236
what m   64.6457117160833
what think you of it   124.83956460614826
danglars threw himself upon his goat skin and peppino reclosing the door again began eating his peas and bacon   51.0446132121993
the three men saluted one another whilst exchanging a last look   76.38118517729623
and where is the unfortunate being   82.126151154339
as the hour to wait upon the king was not till twelve he had made a party with porthos and aramis to play a game at tennis in a tennis court situated near the stables of the luxembourg   78.48751508429157
caderousse who had let his head drop on the table now raised it and looking at fernand with his dull and fishy eyes he said kill dantès   198.19501053695785
the man is tired said the captain conduct him to his bed   134.1917691495728
poverty was repugnant to her   180.533833531888
nothing dulls the intellect like sleep   129.65315310294213
now asked porthos what are we to do   38.97747580548992
dantès had tasted nothing but he thought not of hunger at such a moment   75.82527679373001
embrace also our good and brave porthos   9.112345503671918
aramis looked after them and as the last of them passed close to him he pressed the hand of athos   99.68429093122634
a week passed by   10.431168425268439
arrested were they   125.36751730817959
and fearing that not   170.14853736586718
d avrigny warned me of it   97.81773311428066
leave the rest to me   60.16561059032374
i should like to understand said porthos   44.322002728562595
thanks to the spurs which served as stirrups in a moment we were perched upon the croupe   117.82936295324131
this was all the furniture   109.7483543899283
the duke shrugged his shoulders   160.40106825523486
that s very kind of him   157.782435578146
he was at least forty   169.05805220133215
peppino is a lad of sense who unlike most men who are happy in proportion as they are noticed was delighted to see that the general attention was directed towards his companion   100.78413274770196
20219m let us understand each other said albert   51.51439551390709
franz waited impatiently inhaling the aroma of the roasted meat when the captain returned with a mysterious air   64.28805031216558
it depends on you only   162.99447288170524
no matter i was aware of his intention   122.42832132864757
this conversation had passed as they stood upon the terrace from which a flight of stone steps led to the carriage drive   110.96674840371402
but i will tell you   10.278874020452292
you will see it approach after having struck your father your wife perhaps your son   79.26954511813126
adieu mademoiselle   56.16734961980636
come said the count mildly do not entertain the prejudices of ordinary men morrel   187.0227384379067
de tréville and ran quickly up the stairs   124.13128365790479
d artagnan took advantage of the circumstance to find a place in the hedge not so thick where his glance could penetrate to the supposed cavalier   48.54781247349622
it was then nearly eight o clock in the evening   42.072193243529824
yes but i came to ask something more than to be your companion   113.96815503489591
at last he heard the voice of la ramee   118.3628945959496
there is the wounded man said de guiche passing close to the augustine brother   163.24113110349506
remain free then and guard your hatreds and your sympathies   144.92055860697275
do not say that debray returned beauchamp laughing for here is château renaud who to cure you of your mania for paradoxes will pass the sword of renaud de montauban his ancestor through your body   61.026041370290436
long live blancmesnil   173.3071777804758
he went on his way   174.04448350294308
he waited for a moment in the hall and called for a servant to conduct him to m   213.51112345698093
then came a hum and buzz as of many voices so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the bridal party among whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension quelled every disposition to talk and almost instantaneously the most deathlike stillness prevailed   178.07934897310056
be assured of that   50.15371922805908
well then we will live and die together   116.11834709198617
my dear friend exclaimed athos how i should admire the resources of your mind did i not stop to adore those of your heart   167.9492803688566
the englishmen convinced of these peaceful proceedings sheathed their swords grumblingly   82.97500600288765
but did you think there was anything particular in his look   91.65205807543435
this demon gout this demon gout   77.85667339438629
he has been beaten   96.05172829317041
rather say to take him back with you into the world   70.65770707642116
yes i have seen him he replied and he has handed this letter to me   171.75319586952878
then i must give up the idea   65.61631952301775
said he on perceiving d artagnan   79.78782302789402
he is coming to play with us this evening   151.85992366279152
speak to me not as a magistrate but as a friend   95.44655759855316
does not that sunbeam yonder just by the side of the town glitter on the ironsides   93.54764026401857
goeden day broder replied the astonished landlady   99.71688253908052
to that i can say nothing returned d artagnan who knew the vanity of the new baron   114.0363740453635
i am dying with anxiety   154.25404229585544
but you madame so beautiful in reality you so pure in appearance must have committed great iniquities for lord de winter to pursue you thus   133.8515306173247
in three hours and a half andrea had traversed the nine leagues which separated him from compiègne and four o clock struck as he reached the place where the coaches stop   147.21975201996557
but we could throw them into the ditch said porthos after having assured ourselves they have nothing in their pockets   42.50331521809008
all were still   108.857578587091
the young men rose and returned into the salon while the count again apologizing left by another door   132.9998485040045
have you any money   86.41445213732557
if bonaparte landed at naples the whole coalition would be on foot before he could even reach piombino   147.2145208101628
i must run away for they would send here for me or rather farewell till i see you again   167.37861060150172
those born to wealth and who have the means of gratifying every wish said emmanuel know not what is the real happiness of life just as those who have been tossed on the stormy waters of the ocean on a few frail planks can alone realize the blessings of fair weather   31.906460657561837
cried the officer in the tone of ill humor habitual to him   199.88228941734516
but should you find the means of retaining them remember my lord that i shall esteem you as having rendered the greatest service that a gentleman can render to a queen   103.47860103982948
oh traitors that ye are   173.10860799191553
which only gives us a greater desire to know the real ones replied the englishman   69.04514229131685
some other unfortunate being will soon take my place and to him you will appear like an angel of salvation   88.28490792947105
oh these plans of retreat have been formed for a long time   189.55950311978987
said mazarin uneasily   47.0856491985065
he was so well wrapped up in his cloak that it would have been impossible to see his face even if the night had not been so dark as to render precaution superfluous   158.99822957380246
oh decidedly sir   127.19740622469448
on the honor of mazarin   119.38503008851444
only if they disregard your prayers if your father and madame de saint méran insist that m   89.88750384798496
cried d artagnan making the best face possible and never retreating one step before his three assailants who continued to shower blows upon him   129.29785120909932
and indeed i am not sorry to quit paris   58.38603367579468
andrea turned pale and drew towards the door   158.30686681345162
go monsieur i will follow you   109.71720799321503
my dear m   73.61656480682547
every few minutes he turned around and thus obliged us to conceal ourselves   106.03578579208555
you shall see   118.41462732144912
and who is the cause of all this annoyance   89.41441119437971
in short answered the duke if i comprehend you aright la ramee i am ungrateful for having ever thought of leaving this place   94.68147932558169
no said the banker   163.4916081650096
ah s blood how you have hurt me   149.34724700437292
we have said that teresa was handsome but this is not all   126.18441682943886
he dreamed that he was endowed with wings he wished to fly away   111.43895426452904
d artagnan as we have said perceived a hole in that place and in this hole the steps of a winding staircase   152.21501372198983
the benevolent abbé took an evident interest in all that concerned me   116.8390592956993
but the abbess on her part maintained a reserve still more prudent contenting herself with making a profound inclination of the head every time the fair traveler pronounced the name of his eminence   97.11521077127271
each time he read it he renewed his vow to make her happy   150.2400532021099
he must have one said athos   53.50351135285978
well i at least resemble the disciples of esculapius in one thing people spoke in this style in 1815 that of not being able to call a day my own not even that of my betrothal   157.53515039881944
i wished to punish myself but he has pardoned me   228.8907574231137
they still hesitated an instant   93.91325715321389
and as the wound is very serious seeing that after crossing the shoulder it penetrates into the chest it is to be feared at this instant the tapestry was raised and a noble and handsome head but frightfully pale appeared under the fringe   103.63232835763297
i have given you a great fright have i not   9.45517430291234
my children two of them at least the duke of york and the princess elizabeth are far away from me exposed to the blows of the ambitious and our foes   129.67629881810586
in that case i will go   95.48560192581391
and more than this he insisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned in the address   143.29356565121228
so saying the worthy shipowner quitted the two allies and proceeded in the direction of the palais de justice   137.1503430765119
oh would we could relate it everywhere and to everyone so that the emotion of our unknown benefactor might reveal his presence   138.27839763793594
noirtier which she can not be when she becomes the baroness d épinay   138.49408636656102
but one thing i have resolved on and that is to stop at nothing to restore a poor devil to liberty who has got into this scrape solely from having served me   95.78310694083609
you know his success our dear duke   113.24653041297458
edmond dantès   156.5077297100278
i as a philosopher should like a little country house a cottage down there under the trees without so many free stones over my poor body   17.536276796732267
bonacieux having always lived among her husband s friends people little capable of inspiring any sentiment whatever in a young woman whose heart was above her position mme   88.87621667287188
to provoke him to threats and violence which would produce a contrast with her own resignation such was her plan   141.09879136930968
with his elbows on the table he sat between the two empty bottles while spectres danced in the light of the unsnuffed candle spectres such as hoffmann strews over his punch drenched pages like black fantastic dust   65.08967371227179
yes albert from whatever source the blow may have proceeded it may be from an enemy but that enemy is only the agent of providence   135.0989700228669
the mendicant continued to rip his garments   98.12109511125406
half an hour after the night was quite dark   104.48544413947937
so that he still expects his money   72.04739082396159
well what do you think of this my fine fellow   154.48956692169756
in six hours they reached compiegne and alighted at the peacock   97.60081181047556
and now these few words uttered by faria after so painful a crisis seemed to indicate a serious relapse into mental alienation   130.52999337274048
and if it were an interrogatory   141.84510150734047
speak monsieur speak at once   176.32385887712704
what do you say of this   173.201029799154
arrived here only yesterday morning and married today at three o clock   143.25358691944007
we shall meet soon i trust in paris where you shall have your revenge   38.93574908608191
tis not a long time since the late cardinal burnt urban grandier though   81.63669591583758
how did you penetrate hither   65.70369913755198
well penelon said the captain what makes you shake your head   142.64044926084185
then you know the men who are now on monte cristo   110.6706474148918
no one can deny his being a noble hearted young fellow   148.48803307558666
mad   68.63255724402222
dantès rose advanced a few steps and with a fervent prayer of gratitude stretched himself on the granite which seemed to him softer than down   109.19687094450437
she is young   83.52508007679582
nothing but what you are fond of   129.38090924587317
said caderousse thunderstruck but for that black hair i should say you were the englishman lord wilmore   73.65645103582071
then do not marry her said the count   51.95078127516859
adieu madame   122.76592964850839
foolish creature he exclaimed   91.4107657754994
this movement revealed the spot where winter s body had fallen   143.38454509412708
i shall entertain whatever may happen said d artagnan placing his hand upon his breast and bowing an eternal gratitude toward your eminence for that which you now do for me   116.95583689695007
was it not by chance he caused the earth to be dug up   145.13982646788364
i do not know why but i imagine that this woman wholly unknown to me as she is and wholly unknown to her as i am has an influence over my life   155.35969842758976
you who have chateau meadows mountains woods you who have forty thousand francs a year you are not happy   117.82592019505911
you guess well   160.70389039692535
my mother replied the young princess a cavalier has just entered the louvre and wishes to present his respects to your majesty   90.87722231813122
oh it must have been the young man certainly for he was strong and industrious while the abbé was aged and weak   154.53617579974537
the count s eye expanded   126.892457129403
he no longer loved her   110.04084967977087
the groom in every respect a caricature of the english fashion was standing on tiptoe to hold a large iron gray horse   137.09441793171365
precisely so replied gaetano   164.19628774338162
it is count de rochefort   112.8471301324211
lieutenant yesterday said aramis captain to day colonel doubtless to morrow   134.18593944790283
noirtier made no answer   141.57348078344
but milady herself reconducted him through the darkness and only quit him at the staircase   185.68679690195893
particularly when there is money in the house eh   87.3937535177184
stay since we have finished dinner i will show it to you and then we will take coffee in the garden   143.60055557755084
and now what is to be done   130.8439555057149
everyone looked at his neighbor   63.50002335543868
but argued porthos i speak french and they are all english   160.05861580126205
de tréville was in his saloon with his habitual court of gentlemen   90.05053723658251
a large vase of japan porcelain filled with flowers that loaded the air with their perfume stood in the salon   39.02608301965472
you look to the one below   95.11345711945184
i had known the famous vampa for more than ten years   139.01866729879262
as the count s title sounded on his ear he rose and addressing his colleagues who were members of one or the other chamber he said gentlemen pardon me for leaving you so abruptly   158.2292765517176
become of whom   135.99928600257834
preoccupied as monsieur was with the letter he had received he did not observe that   154.1428804803245
said porthos i have heard that he had adopted a young man who resembles him greatly   125.23748609371324
reverend sir   130.28262896184668
the poor man was recovering with difficulty the order in his house in which he had found most of the furniture broken and the closets nearly emptied justice not being one of the three things which king solomon names as leaving no traces of their passage   221.93976436787375
during this storm gondy who had it in his power to make it most unpleasant for the jesters remained calm and stern   128.22736604996152
i shared the same fate at aquapendente   106.2931923782943
and i too said porthos   88.0547884288037
she looked at luigi who could not refuse his assent   65.17407961262958
the letter signed sinbad the sailor is it not   3.3693665197888265
during the period that the duc de bassompierre passed in the bastile where he remained for twelve long years when his companions in their dreams of liberty said to each other as for me i shall go out of the prison at such a time and another at such and such a time the duke used to answer as for me gentlemen i shall leave only when monsieur du tremblay leaves   134.8774129640186
have you a spanish prisoner   45.05494027649718
do you know what you did unfortunate adviser   120.35596974786266
montalivet transmitted to the prefect of bayonne mystified by two greek words têle graphein   152.14327709443876
baptistin bowed and was proceeding towards the door   95.24436137520453
i know it will end in that way   104.37741104270553
that fellow has a decidedly bad countenance said the count in a tone of disgust as he shut up his glass into its ivory case   71.4421306219376
morrel whispered what have you done to him   132.16687657577174
how many men have you about the palais royal   130.3012429310123
we shall find him changed into a broken down old man with garnet nose and eyes that slobber   153.49040000376675
said beauchamp placing his eye glass in his eye where he tried to make it remain   30.593574022083132
i think some one is coming   102.72935248155704
there you must rest   104.43318450093115
you have two or three times mentioned a m   102.36453097423893
the clerk seized his pen and peppino his beads   112.22707313322735
edmond concluded that perhaps instead of having reached the end of the route he had only explored its beginning and he therefore turned round and retraced his steps   119.87020490472888
and what is it to you   181.13068120428113
give it me that i may see it is not false   134.8847833262701
hold sir said villefort do not prolong this dreadful scene   100.44460717899507
if only we two arrive said d artagnan it will be enough since the duke s troop are only four in number   106.90011028881307
and if you catch up with them you won t come back to hang me murmured the sergeant   54.566497052209385
but when she saw the careless bow of debray and the glance by which it was accompanied together with his significant silence she raised her head and without passion or violence or even hesitation ran downstairs disdaining to address a last farewell to one who could thus part from her   95.80698438099726
and he seized by the neck the last bottle that was left put it to his mouth and emptied it at a single draught as he would have emptied an ordinary glass   111.89100810969269
my hand   115.77902730704652
asked another   89.95993663989802
mazarin remained some moments in deep thought as if he were fighting with himself   67.53183255704442
to be sure returned monte cristo   88.6471321942028
give me your arm then   156.8970292412189
0213m what do you wish to see first   137.6531701724871
what then is to become of royalty   143.32983000123113
danglars a visit   97.73426861795741
and he jumped off the wall   105.93092586344154
well i feel as if transformed a confession weighs on my mind   154.22493918314436
in fact the evening before a fever had seized him in the midst of the parliament while he was holding his bed of justice   60.67562780458382
so i shall never be a great man as he was but to compensate for that i shall be a good man monsieur de rochefort and i hope to prove it to you   114.59037497832078
i will see this young man tréville i will see him   135.51100715877163
at the end of an hour she heard a soft voice calling her   187.16127470448288
bonacieux wept all day like a true mercer not being at all a military man as he himself informed us   125.95573321524638
i wrote to franz and were he here he would confirm every word i wrote then to franz that if he did not come with the four thousand crowns before six at ten minutes past i should have gone to join the blessed saints and glorious martyrs in whose company i had the honor of being   114.03026089720814
you told me that   118.7259935815125
do you call him nebuchadnezzar   36.763677216725426
yes the sheep are fed in my meadows which are excellent pasture   85.08867431976847
i could not find them   83.49242612274196
what avails recrimination over matters wholly past recall   88.72011306871174
the jeweller examined attentively the interior of the inn and the apparent poverty of the persons who were about to sell him a diamond that seemed to have come from the casket of a prince   82.16723316948375
i remember it perfectly   88.42169064411758
these gentlemen declared yesterday that my illness was a comedy   99.33481385433782
you must be aware that i was ignorant of that madame   46.188270744641585
she exclaimed falling back   102.00315905284486
edmond smiled when he beheld himself   88.52359844118857
30031m sir continued villefort there is something to fear besides death old age and madness   127.91963653600281
but it was not the case with debray   71.74273015788879
and when shall we know   61.40527786686877
but how have you become acquainted with all these details   135.21454872774657
but why should i have done otherwise   60.73630006524029
i prefer traveling alone to having a companion who entertains the least fear   88.46907794472402
how long will this fuse burn   156.2281614352668
secondly to embrace my children and bid them farewell for the last time   203.2106859495671
then turning to monte cristo you just now spoke his name as if you knew the baron   122.22960210476826
help me out of paris   123.36904244291402
you can not take me with you   132.05538154588018
dantès was tossed about on these doubts and wishes when the patron who had great confidence in him and was very desirous of retaining him in his service took him by the arm one evening and led him to a tavern on the via del oglio where the leading smugglers of leghorn used to congregate and discuss affairs connected with their trade   89.08673321312057
do you hear what he says major   146.97933114882963
he promised to be here and i have very great faith in planchet who appears to me to be a very good lad   94.68905072472725
now mousqueton he said i hope you don t mean to desert your master   134.80778125992921
at that moment their fraternal bond of union was closer than ever and when they parted each to take the route agreed on they turned back to utter affectionate expressions which the echoes of the dunes repeated   88.64215269598272
you alarm me cried franz   102.18085895559051
regret   122.01130786080725
the proof of which is that i have fixed upon you to escort me   148.74125326776067
certainly i see him   119.76239047545386
can not monsieur cromwell wait a little   120.61086136013456
he wishes to speak to you   104.47431704464276
i will proclaim you a piece of immaculate virtue   71.78143623738569
soon the fury of the waves and the sight of the sharp rocks announced the approach of death and death then terrified me and i used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a sailor to struggle against the wrath of god   27.71220767819422
swear by your hopes of salvation to keep her safely for the chastisement she has merited   77.5200694127006
d artagnan meantime pursued his way with the indifference of a man upon whom such acts of folly made no impression   119.11349461740083
have you anything   122.1103754109325
you do not know how a paragraph in a newspaper may exasperate one   75.53206573633344
eh egad to give up broussel as they demand   99.35384122096774
because said andrea with a certain ill concealed uneasiness i thought i heard my father in law say that he intended embarking our property in that famous railway affair of which you spoke just now   94.50159081649093
the more ill will i have toward monsieur bonacieux the more punctual i shall be in keeping the appointment made by that letter which makes you so uneasy   128.8563890603329
no i repeat again that nothing shall induce me to renew attempts evidently at variance with the almighty s pleasure   151.8067059869959
what did it taste like   83.06482233192531
let us pass then from the valet of athos to the valet of porthos from grimaud to mousqueton   104.15624558038884
you are here safe and sound that is all i wished for   168.58097357950632
the next morning on awaking paris seemed to be startled at her own appearance   82.26247734422694
oh my brother does not allude to its value although it has been estimated at 100 000 francs   161.1368694947961
how can i go and fetch that letter under the fire of the bastion   134.74905073909858
spend them if necessary but let these gentlemen be treated as they deserve that is to say like kings   60.67424667674388
i returned home at daybreak and strove to sleep   192.79569744636387
why your protégé m   116.084395747223
d artagnan who was by nature very curious as people generally are who possess the genius of intrigue did all he could to make out who athos porthos and aramis really were for under these pseudonyms each of these young men concealed his family name athos in particular who a league away savored of nobility   112.32102064448323
a few minutes more and the troop passed over their heads   88.3153795190674
dantès touched it and found that it was a beam   81.71771328926283
de villefort the assistant procureur he overtook his supercargo and caderousse   115.46410687755586
their own m   141.5228312057094
a nurse of the doctor s choice succeeded them and never left till about ten or eleven o clock when valentine was asleep   183.86218767235883
then seeing that the crisis threatened to be prolonged he went out   44.615603137025246
but aramis and athos were the only ones to obey this command and the king s example   88.59632141875394
the minister of police maintained a silence which was equivalent to a complete avowal   60.700037934747165
silence he said or you are lost   106.7238474717627
at the branching off of the road toward paris aramis who had followed in the cardinal s suite turned back   84.74157574628083
the author of this history who has resided five or six years in italy does not recollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by one of those events so common in other countries   139.94169748819488
said d artagnan pressing her hand still more warmly   102.8116612279876
then his two guides took his arms and he went on guided by them and preceded by the sentinel   82.54077537563428
i think sir you exaggerate your situation said madame danglars whose beautiful eyes sparkled for a moment   98.4371891268267
i believe i know m   128.5702926190575
but i can not leave paris just now without knowing aramis stopped   88.51426692576257
but nevertheless we may show them to a confessor and you know i have taken orders   106.26240665349322
it was like those mysterious subterraneous noises that precede an earthquake   118.16628298652157
the young girl hastily took the letter from him   104.41469942871473
gently gently said the old man with a smile   60.60039746653909
my dear friend if i am you must not laugh at me for being so   185.14692694689904
with what my father said just now   22.736154241477692
you leave me and you are right in doing so i repeat it you are right   156.77028316373045
only as the question now is not of rank but of quarters you know the custom come and seek for yours   91.92156778169334
then you never believed in the principality   98.51548786901924
cried raoul swimming on   39.536918311217846
since in our romance of the three musketeers we took leave of d artagnan at no   131.79458477101994
said kitty for whom have i exposed myself to all that   59.524738360190426
the three gentlemen then shook hands lord de winter taking the rue saint honore and athos and aramis remaining together   65.71890948102933
that s useless said d artagnan   65.85654526657086
i believe so at least   187.794835463627
they descended the great staircase taking with them all the guards they found on their road and crying out to arms   165.84432160267218
a last but final hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this interview and therefore he had suggested it   111.90347352935702
the servant drew back and said if you wish to go alone sir i will go and tell my mistress   89.37770414456898
then as they had been accustomed to do they had recourse to m   93.68637486083352
with discretion d artagnan remained behind   106.6374204362358
i was told there were such at the last exhibition   126.36725634537095
thousands of grasshoppers hidden in the bushes chirped with a monotonous and dull note   123.98340274183481
and then said monte cristo this is not all   41.524806774035866
at the same time on the opposite side that is towards edward s room valentine fancied that she heard the creaking of the floor   79.76958255606121
d avrigny smiled sadly   147.98215198835686
mazarin made a grimace as if he meant to say but he does not wear the cardinal s cap   84.9939450289269
the money gained in the exercise of my profession i have distributed to the poor   155.1473627757493
i saw her   148.26193977001847
let no one move   34.901053551895004
he had half guessed what was going on when he saw franz quit the cemetery with m   101.34455490105482
d artagnan read the letter with apparent calmness and said shaking his head see dear friend what it is to belong to the army   100.82896994237566
live yourself your mother and sister with the most rigid economy so that from day to day the property of those whom i leave in your hands may augment and fructify   128.86147009420122
it seems you must always be playing some game or other   135.2024181807054
at every step that edmond took he disturbed the lizards glittering with the hues of the emerald   159.19556117235302
the note burned the hand of d artagnan   91.74270192142278
you are here in the apartment destined for you madame   132.41565045831632
maximilian said the count you asked me during the journey to allow you to remain some days at marseilles   124.7202251410425
40094m what has he done to you   37.66847490102029
well here it is at last   106.24195409521913
it is precisely this monsieur mordaunt whom we are going to join at boulogne and with whom we cross to england   68.82470172494723
we should command an annuity of 175 000 livres   52.57424079303407
valentine carried the pastille to her mouth and swallowed it   136.57732257871064
then again if he disliked his choice the major takes the key double locks his coffer and master andrea would be obliged to live like the sons of a parisian family by shuffling cards or rattling the dice   81.6275225405843
i do not retreat mordieu   78.22163056678338
why did you leave the closet monsieur d artagnan   74.46858228192329
danglars is his banker is he not   59.00013996596149
murmured she courage   106.32391621408374
here in an hour   156.23644188205532
from that time he received all who came   150.8490776115804
this noirtier was his father   130.04493025998892
that of being your invalid answered scarron   145.8529528433811
meanwhile let us dine suggested porthos   101.24864368757639
tis possible   61.479611495877236
excuse the remark   124.75089752434316
is he prosperous and happy   92.79471751618992
you are sure of your enterprise   103.89161164598292
yes we know that   67.41908010355334
it naturally followed that the child was permitted to choose his own pursuits and he has therefore seldom acknowledged any other authority but that of his own will   10.787568013105371
the man standing before you valentine for this time it is no ghost is nothing more than the tenderest father and the most respectful friend you could dream of   134.3029048379787
i have an engagement with a pretty little girl for this evening and do not wish to be known   179.67786941040822
the four lackeys guarded the door and the window   39.25032425106815
he was charged to tell the comte de la fere that she had learned of the return of her youthful protege and also the manner he had conducted himself on the field and she added that she should be very glad to offer him her congratulations   116.84971047836427
do you intend to sit up for me   39.25399179430079
i was brought up here   131.02859610044067
a tailor said the host   162.02237456295535
besides our supper can t delay you much   103.47066174743253
there was no family no servant   148.59310183544505
well thought of porthos   40.98988420630798
the conviction that they came from m   144.6609546540135
benedetto will be punished   123.07451411455712
when i am insulted i do not faint   163.1947054129081

monsieur d artagnan monsieur du vallon you are free   84.41749374644785
behind her but in deep shadow was the outline of a masculine figure   110.29375011458527
albert besides being an elegant well looking young man was also possessed of considerable talent and ability   101.72615188060456
she is quite ready and wishes to know if she is to accompany you sir   197.6079089377837
why have you not done so   171.5325891239583
athos was scarcely aged at all   116.00320832912765
i am sure my dear albert whatever may be your career you will soon render that name illustrious   103.70346307326815

but once again that gentleman where is he   70.1341901903472
two or three masks strove to knock his moccoletto out of his hand   143.1631559884459
there he was compelled to remain   159.61691129048359
bah you are wrong   42.526865167626624
i became angry   86.83317306176016
mazarin gazed at each of them with an affrighted stare recognized them and let drop his lantern uttering a cry of terror   76.43142268097623
return on sunday   112.11032335427947
it was the marquis de saint méran   114.65017390348044
he can always be found as tréville says   130.05355431820314
however fugitive this homicide flash felton saw it and started as if its light had revealed the abysses of this woman s heart   110.27505275694018
and what is it saying anything you understand   70.79497865910575
i confess i can discover no other safe and satisfactory way   149.99702690154731
renée regarded him with fond affection   55.227552290684024
this time kitty was nowhere waiting for him   94.26528942413952
i am not up there i know but i have only just come down   186.1148866052967
i do not tell you this madame to terrify you   141.96866062569262
oh said albert it is of no use to be in the company of a greek if one converses just in the same style as with a parisian   1.9715560303070987
unfortunately i didn t crush him flat   95.54016018121271
i tried to pray but my tongue was frozen   118.29328168157534
but the nephew had time to say to his wife before he expired look well among my uncle s papers   94.34184762392907
it was therefore on the footing of friends that d artagnan and planchet arrived in the neighborhood of blois   157.72945995493583
the baroness clasped her hands   82.70017892913188
the woman selected a gold chain worth about five louis and the husband a pair of buckles worth perhaps fifteen francs   134.40401355968282
an old man decorated with the cross of saint louis now rose and proposed the health of king louis xviii   141.56568777112767
it is the republic s which deputed david12 to devise a uniform for the academicians   84.7075472738287
he dreaded not so much the revelation for he could reply to or deny its truth   133.16854653272642
exclaimed aramis   162.70886914849274
with your lasso you could stop an ox   111.27491987611653
you who have arranged your infernal plans and removed the beverages with a talent and precision almost miraculous   80.77289768240027
who told you i was there   177.1431556381772
it will be nothing more than a sign from m   167.6482851685209
give me what you give the others and it will be all right returned dantès   88.8276643714427
that is just what i find fault with   86.18883476452723
noirtier made a sign that she was to do so   93.09256504796585
in an instant he was placed in the stern sheets of the boat between the gendarmes while the officer stationed himself at the bow   144.89106745954305
i am monsieur du poins an officer in the guards on duty at the donjon of vincennes   134.1240883794788
they then summoned their friends who with blaisois mousqueton and grimaud promptly joined them leaving parry behind them who was to take back to london the horses of the gentlemen and of their lackeys which had been sold to the host in settlement of their account with him   57.59715455653992
if we choose replied danglars he will remain what he is   173.15088244231868
she who out of friendship for me wished to take me from my persecutors   70.31051485341672
on saturday i will tell you my impressions concerning the telegraph   56.05119802288986
in addition to the sword there was a portrait representing a nobleman of the time of henry iii   166.50307916667185
valentine hid her head between her hands   134.3599264869055
chapter lxxiii   130.38527158679162
the fourth auditor who during all this conversation had played a mute part made a sign of the head in proof that he acquiesced in the proposition   117.5886361246262
danglars hazarded a look on both sides of the road and perceived monuments of a singular form and his mind now recalled all the details morcerf had related and comparing them with his own situation he felt sure that he must be on the appian way   131.81978315632995
you are right said felton after having looked at milady from the spot on which he stood without moving a step toward her   102.92454879002268
i am hungry feed me   99.05801559992655
it was to this end that he performed from time to time some of those early masses which the common people generally alone attended   44.39752617257588
captivity the second day chapter liv   152.16934565466374
a difficult commission my lord replied d artagnan resuming his serious manner   92.76275204455999
but if i accept it is death or at least imprisonment for him who takes my place   129.34891598014255
what must come is written   127.86248720820798
they threw themselves upon me   155.82025432958284
in 2001 the project gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for project gutenberg™ and future generations   72.98398769017763
that boastfulness was not displeasing to mazarin   111.55518803200506
let us go count   117.96655901286293
stop an idea   109.31147863367976
villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of admiration   164.2378288771236
he was alone alone with these countless these unheard of treasures   50.3450318446994
danglars dined here   62.57670706027612
what prince   117.11345312106997
but in heaven s name do not expose yourself to danger   69.3657995114867
there however ended the signs which might have confounded her with a lady of rank   11.203113065328509
d artagnan believed this cough to be a signal   59.16155565204663
to your domestics you are my lord the journalists style you monsieur while your constituents call you citizen   49.066146009540994
when i think of you my heart beats fast the blood burns in my veins and i can hardly breathe   168.61203325535078
he resolved then to hasten immediately to the residence of the comte de rochefort and tell him that the queen was seeking for a messenger to send to london   112.81763237472052
he was out of range   91.1451797057174
they have killed them i think and taken flight carrying off their booty   103.83507927591643
we know the count s vigorous and daring mind denying anything to be impossible with that energy which marks the great man   115.25664634075622
i am going down there to pronounce the sentence of death against a murderer   102.32546631615983
planchet was equally seized with admiration and said no more about going away   86.84120426357924
what do you mean by that question   131.8906185634602
he opened the window   71.56157789733103
he was crazy   137.5224795757591
yes said andrea   105.1644496217504
valentine arose placed a chair for morrel requested barrois not to admit anyone and having tenderly embraced her grandfather and sorrowfully taken leave of morrel she went away   238.75939945076038
have a table set for us in a corner and send us whatever you like from yours   158.2212552424568
as to the cause which was near making milady lose her credit with the cardinal kitty knew nothing about it   153.88929649669925
to repeat these signs   80.75641381921591
to the point sir said the queen to the point and answer me yes or no   59.08751712806397
and you think you can catch him   159.62690082109364
pardon me said d artagnan   123.68924521781084
i will entertain you tonight   128.46989454591875
once upon a time there lived a queen a powerful monarch who reigned over one of the greatest kingdoms of the universe   137.5050797329462
it is kept by a friend of ours   65.7240317274121
athos was a gentleman punctilious in points of honor   57.77661830661785
and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the weight on her heart   94.53165032995156
well pursued caderousse can you without expending one sou put me in the way of getting fifteen thousand francs   46.61689402341747
i was just then looking at them myself   275.69710026549814
it expands the countenance and those around me do not then appear so ugly   3.3415554371558187
an hour had elapsed since her condemnation   114.11028011038738
and the four friends guided by mousqueton took up the way toward the house already almost restored to their former gayety   148.33766964007697
that is to say of a man before whom trembled the greatest men of the kingdom beginning with the king   122.27559042554904
that woman was once a young girl as beautiful as she is today   62.94304097292304
let s fly the feather before the wind   128.49475099918703
i do not remember if it is exactly 48 000 francs which i am still owing him but i dare say we shall not dispute the difference   126.88530677072222
he is old covered with wounds and suffers dreadfully he says in travelling   93.76023946547103
and what do you reckon your outfit will cost   98.00034407578677
a double movement of the globe he inhabited and of which he could feel nothing appeared to him perfectly impossible   125.49899092663603
this obliged them to make all the speed they could to evade the enemy when they could but lament the absence of dantès whose superior skill in the management of a vessel would have availed them so materially   47.92840055435305
you would meet the queen and she would not know who you are   103.18277049705605
for i have the proofs   16.529872057975837
those ruins crowned the summit of a hill which overlooked the surrounding country   61.77304039572766
nevertheless i confess i still doubt   167.69965511242208
whilst all this was going on a cavalier in full gallop was seen approaching   96.70954413326402
beside them in boxes of fragrant wood were ranged according to their size and quality puros regalias havanas and manillas   22.840592528040744
it was a gloomy dusty looking apartment such as journalists offices have always been from time immemorial   163.16113812302092
by confessing all he might prove his good will   213.9353241932841
my dear maximilian you are really too fanciful   104.34646228087178
take the least thing drink a finger of wine and let us be gone   112.63025920521451
the reason of it was that they had insisted on my keeping the matter a secret and begged me not to tell you anything of it   228.6066205598272
at last i mastered my agitation   112.58999799128797
so we will take leave of our friend and let him hasten home   72.21973820419377
you forget that what you have just paid me is much more than a poor woman requires who intends for some time at least to retire from the world   136.83657818442867
to which do you belong   153.03411469436793
oh you madame the cardinal hastened to say in order to cut short the explanation he foresaw was coming with regard to you that is another thing   112.37816184441753
you are examining the luxury i enjoy said the queen glancing sadly around her   79.49355112121494
danglars appeared   100.26908699772031
i will not die alone i will not   96.81744665319194
he stationed himself in a room commanding a view of the street pacing the chamber with restless steps stopping merely to listen from time to time for the sound of approaching wheels then to cast an anxious glance on ali   113.53971984698609
the only amusements left us are the indifferent races at the champ de mars and satory   52.12674155586979
d artagnan politely begged the swiss to yield to him the disputed chamber   132.7362768639871
i regard them as invaluable   88.9839822334853
in order that he might wake early he did not close the shutters but contented himself with bolting the door and placing on the table an unclasped and long pointed knife whose temper he well knew and which was never absent from him   15.450655366943082
continue continue   182.2582063394841
anne understood this covert reproach and was more moved than irritated by it   41.13261128028455
yes i am aware you may go alone since i once met you in italy but to accompany the mysterious monte cristo   116.50070590495285
you at marseilles   126.42391420654221
and which should be the lackeys to carry the letters   187.7748834327303
do you know that monsieur   99.81522356071197
i did i promise you anything my lord   79.42861553354825
is there one of my brethren in whom you have equal confidence with myself   139.67193732400906
come answered mazarin i see it will be necessary for me to capitulate   129.8727044397737
asked albert of franz when they had returned to their own apartments   87.98096858631885
i am too much indebted to you to refuse your first request   78.16697337135638
a thousand pistoles perhaps   100.88918765487736
come come signor pastrini no joking   149.59383024621798
a strange incomprehensible unearthly sound seemed to pervade the whole city   102.24002701841887
that where society attacked by the death of a person avenges death by death   46.68434803641526
the carnival was to commence on the morrow   141.73526494850879
at two o clock i shall have the honor of expecting you at the hôtel of monsieur de tréville   157.52857364952848
he did not dare to write for fear of not being able to such experienced eyes as those of milady to disguise his writing sufficiently   85.74226425033703
nothing was visible save a few lights that burnt behind the windows   83.10372853666345
inquired villefort in astonishment   104.3134579742332
eh dear friend said caderousse are wills ever made without codicils   101.71509573693258
it is true the letter of the cardinal spada was singularly circumstantial and dantès repeated it to himself from one end to the other for he had not forgotten a word   133.1422813546812
now to supper said aramis   163.80224177970166
planchet was sent for and instructions were given him   85.01262039249256
send the case before the judges   113.24243832615453
jacopo could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent present which dantès hastened to account for by saying that he had merely been a sailor from whim and a desire to spite his family who did not allow him as much money as he liked to spend   151.0458884055438
in the name of our child   42.469712701346964
you are not unlucky in being charged with such commissions particularly if my lord has authorized you to look into her bed   144.7455725549043
tomorrow monsieur   85.38262233647151
the some one is coming   155.88811398560978
my lord has forgotten the supper   158.30969834768234
we are no longer in the middle ages   84.54829834962666
did you not say something of an infant   12.600626703170022
what sized man is he   51.55263266575969
look here resumed d artagnan   166.93073190152938
oh do something for me   96.90179165608467
d artagnan continued before god and before men i accuse this woman of having attempted to poison me in wine which she sent me from villeroy with a forged letter as if that wine came from my friends   214.53865106691126
monte cristo drew the young man towards him and pressed him for some time to his heart   176.72318443913144
sir two prisoners were taken this morning will you let me have them   3.2741143796296797
i won t go unless you give me the album said the boy seating himself doggedly in an armchair according to his habit of never giving way   97.58096110366327
you will give me your advice will you not and if possible extricate me from my unpleasant position   74.67665472153908
repeated buckingham   120.28817760165285
he has then charged me to take it from you   100.53148357755052
i am too good natured   118.3033398882233
de rieux was inclined to do likewise but i told him they wouldn t look for us where we were   102.70584008576328
major cavalcanti both the count and baptistin had told the truth when they announced to morcerf the proposed visit of the major which had served monte cristo as a pretext for declining albert s invitation   134.5584646550328
yes perfectly well intimately even   131.67838726127536
so strange a reception naturally gave milady ample matter for reflection   167.8325172864868
this was the name of madame de longueville   119.04552287676653
he is a miser   54.92595951696951
but porthos turned sharply round and every countenance quickly recovered its gravity   129.4776007129356
then he has not returned   38.658239406523876
i was wondering what could be the significance of this purse with the paper at one end and the large diamond at the other   108.80905918694032
in fifteen or twenty days i shall set out for la rochelle with the army   152.04973605545587
an old acquaintance replied grimaud   59.83318719019917
a lover s deception which the woman who has married that man ought certainly to forgive   37.629141182252
have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden fusion of my ingots   199.23193975662767
and to whom   120.14250613431368
have you answered the question i put to you on entering the room   200.6462122949817
ah added the count in a contemptuous tone do not tell me of european punishments they are in the infancy or rather the old age of cruelty   77.79836891313673
prophets of evil are not in favor at the court father   100.3286580003747
i am i am no   182.1731058236681
did you doubt it   114.21227020792755
i took the wrong angle and have come out fifteen feet from where i intended   69.0100721786287
i m not such a rhinoceros as you are   168.91957023556827
it would be long indeed ere you would find so lucrative a post as that you have now the good fortune to fill   174.20577159573088
it need not be said that d artagnan was still thinking of the husband   130.4107577438316
and as his orders were always clear distinct and easy of execution his comrades obeyed him with celerity and pleasure   64.60173361578006
you can restore it to his family said d artagnan   52.668961777848644
at this movement which nobody opposed he resumed a little courage and ventured to draw up one leg and then the other   101.51565278414495
i have been nearly mad   131.72106841570465
40268m the general with his head thrown back hands extended gaze fixed looked silently at this dreadful apparition   116.31807913480834
the idea that tomorrow i shall no longer suffer is sweet to my heart   82.1968635587983
an instant after the count entered   142.02980082028083
d artagnan knelt down near the thickest part of the hedge   153.06861413627112
whether success rendered us imprudent or whether we were betrayed i know not   76.10120667664597
and then i was afraid you would not recognize me but you did added caderousse with his unpleasant smile   75.37423165176168
well replied he he has smitten with the sword and he has perished by the sword   106.43826954190489
did she return home   116.74561363977253
that is doubtless our boat said athos   156.9330386849378
the whole was cemented by two hundred years beneath these almost impervious depths for a revolution carried away the emperor who wished to make the trial and only left the documents proving the manufacture of the jars and their descent into the sea   122.4738859940206
thence he once again looked towards morrel who weeping with joy was shaking hands most cordially with all the crowd around him and thanking with a look the unknown benefactor whom he seemed to be seeking in the skies   14.872899184959792
you mean to tell me that three female attendants await their new mistress in her sleeping chamber   105.07074385949707

not all   130.74765823899867
but no sooner had the man s footsteps ceased than he started up drew the bolts closed the curtains and examined every corner of the room   155.32601735450055
the marshal   168.34390930193092
parry for his part will raise this slab of marble and a passage will be opened   189.0579224060571
on me   77.28677857446527
now since the affair of nordlingen they had experienced nothing but reverses   93.81278579623878
the cardinal advanced to him with a smile and taking him by the hand led him into his study   64.22860711670981
i think the only chance of saving your majesty has just been proposed by monsieur d herblay   142.11741918274163
i think you hailed me mademoiselle julie   196.59507871886754
my good friend said valentine i should take you for a visionary and should tremble for your reason if i were always to hear you talk in a strain similar to this   69.2423303700847
he has foretold many things which have come to pass   23.524914078717913
then he passed his hand across his forehead which was clouded with doubt   137.29133812184676
well tempter what more do you want with me   66.54347804531483
d artagnan looked at the cardinal with a stupefied air   42.379606822202504
athos after making sure that lord winter was really dead let fall the corpse and said come aramis now for the honor of france   80.83066268607197
he was softened   147.67379803866842
even his fat smooth cheeks shook as he spoke and he looked at d artagnan with an air of reproach   167.18728200205817
the president read mr   154.51489848655496
he was told that his eminence awaited the orders of his majesty in the business cabinet   114.34920850429155
but there was still another step to be taken   73.88763202234273
as for the men they were scarcely perceptible the darkness was so great   88.26899213117615
do you know i always felt a shudder at the idea of even a destroying angel   53.92898736604134
these were the only obstacles which appeared possible to the young man   127.73265526259637
finally farmer louis sold them eighty trusses making in all four hundred and thirty   81.43449963748375
any one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simar the gorgeous robe of office and the rich lace or who gazed on that pale brow bent in anxious meditation might in the solitude of that apartment combined with the silence of the ante chambers and the measured paces of the guards upon the landing place have fancied that the shade of cardinal richelieu lingered still in his accustomed haunt   195.77034215389023
pardon me said he smiling pardon me my dear compatriot but i had wholly forgotten you   151.70642750431983
gone out in search of our equipage by tomorrow it might be too late   154.89850763827985
when my father with a pistol in his hand was once on the point of committing suicide had anyone then said this man deserves his misery would not that person have been deceived   0.5614884429426468
oh what a dreadful event   99.1575399552191
you are sure it is not he   109.07475943631532
that is forbidden me said grimaud until the last moment   45.582673696151076
cried bertuccio whose copper complexion became livid i go to auteuil   169.32305940855642
the hours one after another seemed to awaken the clock as they passed and every blow of the brass hammer resounded upon the heart of the prisoner   43.30211339532421
a man or a woman   118.4079784822876
do you mean at rome   59.96828270407937
besides i am a picard   35.63926076857042
but replied the owner glancing after dantès who was watching the anchoring of his vessel it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so old as you say danglars to understand his business for our friend edmond seems to understand it thoroughly and not to require instruction from anyone   178.34852937882997
i have sported with the green mantle of the one and the azure robe of the other   127.28801325262839
but before the doctor and the father could reach the room the servants who were on the same floor had entered and seeing valentine pale and motionless on her bed they lifted up their hands towards heaven and stood transfixed as though struck by lightening   125.8532082326435
exclaimed d artagnan putting his finger on his lips   98.83230783274605
he did not therefore allow her any hope that he would flinch   154.02353220343224
monte cristo turned to haydée and with an expression of countenance which commanded her to pay the most implicit attention to his words he said in greek πατρὸς μὲν ἄτην μήζε τὸ ὄνομα προδότου καὶ προδοσίαν εἰπὲ ἡμῖν that is tell us the fate of your father   111.54489538555828
and he hastily quitted the apartment   125.81908320499717
such are my orders   163.92183510168724
sir said he that man has been here   121.18363753841122
and another paper deriving its information from some malicious source had published two days after albert s departure for normandy the few lines which had rendered the unfortunate young man almost crazy   70.60143302588597
the priest stole the sacred vases and sold them   94.60028496106258
repeated mme   155.43582075025085
de tréville who had received the account of the adventure from the mouths of the heroes of it related it in all its details to his eminence not forgetting the episode of the napkin   153.03853930087539
without doubt he recognized d artagnan for he became deadly pale   106.39348663488225
i fear it is a conspiracy   132.91851667215082
and you spoke to him   113.57302715100232
she believed the order ready for execution   98.2764013075658
but he made it and there is the evidence yet remaining of his work   97.85986401191212
a horse slips and injures a joint   170.39285333901904
we chased him for six hours and when he was near being taken when st   92.79879228887235
but being anxious not to be too conspicuous all with the exception of porthos who had a fancy to display his red doublet were quite satisfied with their places the more so as chance had brought them to the centre of their row so that they were exactly opposite the arm chair prepared for the royal prisoner   99.62287847370649
he had stopped like raoul at the hotel of the bell and bottle the best at compiegne   123.50806378100188
vaguely   133.8725732541916
capricious and unfaithful the king wished to be called louis the just and louis the chaste   89.40776984660758
you may remain   159.0569307498588
repeated morrel not being able to conceive such intense happiness   76.5596866061153
it was of this detachment sent as a vanguard that our friend d artagnan formed a part   205.03967062572343
but i should say it was two lovers walking side by side and hand in hand   132.0721987853999
where is this lemonade   123.0686402879124
begone then to your beautiful duchess   132.85191887157515
yes said danglars darting at edmond a look gleaming with hate   18.918015969756794
oh quite the contrary dear friend i swear   78.86400379552093
one of the two riders he who had spoken second was ten paces in front of his companion   135.51592443007257
i believe the storm is over said he   59.313453758158445
her lips were cold   207.63801381187727
and i feel convinced they have all unfeignedly grieved over my loss   73.50770389928772
that was his favorite word   135.5469185040965
at these words he took up a silver bell and rang it   55.0947189876623
why here is the simple fact   84.48874655221127
well it was that affair madame   138.02788941760787
it was about half past nine   115.11765310633174
d artagnan here   60.504857241834195
faith no for between the culprit and the victim i have no choice   99.36233186672663
where is athos   142.89769667423343
oh cried the novice as to friends you would have them wherever you want you appear so good and are so beautiful   31.620429503661384
another   94.39719217449269
and this in addition to his position as responsible agent on board which is always obnoxious to the sailors made him as much disliked by the crew as edmond dantès was beloved by them   54.69970354420947
ah yes so i was   62.687447887126936
perhaps i shall have lost all influence   125.35367107136064
i know too that you are a good marksman there we are about equal   25.67616221742253
de blacas wiped the moisture from his brow   113.16588767742464
i come therefore to ask what has become of him   118.67399590730838
the young greek as we have already said occupied apartments wholly unconnected with those of the count   123.52948667500887
god has preserved us hitherto god will preserve us still   91.92261669737796
muttered athos i may be mistaken i haven t the unerring eye of d artagnan   140.6192369709052
and therefore i said were our object money only   96.32848280003779
oh juxon said the king seizing the bishop s two hands in his own promise that you will pray all your life for this gentleman and for the other that you hear beneath your feet and for two others also who wherever they may be are on the watch for my safety   91.29013350921257
but the latter went on without pity seek whom the crime will profit says an axiom of jurisprudence   50.897211737624524
if he turned up an ace first he won   70.43441726390117
you have not seemed to be well for the last fortnight   129.94301902765648
why then they would be laughed at and a master pastrycook must never be laughed at   108.03902085798367
but if you saw this you must also have seen the person who poured it   75.27506333346622
and the count while pronouncing these latter words accompanied them with one of those ghastly smiles that used to strike terror into poor franz d épinay   158.18747199972282
and about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl   74.80461242106583
albert summoned his servant and ordered him to acquaint m   40.811781257954706
but she would then be the accomplice of an assassination   51.62914042434904
but after we had taken in our cargo the wind became contrary so that we were four or five days without being able to enter the rhône   134.75130171804278
the three carbineers looked about carefully on every side saw the young peasants and galloping up began to question them   108.08453941395092
it is not very difficult to discover that   85.13604206402266
asked the one who carried the lantern   11.026607960423362
during this time exempt from the anxiety of its only and true chief the royal army led a joyous life neither provisions nor money being wanting in the camp   80.83080686214922
20107m one evening a wolf emerged from a pine wood near which they were usually stationed but the wolf had scarcely advanced ten yards ere he was dead   55.14157051024153
had entertained toward mazarin and he endeavored to receive the minister s homage with civility   90.40777789425908
king s attorney   74.56031523592051
well what does it signify valentine so long as i am satisfied and feel that even this long and painful suspense is amply repaid by five minutes of your society or two words from your lips   79.63497983943607
we dress the king in groslow s clothes   100.96905134353776
and i believe it is from him my guardian whose near relation he was inherited the estate from which i take my name   130.8296957404678
because it is against prison rules and prisoners must not even ask for it   137.59999777752944
but it is ridiculous thus to yield to the caprices of an old man and i shall therefore act according to my conscience   91.31033609260456
but this simple operation upon the most delicate organs of our frame generally so easy to accomplish became almost impossible at this moment so much did curiosity struggle to retain the eyelid open and learn the truth   65.35280572831974
the vicomte de bragelonne who will have the honor of remitting this letter to your majesty is the friend of my son who owes to him his life   63.76444193446164
it was not aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal visitor it was a woman   124.69814746116344
hold on   74.1862881094731
the sea knowing what was required of her threw over them her weeds encircled them with coral and encrusted them with shells   134.15711244842893
that happened as i told you in 1829   89.6174228746903
0255m the draught produced a galvanic effect a violent trembling pervaded the old man s limbs his eyes opened until it was fearful to gaze upon them he heaved a sigh which resembled a shriek and then his convulsed body returned gradually to its former immobility the eyes remaining open   89.58822214303657
it is singular said d artagnan whilst the boat was taking them to the standard it is astonishing how that young man resembles some one i must have known but who it was i can not yet remember   138.39918657409848
how long has he been there   140.99326962112923
one plays with anybody   57.27922780781224
the thirty two that we shall use tonight are its progeny   185.72239218254987
employ me even actively but let it be on the high roads   163.98029065215314
and where is she then   89.82924423320264
no but to set my mind at rest as you observed just now   81.84689436358717
oh i am sure of it   42.096129537969034
in two words d artagnan informed him where mme   111.7338706622602
i am at your service sir said the abbé with a marked italian accent   164.9688607769342
he opened a drawer and took out a purse   121.39811436423467
look emmanuel   113.31555406922446
i doubt it   119.89637739218705
why yourself to be sure   63.74043374435074
the doctor had put him on a diet   111.67594774264386
beware morcerf he is already an old man   126.00458140323354
he had seen the two mortal enemies of the musketeers had seen mordaunt adjust the fuse   103.59492784842494
bonacieux in an undertone   148.98820859367277
if you wish to learn more address yourself to m   154.40550963003398
yes sir a fearful misfortune   91.29068247410466
however you may look and see added the lackey raising the curtained entrance of the tent   119.18536620926206
haberdasher she is afraid so   137.52243162374927
but still you acted from motives of self interest my dear maximilian for you well knew that from the moment in which you had manifested an opposite spirit all would have been ended between us   91.14813364654995
the way was therefore opened to the four friends with all sorts of puritan congratulations   140.2921067641708
but all that even you know with respect to the french code i know not only in reference to that code but as regards the codes of all nations   88.6580813160777
in that case replied the major it would be necessary to write to the curé for duplicates and it would be some time before they could be obtained   86.51091639027155
at seven o clock in the evening all was ready and at ten minutes past seven they doubled the lighthouse just as the beacon was kindled   55.262695212488126
well said he they likewise have refused me   178.77944990705765
your tilbury your groom your clothes are not then hired   26.81478433218291
really you should relate all this aloud you would have the greatest success   53.62891192697727
what do you wish to say about it   116.62407013623906
with hatred in his eyes foaming at his mouth and his fist extended mordaunt had advanced one more step a threatening terrible step toward de winter   35.365457892197355
but where can i wait   106.655835610496
dividing the proceeds chapter 107   185.7773259252877
i am sorry i did not follow him said porthos   136.65129817697732
the doors are about to be opened and in five minutes they will be here   84.17888303578417
perhaps said anne   220.6634240922881
oh he is always as colorless as you now see him said franz   18.318057062232057
and he knows the full casks said blaisois for he has already been in the hold with monsieur le chevalier d artagnan   2.331916296923225
what did your father tell you m   30.683699035033086
and besides loves your majesty too well   78.22310522892349
do you promise   130.91309192370642
and why have you come here   88.25838403498767
cried groslow rushing to the hatchway   137.72814043993301
returned the count   128.09509228619402
aramis had passed his sword through the body of the first and athos had knocked down the other with the butt end of his pistol   120.61351500365485
at what hour   66.11929404903687
what are you doing here   57.28242235243816
be careful   68.3448095343159
and he named several distinguished gentlemen and among them was m   161.31509702809421
i want nothing now that i have you said the old man   57.10199413696015
the sergeant put the lantern near the panel   73.69265180708135
though sinking from moment to moment the wounded man was not yet dead   65.14832943989977
we will explain in a few words how d artagnan had been led to choose that place of residence   92.54025127941819
those who have died of hunger   58.62696774628518
i was not praying   109.5328563274254
but i confess to you i am now almost exhausted   4.8887837126139715
tell me replied faria what has hindered you from knocking down your jailer with a piece of wood torn from your bedstead dressing yourself in his clothes and endeavoring to escape   44.01327965537847
the last count of spada moreover made me his heir bequeathing to me this symbolic breviary he bequeathed to me all it contained   175.14892200770922
said kitty blushing   65.53155073537263
from th abyss he ll give ear to my moan   135.3872393915717
exclaimed the duchess playing carelessly with her fan   105.01595405293489
villefort said nothing but he clasped his hands opened his haggard eyes and overcome with his emotion sank into a chair   193.6842929108886
so much the worse so much the worse diavolo   88.37764925274209
the door was opened to the coadjutor of the room in which the mendicant was suffering   79.36386957280465
the next day they kept their word and thus they grew up together   105.0804097205152
where is your master   111.37203164551173
because they fought against me   173.2271516134523
they have commissioned me to write to the major to demand papers and here they are   100.56505286494169
midnight sounded and almost at the same time the bell was rung in milady s chamber   115.86269499665084
occasionally he shuddered   80.12350808053462
i only restrain you   127.41407826117388
because they would not spend money so guiltily acquired   175.20451518512652
he asked coldly   150.7161158897386
you surely will not do that my dear count   102.77462082009087
what is he contriving   109.26810806931583
lift it and judge if i am mistaken   169.11772446622223
athos listened to him without a frown   114.74214520323511
do you think of him   222.9406593043244
and who served under an assumed name   126.2246558546831
20029m as to the note which accompanied this the englishman understood that it might have been added by some inspector who had taken a momentary interest in dantès situation but who had from the remarks we have quoted found it impossible to give any effect to the interest he had felt   132.53654520718206
he looked at the pictures whose faces seemed to smile and the landscapes which appeared painted in brighter colors   77.72522018832942
her body even pays what she promises i must do her that justice   142.55852166631075
in these prompt arrangements we recognize the order of a well disciplined soldier   110.0962493742757
why didn t they search more vigilantly   56.87389733928604
danglars was joking in a friendly way but fernand looked pale and agitated   134.60415637863602
franz now looked upon another scene of enchantment   139.17009616522148
madame danglars threw a rapid and inquiring glance which could only be interpreted by monte cristo around the courtyard over the peristyle and across the front of the house then repressing a slight emotion which must have been seen on her countenance if she had not kept her color she ascended the steps saying to morrel sir if you were a friend of mine i should ask you if you would sell your horse   103.67200894127814
continued the count   56.3945069057895
morrel only then recollected the letter he had received from the viscount in which without assigning any reason he begged him to go to the opera but he understood that something terrible was brooding   40.732243672618
nothing is impossible gravely replied monte cristo   171.4089741326315
are you not a christian   155.27695714774686
i wish to be there i expect to get something by it   121.97883728295623
he is in safe custody answered villefort   86.76268658514383
i was trying said porthos to recall where i had seen that mendicant whom i must have killed   187.61445891068396
i have seen milady   121.54430157161059
he kept his word   121.50160200090448
ought we to go on   117.63000944515014
it concerns your treasures does it not   37.84252028386652
than thus descend the staircase at the tuileries driven away by ridicule   163.30389061929958
fifty feet   226.03845452786425
you will not have me turned out this time as you did in london you dare not   182.47893390487263
but as regards the competency of the document i certainly have doubts   44.00516817205791
after dinner the count of monte cristo was announced   63.91363905638731
never have i met with so remarkable a person as yourself   84.73471375548232
said lord de winter with contempt   102.80446264426277
indeed i expected it for it is a family inheritance   105.49936894600663
if i guess rightly will you confess it   78.97882524926885
be it so said athos   132.80654043393562
well but what does that matter   111.85083580558513
i believe the queen to have too high a sense of her duty sire   150.1371804632544
your wound   51.17891825765337
all these proofs of love which you would give me are almost crimes   161.17308030078752
resumed mme   82.26568715811783
i have scraped together some such things as an income of two or three thousand crowns in the haberdashery business but more particularly in venturing some funds in the last voyage of the celebrated navigator jean moquet   72.2510316936318
no said d artagnan and yet i am certain it is not the first time i have seen that visage   18.758845395273667
against whom   82.70557036474415
my dear danglars said morcerf we have been acquainted for many years and consequently we ought to make some allowance for each other s failings   158.88348220085697
you must have searched badly   24.048476148196983
smiling as he uttered the word   119.84304260039202
he uttered not a word nor shed a tear but a deadly pallor spread over his face   163.78948739949413
he may have fallen from his horse he may have cut a caper from the deck   149.78951436215024
franz who had mutely interrogated the countess and received from her a gracious smile in token that he would be welcome sought not to retard the gratification of albert s eager impatience but began at once the tour of the house closely followed by albert who availed himself of the few minutes required to reach the opposite side of the theatre to settle the height and smoothness of his collar and to arrange the lappets of his coat   111.17520264568843
he knows her brother in law   133.2478133293036
and as he spoke he put his hand on the holster of his uncle s saddle bow   142.55467344682066
tell me valentine for it is that i came to know   96.61171005745189
athos immediately profited by the permission and the door was closed behind him   94.66071867878878
you re a great moralist and that s the fact said porthos   103.5733166183791
at the end of an instant they heard a furious fusillade   174.45658603967627
the young men filled up their third of a glass with water   38.94374131670777
since the moment he had first received these two mementoes athos had never parted with them   166.62811056620814
they will then fancy it is an ambuscade they will deliberate   146.12863930752724
it was faria s last winding sheet a winding sheet which as the turnkey said cost so little   167.58148514748578
and if you will believe me you had better spare yourself the trouble of reading that long letter and follow me   178.242921048914
we have a queen blinded by a belated passion   79.29307663968085
d artagnan spoke these words with a simplicity that did honor to his courtesy without throwing the least doubt upon his courage   147.33574394248822
the bride blushed while fernand restless and uneasy seemed to start at every fresh sound and from time to time wiped away the large drops of perspiration that gathered on his brow   91.26140848038202
this was one of his parts in the popular comedy he was performing a make up he had adopted and which suited him about as well as the masks worn on the classic stage by paternal actors who seen from one side were the image of geniality and from the other showed lips drawn down in chronic ill temper   70.12039895333977
but they were not pioneers they were soldiers of the garrison   49.121626097009724
then as they were just passing the round tower the young man shouted stand by there to lower the topsails and jib   113.79624611787041
with five thousand you can buy a pretty little house with two acres of land   183.6052829135264
thus then it is your opinion said anne of austria with a sneer and biting her lips with rage that yesterday s riot which to day is already a rebellion to morrow may become a revolution   83.8310874447426
the funeral being over the guests returned to paris   87.28419335699074
i offer my best respects and services to you my lord   51.248806896003295
albert de morcerf or i should this day have been the wife of a dishonored man   71.37851410622125
mazarin nodded an assent but wishing to know what this prediction was about which they disputed he remained in the same place   41.36622192279249
and as we are in haste to rejoin the prince s army we must continue our journey   47.2341955570421
continued m   163.40818869559888
then his eyes lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused him so long and wretched a captivity   123.51614644571185
come aramis   78.4270026305546
then with renewed instructions to grimaud athos signified to raoul that he could set out and ended by reflecting that it was perhaps better that raoul should be away from paris at that moment   76.94271524126022
no replied the soldier tenacious in his credulity   256.098281305842
it will be useless to announce me mademoiselle returned the englishman   123.40311918424331
doctor i resist no longer i can no longer defend myself i believe you   89.17899412369783
ah that s all very fine retorted the woman   89.60121038418417
but have you no groom   174.6547484767977
i believe i can guess at least   125.85413339824463
and if the king permits me returned the gascon i shall be near him always when there is danger to be encountered   149.2002148181345
suddenly he rallied made a violent effort to restrain himself and then a smile gradually widened the features of his disturbed countenance   120.64961178268612
grimaud was on his legs again as if by a spring   68.88542003080698
where he was no one knew   107.82959450812143
god will give it me   159.48552332913485
the letters being finished each put his own into two envelopes so that no one without tearing the first envelope could discover to whom the second was addressed   111.19972668686087
he is beforehand with us said m   59.378433508682875
i owe to this worthy lord all the happiness i ever knew   163.58419001963108
and he favored this man the more as grimaud became the more and more odious to him   88.02112432077551
it is i   104.43970916048357
danglars do you not maximilian the banker whose horses ran away with my stepmother and little brother and very nearly killed them   55.058861082408995
cried buckingham   94.82830235884015
d artagnan said the minister sitting down i am about to give you the greatest proof of confidence that a minister can give an officer   86.71138171032605
i need but mention one fact to make all the ladies in paris court his notice and that is that he has come to take up his abode in paris for a year during which brief period he proposes to spend six millions of money   168.08861016256554
and you may rely upon me for the others not being inferior to them   127.84053751681516
d artagnan took the paper hesitatingly and cast his eyes over it   170.43509254949404
said he what is this   115.08962657069175
then he advanced   139.01552008497177
rosette of an officer of the legion of honor in his button hole   155.86047850178363
i do not go on because it pleases me to stop here   106.77292497534225
but as if they likewise mistrusted each other they kept their respective distances   109.46565182680938
and milady stretched out her arms to mme   118.13149833891521
for a moment the idea of struggling crossed his mind and of so ending the unexpected evil that had overtaken him   84.72270112860383
resigning himself therefore to what seemed inevitable he bade his host good night and mounted the stairs   99.92971953917788
they pursued their way along the quay then called l abreuvoir pepin and went along by the walls of the grand chatelet   133.52261360233572
the coadjutor bowed   52.42873784619785
inquired the elder dantès   115.68361510028112
is that monsieur   142.17446147906264
bazin entered at that moment carrying a bottle in each hand   178.62296488950915
meanwhile it was necessary at all hazards in order to gain time to put some obstacle in the way of the execution on the following day the day appointed by the judges   73.71805687073939
add another day for landing and that would make four   120.21281882685484
madame said lucien playing with a little dog who recognizing him as a friend of the house expected to be caressed i am not the only one who makes similar complaints i think i heard morcerf say that he could not extract a word from his betrothed   99.93583797830982
said caderousse twirling a plate in the air between his two hands   137.1889335359947
but at seven o clock you must hold yourself in readiness with two horses   124.16778639617465
the nubian immediately descended and opened the carriage door   60.91951855228229
let him signal   76.66414867667159
they might not be satisfied and ah ha thought danglars this is not so much like paris except that i shall probably be skinned   92.64111742662482
lord de winter went out making a sign to felton who followed him shutting the door after him   153.98315607534101
he offered his arm to the countess   73.10427791107963
that is to say highway robbers   24.23484021489604
this visit had infused new vigor into dantès   188.3092461992257
he was like a soldierly automaton or rather like a magnificent marionette   71.75515967020024
but it is not selfishness alone that makes me thus in haste   104.99737650883841
we have already at the station three gentlemen whose passports are under examination who are on their way to her majesty   133.84827954430054
the queen had at first positively refused   138.9129188870111
he had married a woman from the village of carconte and whom we did not know by any other name than that of her village   154.22950081321102
i will ask leave of absence of monsieur de tréville on some pretext or other which you must invent   175.49804487527572
and he retired discovering mazarin who was in great confusion to the astonished gaze of aramis   131.01266123101595
i recognize you perfectly   59.58715420511558
you know my devotion to you   72.13149679889767
and whilst he was lost in thought bazin retreated toward the sacristy and even there he could not think himself safe until he had shut and locked the door behind him   95.15933274023396
if you like replied the latter   221.06577646873754
read that he said   74.51202993680438
i came here direct from the castle of st   48.694949878699724
you are mad dear friend   197.9174524951063
the nostrils of the horse were no longer above water and the rider who had lost the reins in struggling fell with his head back and his arms extended   99.8646046447825
the birds whose songs delighted him cheered him with their music   132.90995235258154
i speak of monsieur de tréville who was formerly my neighbor and who had the honor to be as a child the play fellow of our king louis xiii   73.0724336994502
she made him kill the duke   80.83317210815036
that we couldn t go a hundred steps without being recaptured because we were without clothes to disguise ourselves and arms to defend ourselves   94.67784374908828
she smilingly listened to the soft speeches of d artagnan and even gave him her hand to kiss   92.12605497992863
monsieur d artagnan belongs to the service   96.90693193483784
d artagnan was over him at a bound and said to the englishman pointing his sword to his throat i could kill you my lord you are completely in my hands   64.85483064792916
stay with grandpapa maximilian   138.88300765444893
is your horse tired   49.991641787628424
is it not almost incredible said madame danglars that a person having at least half a million of secret service money at his command should possess so little information   158.17400512937573
but the stranger knew not the headstrong personage he had to do with   144.17881719899577
of course   79.38461920426056
i shall be delighted to have your opinion   63.95873705957476
the patron was so strict that this was the first time they had ever seen him give up an enterprise or even delay in its execution   163.91788565356438
this time the illusion or rather the reality surpassed anything valentine had before experienced   88.41959568867682
and supposing he should be able to get so far he determined to dispatch him in good style or at least by hitting him in the face as cæsar recommended his soldiers do to those of pompey to damage forever the beauty of which he was so proud   138.25785027769712
at length when they found they were likely to be really in want they got together as a last effort eight or ten pistoles with which porthos went to the gaming table   155.32641774923673
de morcerf said monte cristo quietly   131.90119221701426
the child was small for his age and unnaturally pale   108.39710045458678
for don t you see renée the king is the father of his people and he who shall plot or contrive aught against the life and safety of the parent of thirty two millions of souls is a parricide upon a fearfully great scale   150.55806687175132
the abbé scarron   139.84657014788974
cavalcanti s father will be gone   62.43380755329699
the duc d orléans visited the posts   75.08402704780926
he is my only remaining friend and we both need his help come   138.93932773064495
chapter liv   147.0447845808379
and raoul fell back trembling upon his chair   131.78847178376503
the countess in reply bowed gracefully to albert and extended her hand with cordial kindness to franz   152.06309178421682
it was intensely dark   76.63985428553993
poor father   63.91765828268064
they did not scruple much in the case of athos   187.75209728960823
yes said the procureur and i think the will promises to be yet more extraordinary for i can not see how it is to be drawn up without the intervention of valentine and she may perhaps be considered as too much interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable interpreter of the obscure and ill defined wishes of her grandfather   170.55969694332086
and by whom are you forbidden   168.4978563610629
do you not father   192.73580847558407
as for monte cristo his eyes slowly rose towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude   189.85456155663974
besides had not the deputy who had been so kind to him told him that provided he did not pronounce the dreaded name of noirtier he had nothing to apprehend   108.82244133766628
but he added in this war prisoners stand a chance of being hung   87.81777600577145
by five minutes   147.03139371559507
you are free to night without fighting   89.00044167039314
isn t there a great and grand one the convent of jesuits   32.98681509567356
monsieur replied the banker drawing himself up with a haughty air the extent of my resources has never yet been questioned   130.32071642924998
i believe they do   168.4191294028949
speak and i will follow your advice   79.64432081507101
they say that the door is not opened by a key but a magic word   25.022631111761967
true replied grimaud   14.440840794715825
madame said villefort believe me a fortune of 900 000 francs is not so easily renounced   101.94324412907977
he said to himself what chateau   154.2321223488747
at last charged with murders with debauchery hated by every one and yet threatening still like a panther thirsting for blood she fell under the blows of men whom she had rendered desperate though they had never done her the least injury   111.6678066986067
four powerful horses were already pawing the ground with impatience while ali apparently just arrived from a long walk was standing at the foot of the steps his face bathed in perspiration   128.61052983648577
come my lord you shall be treated like a prince as you are   134.8032849417922
then with sighs which were unlike any human sound he dragged himself to the door reeled across the courtyard and falling into the arms of his valet he said in a voice scarcely intelligible home home   130.7552710025177
she cast a glance at the door   148.12565317325462
overpowered with agitation the poisoner succeeded in groping her way to the door and reached her room in an agony of fear   133.1017784689284
no vicomte said madame de chevreuse taking his hand and making him sit near her while she looked at him with eyes sparkling with pleasure   140.31723282605304
the sick man was not yet able to speak but he pointed with evident anxiety towards the door   107.3165045122515
sir he responded you are a stranger and i believe you say yourself that a portion of your life has been spent in oriental countries so you are not aware how human justice so expeditious in barbarous countries takes with us a prudent and well studied course   120.48600348249039
then he slowly uttered these words who is now dying in your house   207.40070984997396
if i ever find him again and i will find him i swear were it in hell   108.67084381504769
such feats sir are done once and never repeated   106.02835053985751
it was evident from his pale face and knit brows that his resolution to revenge himself was growing weaker   79.44316104880181
my friends monsieur   160.12438674894304
the eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind   115.67134229033724
indeed i fear 40028m valentine will have no greater pleasure than that of fulfilling her grandmother s last injunctions   178.0908001450933
my lord will remember that the lodge is at a distance from the house   144.71260855070818
he got in it and thoroughly wearied by so many emotions arrived about midnight in the rue meslay threw himself on his bed and slept soundly   127.12125910790242
you have seven martlets on your arms   11.3606189093843
now continued carlini if i have done wrongly avenge her   99.84204434921595
this man was dressed in a greatcoat or rather a surtout a little worse for the journey but which exhibited the ribbon of the legion of honor still fresh and brilliant a decoration which also ornamented the under coat   100.08006939287203
teresa had become alarmed at the wild and deserted look of the plain around her and pressed closely against her guide not uttering a syllable   148.97411283743548
mine was to guard you and i am doing so   195.30369651179348
first my lord   126.19319339843909
you wish to know what i will do   81.81647662345549
god knows how much i love revere you   155.7627693553474
madame answered the youth in his sweet voice it seems to me that there is only one career for a gentleman that of the army   139.61344568264263
and should i forget you kings memories are short do not be afraid to bring yourself to my recollection   110.95577030577223
let us speak candidly sir   147.72549333688386
but she was absorbed by jealousy   215.29696219718124
i had sworn to die of hunger rather than part with these precious pledges   88.61112115359886
the first rays of daybreak penetrated the aperture of the tent as winter re entered it   195.80563493332784
a young man does not require luxuries   157.48121427589518
here are thirty francs   132.9848184404711
this boat contained an officer a mate and eight rowers   158.46063141802838
but that s impossible   46.13174021464316
so that three of the king s musketeers one of whom was wounded and a youth not only maintained their ground against five of the most terrible of the cardinal s guardsmen but absolutely brought four of them to earth   84.01777743485327
he would have stayed here fifty years i ll answer for it without any attempt to escape   60.33357841740304
come in my dear john said lord de winter come in and shut the door   122.95386290937167
then make yourself quite easy   110.90440019141793
i must confess that i was mistaken   60.75521754753766
we will embrace raoul and perhaps he will have news of athos   149.08694744314283
an amateur headsman replied aramis who however does not handle the axe amiss   179.91329286917926
two feet of earth removed and dantès fate would be decided   30.821430122377222
that angel resembles the one i have lost   128.4059340686351
but a sword thrust is a sword thrust whatever be the age of him who gives it and a youth is less to be suspected than an older man and the stranger fell into a reverie which lasted some minutes   194.40399693455
let us drink heartily and while we do so tell me a little of what is going on in the world yonder   130.54039526194924
and then my good fellow use your daggers in any way you please and i further promise you to be there as a spectator of your prowess   119.11503589363471
so you are free now and rich   160.0394158519609
he seemed scarcely five and thirty   124.51070275582593
then i renewed the search   29.443969456035134
said the king who began to be shaken was it so managed   97.49846048988678
bonaparte continued the baron is mortally wearied and passes whole days in watching his miners at work at porto longone   119.7882853901379
but you my dear d artagnan   96.2057454095696
but she positively answered that she was tired of the exigencies and infidelities of monsieur porthos and that she would not send him a denier   166.17458132833633
while walking near the wood of monsieur le prince i laid a few snares in the runs   139.57103804275636
i have a jolly little circle of witty abbés and pretty women   89.63980499477316
it is not here   79.07072282541876
show me into one of those pretty little rooms which overlook the court and bring me a cold fowl and a bottle of bordeaux   71.10139946988423
but at the first effort he made although he played with his left hand he found that his wound was yet too recent to allow of such exertion   131.98621653739812
lord de winter   145.91261122271953
it is true said athos but this child comes in the name of heaven   157.99810724433158
de villefort even would not have alarmed him   120.9282249897083
i am accustomed to adversity   115.08454930778284
is monsieur aramis with d artagnan   76.30194440223087
and so he was murmured caderousse   106.3018185659366
did you not tell me it was a family jewel   134.08240105711297
when franz had finished reading this account so dreadful for a son   7.4541297737980585
but he called to mind the words of the will which he knew by heart   197.8317134130715
that assassination was a mysterious affair said villefort and the perpetrators have hitherto escaped detection although suspicion has fallen on the head of more than one person   81.74374280562259
but i really pity this poor comte de wardes since you have ceased to love him   189.66673083461285
said porthos it is very pleasant to be able to say the late monsieur mordaunt   28.614403671201316
which is to say that the gascons made a king of me myself seeing that i am my father s son is it not tréville   49.18417844718994
five minutes afterwards the curtain falls and the spectators depart   98.30083887246698
the crime which i have committed my lord has no call upon human justice and you can only deliver me from it by blessing me frequently as you have just done   151.78513704706396
but still further his education had been so little neglected even with respect to scholastic studies so rare at this time among gentlemen that he smiled at the scraps of latin which aramis sported and which porthos pretended to understand   62.25056882034118
though i remember in our affair of the rue férou i received a sword wound which at the end of fifteen or eighteen days produced the same effect   202.52926998791202
there was a silence of several seconds   108.75085030620286
you are welcome count   80.76090807928418
and springing backward he broke his sword across his knee to avoid the necessity of surrendering it threw the pieces over the convent wall and crossed his arms whistling a cardinalist air   161.3561944374343
you ministers give such splendid ones   46.523582972660975
hem thought monte cristo he begins to conceal his losses   116.73033629549704
dear maximilian why not attribute your escape to my constant prayers for your safety   142.7622727045496
ah monsieur returned julie it is treason in my brother to bring you thus but he never has any regard for his poor sister   122.66146346416001
that s correct   104.03019913487856
and yet it was easy to understand that he was formed to rule the young men with whom he associated at present   104.7969808642834
while he was yet at the door of the study he heard the bedroom door open turned and saw his father   157.09327412659988
canst thou speak any patois   168.95008969300915
no but he is proud of them   68.67992749912989
chapter 37   107.51458082481447
the four philosophers looked at one another in a state of bewilderment   137.45536343246866
that little stout man short and elderly that sort of lackey dressed in dark clothes treated without ceremony by the men wearing swords who composed the escort was bonacieux himself   98.93493031649247
father said the young man i have the honor of presenting to you the count of monte cristo the generous friend whom i had the good fortune to meet in the critical situation of which i have told you   68.58794325771889
yes my good master cried bertuccio casting himself at the count s feet it was simply vengeance nothing else   99.35908664692185
can you sir produce any witnesses to the truth of what you have asserted   109.84446080479428
d artagnan said athos with a maniacal burst of laughter guess what she had on her shoulder   125.42898288735451
i present to you he said monsieur le chevalier d artagnan lieutenant of his majesty s musketeers a devoted friend and one of the most excellent brave gentlemen that i have ever known   125.28231827829674
the visitor was about fifty two years of age dressed in one of the green surtouts ornamented with black frogs which have so long maintained their popularity all over europe   138.93308930894364
i feel easy replied porthos   59.66530823940896
the door opened   59.81531429112404
peter   107.5828840040167
for he knew that all the soldiers of the french emperor were naturally noble and generous   44.265283277221585
can i be so lucky as to find what everybody is seeking for   61.33689877465126
but beneath my fingers as if by magic in proportion as the fire ascended i saw yellowish characters appear on the paper   91.69497996428969
for people toward whom he had but to put forth his hand his eminence had rarely recourse to such means   133.77154696922395
my lord escape   56.73355991762517
you see monsieur what the new world has to do with the bottles which are on the commode and the wardrobe   114.28243036676018
chapter 63   48.866807416999045
three times athos knocked without receiving an answer   126.9011725423258
hastily snatching up the lighted candle i hurried to the staircase   120.45219347882617
it was there a lodging was prepared for them   99.88581599307389
from time to time a shot from a musket or the blade of a rapier flashed among the crowd   160.36101427227095
the most dreadful misfortunes the most frightful sufferings the abandonment of all those who loved me the persecution of those who did not know me formed the trials of my youth   136.53060227251507
just like the women replied d artagnan coolly   182.75298019630597
ten minutes after one is taken the effect is produced   114.10200049162201
milady had guessed aright   30.78651766946426
no the other cardinal would have done so but this one is too mean a fellow to risk it   80.82597953252046
our host has a well furnished cellar the key of which never leaves him   118.40385222526713
the general doubted my fidelity   118.11867191807802
said athos musingly   79.40325023092382
our expedition lasted nearly six weeks   157.73949537420236
ali suddenly cast aside his chibouque drew the lasso from his pocket threw it so skilfully as to catch the forelegs of the near horse in its triple fold and suffered himself to be dragged on for a few steps by the violence of the shock then the animal fell over on the pole which snapped and therefore prevented the other horse from pursuing its way   155.0926915038621
that they may try a month hence to marry me again   109.56455005149306
to morrow according to all probability we shall attack the enemy   160.33181879928205
the ship drew on and had safely passed the strait which some volcanic shock has made between the calasareigne and jaros islands   157.41730157764823
felton jumped onshore climbed the little ascent which led to the top of the cliff saluted milady a last time and took his course toward the city   119.27290243483016
dantès read it   147.91726356365243
d artagnan advanced a few steps into the apartment   62.75228388290573
noirtier was a true prophet and things progressed rapidly as he had predicted   105.857078867936
morrel was dreaming and monte cristo was looking at the dreamer   93.16086124759113
you have nothing to do but to overtake it   95.30282435989245
i only wish to do what will be agreeable to you that is all   138.1043888700276
the heart of d artagnan swam in delirium   108.08484361309385
he has regarded neither my prayers my entreaties nor my tears   164.3721653322615
noirtier was carried away   94.97591874094763
la jeune amélie was first at the rendezvous   78.05666498464467
yes but cautiously tell one thing at a time and do not say i told you   81.3758079602764
the man he addressed recoiled with terror and only answered the few words of the musketeer by pointing   167.36605318026687
but that is not all after rescuing me from the sword he rescued me from the cold not by sharing his cloak with me like st   105.89366648070686
the curates asked him what was to be done   120.36051059529619
by r lady   31.05879389755809
it is for that reason i have given orders to pass the island for as you see the fire is behind us   119.75218206857762
if the pardon is to come there is no time to lose   152.62117056087925
so much the worse said valentine smiling   102.12420443235554
said grimaud who had not spoken a word   78.50607100189407
but then we know that understanding was not his strong point   199.85129072874508
the ante rooms were still full of soldiers the passages still lined by guards   75.47992378237979
don t lose a word of what i m going to say to you porthos   162.54881113382777
what is the day of the month   145.34565226723225
generally you are only rude but tonight you are brutal   49.72453469258777
she looked at him with an expression of kindness which it was impossible to mistake   67.2137721654333
my very own   60.12410634463268
cried she my god   116.1761451736818
gentlemen said groslow i beg you will take your places   38.23222556194513
any way mother   63.379806293267144
now then said villefort placing the letter in his pocketbook i must have another   93.27483503192924
monsieur i implore you do not stay there   44.03959027929969
treat me in the same way   97.16457212261265
dantès turned pale hesitated and reflected   124.02357926074221
julie uttered a faint cry blushed like a rose and leaned against the baluster   120.03142227658013
well how is he now   63.06361369524118
what do you require then   66.33492180461182
see the sneaks come without drum or trumpet   29.98568628310757
morrel did not turn round he expected these words of cocles the agent of thomson french   137.00391971851695
had i such a uniform as your eminence possesses i protest i should be mightily content and i would take an oath never to wear any other costume yes but for to night s adventure i don t suppose my dress would have been a very safe one   158.67445078196923
but less preoccupied by that pretty face than d artagnan he had fancied he saw a second head a man s head inside the carriage   127.73213709611791
shall i suffer like this long   143.22424613421782
cried the king the scotch sell their king for two hundred thousand pounds   133.90607222005355
de monte cristo and myself   139.07250237696965
parry bent over his master s hand and kissed it respectfully   135.79219333354382
he would have written or at this instant someone knocked at the door   213.87515164288223
but you guitant are not a courtier   150.62986359544192
the same good fortune has not happened to your accomplices one is mad the other dead   85.16870503899193
he could not refrain from a smile of visible satisfaction   87.29880462595133
porthos drew his sword from the scabbard and made passes at the wall springing back from time to time and making contortions like a dancer   137.54530337665665
quite contrary to the lot of monsieur de conti unable to be cardinal he was obliged to remain a soldier   141.91017554279776
but what probability was there that mme   83.72939939759469
decidedly and honestly   152.17474249374035
franz thanked the count for his attention   88.00311363217588
hold the moment is a happy one for there he is now giving his blessing in the square of the palais royal   134.9780136578243
that s well said monte cristo   88.45263264521739
had we not better lower our heads   135.663863864897
do not forget that   81.5749430348891
i hoped that the active and laborious life of a smuggler with the severe discipline on board would have a salutary effect on his character which was now well nigh if not quite corrupt   143.43723326638624
then turning to maximilian with an adorable smile   53.071291934707006
i faith the treasonable word is out   96.34151942261431
i shall hear from you   93.9147310425139
in consequence of this feeling of repugnance he was about to pass without speaking to him but as he had done the day before m   101.45848776737144
then you advise me to go alone to beauchamp   144.50787738220419
a great loss   9.515247485184574
by the baroness he was most graciously welcomed while eugénie received him with her accustomed coldness   95.06054888694926
and there will be fine doings if you do not take care   98.53700148444612
d artagnan then cast an anxious and rapid glance over the field of battle   110.09077558269337
at last louis xiii   126.10196305163979
will you tell me that your three damned musketeers athos porthos and aramis and your youngster from béarn have not fallen like so many furies upon poor bernajoux and have not maltreated him in such a fashion that probably by this time he is dead   60.48875007368571
ah said the inspector you have not the latest news from italy   16.763534810976722
that was no reason for staking my diamond   184.7496779901171
so pray excuse yourself as well as you can for having made me wait and after that tell me why i see you in a dress so singular that at first i did not recognize you   133.93815421374822
said the young girl   137.16540526183798
aramis dug his nails into his flesh and groaned aloud   45.08500331535065
in an instant all the strength of mind of this creature though drawn from the most vigorous sources abandoned her   114.7984230066543
d artagnan uttered a slight cry of joy   95.00470142914753
you know said the queen that they want to take the king away from me   85.3996625079791
the poor duke became perfectly giddy   145.67345468688228
she is then now at malta   167.400619248353
20255m oh no said morrel   23.596547773790405
the king muttered the wounded man the king is a prisoner   92.5134146672058
exclaimed the monarch   107.75294591829886
he had gained much information but not enough   98.56270593133038
but the more the young woman excused herself the more important bonacieux thought the secret which she declined to confide to him   23.259619317111927
bah replied monte cristo impossible   53.96024393569199
the corso was light as day   53.73717818495383
he had labelled them with as much care as if he had been master botanist in the jardin des plantes   114.52400172983816
you will go to marseilles said dantès for you understand i repeat his words just as he uttered them   184.27081312537746
my own conscience and your politeness sir are the guarantees of that   174.64714121633625
where do you come from now   89.83071811516282
then seeing his son he fell into his arms pale and trembling   165.62662478932793
they stopped on the road but you continued yours   88.0352483203641
the fortune of war my dear viscount the caprice of fortune   52.77839736612434
to arms   52.01529814387261
at a hundred steps on turning to the left you will find the wall of the park   68.55861652001245
this rabbit dead the abbé adelmonte has its entrails taken out by his cook and thrown on the dunghill   58.10655579216723
oh count i shall sleep calmly deliciously in the arms of death   144.15888364505088
then i will go alone   63.206241118767544
the chance of being attacked would be an excuse for everything   53.199844095181966
it will do me good   36.64578779512743
my guards exclaimed that they were sure of it   91.33129679036591
it is urgent that i should have this money without delay   35.68858982814203
a deathlike silence reigned in the room above   111.76085492931499
danglars felt a dreadful spasm dart through his heart   22.667003537662183
those who would as it were force a passage to his heart found an impassable barrier   159.22833289788886
you wrote sir knowing what answer you would receive   98.9563175513058
well well said the count who told you that   114.48884472598661
and i in exchange pardon you the murder of my poor love and your cruel vengeance against me   71.3830524789258
without this danglars would have been quite ignorant of the time for daylight did not reach his cell   111.28742645206114
very well until the moment when the comte de la fere resumed raoul said come bragelonne draw your sword   8.676622658708311
suppose i were a soldier like you and ordered to carry a certain redoubt and you knew i must be killed in the assault would you not say to me as you said just now go father   73.72984718441043
then i shall recognize you as my nephew for you would be a worthy son of such a mother   67.05884489409078
athos looked at him intently   89.00001050498217
please to remember that he who shall touch a hair of my head is himself an assassin   40.937395674319816
observe to nobody   141.57904795176555
do you know this ring   67.73452435732196
raoul on foot for he had not time to mount his horse again tired like the guards of distributing blows with the flat of his sword had recourse to its point   2.3425352290896626
i said porthos i am entirely of d artagnan s opinion   49.58719122701579
and i said porthos do you think my strain cost me nothing   117.77231342784019
what was the expression of his face   103.27665342839606
but i fear you will deem it even more absurd than the first   98.04093953561107
begin with me my lord   196.18240753418854
another gasconade   62.48566975608983
monsieur was already such a good theologian said bazin almost weeping   30.05906587249784
the gardener nodded and began to fling up the balls which were picked up by la ramee and the guard   135.94355467220956
we will try and carry him on board the tartan   105.43062053267433
i have parted with him   79.13688371034594
and if i make a promise i must keep it   43.768546923891506
and taking it from felton he cast a rapid glance over the paper and perceiving that it was the one that had been mentioned to him he placed it on the table took a pen and prepared to sign it   104.43940210083788
but drawing from his belt a little silver whistle such as boatswains use in ships of war he whistled three times with three different modulations   85.11891215103645
that is reasonable since he is an only son   114.27929908254586
you are not a priest   159.82623426263484
it was the day after that upon which bertuccio had paid his second visit to benedetto when the latter was to learn his father s name   77.9337610151611
and as he was a man full of forethought these trousers carefully rolled up in his valise contained every sort of tool for immediate use   121.81654730235827
he appeared calm but it was evidently not without a mighty effort   28.555399463298244
you had nothing left   118.85454037288439
whatever happens let us not leave england before the crisis   148.24370361272474
the latter obeyed without reply and entered the chamber where he appeared to be expected   14.788623952874403
i have had the honor of informing your eminence that these men were drunk   104.67058552309281
the eight oars fell into the sea simultaneously without splashing a drop of water and the boat yielding to the impulsion glided forward   159.21215419196733
quite a canoe   99.3819181983073
but villefort uttered words which even he himself did not believe   127.37344597940339
de villefort and i am ready to prove it   165.35898641233223
jean had struck three quarters past two   76.0488489393259
i wore a long sword which cut like a damascus you remember it aramis for you always called it balizarde   184.65966832927802
good news   107.54036727528111
i have been a captain in the queen s guards for twenty years was the reply   108.46259279163684
impostor indeed   191.2852156070704
take the stairs on your right   65.02768036684094
milady was so beautiful at this moment the religious ecstasy in which she appeared to be plunged gave such an expression to her countenance that felton was so dazzled that he fancied he beheld the angel whom he had only just before heard   53.09808647031647
coysel is a madman   30.227105897519735
we shall laugh over all this in five minutes   107.15151059330412
yes but he couldn t understand what it meant for he had spent that night with a dying person and marie michon had left his house before his return   124.61841637017254
he might have been taken for a statue   13.995098218981667
and scratches himself for amusement added the king   167.4902234170608
tell me is not her father baron danglars   168.53662815262354
well and what are you going to do at st   77.27623354577048
his devotion to the queen was boundless   94.52825171651054
arrived in his bedroom the count motioned to ali to stop   112.10199997596582
valentine mounted on a bench and passed not only her finger but her whole hand through the opening   99.4289604350064
dear friend at raoul s age the heart is so expansive that it must encircle one object or another fancied or real   131.998114613296
you know noirmont do you not   103.39980250376259
that woman that woman   47.030593007403326
said d artagnan comprehending the slight frown of the musketeer   157.9787372967236
i think we are all taken prisoners except aramis and that our chances of getting out are lessened since one more of us is caught in mazarin s mousetrap   110.07996038833537
has he wit or not this demon d artagnan   85.41186107401224
caderousse signed it   80.92744182257556
add monsieur d artagnan my lord   125.68965179419095
cried the gascon and porthos   158.82818406112182
asked porthos who perceiving that d artagnan had allowed the conversation to drop profited by it to put in a word or two   149.14299955066332
porthos said aramis athos has already told you that you are a simpleton and i am quite of his opinion   140.18683404678646
i swear to you i protest oh but god is above   87.90859014061405
my daughter is only seventeen years old and your son twenty one   64.35561953705852
then do your best to keep our name free from dishonor   102.62087234642576
oh yes with all my soul   115.58873564407419
ah it is m   73.11887159205381
now you have the key of the cellar   52.32917851491972
30065m but i remember it perfectly interposed the darling edward   163.18991105558814
how is your husband our dear monsieur coquenard   103.68619599101085
that would be nothing for us four   175.44842195710305
where if you please   101.54176414875649
i confess this is the drollest thing i have ever met with in the course of my extensive foreign transactions and you may readily suppose it has greatly roused my curiosity   63.71702513873221
the men he beheld saw him undoubtedly for their cries were carried to his ears by the wind   101.47479243788942
no one can say that m   156.17526708344909
assassin of buckingham assassin of felton assassin of my brother i demand justice upon you and i swear that if it be not granted to me i will execute it myself   130.1751788021503
d artagnan let me confess to you what i ve been thinking about during the whole of my drive as i looked out upon the parties of citizens who perpetually crossed our path and looked at you and your four men with fiery eyes   91.23121197069169
chapter 53   91.57970473767011
said he you are brave young men proud in daylight faithful in darkness   117.80298712090122
well since i gave you a fourth of my gains i think you owe me a fourth of my losses   182.53412690705613
let her do what she likes with the duke   117.07626682630269
strength and sagacity continued   163.70943418728342
d artagnan bowed   130.73075301974882
the palais de justice communicated with the prison a sombre edifice that from its grated windows looks on the clock tower of the accoules   126.73215090629469
all we have to do is to stop the issue of any more and close our office   162.46950233143713
as for my disposition that is perhaps somewhat too hasty   111.56257403988901
if the news be inauspicious we must fly this night   162.0975524337457
said she in a hollow voice   121.24716950274993
i hope i have not made you wait too long sir said the duke   76.24732851778822
i have taken the oath of allegiance to louis xviii   134.61061494239516
made tréville the captain of his musketeers who were to louis xiii   211.97582252460268
porthos who had not spoken one word answered merely by a word and a gesture   103.74112736988891
things look black enough replied porthos   63.23518849757518
the guards more skillful did greater execution   79.59101607216836
it was in his service that my father made his fortune   150.14483502594626
in this instance i may fairly and freely accept your thanks   82.71233258701284
at the end of the next act with your permission i will come and inquire whether there is anything i can do for you in paris   65.77106379631316
take the detachment and conduct him to his place   127.05293171710883
the four walls alone remained as he had left them   140.36036602834793
it is the counsel of a madman and i should be more mad than you did i not stop you at once with the word impossible morrel impossible   93.08788538104208
continued the old lady with a fearful expression that i may rise from the depths of my grave to find him if he should not fulfil his duty   100.27856882414865
de villefort the object of unusual attention and we had almost said of general admiration sat in the armchair and cast a tranquil glance around him   150.6613591965472
in your place i would do one thing   99.83158751265873
holidays   0.590888407644286
you were seated upon cushions in the spanish fashion   229.36449576279915
said d artagnan who quickly understood whence such an exact description had come   136.34986741268213
insolent wretch   128.31730826131556
the arts change about and make a tour of the world   166.92777917821493
all his funds amounted to 6 000 or 8 000 francs his bills receivable up to the 5th to 4 000 or 5 000 which making the best of everything gave him 14 000 francs to meet debts amounting to 287 500 francs   106.81559809455302
inquired monte cristo laughingly   82.66779020106834
each one on awaking would find himself on the field of battle   133.7701366591203
he was moderately reassured however by the aspect of that countenance full of astute intelligence and affected humility   153.66420206707454
to maintain a cause which i believed sacred i have lost the throne and my children their inheritance   83.4783852632681
d artagnan slipped out of the cathedral and placed himself in ambuscade at the corner of the rue des canettes   120.4685296490256
now said the old man aid me to bury my child   155.33045978050762
but three weeks had already passed and the most diligent search had been unsuccessful   166.18617118654944
but mousqueton forages and brings in provisions   122.90204912524321
exclaimed morrel with increasing anger and reproach you who have deceived me with false hopes who have cheered and soothed me with vain promises when i might if not have saved her at least have seen her die in my arms   70.48553739148514
on the contrary one shot at this moment would be paid for dearly to morrow   160.5009663345934
no said danglars smiling they are bonds on the bank of france payable to bearer   145.00701848995965
if he persists   152.48082763380063
that s true said porthos   84.28946631500027
now this point was settled   194.77074229802648
cries of death   98.35922531950118
chairs were placed scaffolds were raised and windows were hung with flags   112.0840583058278
morrel can not give up his horse his honor being engaged in keeping it   135.6894939327538
what a wicked looking crooked staircase said château renaud with a smile   118.26847889267776
you are a prisoner   80.04457612362825
now shall i tell you something   78.56484401245035
athos called grimaud pointed to a large basket which lay in a corner and made a sign to him to wrap the viands up in the napkins   93.15944904794102
willingly my young cavalier said the priest if you will be content with the remains of my supper and with half my chamber   171.87631332754205
monte cristo sprang lightly from the carriage and offered his hand to assist emmanuel and maximilian   125.32247931922024
went without recompense   90.58565839622825
the foremost of them stammered and attempted to fall back   92.12178837358927
all day   117.95686775004528
the moon shining through the open blinds made the lamp appear to burn paler and cast a sepulchral hue over the whole scene   163.72281968714208
no m   63.531317435796886
that of the telegraph man was horticulture   55.33752381977388
good replied athos whose blood mounted to his face at the insult offered to royalty   101.60599854408996
she was coming out of marseilles harbor and was standing out to sea rapidly her sharp prow cleaving through the waves   66.28474012461416
i meant persons who were out in the streets of rome   78.1820327016012
it was the letter written as our readers know to julie and signed sinbad the sailor   126.04455751066378
this alone can stop me in my onward career before i have attained the goal at which i aim for all the rest i have reduced to mathematical terms   136.14028009288876
the door opened and the man in the mantle reappeared   68.3387333963173
but as to you i do not advise you to risk doing so   135.43093052653268
at present i no longer think of it and yet i must tell you that we are beginning to occupy ourselves greatly with these things under our popular government   122.43575634319527
all the other guests followed   211.4910695310321
with those studs   110.72154974895287
there are in this bag three hundred pistoles   159.8717571434014
assuredly said d artagnan i admire this piece of prose   139.7326361701677
acknowledge it beauchamp   77.64319417287179
as the light shone on them a cry was heard from the other two combatants   75.7795659966581
and so those gentlemen down there are men of great talent   80.74587359416226
let me do what i please and do you what i do   119.33735788735585
exclaimed planchet here s land in good condition   85.09373848050186
the tumult was indescribable   53.650795524705515
there were then great griefs tears without end and solemn promises to remain faithful all of course on the part of the hostess   96.15928526664167
carriages now arrived in crowds   35.7818493751123
dantès inserted the sharp end of the pickaxe between the coffer and the lid and pressing with all his force on the handle burst open the fastenings   122.04313264610406
they took leave of each other and in ten minutes after having commended his friend to the cares of the hostess and bazin d artagnan was trotting along in the direction of amiens   106.81179315367396
cried d artagnan raising his head and regaining his self possession   123.70914473854234
yes said they all with one accord   141.93488221187891
my friend since i killed chatillon adored of the ladies of saint germain i am too great a celebrity not to fear a prison doubly   168.3853555050568
do i wish to know him   172.5530224966656
cæs   124.31456221015979
both sir   118.79843026211498
have you not seen m   180.66133230575
the fair worshipper touched the great hand of porthos with her delicate fingers smiled made the sign of the cross and left the church   82.48562931286136
it was arranged for the evening and no other time will serve   157.67341066598323
athos then shrugged his shoulders and without putting himself in a passion thrashed grimaud   85.42192718836374
and moreover very handsome saddles said porthos who at the moment wore on his cloak the lace of his own   136.30461251432075
and with a rapid change of thought the conversation passed suddenly to another subject   68.63657883266815
follow me then said the abbé as he re entered the subterranean passage in which he soon disappeared followed by dantès   123.69866909022583
d artagnan interpreted it   158.71645273450343
this niece comes sometimes to see her uncle   94.95721242743413
heavens   158.06668339382531
you are doubtless provided with pistols gentlemen   124.79714288709025
and in what light did you view the occurrence   78.72127828683622
teresa with the chief s consent did the same   48.027489325400325
the walls were hung with one of the gray papers which economical landlords choose as not likely to show the dirt   99.09618531682752
the second grotto was lower and more gloomy than the first   166.9408708994685
ah yes said a light horseman with a glass of brandy in his hand which he sipped slowly   216.05225324125456
at verberie raoul desired olivain to make some inquiry about the young man who was preceding them   113.12085354679174
i am not very clever at pretexts   200.5981009616013
and what do you know of him   116.87427038563067
for i only am left and they seek my life   132.82139167204417
meanwhile danglars stooping to monte cristo s ear your advice was excellent said he   132.340488145831
in order to render an act valid i must be certain of the approbation or disapprobation of my client   142.70174226790542
nothing nothing only shut the window   108.86178387096157
let us see for you know my dear captain a judge must hear both sides   123.58290842549917
cried he and if you have the good fortune to be admitted to her majesty s presence tell her what you have seen   158.10408323418915
asked andrea of himself   13.659706153578782
and running into a court he disappeared   96.52808318053569
of what country are you   127.43828558407672
the most profound terror reigned throughout the house   186.0651026840054
do you still wish to do so   168.1685053828622
i have nothing more to ask of heaven i have seen you again and have found you as noble and as great as formerly you were   115.21771500956253
that is never leave him alone an instant   160.33147355215834
you a deputy procureur to found an accusation on such bad premises   25.84893359168649
the second reason monsieur the chevalier replied kitty emboldened by the kiss in the first place and still further by the expression of the eyes of the young man is that in love everyone for herself   70.81879962865142
i love my sister julie i love her husband emmanuel   81.55502190315991
i will search for them madame said de winter and doubtless i shall find them   120.20397305913107
on arriving at the rue saint denis the friends found a vast concourse of people   147.0098129071525
you have kept the secret   134.45662325271832
d artagnan jumped into the saddle then the old companions in arms again shook hands   71.54207876880918
he who returned to france with millions had been unable to find the grave of his father who had perished from hunger   137.94973140686713
then he looked about for something to pour the soup into   82.73434455059189
now take your courage in both hands and hear what this gentleman in black is going to say about his sovereign with full license and privilege   122.36356769190536
why my dear fellow that on leaving us he lost his way that s all   216.28088823502046
there has been a crime said monte cristo   107.39799982188791
is it to do us some ill turn   153.0475219193831
not personally but from having heard the queen speak of him more than once as a brave and loyal gentleman   165.9052320754828
read that said he when i am gone that you may not be witness of my anger   96.99102911819509
why not try to find an opening in another direction from that which has so unfortunately failed   153.02325638241982
and what did the cuistre pettifogger say about me   212.53809003907674
the expression of the count s face had not remained unperceived by the banker   196.08224343416288
sign the order for the liberation of milady de winter   134.31860834009692
la ramee came into the room   195.06219697374638
i try to be beloved not feared   88.53580238300601
to saddle gentlemen   58.953877777517704
during all this time the general on whom they thought to have relied as on a brother manifested evidently signs of discontent and repugnance   103.14067187534765
armentières   176.411581930417
felton lowered his head and reflected   24.653965015213643
and my only heir are you not   128.8851673147635
said aramis there are questions between them at this very moment   74.13866915834126
why did you talk of a regiment athos   140.99122513811534
mad you mean don t you   12.589437185340401
said the queen never   117.31306630598357
and waving his hand to comminges he rejoined d artagnan who instantly put himself at the head of his troop followed by the cardinal guitant and the rest of the escort   0.9275640656817075
ah yes where is my sister   106.59623766983857
and i was ready to strangle you   130.33050347111168
and how much will that cost me monsieur d artagnan   95.9035400151709
take away vasiliki   117.33292445632934
it leaves its track   197.55039515493073
madame de villefort sent for him half an hour ago   175.90341512633313
come then said d artagnan you are right   67.45517696272465
no on the honor of an officer   67.12543773363299
take all needful precautions replied the inspector   126.49589707722936
he must be a vampire   205.19573027737113
cried aramis and d artagnan at the same time   70.43371062787185
they heard the horsemen pass under the windows   157.7024162836748
said the swiss who had needed a little time to take in d artagnan s proposal pooh   162.51061204363367
morcerf like most other young men of rank and fortune had his orchestra stall with the certainty of always finding a seat in at least a dozen of the principal boxes occupied by persons of his acquaintance   66.98015370563755
no sir said albert coldly   45.31623995837998
what is he himself   99.28560257341474
heaven is as inflexible as man and the signature of the contract is fixed for this evening at nine o clock   69.50138106138945
dantès folded his hands raised his eyes to heaven and prayed fervently   126.1349726628784
oh it is all my wife s fault   172.63561628127567
oh as for parricides and such dreadful people as that interposed renée it matters very little what is done to them   167.4386136686755
muttered fernand   98.80582025619726
she cried will you dare to tell me you did not know what you now reproach me with   82.11196070037929
anne of austria sought to read in mazarin s face the occasion of this unexpected visit since the cardinal usually came to her apartment only after every one had retired   138.082721790541
but scarcely had she perceived him then she reseated herself in her armchair and made a sign to her women to resume their cushions and stools and with an air of supreme hauteur said what do you desire monsieur and with what object do you present yourself here   134.96602864866796
the queen although already pale became visibly paler and her face was contracted   73.7793716529988
true excellency that was the crime the real crime for in that i acted like a coward   84.4276679262554
said he to the young man who since the death of buckingham had regained that coolness and self possession which never after abandoned him wretch   31.909220255694805
on the nineteenth the impromptu army had attempted a sortie more to assure itself and others of its actual existence than with any more serious intention   131.77861398994196
and pray that if you should ever be in a similar predicament he may do as much for you as he did for me   42.627236101371906
this sum i have expended upon travelling expenses and and you want money   137.45856377617122
it was elegantly fashioned and worthy of its mistress   88.21222665170784
there was an ironical tone in his voice which he could not quite disguise and which astonished the coadjutor   188.08450032620362
and moreover it kills said beauchamp   103.7806752830516
then for the first time i observed the agitation of my grandfather and i must tell you maximilian that i am the only person capable of discerning emotion in his paralyzed frame   139.11127748466075
yes indeed said he i believe so   163.59586487062586
speak on   70.58399512410922
by guards brought by the men in black whom you put to flight   122.24470686989501
so near that if the windows which look on the orangery were not stopped up you could see him from where you are   74.6577090548528
i would lay a wager he has stolen it   193.14122140443627
for whom do you take the blue domino at the window with the white curtains   154.60692623219262
the swiss with an air of stupefaction looked at the hostess who turned pale   91.28146334111531
my child my darling edward   21.93473530858529
excuse my putting such a question to you   36.97938526181626
and that is why on account of the living mercédès and my deceased father i have sworn to revenge myself on fernand and i have revenged myself   101.25275509676044
let me see what it is   123.26267360314952
monte cristo drew morrel a step or two behind his brother in law   149.43803986760457
i am an honorable man   168.79257855172312
i will introduce you to them   176.54230286174462
madame he said i am an abbé it is true but i am so against my will   151.86197711809382
i monsieur replied the abbé with an air of surprise i want nothing   139.68248494555206
is it a suitable match   175.67776989019399
replied the secretary resting on the stairs   175.6186738275492
i will never confess that but to the man who should read to the bottom of my soul   130.71229192928442
besides to do all this time is necessary months years   127.60698615806695
major cavalcanti   168.50569232748634
if he comes back you will kill him you are so skillful and so brave   78.01750071647976
speak gentlemen speak i am listening   122.54375001927536
at length a sense of dignity prevailed and if she did not entirely master her agitation she at least succeeded in preventing the fall of a single tear   144.09493221846716
my children he said this is the marechal de la meilleraie as to whose intentions you have been deceived and who pledges himself on returning to the louvre to demand of the queen in your name our broussel s release   108.08592234327635
oh you have some design against me reverend sir   103.15406149224843
but at the moment when the cardinal saw his means already bearing fruit and applauded himself for having put it in action an inhabitant of la rochelle who had contrived to pass the royal lines god knows how such was the watchfulness of bassompierre schomberg and the duc d angoulême themselves watched over by the cardinal an inhabitant of la rochelle we say entered the city coming from portsmouth and saying that he had seen a magnificent fleet ready to sail within eight days   66.34763755725314
and the count began his defence i assure you albert in a most eloquent and skilful manner   143.49672831781726
again the abbé looked at him then mournfully shook his head   110.61574767766892
in an instant d artagnan perceived that the best way in which he could act would be to go home and write milady a long letter in which he would confess to her that he and de wardes were up to the present moment absolutely the same and that consequently he could not undertake without committing suicide to kill the comte de wardes   48.20319966413665
but the skilful manner in which dantès had handled the lugger had entirely reassured him   138.57949557807547
with folded arms he gazed for some time upon the great city   125.39323092997265
but upon the first step he met lord de winter who seeing him pale confused livid and stained with blood both on his hands and face seized him by the throat crying i knew it   103.73715335908227
strong thinkest thou   106.82709199581386
but andrea turning towards them winked his eyes rolled his tongue around his cheeks and smacked his lips in a manner equivalent to a hundred words among the bandits when forced to be silent   172.02273667557978
said the host in spanish   87.81455393770548
you knew very well that i threw the paper into a corner of the room indeed i fancied i had destroyed it   85.85342062052081
what are there no grottos at monte cristo   134.25582289405992
he would take advantage of the first moment of surprise shame and terror to triumph over her   88.09051978404914
porthos looked at d artagnan with an expression of profound admiration   133.17553140001803
there is a third and the most terrible that is my condition as a mortal being   121.01628547672675
i should be more than glad   71.13607557643216
we have still a word to say to these gentlemen   191.71655503028313
said the colonel   158.4158553979297
cried athos and aramis at once   123.91131477530953
what chance brings you here gentlemen   80.0640144154406
i think so madame because i myself have made use of them that i might not be poisoned at naples at palermo and at smyrna that is to say on three several occasions when but for these precautions i must have lost my life   153.633978656716
she opened the door   98.43972613644567
you know i am cool enough   204.52914216509583
they were both orphans and had only their employers leave to ask which had been already sought and obtained   96.11924056287586
we had thus at aigues mortes martigues or bouc a dozen places where we left our goods and where in case of necessity we concealed ourselves from the gendarmes and custom house officers   214.53955876327814
yes he murmured yes be satisfied   154.4156098416715
there all the items of the day had their source and were so quickly transformed misrepresented metamorphosed some into epigrams some into falsehoods that every one was anxious to pass an hour with little scarron listening to what he said reporting it to others   74.01735778348277
never had morrel witnessed such an expression never had so terrible an eye flashed before his face never had the genius of terror he had so often seen either on the battle field or in the murderous nights of algeria shaken around him more dreadful fire   146.98210218049428
and he as usual has refused   108.09359637299109
the bandage fell from his eyes and he understood the joke which he did not think quite so stupid as he had done just before   116.98314494030063
stop a moment said monte cristo   164.00484363779805
where is the count   112.15583344274312
madame danglars terrified in the boudoir with which we are acquainted   109.06114273556955
d artagnan said to him as they descended the staircase of the palais royal   51.00889448818954
he would not come up   68.66994267522037
he said what is the matter   152.16303934026308
oh but i said anne i also duke have had presentiments   121.59578272403154
madame said he the count and yourself recompense too generously a simple action   102.37935354020048
raoul gave it up reluctantly   184.83090221485122
and be upon your guard before my husband who is rather shrewd notwithstanding his seventy six years   126.7759001274496
of what think you do young and strong men die in prison when they have scarcely numbered their thirtieth year unless it be of imprisonment   87.2484782965426
let me know my crime and the reason why i was condemned   125.07615208036088
if i did i should make you as wise as myself which it is not my intention to do   168.70118736058242
plague stifle you and your latin   118.24132129946364
well then we will go into paris   182.98397127641493
they had not long to wait   123.4088407781133
on reflection my dear du vallon it is a great honor for the comte de la fere and gives good reason to hope   106.75730108609596
no i am lost   51.08074687781473
both felt the high honor of such a favor from the pope   67.33472265253523
the captain gave his orders the helm was put up and the boat was soon sailing in the direction of the island   87.13495759387304
i mentioned your diamond then to my adversary who had likewise remarked it   106.70672976661191
as he departed danglars approached and said well it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his landing at porto ferrajo   139.59894022565845
no it was not dead   40.251616639162435
let us hear the means   34.28153722084953
suppose that all the stars had descended from the sky and mingled in a wild dance on the face of the earth   36.08376885405687
you may even say my lord replied athos who stickled for propriety   64.38923686916601
there the great number of inns puzzled them   140.27499687729343
but this fire   130.7158793044426
but the powder flashed in the pan and it did not go off   41.51161117022109
after the two friends had been chatting a few moments a servant from m   88.57993647662265
you are mistaken for i have made a vow never to return to africa   115.08458953424419
let us charge them answered the gascon   147.21723350316654
the count returned to a small drawing room on the first floor sat down and crossing his legs motioned to the young man to take a seat also   115.04656331774743
oh i am not afraid of thunder said the jeweller   165.55767027330037
such is the hospitality shown to a queen by the minister from whom a king demands it   105.80656354409783
but the precaution was needless she was in deep converse with her own thoughts   102.69594550197543
well albert inquired franz of his companion are you still disposed to go to the colosseum by the outer wall   46.551064250375646
the fact is said the young man that i should be exceedingly grieved to leave it   150.95111143388
it was somewhat difficult for he could not quit his flock   95.65883108945945
but consider d artagnan added he in a tone so solemn that it made the young man shudder consider that béthune is a city where the cardinal has given rendezvous to a woman who wherever she goes brings misery with her   148.64576511303946
but i am a good sailor   46.50561858522431
today he said with an effort today the man who holds the blade of justice must strike wherever there is guilt   133.47237634265923
this promise of an impotent old man was so strange that instead of being the result of the power of his will it might emanate from enfeebled organs   115.2055811290821
as for porthos i believe him to be eternal like god although less patient   128.95132710122104
yes and to the point   76.5816874456395
proceed sire i beg   151.9454444909649
no stay here and try to make barrois drink the rest of this glass of ether and water   79.79299298824638
said athos to his adversary   130.7753593575126
cried he to d artagnan do not kill him young man i beg of you   68.88469160517928
i do not know her name   117.23199365154318
how so general   240.93664472301685
at the same moment the faint report of a gun was heard   66.20431734398039
felton tied her two wrists together with his handkerchief and then with a cord over the handkerchief   126.1926502787119
during the daytime valentine s perceptions remained tolerably clear owing to the constant presence of m   126.74019392574448
twelve replied aramis   141.0983376854674
who then has so correctly informed you   120.81724553540913
athos came down   85.08190524547373
did you know her   65.09699766059175
mm   172.1871934355533
but i know you are brave and loyal gentlemen and that confidence may be placed in you   81.57974775732069
it is deeply engraved on my heart and after what you have just said i remember that only   122.62744945201109
mordaunt tried for a moment to read in the general s face if this was simply a useless question or whether he knew everything   103.28448323445829
bertuccio said he give fifty five thousand francs to monsieur   72.36911309276502
yes but on one condition that we begin by the coadjutor   73.03839620100933
then turning to athos he added i seem to miss something here   148.90988403260002
had any one but you been there i don t say d artagnan bowed   198.89269812296982
for the last time where are you going   89.98084788070638
returned the prince   98.00309505406179
but as there was nothing positively certain in this report the young warriors decided to continue their way toward bethune free on the road to diverge to the right and march to carvin if necessary   136.22676627965453
for this time i swear to you we shall act like powerful men who know their enemies   73.21932234634065
she then went out by the same door which she locked so that the duke found himself literally a prisoner   152.24876567339123
in these days the throne is too dangerous a place for me to wish him to retain it   166.8405024714367
though he was in his own element   94.63421188556248
where does he live   190.70250872020208
raoul sprang from his horse to which he left the charge of its own preservation and in three or four strokes was at the gentleman s side   130.66734993432854
i did not recognize the chevalier in armor sir   67.20551983720925
now as a half smile was sufficient to awaken the irascibility of the young man the effect produced upon him by this vociferous mirth may be easily imagined   40.47698768804024
and i say and proclaim it publicly that you were justified in revenging yourself on my father and i his son thank you for not using greater severity   69.8296414195704
and madame de saint méran   107.11433940618937
i had a brother an elder brother who was in the service of the emperor   125.0162299632216
compiègne that royal residence and fortified town is well furnished with authorities gendarmes and commissaries of police   95.44918436263238
she then slowly raised her head which had resumed its formidable expression of menace and defiance ran to the door to listen looked out of her window and returning to bury herself again in her large armchair she reflected   32.981710624611196
as to the key it had disappeared   205.23717375920864
to a certainty athos said aramis you were meant to be a general of the army   118.6275920910466
the people all took part against andrea and twenty thousand voices cried put him to death   18.216213687371592
a great effect upon d artagnan who recognized in her the lady of meung of calais and of dover whom his persecutor the man with the scar had saluted by the name of milady   97.49734306514843
but resumed athos i recur to my first proposal   171.64958418339123
come in exclaimed d artagnan   121.53437862110256
yes it s true   154.76721306136452
he bowed respectfully to the king who gave him a somewhat cavalier reception but a look from his mother reproved him for the hatred which from his infancy louis xiv   135.80237658001204
devil take the vain fellow said d artagnan   89.24883285929721
he pressed aramis s hand and went in search of porthos   188.22411861789826
we were speaking of a suitable habitation for the count of monte cristo   53.013514138166336
give it me said andrea and he read by the light of his carriage lamp you know where i live   79.18006007790473
no nonsense caderousse   130.91117139856382
porthos seeing this retwisted his mustache elongated his imperial a second time and began to make signals to a beautiful lady who was near the choir and who not only was a beautiful lady but still further no doubt a great lady for she had behind her a negro boy who had brought the cushion on which she knelt and a female servant who held the emblazoned bag in which was placed the book from which she read the mass   98.16463577778075
villequier said guitant   32.36037905001092
yes replied franz here i am and he in his turn left the caves   73.63244259017411
said the major   95.16502377378256
asked caderousse shuddering   69.66787771166693
mordaunt replied by trying his opponent s weapon with an amount of strength which the gascon was astonished to find in a form apparently so feeble   174.08864671573593
but there are four against you   161.9079751223657
what i have said i will do   98.5051709696771
replied porthos   110.02695547857567
i don t see why   148.37662608996783
for of course you know   104.32073197884318
where is the child   40.05986784148982
then striking his forehead he exclaimed oh   74.38176028575438
i have already told your excellency of an innkeeper from nîmes who had set up a little tavern on the road from bellegarde to beaucaire   67.61945204846597
which is a great chance replied planchet but we must not despair of the mercy of god   71.8562216882103
if i am victorious he will not marry valentine and if i die i am very sure valentine will not marry him   62.916136558443874
but with our four horses we may bring back our three friends if we should have the good fortune to find them living   132.99839631803417
let your majesty remember said tréville that monsieur athos is the musketeer who in the annoying duel which you are acquainted with had the misfortune to wound monsieur de cahusac so seriously   151.39608798018023
that is all i wished to know said the queen   177.35021049587172
on the contrary let us speak of it   119.80046487894404
the world is not wanting in attractions   138.62922512039785
the name of sinbad the sailor as may well be supposed awakened in him a world of recollections as had the name of the count of monte cristo on the previous evening   64.61987967130857
the same evening the grocer or grocers druggist or druggists come and say it was i who sold the arsenic to the gentleman   97.72444453234036
i must have wronged you in some way at marseilles   189.61870899324185
during this time edmond seated on his bed with his head in his hands tried to collect his scattered thoughts   83.54360959961126
it is understood is it not   134.82647780017194
maximilian uttered a cry of delight and springing forwards seized the hand extended towards him and imprinted on it a fervent and impassioned kiss   130.52890960980832
it will be time for you to perceive my motive when we have paid our visit to the coadjutor   103.20879296643938
but to a certainty it is not for having knowingly at least disobliged monsieur the cardinal   121.2833980680914
cried d artagnan yes   185.46446394277342
danglars immediately advanced towards the door and opened it   158.2413275463046
unfortunately i have no idea where they are   98.51521772815777
my friends retire   59.82066714305252
i promise you   93.68124246867572
and he showed the cardinal with his finger the four muskets piled near the drum on which were the cards and dice   165.85465720024902
what a devil of a face you have porthos   178.15553354672866
andrea spoke with perfect composure he had a cigar in his mouth and his hands in the pocket of his top coat   96.91029827698283
watch over him in my absence as much as you possibly can   158.85275827907802
thus if not actually happy yet the days these two unfortunates passed together went quickly   68.93137435774409
sensible   116.21513657814523
i was going to ask you if you had received any news of monsieur franz   152.30481255466293
i only speak that exact truth   161.33842873268912
he ran along the high road took the path he had before taken and reaching the ferry interrogated the boatman   94.5269369624841
a key was inserted in the lock of the first door and the creaking of hinges was audible   165.4365578559937
i had forgotten that england was an island and that you were the king of it   115.86605500711556
so you see we must do without this little superfluity   188.74846275282292
is she there grimaud   179.6672048121785
this burden almost as heavy as a world which i had raised and i had thought to bear to the end was too great for my strength and i was compelled to lay it down in the middle of my career   52.20697999524987
is he still amusing himself in italy   116.92743600171613
it is true also that as i did not then know his eminence if i had been able to dispense with the visit i should have been enchanted   85.17142077797247
have you the diamond   129.05167218787108
may we inquire what is this recipe   84.75261088520978

at intervals he listened to learn if the noise had not begun again and grew impatient at the prudence of the prisoner who did not guess he had been disturbed by a captive as anxious for liberty as himself   143.11386830193672
but after the searching look of the king he encountered the burning eyes of aramis   133.72958515787812

oh you do quite right monsieur   44.60268562408713
d artagnan grew pale and a convulsive trembling shook all his limbs   106.25826181196815

madame de chevreuse uttered a cry of surprise and looked at athos with an expression of astonishment that made the old musketeer smile   103.17996868680322
one instant sir said the man in a gown whom he addressed   69.53568748006963
why as for that i could only know what i was told respecting the merchandise with which the vessel was laden   65.59246789871938

returned the cardinal   24.924653697958277
and then immediately the eyes of porthos wandered anxiously   69.47323378812132
demanded the swiss stamping violently like a man who begins to be seriously angry   37.18762177447792
but i deny that it is so in the part of it inhabited by monsieur d artagnan for i can affirm sire if i can believe what he says that there does not exist a more devoted servant of your majesty or a more profound admirer of monsieur the cardinal   163.60288759654225

since that time monsieur nobody entered his chamber but his servant   74.87979927499529
i was not in voice   152.48339301097815
it is good advice said athos and if the king will do one of us the honor we shall be truly grateful to him   65.56692282715241

milady read in his eyes love   101.40502424651348
and now where are you going viscount   91.34523916324525
because i would not annoy my little benedetto   120.12220382432967
you whom i expected last you arrive at five minutes to ten when the time fixed was half past   162.76108996583756

i supported myself by a chair feeling that i was about to fall but this support was soon insufficient on account of my weak arms   95.13988141751571
sire said villefort the suddenness of this event must prove to your majesty that the issue is in the hands of providence   114.58597944340877
porthos was of the opinion that he should give him a good thrashing first   86.92601553886114
you count who are more than mortal will i am sure lead me to death by a pleasant path will you not   141.39686466187922
you are aware sir of the deplorable condition of my husband s father   112.9873184062944
i have already recorded sentence of death five or six times against the movers of political conspiracies and who can say how many daggers may be ready sharpened and only waiting a favorable opportunity to be buried in my heart   155.13480640087968

she has answered you   119.32494337580756
do you believe you have anything to do   99.38354637282076
and the baron pointed with a slow and accusing gesture to the left shoulder of milady which he almost touched with his finger   153.72615265377206
with his instinctive delicacy edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord and faria had been equally silent   189.17107189861923
the same evening andrea was incarcerated in the conciergerie   137.4538136316001
and truly to speak such words to me would be on the part of your majesty too great an ingratitude   158.54123715851827
i gave her my wealth i gave her my name   101.22656970755207
mazarin according to his custom was thinking much and saying little   56.401146625079434
in the most conspicuous part of the salon was another portrait   153.19919243777636
at this moment the neighing of a horse struck his ear coming through darkness and space   68.51455005946235
the appearance of the town denoted the greatest agitation   124.0532650433842
we say corroborated because the brigadier was too experienced to be convinced by a single proof   0.2509509456307626
and the consequence   82.20541837507301
morcerf   133.46005484043062
ah good then replied athos we will teach them these door breakers   151.04965047117054
now let me try on the dress of yonder chap   102.53429253604507
of what else do you imagine he would speak to me   54.292285358758235
great personages may have had a hand in what you have seen and if talked about the evil would only recoil upon us   122.33969067454525
no i did not say i was a stranger to you   10.218578266613818
isn t it reasonable   63.856974930179774
as for raoul he avoided the monk by the whole width of the road and passed him turning his head away in repulsion   102.5666719383756
the disappearance of mazarin was not as yet generally known   88.98643516533264
but before you leave france my dear father i hope you will put me in possession of the documents which will be necessary to prove my descent   38.58772584701876
the poor young woman could not possibly suspect what frightful cruelty was behind the rampart of that pure brow behind those brilliant eyes in which she read nothing but interest and compassion   146.75680956588076
and i am delighted to see that the present government have adopted this salutary principle with all its pristine vigor   148.47442754632578
at length a hand and an arm surpassingly beautiful in their form and whiteness glided through the tapestry   111.10878434251124
de villefort and his father exchanged looks   118.85614315611143
had surrounded himself this second or rather this first king of france became desirous that he too should have his guard   165.92214297057626
shall i assist you in repairing your negligence   175.22922403470346
my father said the young man bending his knee bless me   97.48175388441842
everywhere were swords pistols cuirasses and arquebuses and it was plain that as soon as his gout was better monsieur de bouillon would give a pretty tangle to the enemies of the parliament to unravel   94.70226729810611
asked anne of austria after a moment s silence   130.56136601920176
he almost believed in the crime of de wardes   169.7225415931674
it seems to me rather reassuring than otherwise   99.84348907525606
although the day had been fatiguing neither of them was inclined to sleep   128.37799430298696
no one has come out he replied   97.75539599323888
the officer entered a large fat man with an open physiognomy   106.8776197462118
i will swear to you by my soul s salvation my faith as a christian i have told everything to you as it occurred and as the recording angel will tell it to the ear of god at the day of the last judgment   170.4020576617022
the order is strict and must be put into execution this instant   31.959432651930683
said aramis hastening forward   84.2980561701896
thanks to the cares of mousqueton the exterior was far from announcing the distress of the interior   109.0575212842759
and he conducted them to mousqueton who freely distributed the trusses at the rate of a louis apiece   110.35593223886612
we have a second bed in the adjoining room   158.15789389344832

20115m carlini threw himself sobbing like a child into the arms of his mistress s father   170.17527428414243
happily he had time to reach a closet hidden behind tapestry in which he was secreted by an old woman together with his brother the bishop of meaux   172.71844379729913
i confess it openly   73.13177161095288
he gave no other name answered julie looking earnestly at the count than that at the end of his letter sinbad the sailor   97.33594453912809
nay i flatter myself that there can be no doubt of it replied the cavalier in the cloak   101.3982754654569
14 besides the rowers the boat contained only the women my father mother selim and myself   10.008157070397644
he inquired after the count with his usual familiarity and ascending lightly to the first story met him at the top of the stairs   86.8913898846559
ah it s all one said the host   129.57751204913325
de tréville a long history about the queen   92.4247168324617
but his lips moved without any sound leaving his mouth and making a powerful effort to control himself he sent back to his heart the words that were about to escape from his lips and went out   117.26907720514474
you know there s only one way of saying things so i went in and said my lord we were not the strongest party   30.307494032437106
mercédès has no fortune   150.17431174769163

on the evening before a battle one thinks of a thousand things forgotten till then   90.70633664843662

they killed six thousand angevins in sicily because they pronounced italian badly   120.56107668217408
he made a sign to ali not to lose sight of the man in the street and turned to the one in the dressing room   69.91776985272278
and to give more weight to his protestation caderousse advanced another step towards the abbé who remained motionless in his place as calm as ever and pursuing his interrogation   67.819611620422
monsieur de tréville is ill so my company can t do without me   149.35293843572362
not because i have the least desire to learn anything you may please to conceal from me but simply that if through your assistance i could distribute the legacy according to the wishes of the testator why so much the better that is all   191.13306435954632
but when that was done why did not his son come and throw himself into his arms   125.67261058358469
but i did not expect you   16.207776789491987
will our help come from you   49.97966777587394
said porthos almost burying his large feet in the sands   64.59331142656455
private misfortunes must never be allowed to interfere with business   122.40051410995348
i was very wrong my lord for in giving it to you i acted in opposition to my orders   35.268923940730716
30325m no she replied it is for my poor grandmother   161.2879997740756

porthos yielding to the pressure of the arm of the procurator s wife as a bark yields to the rudder arrived at the cloister st   155.57477051059843

the young girl raised her tearful eyes towards monte cristo as she said with touching earnestness whether we return to the east you mean to say my lord do you not   163.3970162379194
i believe he s swimming toward us   111.73511676554656

albert was punctual   127.70537480233972
you remain minister   97.70252644012986
the gate of the enclosure was shut   97.91506890779043
the fit lasted two hours   13.959872677919066
as soon as she saw him she seized his hand   120.75126601943802
but is this all that is known   65.69640004832746
oh god thou hast preserved my memory   114.3338895138436

the comte de la fere himself   113.00277163862293
then putting the 4 500 francs into the hands of the astonished dealer i proceeded to fulfil my intention of passing the night in riding in the champs élysées   113.2531562805936
cried richelieu   87.16034625353713
replied athos smiling   132.43424547956099
or at least he has not long been so for he was pacing up and down for more than two hours after he left the king and the sound of his footsteps has only ceased during the last ten minutes   102.53641981387935

i have pursued it for six years only   107.17345730321712

the hand of god caderousse continued to call piteously help reverend sir help   60.460036182430045

the valet then left the room   137.11464141857925
as for me i should have been incapable of it said château renaud with most significant coolness   89.51084252548793
at that instant the moon inquisitive perhaps like d artagnan came from behind a cloud and by her light d artagnan recognized the large blue eyes the golden hair and the classic head of the duchess de longueville   157.74057829531287
but the carriage and horses   128.95087565985776
a letter from the king perhaps   158.5090702676366
but that s more than dislike that s ingratitude   84.71284570032185
he had enough and set off without waiting for the rest   149.96807464256753
morrel s   84.46054877565244
go and perform your master s orders   106.1907225946544
tis true my lord answered la ramee that his pates are famous and his wine magnificent   97.79712854825453
he stated his scruples and the difficulties of the case   65.37817054547297
the whole body of servants arranged in a semi circle at a respectful distance looked on with humble curiosity   62.891047968827756
come hither monsieur   86.4884650972711
five minutes after andrea left the hotel completely disguised took a cabriolet and ordered the driver to take him to the cheval rouge at picpus   149.17035139389526
i am monsieur d artagnan a gascon gentleman serving in the king s musketeers   200.40844440666694
planchet said d artagnan to his domestic who just then insinuated his head through the half open door in order to catch some fragments of the conversation go down to my landlord monsieur bonacieux and ask him to send me half a dozen bottles of beaugency wine   60.97020236239322
well then signor aladdin replied the singular amphitryon you heard our repast announced will you now take the trouble to enter the dining room your humble servant going first to show the way   174.55852189813166
but hast thou nothing to say to thy friend planchet   127.49800668297162
and if we lay hands on them his eminence may be assured they will be reconducted to paris under a good escort   128.34193982079913
did he come to arrest me   93.86439127023111
it is not usual with us corrupted wretches of civilization to find gentlemen like yourself possessors as you are of immense fortune at least so it is said and i beg you to observe that i do not inquire i merely repeat   89.18211803135944
at two and twenty one calls every man one s friend   63.19772128837995
one day he stopped all at once and exclaimed ah if there were no sentinel   152.84227224403074
at which the cries of the multitude were renewed   90.14161487247533
and where was this letter written   169.84133353429695
then the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an instrument of god s justice   93.23429377472941
do you not know the race   92.54937286478798
in the lucern patch our readers must now allow us to transport them again to the enclosure surrounding m   128.4223901244427
there is in the world then one man who having the power to ask asks nothing   60.09428009711651
at length franz arrived at the word myself   114.92262532876369
the general has just blown his brains out replied monte cristo with great coolness   165.05758741654097
how much have we louise   26.578770981353856
when they opened the window they saw the poor lad lying senseless with his head split by a blow with a pitchfork   66.53716073686476
the landlord sent out for every description of garment as if he wanted to fit up his wardrobe   16.580514865808595
and to be free a prisoner has to pierce a wall detach bars cut through a floor all undertakings which a patient and strong man may accomplish but before which the feverish irritations of a woman must give way   160.12560267612233
we must be discreet with this sort of letters   128.19805324116072
every means had been employed in vain to restore the use of his limbs   183.69188507628257
that alters the case   90.03253052496677
monsieur said the young man saluting again and more profoundly monsieur le comte has pronounced your name before me as an example whenever he wished to speak of an intrepid and generous gentleman   158.07857044875078
then have a care i repeat for you seek to persuade me and if you succeed i should lose my reason for i should hope that i could again behold valentine   72.29125529569367
no my prince replied mazarin the third bed is intended for your highness   65.57361691741703
but he leaves his room he plays at tennis at the mall   220.09850734017556
good said comminges   83.5068588147823
and signor luigi vampa such was the name of the chief of these bandits would have scrupulously kept his word   85.85817483840843
i have seen the bastille   78.74687752399862
he drew near with his sweet smile and but for his paleness one might have thought him in his usual happy mood   79.21814274004143
it appears sir that this edmond dantès had procured tools or made them for they found a tunnel through which the prisoners held communication with one another   116.85802145021603
this is a gloomy introduction if i may judge from your pallor and shuddering morrel   131.9367833909651
but inquired dantès hesitating has this treasure no more legitimate possessor in the world than ourselves   73.07880438561384
villefort   71.68463205429504
it is a long time since that has happened   104.73404212348518
but to avoid risk put the pistols in the holsters   43.98662104360666
has he gone intending not to return   24.022695011383846
he not only gets used to his captivity but jokes about it   105.55282870683682
you are deceived morrel that woman she was dead   92.51939661625238
you shall know it now then said monte cristo listening   90.55966074544237
from the latter point it was easy to follow tracks on the snow   118.54685079389951
he used to weep he now laughs   171.2364105836678
are there any stories connected with this prison besides the one relating to the poisoning of mirabeau   140.51276087225074
what is that stupid fellow troubling himself about   111.63324455971599
and madame de villefort have just left this room have they not   122.13755198890459
and certainly my prospects of military preferment are most encouraging as well as certain   101.07017754579661
the most perfect tranquillity was restored and the vigilance of the custom house officers was redoubled and their strictness was increased at this time in consequence of the fair at beaucaire   123.15324058790013
the young priest was condemned to ten years of imprisonment and to be branded   84.47411205191203
you had never anything to complain of   112.13255517682812
go sir go   104.71615672590308
she became excessively pale leaned her beautiful hand upon a console which hand appeared then like one of wax and looking at the king with terror in her eyes she was unable to reply by a single syllable   135.57960380619858
without thinking what it is he calls it a crime   124.30338149438845
and now how are you feeling   86.65863166652984
there was only this blow wanting   71.63032359098324
thanks planchet thanks   94.74987906361716
my dear cousin   158.6218109857916
you have said that my son should live have you not   143.32251693857927
felton began to descend the ladder slowly step by step   103.43008873706145
she was my mother   148.65308929334154
on every occasion i have exposed my life to save those who were in danger and i have preserved lives in exchange for that i took away   159.51957874555
inquired the bandits with astonishment   112.16215637435717
4 beheaded   157.86274645512822
and that demand for his services on the part of mazarin seemed to him an auspicious sign   130.02527110850536
the smugglers dantès had not been a day on board before he had a very clear idea of the men with whom his lot had been cast   39.18592912999482
they were brought to him   119.73586176974572
it must be farther off than even that   134.80731059902664
you will not find her   193.18523670335148
my ship is ready and had you not come i must have set off without you for general cromwell expects my return impatiently   41.57649224383235
and you have doubtless brought all your papers with you   106.76624852101038
i wish my life to be free and open   21.947108535760236
i will expose all   169.16272015621698
you ll excuse me i know   132.61462163785416
then said mordaunt your honor gives me my liberty for to night   125.04927504896006
the trial chapter 87   57.147865501567274
twice you have pronounced that word   152.60106097037465
the queen stretched out her hand seized the ring pressed it convulsively to her lips and without being able to breathe a sigh to give vent to a sob she extended her arms became deadly pale and fell senseless in the arms of her attendants and her daughter   146.22198707758906
the care with which ali placed this cup on the table roused franz s curiosity   121.21739813997223
a hundred thousand francs   157.12996767503725
still said château renaud dr   125.54779195397866
de tréville confiding to him candidly the importance of his departure when the news was transmitted to him as well as to his three friends that the king was about to set out for paris with an escort of twenty musketeers and that they formed part of the escort   68.46450652588487
count de guiche said the prince it is a long time since you saw your father remain here with him   137.90318264535784
i am sure your majesty will not commit such an act of imprudence first because it would be useless and would produce the most disastrous results   39.27598365577114
grimaud is the man whom a friend has sent to second me in everything   17.36000695415568
i did not sleep well   152.64196814252347
don t you think monsieur that woods are like churches   138.664274396558
i will give instructions to everyone and you m   179.01549587840012
his talent   63.098366767000144
said mercédès coloring   127.87290935677571
but there is no occasion to divide the honors of my discovery with him   178.48173447875166
cromwell had sent him to mazarin   94.04721808986803
you have promised him that i shall live   83.57137869994651
he reached the instrument he had placed on the stand touched a spring and immediately a pale light just bright enough to render objects distinct was reflected on his hands and countenance   134.78978059295824
resumed morrel   80.65720118325467
choose for yourself in my stables the horse you like best   138.41652561228702
is it permissible   71.74863931945546
with these words he went stealthily to the door which he closed and by way of still greater precaution bolted and barred it as he was accustomed to do at night   175.17818376023726
yes that poor duchess   75.25002373097334
if your eminence would quote to me some one of these events in history said milady perhaps i should partake of your confidence as to the future   92.23036453324258
but i am not a foreigner sir said she with an accent as pure as ever was heard between portsmouth and manchester   118.91989873886297
you are a very odd man athos he replied to doubt me thus   113.76519599715095
he seemed like one of the ancient titans who uprooted the mountains to hurl against the father of the gods   172.973586196804
remember we are waiting for our turns   104.2459100114327
and all the nobility of france would demand an explanation of your disappearance   173.3950902699149
i have chosen the drawing room sir as our place of meeting in order to avoid the disagreeable impressions and influences of a banker s study   24.99385647493783
so then they drew up the indictments before the king was taken   121.97275368190904
oh you do not understand me   92.165494950269
go on then for i see i shall not get to the chamber this morning and i must make up for it   169.92387688859003
no said the count with an imperceptible smile of contempt for he had no wish to be seen in the young man s society no   75.39978237865702
the road selected was a continuation of the via sistina   157.2923504969412
morrel shuddered   42.70509165424873
it s a piece of good fortune sent from heaven said athos evidently much relieved   80.94159255778887
well then all is settled   58.291200798993856
let us send in our names and if he does not send us a suitable message we will leave him to his own affairs or those of france   42.117242171311915
grimaud trembled and stared at the dying man in a dull and leaden manner   89.44362067358034
the rochellais had at last taken possession of the bastion   52.31117609426866
well it has happened to me to do so in our blaisois forests and i remember that the first time i encountered one with its eyes fixed upon me curled up swinging its head and pointing its tongue i remained fixed pale and as though fascinated until the moment when the comte de la fere your father   153.18669313458776
the boat is waiting for us   87.17503939315623
morrel said he we were somewhere between cape blanc and cape boyador sailing with a fair breeze south south west after a week s calm when captain gaumard comes up to me i was at the helm i should tell you and says penelon what do you think of those clouds coming up over there   220.18361320406513
in fact he could say these two children of a cruel and persecuting king who have inherited the vices of their father which i alone could perceive in their juvenile propensities these two children are impediments in my way of promoting the happiness of the english people whose unhappiness they the children would infallibly have caused   153.1388753331161
they lost her   174.3104901168265
he talked for the pleasure of talking and for the pleasure of hearing himself talk   65.09979370992141
only i believed that monsieur had but one horse in the guard stables   80.05233477523403
they arrived at the appointed spot   93.92428509384864
and her style of beauty struck him more forcibly from its being totally different from that of the southern countries in which d artagnan had hitherto resided   83.69959795533808
i am brutal i not only allow it but boast of it   240.2491172627868
but he will not avow it   125.7072967962756
no but i have forgotten monsieur grimaud   155.16487357207507
grimaud was still the same and therefore he retained the entire confidence of his superior la ramee who now relied upon him more than he did upon himself for as we have said la ramee felt at the bottom of his heart a certain weakness for monsieur de beaufort   49.38564090577258
no longer living but by the strength of his genius and no longer maintaining the struggle with europe but by the eternal application of his thoughts but such as he really was at this period   118.39169748154671
sir replied anne with a degree of haughtiness which to certain persons became impertinence this is the reason that you trouble me in the midst of so many absorbing concerns   107.90516117431929
danglars would give double that sum to attain the same end   114.63323889927433
for he thought this death would cause the wedding to be postponed indefinitely   89.05609954286359
some one drew near   129.36501360073132
having thus spoken d artagnan cleared the ditch by the roadside and crossed the plain so as to wind around the village   80.12462656074541
how is monsieur bernajoux your esquire s relative   119.59404289286445
if on the contrary he appeared his noble countenance his brilliant eyes his amiability his polite attention even towards madame danglars soon dispelled every impression of fear   65.88801656308269
see planchet said he these gentlemen only say this out of affection for me but at bottom they all like you   150.7801491579752
eh monsieur eh   193.68823356509535
i can not swim and dared not throw myself into the river   106.65242755867165
order was re established in the hall except that a few people still moved about and whispered to one another   132.04536502984075
but now that the duke had escaped the concierge had seen fit to fasten the gate with a double lock   155.1175357532013
and the wretched family departed leaving a cloud of sadness hanging over the rest of the evening   86.39977273728722
i think it is a fine country said haydée but i see france as it really is because i look on it with the eyes of a woman   181.92325864589156
it was an entire army   106.20326304600034
it was dark but at eleven o clock the moon rose in the midst of the ocean whose every wave she silvered and then ascending high played in floods of pale light on the rocky hills of this second pelion   76.53608754593925
born in the neighborhood of arles she had shared in the beauty for which its women are proverbial   150.27591581176088
by heaven m   97.6882714777153
20356m adieu   116.16452150643629
the clock struck half past six and a lady was announced a friend of madame de villefort who came to dine with her   77.69861370733733
but it seems that it is intended to affect me personally   55.058622798210195
well captain he endeavored twice to get up and fell again twice   140.60246068670932
i like to hear him talk said athos   178.08332766095407
you did not let the executioner escape then   77.75825678501135
i would rather do so was edmond s reply than suffer the inexpressible agonies which the slightest movement causes me   51.559848772223674
for i am the only culprit edmond and if you owe revenge to anyone it is to me who had not fortitude to bear your absence and my solitude   104.53212037997858
some time after our rupture you wished to study music under the celebrated baritone who made such a successful appearance at the théâtre italien   75.91400476509217
the cable which tied the boat to the vessel was then seen plainly rising out of the sea   76.81589668892195
yes but calumny seized upon all those follies in which i took no part as you well know my lord   121.0872357164089
d artagnan fell at the feet of the cardinal   99.23015327448772
asked the jeweller   44.03887329764254
felton was then mistrusted   122.8772931864507
today i am at your service replied the count   78.1876864446213
multitudinously is good said château renaud   133.72811835667514
but if he should return   72.43281365268282
then turning to monte cristo he said prince cavalcanti is a charming young man is he not   87.72222345727405
respond to her call   118.62176746721993
i will aid you in many ways but without attaching you to my person   82.33972966798297
germain and asked the cardinal to order him an escort of only twenty musketeers   131.69963460137166
what a strange fellow you are said the jeweller taking the diamond from his hand   36.64856314137509
thank you said edmond with a friendly nod and the two lovers continued on their way as calm and joyous as if they were the very elect of heaven   90.95748656158277
so far i have appeared to answer his purpose   117.28208650306482
and what excuse did she give you for entering all alone   69.90603656629946
so long   163.17258416472063
he cared little for that mene mene tekel upharsin which appeared suddenly in letters of blood upon the wall   14.073269561291141
the man carried me to the foundling asylum where i was registered under the number 37   101.17467668451567
hold your tongue you fool   72.16451594752144
before a siege   153.10058833494756
the street was not able to contain the spectators who assembled from every direction   78.61528100771636
of fifty large sausages suspended from the joists scarcely ten remained   87.31029780214828
so soon as another is admitted into our secret an inquest will become necessary   110.45694592210172
mademoiselle eugénie said the maid retired to her apartment with mademoiselle d armilly   203.85704825442104
bassompierre took up his quarters on the north of the city between leu and dompierre   84.8049309787812
did edmond make you his heir   108.60422474393874
my grandfather intends leaving this house said she and barrois is looking out for suitable apartments for him in another   81.17252393186295
then rising he went out and meeting a servant on the stairs he asked where is m   95.6801817522006
it will suffice then to tell them that at the moment at which discouraged by so many fruitless investigations we were about to abandon our search we at length found guided by the counsels of our illustrious friend paulin paris a manuscript in folio endorsed 4772 or 4773 we do not recollect which having for title memoirs of the comte de la fère touching some events which passed in france toward the end of the reign of king louis xiii   102.68794789824203
what you say interests me to the greatest degree   180.2086327649602
we have served them to the best of our poor means and god will recompense the will forgive the want of power   2.016828250036994
though i might have known him by his skill and coolness in danger   82.53905423240619
the queen fixed her eyes upon the carriage they had left and seeing that it was empty she said but where is madame de longueville   119.99765828302738
said felton i can do but one thing which is to pity you if you prove to me you are a victim   112.33981781755305
d artagnan said porthos i must out with it at once for i can t keep to myself anything i have against you   157.7091651806186
by whom are you charged   33.35292558989529

all eyes were fixed on the door and i said beauchamp shared the general expectation and anxiety   2.117895687032515
and he presented to dantès a second leaf with fragments of lines written on it which edmond read as follows   122.39424995699584
cried the queen in the fullness of a broken heart   120.28257454504543

on approaching an outpost near the barriere des sergens the sentinel cried out who s there   39.87542403556294

and what do you believe   170.64828055926864
carriages horses guards and perhaps even the prisoner were about to be torn to shreds when all at once a voice well known to raoul was heard and suddenly a great sword glittered in the air   200.55165032386026
and then i have thought that considering three months lodging about which i have said nothing yes yes   127.21899032898925

nature according to her way had made no deviation in the path he had marked out for himself   135.6725559556576
no i think not for he ordered his breakfast at ten o clock   138.85099752731045
and now the ranks began to open   91.40625355697625
aramis related what had been agreed upon   129.07461501334956
i say i am entirely of porthos s opinion replied aramis   159.96498461668438
the comte de wardes of thursday and the d artagnan of today are the same person   11.397590984935036
listen to me said the countess and do not be so very headstrong   180.24139799478948
sir said madame de saint méran without using any circumlocution and as if fearing she had no time to lose you wrote to me concerning the marriage of this child   57.75761134871581
and another voice which like an echo repeated dead dead   30.601374231973935
unfortunately porthos knew nothing of the life of his silent companion but what revealed itself   109.72997059242039
gentlemen your hands   85.63866294078574
gervais replied d artagnan from behind which the rochellais annoyed our workmen   121.23718990755012
haydée was reclining upon soft downy cushions covered with blue satin spotted with silver   135.4145562866288
asked the postilion in italian   128.73152730267591
he preserved this opinion even after the feast with the remnants of which he repaired his own long abstinence   59.509948923580396
and you have no servant   90.04629861783806
at this moment the landlord came in   80.31381165762183
but what ails you   161.27034933210862
but athos rose likewise drew his sword and placed himself in the way   164.28918779396244
the duke was in the act of combing his beard which he had allowed to grow as well as his hair in order to reproach mazarin with his wretched appearance and condition   142.63019454969537
said a voice at the end of the gallery   169.6865285173219
where you can be relieved   94.39097034700342
where do you suffer   203.2661961149334

i will dare to at this moment the steps of lord de winter were heard   121.32373648043772
it was a very near thing but he is not dead   63.094443393779486
in truth that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no longer was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed as we have observed more appropriate to a phantom than a living creature from the corridors deserted by courtiers and courts crowded with guards from that spirit of bitter ridicule which arising from the streets below penetrated through the very casements of the room which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued against the minister   107.95697729626639
edmond listened and the sound became more and more distinct   112.83554717901946
the rabbit died   105.0017676882552
twenty minutes twenty tedious minutes passed thus then ten more and at last the clock struck the half hour   60.720475259067676
noirtier did not love his child and yet he sleeps   118.2934265379424
he fell asleep again and another vision appeared   14.377007281084431
he replied he replied that the death was not a natural one and must be attributed to what   175.42959003091883
but have the kindness to give the abbé busoni i told you he was not at home repeated the valet   97.4875704150495

i told you my opinion on that subject if you remember when we were at rome   106.49922213467693
however you will be better informed as to me and my possessions ere long   78.79552842209364
it appeared to her that the blast as it swept along disheveled her brow as it bowed the branches of the trees and bore away their leaves   81.51183958588261
certainly replied albert seeing that without my title i should be nothing   124.34551256213
almost before the key had turned in the lock and before the departing steps of the jailer had died away in the long corridor he had to traverse dantès whose restless anxiety concerning his friend left him no desire to touch the food brought him hurried back to the abbé s chamber and raising the stone by pressing his head against it was soon beside the sick man s couch   82.99809748573459
you have not played for a long time d artagnan   92.39107915965492
ambushes and violences multiplied around me but i resisted   185.97215328409555
then the queen with that wonderful strength which is the privilege of parents repressed her tears and motioned to de winter to change the subject   69.00676309882681
a new governor arrived   87.07891126415504
but our mazarin impossible   159.0642417131978
will you permit a grandson of henry iv   126.74197308712984
thought dantès   115.34199693024983
noirtier and valentine had given him leave to go twice a week and he was now availing himself of that permission   75.92712914636854
the duke however was not dead   72.47253846533084
but how do you mean to pass your time till i come back   87.95561512351195
do you require my services now   85.32257773117246
you had a new livery yesterday   84.32016531985434
yes i inherited this little property when i quitted the army as i told you   130.3805192458102
on their arrival at the castle they learned that buckingham and the king were hawking in the marshes two or three leagues away   226.76663493085854
the worthy sergeant had recognized the minister s secretary and the millionnaire and by way of paying extra attention to his noble neighbors promised to keep their places while they paid a visit to beauchamp   90.98518739298248
asked the fair traveler   63.159027096881346
are not your name your social position and your merit sufficient   59.80766584337485
caderousse followed him slowly to the threshold   100.18909748278512
vast was the crowd of visitors and inquiring friends who left their names at the residence of madame de villefort with the design of renewing their visit at the right moment of hearing from her lips all the interesting circumstances of this most romantic adventure   92.84528615855064
sir suddenly exclaimed the countess after their walk had continued ten minutes in silence is it true that you have seen so much travelled so far and suffered so deeply   128.27037426426403
it was danglars who wrote the denunciation with his left hand that his writing might not be recognized and fernand who put it in the post   187.7523468762624
torn and filthy garments covered his large bony limbs which seemed as though like those of a skeleton they would rattle as he walked   156.6551590041915
but you how did you get rid of yours   157.98769984467373
the cargo on board   89.57318191989228
all london was crowding to the doors of the house   145.04326764822338
d artagnan refused   193.72693747913974
from behind the door a human figure appeared but the girl was too familiar with such apparitions to be alarmed and therefore only stared hoping to recognize morrel   98.72434249747157
well what is the matter   98.38724321059061
the three friends looked at one another and laughed   112.8837169307503
his face was much agitated   132.82700906163078
it is the desire of vengeance and how desire molds a man   55.828915281619224
you say she is only a slave   119.31985444855461
well now you understand mother   115.91191051282672
d artagnan shuddered at the noise of the keys   112.92707273198829
yes a fine house standing alone between a courtyard and a garden you must know it   54.34594867673486
with such a vade mecum d artagnan was morally and physically an exact copy of the hero of cervantes to whom we so happily compared him when our duty of an historian placed us under the necessity of sketching his portrait   180.32363243094125
no my lord replied the gascon   176.2903825698674
the scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling clearness   57.10458966556902
aramis calmly drew his sword which he had carried between his teeth as he swam   126.73783705073687
and the musketeer narrated to his friend planchet s adventure   130.63002369810974
then a body which after rising of itself even to the waist above the sea turned gently on its back according to the caprice of the waves and floated   46.641967925858324
i have just made m   73.47177757328791
no i was drunk   83.113067499566
but i require three weeks preparation   110.5727308649118
then the door opened and he appeared   53.79155674414511
i do not understand you   91.76131882990929
wait my dear sir wait a moment   67.65706548242824
whereas brought up by the coadjutor for instance he would imbibe national principles and love his people   259.72628705920164
of former days my lord   53.36828287801393
we even joked very pleasantly if i remember rightly on the very probable contingency of your being charged by the cardinal with my arrest   108.3322199505188
he has such a short neck said she   132.29321605939398
the wounded man smiled sadly   155.42963496387227
rather say that you have a new love   167.75955804058705
oh nothing which was not right in the character of a creditor   174.68992791079836
it was a man who would answer for the offence whether trifling or serious   145.0628309978702
he therefore told him all   80.38360757611403
my lord replied the messenger i wish to speak to your eminence in secret   117.82984754435164
and where is auteuil   139.9564828160197
well when you receive the remaining 40 000 you shall give me a receipt in full   118.26210329668073
mademoiselle eugénie however merely returned a dissenting movement of the head while with a cold smile she directed the attention of her mother to an opposite box on the first circle in which sat the countess g and where morcerf had just made his appearance   79.42594319286871
we still remain four friends devoted to each other   104.0761439466047
i pardon you for the attempts upon my own person   213.33806115241413
are there any materials for an article in what you are going to tell us   126.32722616071999
but à propos resumed m   42.632946916725615
five or six minutes elapsed   57.60516745827096
you see i am dying   45.231682326794484
look i shall turn to the left so that the soldier will be at your right as soon as he mounts on the bench to talk to us   183.6739944604056
you will not leave me to perish   156.9511035140289
said raoul blushing   92.48649658578488
de monte cristo whom you just saw leaving here you did see him i think   80.94007256926321

do not speak so loud madame   85.01174485207832
i am going to fight because i am going to fight answered porthos reddening   56.56668245665887
a cup of chocolate   62.93244612372989
i am much attached to that horse athos   143.6972958049129
as to grimaud he received orders to place himself behind the four friends in order to reload their weapons   78.12052411713947
for their ransom   71.12778752013931
this will change the aspect of french affairs but i much fear it will do nothing for english even if it does not harm them   225.60065929533425
if this law were adopted sir said the procureur it would greatly simplify our legal codes and in that case the magistrates would not as you just observed have much to do   153.18438235161162
you are my son dantès exclaimed the old man   219.75674436652906
then aramis paler than before but subdued by these words snapped the serpent blade between his hands and then folding his arms stood trembling with rage   76.80981991521075
mousqueton heaved a deep sigh   160.84959015072974
madame de villefort could not drop the curtain which she held like a funeral pall over the head of valentine   146.6915045239015
i thought i had quite said groslow   49.65043163262577
said morrel shrugging his shoulders   143.03586458117513
the two gentlemen traveled by byways in order not to encounter the mazarinists scattered about the isle of france and also to escape the frondeurs who were in possession of normandy and who never failed to conduct captives to the duc de longueville in order that he might ascertain whether they were friends or foes   64.25361240171691
my lord there is time to draw back said d artagnan and your eminence is perfectly free   66.81791689783081
excuse my smiling when you speak of a sum i am in the habit of carrying in my pocket book or dressing case   12.802091369390581
the first person to attract the attention of dantès as he landed on the canebière was one of the crew belonging to the pharaon   120.70191735720616
i love most fondly i love madly i love as a man who would give his life blood to spare her a tear i love valentine de villefort who is being murdered at this moment   135.09455519780172
well then your government would do well to choose from the past something better than the things that i have noticed on your monuments and which have no heraldic meaning whatever   74.46215254317373
what matter if you are paid for it   187.1555471796165
but we owe something in this house   147.0115189631856
but for this precaution which it will be remembered the abbé had made to edmond the misfortune would have been still greater for their attempt to escape would have been detected and they would undoubtedly have been separated   181.1806775068834
the servants had just disappeared under the trees followed by the tutor and the young men were laughing and talking about a hundred yards off   51.61068144174115
i thought you would never come in   167.80991627486645
but of what   120.38594217513683
if you must have me descend to earth i submit   148.36221625584244
they are indeed exquisite he said   118.88441144932962
each of them had a ticket attached to it by which it might be recognized   96.6260996286466
ere the cardinal your predecessor sent our mother marie de medicis to die in exile she taught us that language   118.78107202068901
the person to whom i addressed my scruples asked me where your father had acquired his property   137.63640705125175
but if you have any consideration for your own life or that of those who love you do not speak a single word do not make a movement which may lead anyone to believe you have recognized her who exposes herself to everything for the sake of seeing you but for an instant   67.85073987979594
well you soon become tired of singing and you take a fancy to study diplomacy with the minister s secretary   92.77854630513295
precisely so   148.43379609707804
there was a stream close by and a bridge across it   80.85277754208327
grimaud always sees dark or light night as well as day answered mousqueton   134.52475437466182
he saw that these tracks tended toward the wall   209.37288267819187
and it was a wise man who said when in doubt keep out   134.07932777879478
those whom i am compelled to dismiss lose as a matter of course all participation in this money while their portion goes to the fund accumulating for those domestics who remain with me and among whom it will be divided at my death   111.57889749902805
all these old soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in the time of the emperor but which are not suffered now for the people here do not like soldiers of such disorderly conduct   121.09533368561468
don t try to understand it you will only lose your time   97.09507056996313
it was important that he should be informed of what was passing   65.15188071399588
for a fortnight i had been at that hotel during which period i had cured my valet de chambre of a fever and my landlord of the jaundice so that i really acquired a reputation as a skilful physician   136.28182794473747
at each shot morrel turned pale   20.73362637099258
he walked six or seven times round the place royale turning at every ten steps to look at the light in milady s apartment which was to be seen through the blinds   144.28972613364473
all the way along d artagnan had been consulting with himself whether he should place confidence in m   96.89594313517628
i shall never swim again replied faria   59.45563922326179
they are no doubt both curious and interesting   147.3672326356817

it is impossible said the procureur   140.2821793987078
gentlemen said albert germain informs me that breakfast is ready   157.40514248703778
he seized the inspector s hand   126.54262071331505
but terminating as it did with such a phrase the only one which could be caught at by the jokers anne turned around and directed a glance toward her favorites which announced that she delivered up the coadjutor to their tender mercies   157.0583846545768
do you agree with aramis   66.6497060583116
about ten feet from the spot where he and the stranger were the roof had given way leaving a large round opening through which might be seen the blue vault of heaven thickly studded with stars   132.70531251815112
good day dear d artagnan said aramis   165.96341428173713
somebody has disturbed him without doubt said d artagnan   79.73043928789208
ah cried benedetto his eyes sparkling with joy   65.02664645385545
and she flew to a little inlaid casket which stood upon the dressing table opened it with a feverish and trembling hand drew from it a small poniard with a golden haft and a sharp thin blade and then threw herself with a bound upon d artagnan   34.54648091193516
it is you who are not a woman muttered mazarin   119.38460233326511
and yet it is difficult to suppose such a resemblance should exist between two jewels   96.20261539677144
i fancy i begin to see my way murmured milady with a savage joy burying herself under the clothes to conceal from anybody who might be watching her this burst of inward satisfaction   88.79022124654793
and that the footsteps which were those of several persons stopped at the door   123.05909366060376
but really this is a most singular conversation for the carnival gentlemen   77.8449522364952

pardon me for having joined with your persecutors   116.80116824084375
to break my vow in behalf of the ex emperor   137.20667587924433

or will you allow me to show you several fine statues by thorwaldsen bartoloni and canova   97.95054509741253
now sir continued morrel in these days no one can disappear by violent means without some inquiries being made as to the cause of her disappearance even were she not a young beautiful and adorable creature like valentine   74.74074971591844
there is nothing in hand but a party of pleasure   148.47616576322596

give him to me   99.4146320422499
but quick as a bird she glided between his hands and when he wished to speak to her her finger placed upon her mouth with a little imperative gesture full of grace reminded him that he was under the command of a power which he must blindly obey and which forbade him even to make the slightest complaint   143.92600508998066
quite sir   67.07927482763421
all i seek is happiness   75.78494013908647

no not perfect was the count s reply   79.43287281739404
that does not concern me   201.58255995020716
richelieu looked steadfastly at the young man   104.18166645961358
a written examination attests it said the cardinal replying aloud to the mute interrogation of his majesty   119.9410814095207
i worked at night also replied faria   178.9163849877374
the jailer therefore only grumbled   182.97661987808573
arrived at the staircase it was still worse   64.0359047060739
cried d artagnan without a thesis   200.27318982152866
said he showing it   112.73382154636687
that night the question was secretly agitated and on the morrow the gray and black cloaks the patrols of armed shop people and the bands of mendicants reappeared   165.26076235000448
scarcely had he descended the first stair when a hand of iron seized him by the belt and stopped him   79.62406237615505
and by chance was there yesterday at the same time that i was and it was my duty to offer to conduct her to her carriage   107.79227481583436
you are inclining toward false doctrines my young friend   21.793695606029118
remember said milady seeing the stranger lay his hand on his sword the least delay may ruin everything   154.73356362793015
i will inquire said morrel   111.58495024043286
i buy those horses he said to the groom   43.883514098292736
the officer superintended all these details with the same calmness milady had constantly seen in him never pronouncing a word himself and making himself obeyed by a gesture of his hand or a sound of his whistle   115.5837381205504
at the other end silent scarcely visible and like a shadow was a sentinel who was walking up and down before a grotto which was only distinguishable because in that spot the darkness seemed more dense than elsewhere   123.8507712550914
well and why should not you be free too   151.35187255323166
said château renaud shuddering   186.16108166835528
cried the executioner i think i am dying   85.82694670642243
this frequently happened   123.44938787410977
he had tried victory by means of superhuman undertakings   82.4918449738377
d épinay is coming back to settle this affair at once beyond all possibility of revocation   162.01193254495612
he frowned and his cheeks were colored   72.86547691918605
indeed i think you understand them better since i am ignorant of what has become of a considerable portion of my fortune once very tolerable while i am sure madame that you know perfectly well   59.866924999696415
for here is the register of my birth signed by my father and his principal officers and that of my baptism my father having consented to my being brought up in my mother s faith this latter has been sealed by the grand primate of macedonia and epirus   176.26955366456858
well be it so then   132.0507257779833
villefort fell rather than seated himself   108.4509330518284
and you of me sir said louvieres   87.7937394987321
nobody by the faith of a gentleman   145.96059213930528
no replied bonacieux with a self sufficient air she is too superficial a woman   123.29647208022934
once on board we drop down the thames and in two hours are on the open sea   98.43229712883117
the other was an instrument that was all   183.8684255514606
and the cursed italian   99.35759114072926
monsieur de beaufort   171.8032410453441
the wretch had nothing to defend himself with but his discharged arquebus   172.73982515586135
said aramis truly you are a great man   78.80502512041443
it is now three and i am to speak   70.09075240021208
no one has seen d artagnan and porthos has not appeared   178.66207906468375
still as five o clock approached and the carriage was momentarily expected by the count the indication of more than common impatience and uneasiness might be observed in his manner   203.58785627335936
that you found me sad but resigned   172.24748286516132
i am called the count de guiche continued the young man   98.31866786404281
really you appear to be totally ignorant of the cause which brings me here   101.9745227222341
in five minutes it will be too late   88.40529383178148
he darted a preparatory glance at athos and aramis who slyly pushed their chairs a little back so as to leave themselves more space for action   91.49323268820622
but as we know d artagnan possessed with ambition to enter the musketeers had formed but few friendships among his comrades and he felt himself isolated and given up to his own reflections   69.97354098236644
gracious me   134.56894271462778
so saying he stretched out his hand but the other pretended not to see it and he let it drop again slowly by his side   108.14210919813357
yes that was the way it ended   177.84858214967102
ah you take it with that tone do you master gascon   82.43374547215036
the citizen took a paper from his pocket and presented it to d artagnan   98.4779312466875
a child s reason i repeat it continued mousqueton   90.1680944991661
how is king otho getting on   112.30579888631466
d artagnan and porthos   105.75943209644089
are you satisfied now   123.69086550093397
and he gave her a kiss at which the poor girl became as red as a cherry   125.55566627185671
my good my brave guitant whatsoever command i may give you in that language in french whatever i may order you to do will you not perform it   58.853017446304314
i do not suppose that you will all be quite so disinterested as monsieur de la fere replied the cardinal bowing to athos   154.8103905850464
on her left shoulder sparkled the diamond studs on a bow of the same color as the plumes and the petticoat   66.8757253987909

a large stone had served as a wedge   156.53193804380692
said valentine raising her eyes to heaven and sighing   119.95185777957488
many young men of palestrina frascati and pampinara had disappeared   219.97024052876998
martin with his garrison and threw a hundred men into a little fort called the fort of la prée   152.732504361849
it is likewise well situated neither too near paris nor too far from it   37.99431448798208
you know full well that my existence is bound up in yours that were i to lose you i would not outlive the hour of such crushing misery   47.34351834820691
dantès would have given ten years of his life in exchange for it   74.91674610882004
for my part said d artagnan i say this must come to an end   137.31357286204056
the presence of the two victims alarmed him   151.8167429987959
is that not true monsieur bonacieux   163.08320609847016
the duc de longueville gained the government of pont de l arche five hundred thousand francs for his wife and the honor of seeing her son held at the baptismal font by the young king and henrietta of england   157.02150018169368
tedesco   59.24441810291967
we must ask the comte de la fere the question   98.2006386441801
at this moment of mortal anguish the cold sweat came forth upon his brow a pang stronger than death clutched at his heart strings   162.09859172084322
caderousse and his wife looked eagerly at each other   146.06857263052794
then after a brief interval during which the honest shipowner turned his hat in his hands m   93.99359816483337
wait here to receive the troops   113.1017846469124
he addressed himself then to porthos to gain information respecting athos and aramis and to aramis in order to learn something of porthos   23.474835002830858
oh make haste and tell me then   146.79469772444293
he was the worst musketeer and the most unconvivial companion imaginable   170.4452773796377
ah this is not right   106.19331133261936
on the 10th or 12th he will be at lyons and on the 20th or 25th at paris   70.70067984081045
are you superhuman   101.08838657350344
who are these gentleman   129.4568163149161
d artagnan imagined that on arriving in town the duke would slacken his pace but it was not so   102.28617859690873
and why should i regret what gives you pleasure   76.67327371163152
yes said valentine he was very fond of me   79.52334570948659
whereas my own country which i can only judge of from the impression produced on my childish mind always seems enveloped in a vague atmosphere which is luminous or otherwise according as my remembrances of it are sad or joyous   61.86997267909079
i my lord   74.06160440012744
one of her conditions was that she should come and see me twice a week   115.27928402030544
the secret has been well kept   92.3998166155289
he gave me this paper   104.61342074219856
i m beginning to feel queer   200.7636731596014
and in fact it was that unfortunate scotchman parry s brother you know on whom groslow amused himself by trying his strength   84.22249818164339
the movement was executed in silence and with precision   92.82296860203088
it was at perugia on corpus christi day in the garden of the hôtel des postes when chance brought us together   118.39523644729752
all was dark   125.23828646326741
yes i recognized mademoiselle danglars   165.22641787292073
but athos only replied to this proposal by shrugging his shoulders   113.6446611782562
at this moment steps were heard in the ante room and without any announcement the marechal de la meilleraie appeared at the door   40.67904077672402
the stranger fancied he heard footsteps on the stairs   188.96020714977254
in fact it seems to me so great an honor for a prisoner that i think monsieur de comminges must be mistaken   99.75310098754464
but this promise was very vague and did not at all reassure d artagnan   84.27272532387133
i have none to settle on her   101.98010112203204
it was as a prey to this hallucination that d artagnan traveled at whatever pace his horse pleased the six or eight leagues that separated chantilly from crèvecœur without his being able to remember on his arrival in the village any of the things he had passed or met with on the road   129.6569260300497
noirtier answered only by a look which made villefort s blood run cold   78.18979751386577
i descended into the arms of the archers   68.71719870632555
30171m yes i do want a notary motioned the old man shutting his eyes with a look of defiance which seemed to say and i should like to see the person who dares to refuse my request   142.64058181199823
but that relatively to all i have learned you have yet a great deal to learn   31.562960180383328
marseilles is filled with half pay officers who are daily under one frivolous pretext or other getting up quarrels with the royalists   61.743962152801345
then drawing near to ali he whispered remain here concealed in the dark and whatever noise you hear whatever passes only come in or show yourself if i call you   120.87892537534977
a singular commission   68.39373024252785
it was you who in love with de wardes and thinking to pass the night with him opened the door to monsieur d artagnan   51.231065246578964
communication being closed by the war i was in want of everything   222.13395984912557
only to think of it makes my flesh crawl   149.91552323066958
a mousetrap in the seventeenth century the invention of the mousetrap does not date from our days   129.0718399648951
good evening madame said the banker   147.99974666753667
athos porthos and aramis instantly drew near one another while jussac drew up his soldiers   83.54595856468492
ingrate that you are   118.30757885218534
revolt   93.49867016275022
in five minutes the party entered the courtyard and d artagnan led the prisoner up the great staircase and across the corridor and ante chamber   93.55875461863673
well should he be arrested do they think they will arrest him   82.33267756690161
what must be done then   90.15730816012214
ah you frighten me   114.83383638395662
alas do you love nothing else in me   128.03159212859947
certain replied grimaud   128.38803338758055
inquired madame de villefort   92.6287445878362
what does that imply   109.46559804688539
but how did you become concerned in this villainous affair   145.86176051509227
inquired mercédès evidently attaching great importance to this question   50.83781983159367
no monsieur for on the contrary i am desired to preserve the profoundest mystery   86.49607507770308
morrel and i shall say that he is a man honorable to the last degree and who has up to this time fulfilled every engagement with scrupulous punctuality   107.88431738311785
oh pardieu less than nothing said aramis   109.91066645228673
at this moment a fresh visitor entered and according to custom franz gave up his seat to him   161.74066423795068
d artagnan on his side went up to the landlady praised her wine which was a horrible production from the country of montreuil and heard from her that there were only two houses of importance in the village   120.23487534158906
there now   160.14492107312418
give me therefore one more day before i invite you   149.9529716515635
if you want another uniform and sword you must play the same trick over again   83.43858306300382
he has not one that is more expeditious   87.7012063164647
i am mad for her   156.15548841005472
they must die die all together killed at one stroke by the thunder of men in default of god s   203.1156007363949

i must again excuse myself m   153.97859274088222
tomorrow perchance it will be our turn   72.72211826578615
dear good renée whispered villefort as he gazed with unutterable tenderness on the lovely speaker   158.25956548344703
but as to free will aramis   122.58409549598674
but for some time the imperial police who at this period quite contrary to what napoleon desired so soon as he had a son born to him wished for a partition of provinces had their eyes on me   158.1077424867634
repeated caderousse becoming excited and eager   72.21480834952865
but replied franz this ambrosia no doubt in passing through mortal hands has lost its heavenly appellation and assumed a human name   126.87346462449896
the man in the mantle had kept his promise to the transteverin and there could now be no doubt that he was the count   103.03547184233337
if you do not want me at leghorn you can leave me there and i will pay you out of the first wages i get for my food and the clothes you lend me   127.31124162803049
the young woman continued to advance   112.22336207103552
chapter i   156.64745054595429
or else whatever may be my repugnance to soiling my sword a second time with the blood of a wretch like you i swear by my faith as an honest man and at these words d artagnan made so fierce a gesture that the wounded man sprang up   114.7770929785038
then let s count our money and divide it   203.66850539726548
now inform me what you have discovered concerning him and the conspiracy   102.00209428481902
no it would delay me and i need the fatigue you warn me of   127.1962898852934

coquenard had eaten his soup the black feet of the fowl and the only mutton bone on which there was the least appearance of meat   156.0252382238108
but after all i ought not to blame you for the misconduct of your horses more especially as it procured me the pleasure of an introduction to the count of monte cristo and certainly that illustrious personage apart from the millions he is said to be so very anxious to dispose of seemed to me one of those curiously interesting problems i for one delight in solving at any risk even if it were to necessitate another drive to the bois behind your horses   179.0672543440711
that can not be sire said the earl   120.76477316178628
there was indeed reason to retreat to be alarmed and to scream   86.88242611195142
count he said i swear to you my soul is no longer my own   162.38228268599596
well reveal your secret to him and ask him whether however important however valuable however terrible it may be you may not confide it to me   111.7608175086928
he smiled kindly on the prisoner for he was an excellent man and had taken a great liking for the captive prince   111.81506197884977
de tréville was praised to the highest note by these men who adored him and who ruffians as they were trembled before him like scholars before their master obedient to his least word and ready to sacrifice themselves to wash out the smallest insult   99.36401545078378
danglars astonished opened the door   102.29992749955105
when i wished to retire into a convent you remember how angry you were with me   98.89019049618817

porthos had in fact been involved in a dispute with the bishop of noyon in regard to the pierrefonds property which adjoined his own and weary at length of a legal controversy which was beyond his comprehension he put an end to it by purchasing pierrefonds and added that name to his others   73.60067395166546

then casting a glance on the handsome young man who was scarcely twenty five years of age and whom he was leaving in his gore deprived of sense and perhaps dead he gave a sigh for that unaccountable destiny which leads men to destroy each other for the interests of people who are strangers to them and who often do not even know that they exist   98.46313418527491
beauchamp repeated the name to himself as though he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright and then gave orders for him to be admitted   205.10244564067

the gate groaned on its hinges and d artagnan seeing the way clear whipped his horses who started at a canter and five minutes later they had rejoined the cardinal   185.66825991320266
let us strive i beseech you let us strive to be cheerful   94.46395960319003
as long as he was in the city planchet kept at the respectful distance he had imposed upon himself   175.51080462417139
or does your stomach feel light and comfortable eh   81.11106983856295
first you break your jug then you make me break your plate   103.31729391605488
my dear friend general cromwell has sent monsieur mordaunt to fetch me   61.23705885319845
her majesty is asleep and you must set off directly replied mazarin   160.0732152378564
my mother applied her eye to the crack between the boards   130.65070022188874
why monsieur very ill indeed   136.11896144869738
she has the most beautiful light hair imaginable   174.93913608247564
those were good old days   92.0339332252294
get over it and in three leaps you will be on the road and free   120.26682998430549
has anyone brought a letter for me   55.83805693185021
the curate astonished at his quickness and intelligence made him a present of pens paper and a penknife   120.51668600302057
but said he first allow me to embrace you as your daughter did just now   121.30724585149574
and what has became of him   133.82450025226882
he leaped over the corpse as if it had been a burning brazier   70.18744903594967
this was all that m   113.93833484535688
monte cristo was at home   6.933464423826308
the sweetness of your voice covers the harshness of your words   157.81458038549115
replied dantès i am not proud but i am happy and happiness blinds i think more than pride   77.5582278914895
valentine who for the last hour had been suffering from the fever which returned nightly incapable of controlling her ideas was forced to yield to the excitement which exhausted itself in producing and reproducing a succession and recurrence of the same fancies and images   52.684018981233194
but what does not change or changes for the better is wine   79.22177894276678
then when he raised it again he was struck by the presence of a man who was standing at the open door and was gazing at him with a compassionate air   107.83326643987469
as our fugitives approached the house they found the ground cut up as if a considerable body of horsemen had preceded them   111.64674629480808
at sight of him madame de villefort uttered an expression of pleasure and holding the child still closer towards her she said edward dearest do you see that good man   53.1093771578782
he has just left me   56.59382628614537
the prisoner did not wish to lose time   148.70759570594004
during this time olivain had finished his bottle and eaten his pie   87.70945253740945
de villefort that general quesnel whom they believed attached to the usurper but who was really entirely devoted to me has perished the victim of a bonapartist ambush   194.4605334162402
said haydée kissing the count s hand and i am very fortunate in belonging to such a master   88.31365756753502
and while saying these words she absolutely devoured her by her looks   76.85186203657472
cried edmond blushing deeply   114.67070284456322
ma foi he has an open look about him that pleases me in spite of the singular remark he has made about me   146.15963387342927
sire replied tréville without lowering his voice in the least either order my musketeer to be restored to me or let him be tried   158.56966069797002
sir those amusements are allowed   87.11855538326999
you were one of the four grooms   137.38756001581928
but i am not yet ready to receive it   117.45934124409412
by accustoming her by degrees yes yes yes said noirtier delighted to be understood   96.82992094003694
but without doubt m   149.0998755362033
for it is fit you should know monsieur d artagnan that i have received heavy and serious complaints against you   93.90854267004258
an officer was placing two soldiers at the door of each drawing room and was advancing towards danglars preceded by a commissary of police girded with his scarf   104.03330158499028
have you any friend whose clock is too slow   56.64797182680664
i can see in the dark   205.29186050069706
milady gazed with all the power of her attention   80.20550237734687
dismiss your lackey   73.97518790530708
mordaunt was startled   122.00231410904642
policar morrel who served under the other government and who does not altogether conceal what he thinks on the subject you are strongly suspected of regretting the abdication of napoleon   149.2547140003413
the fact was nobody had observed a horse entered by the name of vampa or that of a jockey styled job when at the last moment a splendid roan mounted by a jockey about as big as your fist presented themselves at the starting post   122.7807703494233
but i hear beauchamp in the next room   106.14245133068887
either help me to gain the nearest village or swear to me on your salvation that you will send me the first monk the first curé the first priest you may meet   69.4317941908359
five or six thousand men   69.67186946591826
what is he looking at   66.62071617429183
villefort understood the king s intent   51.65630360038517
we have received with the information all the requisite proofs and we are quite sure m   167.15721105642916
but in coming too early i should be afraid of awakening your majesty   42.978169317612995
one day when benedetto was about five or six our neighbor wasilio who according to the custom of the country never locked up his purse or his valuables for as your excellency knows there are no thieves in corsica complained that he had lost a louis out of his purse   170.67630583357067
from that time d artagnan had been cautious with respect to handkerchiefs with arms on them and he therefore placed in the pocket of mme   127.69704255743082
the poniard was pointed at the sixth rib and buried up to the hilt in his body   78.80756471862847
for when crime enters a dwelling it is like death it does not come alone   140.06588519700495
you have eight days to return in all sixteen days   170.45082554091644
the brother of louis xvi   4.493009962400123
but you were ill and illness renders the head weak therefore you may be excused   124.60261124511453
all that which a man wounded in his self love could let fall in the shape of imprecations and reproaches upon the head of a woman porthos let fall upon the bowed head of the procurator s wife   123.47612796740776
no my friend said athos you must leave us   173.54326964068812
the musketeers saluted bicarat with their swords and returned them to their sheaths   130.8607366942151
do you know in what crime you are to day engaged   194.25936915859108
but let us walk   118.36164297090895
have my valise carried to the muid d amour rue des bourdonnais   87.38049042407393
but he has discovered a thousand means of taking it away and the devil has somewhat aided him   67.9999507668588
villefort smiled within himself for he felt his increased importance   152.35681531109043
and they wish either to remove her from her mistress or to intimidate her in order to obtain her majesty s secrets or to seduce her and make use of her as a spy   150.1624649792232
she had met fernand at the corner of the rue de la loge   102.57411555229254
the gigantic bellows the monstrous extinguishers the superhuman fans   182.0573987718838
his fine eyes no longer surrounded by that dark line which nights of dissipation pencil too infallibly seemed larger more liquid than ever   150.99753875093958
the abbé burst into a fit of laughter while dantès gazed on him in utter astonishment   5.209575678120828
and as we are prevented from going down there we are forced to refuse food and drink to the travelers who come to the house   28.082508471986543
and morcerf inclined his head towards the door through which sounds seemed to issue resembling those of a guitar   139.36521955039012
while la carconte displayed the charming fashion prevalent among the women of arles a mode of attire borrowed equally from greece and arabia   115.29992920888422
a ninny indeed   101.2658749656538
a benefit reproached is an offense committed   55.073158323931544
instead of making compliments to each other let us explain our conduct to each other like men of right and honest hearts   19.739116831288797
the cardinal who sometimes became weary of the king granted this leave of absence with great pleasure to his royal lieutenant who promised to return about the fifteenth of september   177.87967500841472
mademoiselle cried valentine   127.19444445863262
40152m as the last stroke died away the count thought he heard a slight noise in the dressing room   178.55167702439013
a minute afterwards the blinds were thrown open and through the jessamine and clematis that overhung the window one could see the garden ornamented with lanterns and the supper laid under the tent   95.64323565614264
he cast a passing glance at porthos and beheld this triumphant look   166.43815079182454
tomorrow if you will i will hear your narrative   67.39901301667194
they must be enemies   175.1781969038094
he was conscious that he passed through a door and that the door closed behind him   48.70577948646053
no objection was raised and the infant was given up to her   10.363663768717032
if from hatred watch your enemies   147.69229553467846
well let us as you say go and ask a dinner from the master of that house   201.6899296619353
yes said the baron assassinated   106.06115234530664
did you not see that at that name the young man stopped   10.623260282032149
you will see the count again   158.98859114677367
and what did monsieur d artagnan reply   140.7028069075627
my dear count we have only just begun   152.40710218621865
the cardinal threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire   138.13304038138395
demanded aramis   151.18836291965457
then turning his eyes from milady to the paper he read order to conduct the name is blank interrupted lord de winter   79.41944925921334
a double line of carbineers placed on each side of the door of the church reached to the scaffold and formed a circle around it leaving a path about ten feet wide and around the guillotine a space of nearly a hundred feet   141.29059010817997
upon which the queen had pressed the royal child to her heart whose haughty and unruly sentiments were in such harmony with her own   151.1502943316379
we are here   48.91243213681616
eugénie   189.40290880991222
putting on his cloak and gloves   94.73813158624918
remounted the throne   57.32528308941701
there said the king that consoles me   101.46128509214762
morrel smiled and shook his head   126.77168878537677
but he trusts you will excuse him as very important business calls him to malaga   100.86408775397092
d artagnan i have always loved you as my son   115.1350185182564
oh bid him enter   67.17842936499153
then the two wings of the window facing the square had been thrown open and the people had seen silently advancing from the interior of the vast chamber first a masked man who carrying an axe in his hand was recognized as the executioner   186.3218749241987
some gendarme   2.31500412790831
come now you don t really wish it   122.39823626688566
we live in times when there is much to which we must submit   73.85073354507011
it was the only letter you had   168.76882874375593
all that evening nothing was spoken of but the foresight of danglars who had sold his shares and of the luck of the stock jobber who only lost five hundred thousand francs by such a blow   103.24965114932716
parry knew this room as he had often been to see me when the king was at newcastle   174.68644689984936
the cardinal spada buried no treasure here   125.5746335461923
i placed myself in ambuscade with my sixty men   91.09952598425393
tell me i entreat   100.42160894883698
i have just made a little excursion to the borromean islands18   138.09351106346912
aramis stooped to kiss the king s hand but charles clasped his and pressed it to his heart   132.5210684754869
he perfectly understood them and undertook to procure for me a man s passport and two days after i received this to which i have added with my own hand travelling with his sister   101.70995988995872
a little troop of men on horseback were waiting on the edge of the stream ready to embark   92.15429323101866
i wish to see valentine   99.58520825074247
the marquise de rambouillet sends him his tisanes   91.66181640553253
yet conscience remains remarked madame de villefort in an agitated voice and with a stifled sigh   128.6950171123272
yes my friend returned the count   91.16504616488865
come you do not flatter him   78.69508070989751
and do you think we have nothing to fear if we land   103.29229533323316
milady is fair you say   170.5353795557503
i thank you sir   55.37941040234112
this time the marshal charged but he was welcomed by musket shots while stones fell like hail from all the windows   178.20718503416532
the perspiration poured forth upon the young man s brow and he felt as if he should faint   144.16404426398228
said franz inquiringly   146.7837426163229
you talk very comfortably a hundred and eighty leagues   131.24411833158376
rinse the glasses said grimaud   30.495938140189523
mordaunt therefore raised the canvas and saw cromwell seated before a table his head buried in his hands his back being turned   117.60488125036674
he approached just as the brigand was refreshing himself with a mouthful of brandy which owing to the leathern bottle containing it sent forth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to danglars   125.20374183810706
i tell it   111.71017724885148
how do you know it is the doctor   133.75771972393116
my brother s servant who comes to fetch me is told how to proceed   72.03910695763338
the woman who was here the woman with the embroidered handkerchief   151.38759025004143
my king said aramis they well may raise a scaffold but they can not make an executioner   173.9837047484016
feverish and excited i rang at the door   133.4441513580824
for monsieur athos has the right to kill me first which must much diminish the face value of your bill monsieur porthos and render yours almost null monsieur aramis   126.41096538913864
as the inquisition rarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and their flesh lacerated by torture so madness is always concealed in its cell from whence should it depart it is conveyed to some gloomy hospital where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the mutilated being the jailer delivers to him   88.66268022688978
as many thousands as you give me hundreds   178.85527524576142
bonacieux became livid   103.39885697462167
it seems to me that you are in more danger riding than on foot   123.04154964117934
yes he has not much to complain of   114.42454115674997
now monsieur he said to raoul will you give me the letter you have brought   88.40559694746621
besides the casket is the more precious from being all that is left to me   151.97284047685824
and i i swear to you before god madame said d artagnan that if i am taken while accomplishing the orders you give me i will die sooner than do anything that may compromise anyone   196.61597963961714
i gave it away in a night of love as it has been given to you   108.04921508693232
because it could have been said that i had had him condemned for the sake of justice and had let him escape out of pity   155.09425486431604
what rank did he hold on board   14.142279239657682
it was offered with good will said dantès   143.7102703100702
you were recommended to monsieur de tréville were you not   58.6675262913269
and who was the winner   103.0389365273656
to the champs élysées said the general   67.96638797453788
the morrel family chapter 51   39.00120518226001
planchet saluted in the manner of one accustomed to fine houses   112.22052198951874
why then cried milady with an incredible tone of truthfulness you are not his accomplice   94.83759551797624
so that the two ends came out of the sockets of stone in which for thirty years they had been fixed   231.065436561014
but why did we not breakfast at the parpaillot   115.82064645184397
two or three chairs were thrown down as if there had been a struggle   164.17987092893284
the man preserved profound silence and remained perfectly motionless   137.4413514274487
at this moment as if in reply to his words a man lying on a coil of cables rose and advanced a few steps toward him   118.5872490512726
but let me be properly acquainted with the subject   207.63943368437654
my god my god my god   33.05529441477067
the child went directly to him without kissing his mother   186.79450208045836
this treasure will be lost   110.66857990173692
and porthos turning on his heel made a step to retire   161.36634546563945
eugénie became uneasy   57.831926928530606
the englishman is overflowing with pistoles   89.0992834666353
and as during three years that he had travelled all over italy a similar piece of good fortune had never fallen to his share franz was by no means sorry to learn how to act on such an occasion   104.9802870526729
exclaimed everyone   127.5823483697019
you know that very well as i gave my order to saddle my horse   145.79968362565975
you must know something about it   154.4212646781198
and yet the fist did not descend upon any jaw nor did the sword issue from its scabbard   202.46902104749518
with one of the clamps of my bedstead   59.454510457660206
and they both entered m   87.17760987883464
avail yourself of it   106.84093677032934
and villefort s father extended his hand to the bell rope to summon the servant whom his son had not called   100.96541681419487
nothing was yet to be seen only they heard the galloping draw nearer   101.07386964104293
in one respect you are right for i am ready to quarrel with everyone today   75.89555821304084
bonacieux the door of which doubtless acted upon by a spring closed after him   98.66659237842153
explain yourself my lord i am listening   105.65136448476052
he should be reverenced as the author of our being and as a master whom we ought to obey   75.44655494002986
milady in the course of the conversation twice or thrice bit her lips   164.9459907130146
come said d artagnan all this leads to nothing   140.0212680956708
peccato   42.0836894999686
i was much more really so two hours ago   89.19866952093082
besides he had another strange fancy which was always to believe that the causes of his sadness created the gaiety of others   66.98341144835726
he returned to mercédès with tears in his eyes and heaving breast and without uttering a word he gave her the letter   65.42695591551222
d artagnan my friend prove to this young serpent that thou art not only stronger but more subtle than he is   141.00345150513758
so it was with monsieur d artagnan this stranger meant to quarrel   101.99729383283736
faria bent on him his penetrating eye   148.1037127563737
and now demanded the count are all the forms complied with   160.418934898064
restore my brother to peace and happiness whispered julie to monte cristo   117.16375618183976
they are at the door harnessed to the carriage as your excellency desired   204.8797348161578
for hardly will the people of paris have revolted before we shall have a score of princes begging to lead them   102.37861408933092
call the prince   91.05841177033422
emmanuel would tear the weapon from my hand and alarm the house with his cries   61.27368887898993
ejaculated the priest   93.00222759773058
bonacieux the one he had just picked up   114.36999280468598
perhaps he can not reconcile himself to the french style of living and might prefer something else   117.71245737956966
yours will be returned to you tomorrow   143.59001728844413
he alone would have any influence with them   170.958542232678
please your honors said the host a person in a great hurry wishes to speak to one of you   131.85762249595768
yes but i got down to defend monsieur de comminges and my horse was taken away   94.52930896650454
do you see it   133.3381781583144
i have met him several times at florence bologna and lucca and he has now communicated to me the fact of his arrival in paris   192.67374861355145

he could no longer cherish any doubt that the cardinal had been carried off by the three prisoners since the prisoners had disappeared at the same time   104.97343014881235
monte cristo went to the window and saw them crossing the street arm in arm   200.25317654739968

mercédès courtesied gravely and said that is not my name and in my country it bodes ill fortune they say to call a young girl by the name of her betrothed before he becomes her husband   125.32290680027384

albert laughed   128.9328786309875
after a moment s mournful silence his heart overflowed and he gave way to a flood of tears   79.02725861421689
for the rest he was dumb blind and deaf and of unimpeachable fidelity   104.21056892972668
that may be my lord   172.02332446839813

so much the worse at least for the queen for to day she has need of the same courage and the same devotion   112.28001386013504
but the poor wife who had reckoned on her husband and who in that hope had answered for him to the queen did not tremble the less both at the danger into which she had nearly cast herself and at the helpless state to which she was reduced   132.63256515331372
she was the widow of the marquis de castellane when she married de ganges and having the misfortune to excite the enmity of her new brothers in law was forced by them to take poison   182.13390270347077

andrea scowled   169.77863860620096
then should anything appear to merit a more minute examination albert de morcerf could follow up his researches by means of a small gate similar to that close to the concierge s door and which merits a particular description   23.290882605477037

repeated aramis and porthos   74.30793231259307
thou hast no confidence in me   137.00288073658345
d artagnan suggested that he should send word to his wife so that she might not be anxious about him but planchet replied with much sagacity that he was very sure his wife would not die of anxiety through not knowing where he was while he planchet remembering her incontinence of tongue would die of anxiety if she did know   78.9825475105882
when mazarin ceased speaking he said to porthos in a low tone never tell mazarin that i understand spanish or i am a lost man and you are also   176.3606523748928
at this demand d artagnan gave his name very modestly emphasized the title of compatriot and begged the servant who had put the question to him to request a moment s audience of m   94.01063346218028

yes sire and one wounded man   107.129678094275
the two friends exchanged a simple inclination of the head and aramis put his finger to his hat as if to bow athos alone comprehending by that signal that he had some project in his head   120.4324416764841
in two days and by using up two or three horses that s nothing   133.83083410827828

i don t know any pleasanter sight on earth than a well covered table   198.78929272873177
and peppino placed his pan on the ground so that the steam rose directly under the nostrils of danglars   58.98317430679563
why how came you to be so well acquainted with all this   74.78895908655322

these words had been pronounced with such enthusiasm and evident truth that every eye was fixed on the count s forehead and he himself passed his hand across it as if he felt ali s blood still lingering there   129.4884250628373
athos made the sign of the cross   135.73808722660465
d artagnan tried to gather from the expression of his eyes whether porthos understood the importance of that visit but porthos did not even look toward him   48.38049864318333
her head supported by one of her exquisitely moulded arms rested on the divan immediately behind her while the other was employed in adjusting to her lips the coral tube of a rich narghile through whose flexible pipe she drew the smoke fragrant by its passage through perfumed water   208.02009244570996

the two musketeers who loved their ease brought a chair for each of themselves and one for athos   59.301188655578564
the countess left with an indescribable pang in her heart and before she had taken ten steps the count saw her raise her handkerchief to her eyes   104.8861947264796
so then said he the letter was true to the end   154.34888704377116

albert advanced furiously towards beauchamp but the latter restrained him more by a mild look than by his extended hand   77.77696881561718
keep up the dance then since he will have it so   144.9392002658004
from madame de montbazon   116.8830677515657

oh my lord my lord   67.73549736117639
monsieur d artagnan never made such an answer as that when the service of your majesty was concerned said athos bowing with great dignity   51.699051502796635
poor child   160.75018573535738
do you not see that i reserve eighty francs for myself   123.84436327615336
are you going to make me ring a second time for the carriage   105.75734872346284
inquired charles rising   19.1031477621342
20167m as you left the choice of your costumes to me said the count to the two friends i have had these brought as they will be the most worn this year   124.90592109875517
we engaged our word   68.68466059161642
planchet grasped him by the throat and pressed as hard as he could   166.1770343404309
we listen monsieur athos   108.3469332484039
aramis and i are very unhappy   102.56765788554375
it is because in the presence of their pupils they fear that some of their tarts or creams may turn out badly cooked   58.11068053133189
but listen to me listen and you will pity me who has for twenty years alone borne the heavy burden of grief i am about to reveal without casting the least portion upon you   181.51686836667562
and then each group went and took their watch near an entrance   138.31454607647103
in conjunction with the affairs of ali pasha   88.55412547179853
the host became as pale as death   24.357977833711956
morrel said danglars you have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us   162.95444051427313
the two men approaching the ends of the bed took the sack by its extremities   19.092646654419767
i should quite imagine that to be the case said cavalcanti   127.4336728233233
thanks to this double gift and the spotless name that accompanied it m   110.52583583889562
asked raoul   67.19659226935148
yes yes my boy so we will so we will replied the old man   109.1318983083907
beauchamp interposed this strange man the count of monte cristo bows to none but the count of monte cristo himself   173.5115008291091
then lackeys who ask questions inspire less mistrust than masters and meet with more sympathy among those to whom they address themselves   65.30300510751577
yes madame replied the coadjutor   127.0540642533619
and you will seek in vain to evade it   152.69747154243856
explain yourself my good friend said the coadjutor   132.94842939893735
come and rejoin me   52.558065465093726
yes said monte cristo i think m   64.5534158107123
ah monseigneur do not mention it   92.136558777597
the horse shall be restored to your lackey monsieur   125.57868219352515
why thou art posted here by heaven   180.86113485678538
but monseigneur i know nothing about them   102.83601486050543
he took them up just as he formerly used to take up the stones from the road and threw them out of the house   43.5437134708027
albert vented his anger on a pile of newspapers which he sent flying all over the office by switching them violently with his stick   84.25164188982683
still added he amid all this i have not yet been presented to mademoiselle eugénie danglars whose acquaintance i should have been glad to make   84.33202852705904
will you name him   148.31461834730175
shall i leave you   93.71361100930986
it happened however that these two men on meeting again assimilated perfectly   166.12271607324644
the fourth and last side of your cell faces on faces on stop a minute now where does it face   136.51459162390088
you must look out for yourself   186.85418180162947
no my child no said madame de saint méran   140.06693565385024
yes said the messenger and i bring you his ring   27.786853984501732
wait a little aramis   131.449728953153
add these four to the nine others that would be thirteen days lost thirteen days during which so many important events might pass in london   164.91995683387105
and as soon as he saw the two cavaliers he ran to them with open arms   75.3391717290127
be easy said d artagnan he will know all before night   104.75071956297413
thank god   71.05353643216162
with these words the baron went out   115.2292609196808
my friends will be there i hope   110.62680450681569
what more need be said   114.16678120330806
but danglars restrained me   40.39734526959718
the crowd invaded the space which the dreaded pikes of the guards had till then kept clear between them and the carriage   123.63561685604539
simply a count   144.29051982012706
to which the others had responded that they would be glad to see the gallows erected   181.86768537313122
in ten minutes d artagnan reached the end of an alley regularly planted with fine poplars and terminating in an iron gate the points and crossed bars of which were gilt   57.418328482251525
i know you now   152.49635882442826
by the torchlight dantès saw the glittering sabres and carbines of four gendarmes   174.1756151915721
this force was therefore wholly insufficient and from time to time the line was broken through by the people and was formed again with difficulty   111.56931723689763
yes monsieur said d artagnan lowering his voice and you will pardon me i hope for having disturbed you when you know the importance of my business   86.69169425978913
and if your wings like those of icarus melt before the sun we are here to ease your fall   105.44513723676171
a sob which mordaunt could not repress burst from his throat and his livid face became suffused with blood   115.51850988124843
be it so said the envoy   109.54957679476279
ma foi there is no hurry   154.4078947426617
he must be near chapelle en serval where he pretended to be going   105.9549925290998
i of course give him the same title and everyone else does likewise   197.7554491562001
now i tell you you must pass with me through this army across to scotland and if you refuse you may choose betwixt two names which the contempt of all honest men will brand you with you are either cowards or traitors   75.00827371866731
the party followed him and soon disappeared with him behind the hillocks of sand unobserved   4.975779564020655
to such a degree i assure you though i would not say so to others that if the queen acknowledging the injuries she has done me would recall my mother and give me the reversion of the admiralty which belonged to my father and was promised me at his death well   147.364923906943
the coachman bestowed a heavy blow of the whip upon his horses   85.16471914060804
gentlemen said aramis decidedly it is a night for meetings   10.72475475215974
yes i understand grandfather said the young girl   83.68815645217359
it is the day my father was murdered   99.90469102836556
and he had many such among men of the pen as well as among men of the sword   154.0716580684794
asked the young man anxiously in his turn descending from the table   100.97748850714932
he went toward the place where he had left him   186.76618172612396
are you all here   96.97703998293503
and if that were the case would your honor condemn his action   131.2006536845326
yes madame replied the astonished king   169.69220936245608
but he will make it up in you i am sure   13.437036339059702
i will perform your commission word for word my lord   147.5138350965922
true said madame de villefort with an intonation of voice which it is impossible to describe   143.24580043951124
now mancini was a nephew of mazarin s and was as much hated by louis as the cardinal himself although placed near his person by the minister   141.32164379115062
besides she found herself in circumstances where everything must be risked for the sake of everything   147.00584313979667
you are good and faithful servants   115.8069134010862
in a quarter of an hour athos joined them and at the same moment charles brought in a letter for d artagnan which a messenger had just desired might be instantly delivered   104.57838517677396
and he placed you in the company of his brother in law monsieur dessessart leaving you to hope that one day or other you should enter the musketeers   85.41636123773745
replied the young man very easily no doubt for they are strong and well supported while i am alone   108.29495218768056
speak out answered d artagnan   94.22520771735506
yes and i would rather face your majesty however threatening your smile than face those demons who accompanied me hither and who sprung from i know not whence unless from deepest hell   94.10299836900398
the little company started off at a trot on the road to cambrin where they expected to find the prince   55.02432287871545
the abbé did not know the island of monte cristo   122.56385434388076
the diamond which glittered in the window at marlé s or fossin s shines with more splendor when it is our own   102.73801512991795
i kill my son   181.37401803893385
i want friends   29.63112979810208
two of them were singing in a corner out of tune the psalm on the rivers of babylon   113.98486139178485
this malady admits but of one remedy   99.96373486625792
it could be seen that she had wished to speak but she had remained silent through fear of losing one of her companion s words   65.52406247392409
madame he is very happy in owing any obligation to you   245.31785501872992
the carriage continued to roll on with frightful speed   74.47106386605452
but how do you procure a light   100.68602483013177
the countess bent her head as if beneath a heavy wave of bitter thoughts   92.47361136313788
you all know that i had the fancy of going to africa   74.36783839051627
still this extraordinary silence appeared strange to him and he called a second and third time   147.12546320870763
franz smiled   169.21236706196063
as to getting him drunk the duke couldn t hope to do that and he laughed at the mere thought of it   110.31686897801605
but pride but self love but madness silenced this voice and stifled its murmurs   114.67604619603563
punctuality   119.29926960349225
said he approaching the cardinal eagerly   140.42652783305016
barrois   114.84026874208674
you deprived me of liberty of love and happiness   23.93132130131049
he reflected upon the different characters of those with whom he was going to fight and began to view his situation more clearly   120.8048122624584
and if the action goes off well you may reckon upon a similar sum to morrow   67.67313001260013
0303m but what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his secret   129.79505498952395
this will give a faint idea of the carnival at rome   44.2817151386415
we are returning to his eminence monsieur the chevalier said athos advancing   114.69236202359555
speak to the governor then   91.045808136147
then all looked at each other he was made to take an oath and did so but with such an ill grace that it was really tempting providence to swear thus and yet in spite of that the general was allowed to depart free perfectly free   29.352753909463175
d artagnan half stupefied without his doublet and with his head bound up in a linen cloth arose then and urged by the host began to descend the stairs   95.84467716221698
go to my dear athos   146.30351871893552
they all bowed and retired by degrees as noiselessly as they had entered   130.55327488280426
you have done since i knew you not only your duty but more than your duty   117.8713415403025
i will say two words about it to the cardinal s esquire likewise   97.59184170183002
but he was pleased with his falsehood   166.37207686655532
grimaud came rubbing his half open eyes to answer this noisy summons and d artagnan sprang with such violence into the room as nearly to overturn the astonished lackey   82.61168150993592
the piercing eye of monte cristo glanced through clusters of bushes and trees and was soon relieved from all anxiety for seeing a shadow glide between the yew trees monte cristo recognized him whom he sought   121.96764511774072
athos and aramis turned also and went to salute the coadjutor and the duc de beaufort   178.19312634626945
that is what i want   99.51015652854737
and who is this witness or rather this enemy   207.7065930462243
we have a king ten years old who doesn t yet know what he wants   118.07727886341218
grimaud who held the piece of glass in his hand said sharp   35.007065883420296
i found myself again in complete darkness   111.07784195496892
it is because i am in a worse humor than usual replied danglars   168.85165685835952
but we are all possessed of a malignant spirit which bids us doubt   90.8970177593253
i haven t seen you with so cheerful a face these five years   86.41554008276486
it is well replied mercédès with her eloquent glance   108.79299478608205
flints and pebbles had been inserted around it so as to conceal the orifice   106.09008692887058
the prince threw his bridle over the pommel of the saddle as he was wont to do when he wished to have both hands free unsealed the letter of madame de longueville and started at a gallop on the road to lens attended by raoul and his small escort whilst messengers sent to recall the troops set out with a loose rein in other directions   80.83469173659599
the king himself   32.2470332616212
his cassock is a burden to him and i imagine i have had enough of mine   135.78688551883485
your eminence may perceive continued athos knitting his brow for this sort of investigation began to annoy him that we have not come out without our arms   82.9169119488206
the worthy mercer had immediately upon re entering his house informed his wife of his happy return and his wife had replied by congratulating him and telling him that the first moment she could steal from her duties should be devoted to paying him a visit   130.52756619964708
do you intend to stand on ceremony because you are less attached to me than you were   109.23084121302117
people pay here before they eat   104.16378470085294
milady ran up to her apartment quickly   138.84424776006648
in the principality but not in the prince   95.6352341521133
this person walked along the terrace which was ornamented with flowers   201.12388690856423
he hoped then in a conversation with anne of austria to obtain some information from that conversation and afterward to come upon his eminence with some secret which the cardinal either knew or did not know but which in either case would raise him infinitely in the eyes of his minister   148.6875989218512
ere long marseilles presented herself to view marseilles white fervid full of life and energy marseilles the younger sister of tyre and carthage the successor to them in the empire of the mediterranean marseilles old yet always young   121.90425954166044
i have now the boldness to ask you for an interview of half an hour   107.4255065169643
have you ever seen the queen of england   19.74555050531289
he was evidently ill at ease   79.19037015690262
count may i suggest one idea to you   90.20042171267852
the lackey took his place by the coachman   132.08338963450512
i speak of that adventure in behalf of the queen of the ornaments of the journey you made with three of your friends   123.34268969782129
what planchet is monsieur d artagnan here   108.55013350221473
dantès carefully collected the plaster carried it into the corner of his cell and covered it with earth   77.301184230639
they will think we are trying to leave england and will search for us at the ports   210.9803585198492
but for heaven s sake resumed aramis   72.52114510224249
said he with a broad marseillaise accent and a grin that displayed his ivory white teeth   86.85278344229896
so saying she once more climbed the staircase leading to her chamber her body convulsed with chills and her teeth rattling in her head in spite of the intense heat of the weather   196.8792692830766
caderousse made no reply to these words though evidently irritated and annoyed by the interruption but addressing the abbé said can a man be faithful to another whose wife he covets and desires for himself   149.2086261621578
the vessel in which you wished to fry us is still smoking   104.70763553416442
i am not so much at liberty as you suppose   142.72622562758346
a mantle piece with two modern sèvres vases a timepiece representing cupid with his bent bow a mirror with an engraving on each side one representing homer carrying his guide the other belisarius begging a grayish paper   74.15603768619673
thought villefort whose position demanded much reserve but who was longing to know what his father s intentions were   105.97293308311426
monsieur she said i i do not understand you   141.6464778815626
they had found the door of the grotto opened and gone forth   155.11073955358938
tell me what it says   88.59270206626604
charles shook his head   42.444250940243535
everything   149.43982372282193
what do you think of our lover   78.01600281038839
you would expose the self love of another with a hatchet but you shrink if your own is attacked with a needle   111.70206679014233
oh if that were so i should lose my reason   135.87905602180894
and said the prisoner what talk is there of war with spain   137.85200589161704
i do not know her but a sort of intuition tells me she is a lost creature and that there is something fatal about her   71.42929510175739
it is a man then who expects you   136.67308536559224
now it seems that he has carried off the prize awarded by the jockey club   181.3827877210261
besides which the king fifteen years afterward gave him also this ewer and a sword which you may have seen formerly in my house also a lovely specimen of workmanship   65.74292578008098
where is he now   67.36912140215192
besides your fortune may perhaps be the result of your devotedness   138.75780971665475
well by means of these lines which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth and the ellipse it describes round the sun i am enabled to ascertain the precise hour with more minuteness than if i possessed a watch   103.61295183009878
well i follow its course i track its passage   88.24542021151807
as to d artagnan afraid of some feint he still stood on the defensive   209.08991721956545
oh i am aware of that said madame de villefort   83.43587970295415
my poor grandmother gets worse and worse   92.96582743157326
i will continue then resumed aramis   112.39977972661806
you would rather be killed than desert your post   226.46268271677351
don t you understand porthos   41.76513840176929
oh yes said buckingham grating his teeth with rage   152.64312439099024
olivain   56.02575497880207
he who fires the first shot rarely hits his man for he fires with the apprehension of being disarmed before an armed foe   144.39207467169473
i went on first fortunately   162.7327978595554
this man who had remained immovable as bronze when menaced by the mob not a muscle of whose face was stirred either at mazarin s witticisms or by the jests of the multitude seemed to the cardinal a peculiar being who having participated in past events similar to those now occurring was calculated to cope with those now on the eve of taking place   59.03298143654824
at the end of the first attack i discovered symptoms of tetanus   64.0067960476311
and yet cried porthos we will not leave you will leave d artagnan to act as he thinks proper said athos   149.21364082575707
it is that of a friend who will love you to his last sigh   146.73683731288875
he turned round   110.46596782414736
said benedetto   88.08012854980518
this youth is an orphan deserted by his mother who left him in the house of a poor country priest   206.08273297509885
then he raised to his lips the repast that like a voluntary tantalus he refused himself   212.23426493262926
is there anything extraordinary in a journey   191.94336592319024
demanded the baroness springing to the window   138.80466628255948
all right said athos   45.98876491706112
notwithstanding his large stomach certainly not intended to penetrate the fissures of the campagna he slid down like peppino and closing his eyes fell upon his feet   97.5932169577542
this moment was frightful   92.43946924360536
scarcely had a few seconds elapsed ere he saw everything as distinctly as by daylight   100.19034636897824
grimaud can take care of the horses said planchet   113.23443015933269
his fear was lest the governor touched with pity might order him to be removed to better quarters and thus separate him from his young companion   170.15894366939642
they questioned him as to his sentiments but he contented himself with answering that the letters from the island of elba ought to have informed them franz interrupted himself by saying my father was a royalist   87.65442054276029
what can they have said   95.83159929077458
no replied mousqueton parry kept it   107.06076036240903
you drive the dying to despair instead of consoling them   200.6630072883541
bah exclaimed monte cristo that s a fine reason to give   101.13659397510447
this time we risk our blood   72.3556250545851
said a voice   181.35519141173552
asked the king in a severe tone   50.48028476982072
open   144.6888762790972
the red cap of one of the sailors hung to a point of the rock and some timbers that had formed part of the vessel s keel floated at the foot of the crag   165.76909094843302
then d artagnan ceased knocking and prayed with an accent so full of anxiety and promises terror and cajolery that his voice was of a nature to reassure the most fearful   66.153399776931
yes i had told him that long since and i did only what any other would have done in my circumstances and perhaps less   127.59241530877087
your history is a terrible one mr   139.61370954936592
however to teresa s great astonishment luigi remained mute and not a word escaped his lips the rest of the evening   135.11743771883343
debray why instead of going direct to him do you come and tell me of it   98.42407614560786
fortunately a mendicant passed who coming up to athos to ask charity athos offered him half a crown to accompany him where he was going   162.98778905264956
and do you think your power as great with the fraternity as monsieur le curé told me it was just now   242.2219150219375
i always obey madame when i am commanded by so gentle a voice   147.565143766411
in truth the walker who during the observations of the two friends had passed and repassed behind them several times stopped at the name of de winter   193.75303390733262
it seemed to him that the island trembled to its base and that it would like a vessel at anchor break moorings and bear him off into the centre of the storm   48.46181906814442
that here you exercise unlimited sway and are at liberty to lay aside or continue the costume of your country as it may suit your inclination   75.70542184727346
dantès made a gesture   89.97593591245328
and now he said may i inquire what are the orders with which your majesty deigns to honor me   52.99952505134674
i have sailed over it since my childhood   94.69167667359251
is that his christian name   181.65088564668352
mademoiselle danglars charms were heightened in the opinion of the young men and for the moment seemed to outvie the sun in splendor   79.26658421178124
the king went out accompanied by the chevalier de coislin bearing the candlestick and then the queen returned to her own apartment   125.66756649014
chapter 101   150.50269436618854
answered aramis as you see from heaven   63.71012527325791
but athos was a man of inflexible determination   82.76016695898474
cried buckingham becoming as pale as a corpse   136.0539660865132
monte cristo looked at her with an indescribable expression of interest and pity   126.27210404321421
ali alone was present to wait at table and acquitted himself so admirably that the guest complimented his host thereupon   166.95896218557897
monsieur returned villefort i was then a royalist because i believed the bourbons not only the heirs to the throne but the chosen of the nation   118.9845234793544
monsieur said the prince turning toward raoul i know that you have a letter from my sister madame de longueville   145.50265104407916
my god said valentine raising both her hands to heaven with a sublime expression i have done my utmost to remain a submissive daughter   27.491667782079688
there is nobody within said bonacieux   129.39078161797528
milady was livid   75.83950545229408
well then your guest will be poisoned at the fifth remove and die at the end of eight or ten days of pains in the intestines sickness or abscess of the pylorus   70.29905153321522
he even came to force m   75.15614287020762
certainly i might have lived happily amongst those good people who adored me but my perverse disposition prevailed over the virtues which my adopted mother endeavored to instil into my heart   142.87860316607984
he will be condemned will he not   59.12883358576881
the rapidity of his walk heated his blood still more   118.01587693676078
no said the paralytic   123.98311484159983
a slight click of the tongue against his teeth informed athos of the gascon s uneasiness   128.41346671517232
but to you d artagnan i am i hope still dear athos your comrade your friend   118.45169025904107
in five minutes he had arrived at the place where the guards joined him coming up one by one   113.95175533817591
he had reflected that in a few minutes the cardinal would be warned by this cursed stranger who appeared to be his agent and he judged with reason he had not a moment to lose   180.66693829020582
d artagnan took advantage of the lamp which burned in the cabin of the ferryman to read the billet of mme   115.8807960517878
you tell me of m   55.82549097497133
that you knew it and i was not informed of it   134.55214975127907
the four friends seated themselves on the ground with their legs crossed like turks or even tailors   148.8112006913854
yes sir answered the host even more surprised at the question than he had been by the silence which had preceded it   149.42352462240055
but leave us i pray you   116.56078569290786
they kept their word and never stirred said mordaunt   144.2352529264885
i beg you to do so replied albert   108.45581939534554
because there is a little secret a precaution i thought it desirable to take one of huret fichet s locks revised and improved by gaspard caderousse   84.30831206633816
at this fernand recollected her threat of dying if edmond died and dropped again heavily on his seat   96.75593697891067
you will get yourself exiled as you did in the time of louis xiii   116.00270488756216
50035m well said eugénie cheerfully we have then only to pack up our trunks   58.70539440899193
you will be lost   55.34068753821728
at this moment the garden was only occupied by about ten servants who had just received orders from their mistress to prepare the supper the serenity of the weather continuing to increase   106.23327712541045
is the baroness at home   165.2014942809049
now said the baron look at this woman   198.18576939534705
noirtier has evinced you say a kind feeling towards me   124.44577146715369
debray continued when you receive this you will no longer have a husband   68.91991312789182
is not it true you fellows there   139.86897320113152
this must be then an affair of importance   148.67991256130412
what said the count do you still regret anything in the world and yet die   75.37651737374088
if he had insisted upon the letter being given up to him i would have presented the letter to him with one hand and with the other i would have run my sword through his body   62.32830520910714
to tuscany   26.88911667774026
i know who it is   93.23993220393551
i will conduct you to her but remember not one word of our conversation   165.72683035930805
my journeys became more and more extensive and more productive   74.4071184290506
i never meddle save with what concerns me and i know how to make believe that i haven t seen what does not concern me   133.9398682943334
as for you viscount continued monte cristo to morcerf you are more fortunate than the government for your arms are really beautiful and speak to the imagination   120.60473753315473
who i   111.73837641271405
i am so little mistaken that in ten minutes you shall be arrested and in an hour i shall set off at the head of my army to release my minister   103.36248959120766
de rochefort enter said mazarin eagerly on hearing their names pronounced   66.40167128811396
is it pressing business   129.05848403877266
when he was within twenty paces of it he heard a noise of people and the carriage stopped   91.22695113138488
nothing said the king nothing   163.71239136625599
cried milady trying to drag the young woman along by the arm   155.64269491781795
the king has made him a baron and can make him a peer but he can not make him a gentleman and the count of morcerf is too aristocratic to consent for the paltry sum of two million francs to a mésalliance   103.64013161817606
he turned toward the wounded man who had watched with intense anxiety all the various expressions of his countenance and holding out his arm to him said come i will not abandon you thus   84.55249614886507
i wish in fact that you should now do for your husband what you formerly did for your lover   222.882773871685
two monseigneur   127.21445697264733
they poured a little rum down his throat and this remedy which had before been so beneficial to him produced the same effect as formerly   126.38231558431568
murmured caderousse   84.05577940268782
truly it is i who am mad and you prove to me that passion blinds the most well meaning   101.12952560228163
i will answer them both and contrary to the usual method the last first because it is the least difficult   120.2712343502219
but i shall make you lose your balance and we shall both be dashed to pieces   119.06968552638864
well then did he ask you who is m   73.12673431002196
come take a little oath for me on the cross   111.13253939791794
i know you are not rich madame coquenard and that your husband is obliged to bleed his poor clients to squeeze a few paltry crowns from them   102.44777972576456
to the installation of my rival at m   95.50612487141032
ask m   114.45774890697619
0161m villefort by a strong effort sought to control himself   69.90209119828876
in the same way on retiring from business you have nothing but your real principal of about five or six millions at the most   92.83285841975098
few have passed through this revolutionary period in the midst of which we were born without some stain of infamy or blood to soil the uniform of the soldier or the gown of the magistrate   66.19937098941864
no one but you appeared to be so   159.78907467189526
tell me did he put all these questions to you   210.7238404778013
by the streets morbleu   101.86113767350939
tell me at least to hope   165.6007577471358
though he had acknowledged his guilt he was protected by his grief   95.77953311713792
they both came immediately m   149.05779167412783
the englishman seemed to appreciate this extreme delicacy made his bow and went away proceeding with a characteristic british stride towards the street mentioned   170.9674537553251
she did well to die poor girl   60.669421927158375
i know it will serve me as it did when we came over   134.8312987718146
felton started   61.30669767606303
and at the same minute a carriage with smoking horses accompanied by two mounted gentlemen arrived at the gate which opened before them   132.2118759670159
o reilly you are my prisoner   95.5705377825396
that s a pity said athos coolly   157.9760093085642
it is bad news   83.73041503950526
come i am growing an old woman   105.3331550168193
and he opened the door with a trembling hand into the second compartment where mousqueton and blaisois were preparing supper   112.85101909039706
for this purpose i applied all the strength i possessed to force an entrance from the cramped spot in which i lay to the adjoining room   29.314021667275952
five millions   67.84753658494154
what would your excellency like to eat   113.20516987044385
and what does he mean by his news from greece   146.45741501791886
indeed his griefs hopes and fears on that subject might furnish material for a most touching and pathetic poem   135.19798932800077
in a pate for example   101.3121151088567
mother and son chapter 92   100.92709020067151
accept that which the bearer brings you   136.60419709308889
while the struggle between day and night lasted dantès still doubted   92.85488600977708
god is always the last resource   117.07446105854137
two ladders were hidden in the clover field   110.7730905518995
the latter sure of quelling the tempest when the waves became too violent allowed them to rise to a certain pitch that he might be revenged on the importunate andrea and besides it would afford him some recreation during the long day   101.14244047893655
i have mine said madame de villefort   103.16766971525237
but was it on her own account or on account of another that she exposed herself to such hazards   85.57610923752708
you must form honorable friendships and by that means counteract the prejudice which may attach to the obscurity of your former life   85.56861044464178
there are the prince de conti the duc de longueville the duc de beaufort the duc de bouillon the marechal de la mothe the marquis de sevigne and i don t know who for my part   122.03402779758267
i will tell you the real facts   81.06857350982312
oh i would rather mount the scaffold of my brother louis xvi   28.581977811702743
does anyone know anything of a count of monte cristo   84.52998865646616
she ran to the window and opened it   61.8344052251101
have you seen the greek mistress   160.14342074263794
call for help   135.77755543002763
let him find it out if he can   85.40772264743327
well so much the better   139.175467618699
his eagle eye made him known and his blows proclaimed the hero   78.42639810334416
a charming situation in the heart of the bois de boulogne   108.88830259464092
and now he has sent for you that i may repeat them to you   95.09090370336169
if any are missing when the fete is over i shall replace them   56.94077903465796
have you seen d artagnan   84.47239273853125
if we follow the escort we shall find everything devoured and die of hunger   17.572918136744022
one day the old man fell ill and died   177.37195131945117
you have doubtless heard the adventures of m   120.0506568801637
felton uttered a cry and rushed toward her   126.45930154698893
one evening he mixed a powerful narcotic with my water   123.2333152168984
you approach that famous point of free will which is a mortal rock   100.05232003154984
all these proofs of an energetic resolution which albert did not fear on his own account alarmed him for his mother   51.96117487027118
in the first blazed piles of golden coin   67.76404519552895
you know that we shall fight till one of us is dead said the general whose teeth were clenched with rage   110.81418552541787
but this is trampling on the weak sir   105.07961255881133
one man was killed on the spot and two others were severely wounded   127.03184722544076
the whole assembly manifested great surprise but andrea appeared quite unmoved   69.21927768413892
your friend edmond dantès count of monte cristo   67.84208937962431
so my dear host be not uneasy and continue to take all the care of him that his situation requires   97.93092564921142
faria as we have said without having recovered the use of his hand and foot had regained all the clearness of his understanding and had gradually besides the moral instructions we have detailed taught his youthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner who learns to make something from nothing   167.8471347239658
we came here only to express our loyalty and to say that we are at your lordship s service and his most faithful servants   100.21527614252531
this woman is certainly a great liar   67.16622451659515
monsieur d artagnan sides with mazarin   68.72622589934777
i doubt not you will consider these praises the result of blind maternal affection but there is a soul of iron in that delicate fragile body   115.68860221307527
to you alone then may i confide my sorrows and my hopes   74.30881809303506
we come from paris yes replied athos with the same courtesy   91.62619026993562
it however likewise appeared that the soldier on duty a zealous catholic no doubt shook off the charm for through the door he called hold your tongue madame   69.55195658702682
the laborers began to jeer the travelers and by their insolence disturbed the equanimity even of the cool athos who urged on his horse against one of them   86.09325240154939
i will restore you to liberty this moment   126.42300225694301
but who can describe the thousand means of extinguishing the moccoletto   131.10951485043887
excuse me sir returned raoul blushing still more deeply i know no more than i did before   123.46159852274324
fernand made no reply nor did he attempt to check the tears which flowed down the cheeks of mercédès although for each of these tears he would have shed his heart s blood   141.3894158911847
yes he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room   155.45959299217614
good day dear friend   62.92033755556858
but it was too late   116.26046769157382
he took cucumetto one side while the young girl seated at the foot of a huge pine that stood in the centre of the forest made a veil of her picturesque head dress to hide her face from the lascivious gaze of the bandits   92.7154166845658
only it seems to me that your majesty goes too far in engaging to load us with a friendship so far above our merit   132.79919780403682
he has received visits from the coadjutor from madame de longueville and the prince de conti   122.06604244120346
cries were heard from the camp come down   76.37754850990551
i do not deny the influence of which you speak or that i have not myself experienced it but with me it has been productive of evil rather than good   48.69914972028599
madame de villefort had multiplied her questions in order to gain one answer but to all her inquiries m   139.6782473338955
and he then related to raoul the story of the bastion and raoul fancied he was listening to one of those deeds of arms belonging to days of chivalry so gloriously recounted by tasso and ariosto   13.36147412861061
but count do you remember that the 5th of october child replied the count not to know the value of a man s word   115.8056559020299
yes continued the jeweller   130.63266761356599
and your slave   97.04419317971433
blaisois obeyed   79.96073259941367
the unfortunate woman was exhausted not by fatigue but by terror and when d artagnan placed his hand upon her shoulder she sank upon one knee crying in a choking voice kill me if you please you shall know nothing   67.7428661880507
then said monte cristo you went to him   80.6827281801702
we were coming from syracuse laden with grain   90.11898679011504
still they may have concealed some precious stone some valuable diamond   153.33539911752638
kill the sentinel who guards it and make our escape   102.81947134329988
and where is the governor   124.14765555849414
you said prince did you not   126.77235005800154
the moment for my escape is fixed seven o clock   138.9797990391749
i mean as i love   160.314979927126
she reflected likewise that the cardinal would be furious at her return and consequently would be more disposed to listen to the complaints brought against her than to the accusations she brought against others   113.04671752043167
she remained at the same spot standing mute and motionless   108.9669525376018
the duc de bouillon received domains of a value equal to that of his principality of sedan and the title of prince granted to him and to those belonging to his house   73.2917313407736
you appear as unhappy as i am the reverse   73.96795241546293
it was chance that threw me in your way   165.8215667056369
for another   138.54751710123986
and in short whether you consider yourself capable of resuming and retaining in the world the high position to which your rank entitles you   155.6127086764299
not much only two inches an hour but still it rose   151.04072343897323
fresh sharpened by his victory full of hopes of future favor he was resolved not to recoil a step   175.59012953540244
as on the evening before the soldier stopped his march to listen to her   139.51408024723202
my dear albert returned franz your answer is sublime and worthy the let him die of corneille only when horace made that answer the safety of rome was concerned   77.82456651505595
by the porta del popolo or by the streets your excellencies   91.88917031599117
just at this time the famous massacres took place in the south of france   147.29475404978697
there are hours which last a year   51.408079779755504
morrel still alive   156.10896780374554
aramis less self controlled fumbled continually with his hidden poniard   157.30138662015477
sir interposed monsieur de flamarens to athos if we are mistaken the error has originated with the queen   204.6734331633386
of what did you make your ink   46.97540538090209
yes sir continued the inspector of prisons   110.48368753715567
i stooped to examine it was the second pistol which had not gone off probably from the powder being wet   110.8455189742605
a small low door gave egress from the walled space we have been describing into the projected street the ground having been abandoned as unproductive by its various renters and had now fallen so completely in general estimation as to return not even the one half per cent it had originally paid   154.17742078626904
my lord said d artagnan will lend his which is of no use to him to the comte de la fere   207.7930725386675
and now where is he gone   92.39209740318898
aramis and athos were astounded by the calmness even the gayety of the queen s manner   150.34139273210906
well then try   128.62411707192135
his brow was more pale than it generally was   162.13495104372876
what he had clearly gained in all this was the diamond worth five or six thousand livres which he wore on his finger   55.859255448485186
reflect and decide   116.93717479710097
i agree with you there   119.87542966783292
the blow was direct and he replied rather dryly all this appears to me to be ill conceived disjointed gentlemen   172.30407288947208

at the same time he was a man of elegant manners and strong mind so that in addition to the revolution he had made in war by his new contributions to its methods he had also made a revolution at paris among the young noblemen of the court whose natural chief he was and who in distinction from the social leaders of the ancient court modeled after bassompierre bellegarde and the duke d angouleme were called the petits maitres   127.03173672065185
i will answer for lord de winter as for myself   142.60323777591248
mazarin had passed a very bad night when this letter was brought to him announcing that the duke was free and that he would henceforth raise up mortal strife against him   134.59256120469573
the absence of grimaud whose name had never once been uttered by athos gave d artagnan uneasiness   102.52987661646003
it s of no consequence   133.11225911280525
but porthos i do not see him   93.1182984729266

for instance you told me to live and i did live   43.38180550339514
one instant my dear friend replied the abbé   150.3080452005566
of three guardsmen of the company of m   76.00083725265021

by diplomacy and success in arms he became almost supreme ruler of albania epirus and adjacent territory   161.16367964826293
we have already observed with what rapidity d artagnan seized the expression of a countenance   153.0596512850561
and they mean nothing new   151.74444936682247
at these words the count s paleness which had for some time been increasing became alarming   147.53887741533893
d avrigny and antoinette his niece   119.2211279035653
is it really your intention to make me captain of the pharaon   111.406825720351
poor countess said maximilian i pity her very much   131.4486744230175

until to morrow evening you are not at your own disposal   165.2436507091625
he spoke with so much simplicity that it was evident he spoke the truth or that he was mad   182.08948336195692
and while acknowledging the justice of your reclamation i refuse it on account of the form   152.2199411298176
in that case my lord the time for words has passed and the hour for action is at hand   170.94923996862536
the bed which she had kept from prudence and that they might believe her seriously wounded burned her like a bed of fire   162.947620523147
he considered and reconsidered this idea devoured it so to speak as the implacable ugolino devours the skull of archbishop roger in the inferno of dante   145.06854881250877
cowardly court   93.81561135474291
before he had taken ten steps beyond the door i had examined the house on all sides   98.95645896436392
that is a totally different affair   83.35527280809488
i have driven away the swiss to humiliate you but i shall lodge here no longer   101.362332950397
at this moment a sudden noise of footsteps was heard upon the stairs   136.2657241903638
he took monte cristo aside   212.50953229766384
the truth   89.43604534414668
all this i did scrupulously   103.41602400543206
at these words with the most gallant air possible d artagnan drew his sword   90.751951065951
he sought to open it   43.75231381931583
there was no child disinterred no   89.49005561528769
another idea presents itself what if they should be his hair stood on end   75.43389908553861

this young man must not however fail in his duty said athos   76.08485726175914
20347m excellent murmured monte cristo to himself as he came away   150.28412828921546
if i had wished to widen the breach between those whom monsieur d herblay chooses to receive with a rope ladder and those whom he receives with a wooden ladder i could have spoken out   85.20130259891991
are you not rather young m   142.58775886553693
when i need your assistance and the moment arrives i will come to you count   89.9686011217528
yes said he yes that would flatter me very much   66.68150053706438
and it so happened albert was not mistaken in his opinion   45.3886301809077
there is the subject simplified   178.9324220880618
he opened the door quickly   245.76881914087454
three days after about seven o clock in the evening i saw a servant on horseback leave the house at full gallop and take the road to sèvres   141.6187699055929
the shot told   20.94440417440454
alas madame said the procureur with his imperturbable calmness of manner i consider those alone misfortunes which are irreparable   99.98836692655668
he scarcely tasted food but walked round and round the cell like a wild beast in its cage   75.99777676664729
morrel paid the expenses of his funeral and a few small debts the poor old man had contracted   89.36391482267787

however the vessel and the swimmer insensibly neared one another and in one of its tacks the tartan bore down within a quarter of a mile of him   159.19301501964074
we must use and not abuse said aramis sententiously   140.5884967055486
it is a thing of the highest interest and upon which our future fortune perhaps depends   156.41368789035752
and you porthos continued the count as if in consideration for d artagnan s embarrassment you the best heart the best friend the best soldier that i know you with a soul that makes you worthy of a birth on the steps of a throne and who sooner or later must receive your reward from an intelligent king you my dear porthos you a gentleman in manners in tastes and in courage you are as culpable as d artagnan   84.0863279597177
the soldiers were playing or sleeping   74.13743951962283
still the same story of superfluities   99.44946176980953
villefort approached noirtier   14.052351862572394
in ten minutes after the strangers had departed franz was on the road to the piazza di spagna listening with studied indifference to the learned dissertation delivered by albert after the manner of pliny and calpurnius touching the iron pointed nets used to prevent the ferocious beasts from springing on the spectators   145.27192103847648
the guardroom was filled with citizens and common people some playing some drinking some talking   76.46420926957143
ah take care you were teaching me just now how in case of an invitation to dinner one might creditably make an excuse   157.27296961745196
she is said to possess as much wit and cleverness as beauty   104.64769362020832
de morcerf and i have talked about this marriage but madame de morcerf and albert you do not mean to say that it would not be a good match   99.36884277076285
i offered to pay them for cancelling the lease   107.98504596665798
when one is a murderer to recognize the man whom one has made an orphan   158.59539515154188
he will convey you to a little port where certainly you are not expected and which is ordinarily only frequented by fishermen   157.32872059008866
her first look on entering the room was at noirtier whose face independent of the emotion which such a scene could not fail of producing proclaimed him to be in possession of his usual health   164.03713674902548
talking of countries replied franz of what country is the count what is his native tongue whence does he derive his immense fortune and what were those events of his early life a life as marvellous as unknown that have tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and gloomy a misanthropy   127.18115497358936
exteriorly nothing in the room showed that it was the habitation of an abbé   144.57925360293842
he had received a message from the prince to whom he had hastened with olivain the instant he had received it   97.77854269844013
the third attack chapter 20   51.75796167857531
porthos had received a thrust through his arm and bicarat one through his thigh   25.6060805744045
hang it said groslow i thought i had succeeded better   113.41340749639504
then when the marriage is celebrated they place the amount at your disposal as the chief member of the alliance   89.79265742983156
the effects are drawing near on the contrary   55.6430320926895
it was evident he had his orders   108.74982907980736
you speak as though you had loved this young dantès observed the abbé without taking any notice of his companion s vehemence   143.55290501037587
and in the politest tone monsieur duke said he to me and you madame continued he addressing the lady on my arm the doctor s niece   99.94896845442841
i know lavoisier and was the intimate friend of cabanis   127.59814919897721
silent shadows were seen unpaving the streets and others dragging and upsetting great wagons whilst others again dug ditches large enough to ingulf whole regiments of horsemen   197.95289878300116
come sir said comminges make haste   181.7037954238741
and i have the honor of assuring you that i killed one of them with his own sword said aramis   67.67991962874329
and he fired two pistols   104.79008018850328
did you take anybody with you when you put into the port of elba   144.72979936026715
to them or to us do you mean aramis   95.85613771189398
have you served under the usurper   127.46769410304856
at length he advanced toward the group the meaning of which he could not comprehend   93.5409772933856
athos did not trust this reply and he resumed   114.72568081300801
i have made an agreement with the navy that the access to my island shall be free of all charge   188.9391358704254
if i obtain the situation i desire i shall owe it to m   65.99191370000091
everyone drew back and the man in the red cloak remained standing alone in the middle of the room   99.61161657407116
and in his enthusiasm he struck a st   179.95256674751923
villefort franz and a few near relatives alone entered the sanctuary   140.2021136958074
he therefore went down the rue des petits augustins and came up to the quay in order to take the new bridge   160.59056305748436
in proportion as they redoubled the exorcisms he redoubled the temptations   138.807222244806
one must replied monsieur de bouillon sacrifice one s comfort to the public good   221.86266006786468
in five minutes the malady will reach its height and in a quarter of an hour there will be nothing left of me but a corpse   90.92675582983091
your voice is that of a young man   114.07075538144323
was i so badly lodged at rome   39.22203410789153
fortunately i don t know where he is   193.9416608145238
but it will never succeed now for they attempted it fruitlessly and napoleon was unable to complete his work   126.92646637687784
what has m   115.17368886508531
no nonsense my good fellow   134.8683869752618
two miles and a half   81.55594374268577
there used to be a dog let loose in the yard at night but it has been taken to the house at auteuil to that you went to you know   115.67473285405839
which i received this morning   158.72450119168172
why of downright starvation   199.72981128895077
let me meditate and consider   114.09706810346529
the smugglers chapter 23   29.84458341834946
athos cast a cold and indifferent glance upon the objects we have described and at the invitation of him whom he came to seek sat down near him   43.72434761771959
you see said the king that it is useless for you to resist   157.10107677362257
franz and the countess exchanged a smile and then the latter resumed her conversation with albert while franz returned to his previous survey of the house and company   61.79226848639402
the men run no other danger than that of falling in love with you and the women of falling ill of jealousy at seeing you so lovely   133.80444837443198
it was a vendetta followed by restitution   81.48788976561409
dantès redoubled his efforts   166.94817105784807
but at that instant a treble voice proceeding from a kind of entresol was heard screeching murder   23.832156416228756
this is your brother madeleine   117.40250793295304
a sword for example richly embossed which belonged by its make to the times of francis i the hilt of which alone encrusted with precious stones might be worth two hundred pistoles and which nevertheless in his moments of greatest distress athos had never pledged or offered for sale   169.23604957670042
the fish bites the fish bites   116.77826488844649
athos foreseeing the period when he should make a soldier of the viscount had inured him to all kinds of arduous undertakings   45.878332853510244
bonacieux recurred to the mind of the young man   0.7518609864568901
if i were i should do for you at once the most that you deserve   37.16812110538447
ah it is certainly you   152.95462903804108
zaccone are the same absolutely the same   177.23557024998672
barrois his features convulsed his eyes suffused with blood and his head thrown back was lying at full length beating the floor with his hands while his legs had become so stiff that they looked as if they would break rather than bend   99.87848103380298
now if you please remove your bandage   156.1210726470316
but she herself felt that it was a kiss of no greater warmth than he would have bestowed on the hand of some marble statue of a saint   84.52645170694845
he took it up and as he took it he made a low bow   178.99165663680668
he was dressed in a blue frock coat buttoned up to the chin and wore at his button hole the rosette of an officer of the legion of honor   172.55948571078756
and your friend for instance   164.45240397346174
so that said the abbé with a bitter smile that makes eighteen months in all   65.41425032899532
well i must allow as you say your father was a very intelligent fellow   91.29004340060185
none of those interesting adventures fell in his way   51.15365989495316
the inquiries soon commenced   74.72776878286044
they went on through the darkness silent as phantoms   93.43359618545912
these exploits had gained luigi considerable reputation   162.89724750452055
you see mother i treat you handsomely for thirty five francs   87.10106577655668
the poor senseless young man was not aware of the incoherence of his words while milady was reading with her lynx s eyes the very depths of his heart   149.69946132179078
don t laugh my friend   119.09745472203333
this secret passage is still to be seen in the palais royal   71.39896451495657
he cast his eyes around him and saw a man carrying off teresa as nessus the centaur carried deianira   150.7922179620693
no sir he had not because he applied to me six months ago for the particulars he required and as i did not know when i might again come to paris i recommended m   103.58925379100826
d artagnan was about to assure aramis that he could descend easily when an idea came into his head which silenced him   130.22391573825388
danglars who thought himself threatened certain consciences are never calm danglars even before his guests showed a countenance of abject terror   159.91868231916922
thanks to this stroke of business the four friends were able to take away with them a sum of money which if not large was sufficient as a provision against delays and accidents   143.92029169763748
dantès saw the reflection of their muskets by the light of the lamps on the quay   168.27778313581194
i am pleased with one place and stay there   87.40655320616212
to speak its language tolerably to make a good appearance to be a good gamester and to pay in cash   121.95346229771496
you have not deceived me   101.50140873379976
that s my opinion too said the captain and i ll take precautions accordingly   147.94692911545576
ich bin ein deutscher replied the prisoner   128.39562694653856
now understand me said the count no direct questions my dear morcerf   173.79378028029151
so far as i can judge i suppose this to be a quarter of my father s revenue   154.9297330654703
at neufchâtel as at st   154.63313227666183
but the walls were solid rock a man was sitting reading at the only outlet to the cell and behind that man shapes armed with guns continually passed   86.42383601146685
lucien had found time preparatory to the count s arrival to relate many particulars respecting him to madame danglars   117.39090853594269
as to planchet he has certain reasons for not going to court   145.4429441339456
but as i am very hungry pray allow me to eat   79.3883862881702
then you yourself are one of these marked beings   170.93864191958488
ali bowed his head in token of assent   151.5586667642313
the spaniards   68.09478511481007
you are afraid are you   91.31659716010003
i in my quality of journalist open all the theatres to him   63.98173534081802
he began by asking m   119.13426625934358
never mind renée replied the marquise with a look of tenderness that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features   54.36319242887616
yes said jacopo and without any hesitation   52.42020521018724
we were speaking he of the sorrow your family had experienced and i of your grief when a carriage rolled into the courtyard   129.83950757669277
then you too will be punished for you did not do your duty as a priest you should have prevented benedetto from killing me   81.77891602780475
and i set off without waiting for one but he called me back and gave me this   95.38517900253875
on going home the two friends found a letter from athos who desired them to meet him at the grand charlemagne on the following day   65.88662831187742
your misfortunes engaged his sympathies so you see you must have been interesting   106.46622101776711
franz d épinay and she shall marry him   98.79058964757084
you know me well enough   106.9846966717691
he was no longer astonished when he searched on to find in the register this note placed in a bracket against his name edmond dantès   106.76337365256718
this agitation in one so cold and calm as athos frightened him   171.495810873958
his profession must have made him renounce any great undertakings   92.71222028287474
that at the moment of arresting in the very act with all the proofs about her the queen s emissary to the exiled duchess a musketeer had dared to interrupt the course of justice violently by falling sword in hand upon the honest men of the law charged with investigating impartially the whole affair in order to place it before the eyes of the king louis xiii   96.4533354328156
and he who changes them will follow friend caderousse lay hands on him and demand what farmers pay him their rent in gold   103.87056119769538
your highness will approach the walls and call out to a man who works in the moat to send them back again   118.847376871731
he is not a prince   140.87234542293393
i shall live   144.12602437917553
yes i know it   58.80713902045172
and what is your deduction from this compensation sir   122.78691350104617
must i take anything with me   90.6985076448307
come let us put aside all rancor and talk pleasantly   62.317963182273154
you think then said he that i am taken to the château d if to be imprisoned there   72.64932401230121
all at once he started   162.8074519284194
the joy of the king was lively   117.11224500436181
you certainly are a demon sent upon the earth   28.54817639790285
the officer followed her   91.17918792873755
i saw him from the window madame   69.30071622788088
poor assunta had guessed all   86.75716208359648
d artagnan then returning to the officer said sir have the kindness also to awaken monsieur du vallon and to say tis by his eminence s order and that i shall await him at the stables   106.56235303355527
i undertook it because it was what my captain had bade me do   144.53399519419082
and my poor grimaud here was obliged to dress those you had inflicted on him   77.32328651842758
we rode in his carriage all day and now we have taken possession of his box   121.6018975090123
they looked at the cord still hanging from the loophole and broken at about twenty feet from the ground   87.99174186294913
had made restitution to the united provinces   90.16282609873971
on the contrary i gave you to understand i think that i adhered to the princes   31.0073860875346
athos kissed the hem of the robe of the widowed queen and rising with a dignity that made a deep impression on those around i the comte de la fere a gentleman who has never deceived any human being swear before god and before this unhappy queen that all that was possible to save the king of england was done whilst we were on english ground   45.1190861004043
de salvieux to do so   133.48242692258762
i followed him thither and i saw him enter the house where we now are only instead of entering by the great door that looks into the street he came on horseback or in his carriage left the one or the other at the little inn and entered by the gate you see there   86.25261895892014
morrel expected villefort would be dejected   51.63616496318926
in the first place la rochelle appeared impregnable   85.18388328877073
all we require to insure success is courage and that you possess and strength which i am not deficient in   146.31186919255103
the inspector could not contend against this accusation   155.52965385140786
officer chapter lii   152.42945983954803
he is in a hurry   142.68844366267237
the count s heart was pierced by the utterance of these two words   86.06644608489333
besides he is almost mad now and in another year he will be quite so   53.04742577156109
milady remained for some minutes in the same position for she thought they might perhaps be examining her through the keyhole   115.77241311091178
perhaps not being endowed with the endurance of athos who seemed to be made of iron he would have preferred a bath in the river seine of which he had heard so much and afterward his bed   72.01844080597843
after their departure fernand who had now again become the friend and protector of mercédès led the girl to her home while some friends of dantès conducted his father nearly lifeless to the allées de meilhan   155.9265284406886
my friend said athos he has given me news of raoul   110.48451356962282
i do not enter the church   53.481081047647784
what do you mean by tetragones   80.21658399828823
milady shuddered   39.080954716453846
de château renaud in pleasing a woman   63.03640624423471
he hastened to his cabinet   68.98192525461732
sir began raoul with his usual politeness are you an ecclesiastic   87.49093579934234
and as often happens on such occasions from shame they passed to effrontery and two heads of clans advanced upon the king   105.39159821849107
of debray   64.50836560518542
how pale he is   113.50364944649067
and his whole appearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from their cradle to contend with danger   47.95994642280559
alas said hermine doubtless it is chance   98.55766404600959
yes returned franz finding that the count was coming to the point he wished   176.48289992760795
oh observed madame de villefort it must be an admirable anti spasmodic   115.49790842282192
there was the king who made war against the cardinal   72.32080939593638
three days afterward pistache was found dead poisoned   38.05178433635808
and since villefort the friend of danglars had acted in this way no one could suppose that he had been previously acquainted with or had lent himself to any of andrea s intrigues   122.74426906927249
in the first horseman she recognized d artagnan   165.38299369634098
then said haydée proving by her remark that she had quite understood monte cristo s question and albert s answer then i will speak either in french or italian if my lord so wills it   111.02186856766447
therefore whenever you find any opportunity of saying something in my behalf i shall say it and you   159.9187673532072
nothing my lord   85.65512779013757
a deputation of two or four people   95.35250763758602
my nurse lives there   181.74725673144235
madame de saint méran was doubtless advancing in years but she enjoyed excellent health   150.54203650477737
quick to the louvre said he to the louvre without losing an instant and let us endeavor to see the king before he is prejudiced by the cardinal   140.47959967344246
need we think of that since we are to save the king   131.29258226520625
mousqueton stood at the door and porthos was inside the carriage   171.9240635786573
panting with loss of breath he returned to the room he had just left   118.97925750519097
the name of one of the four friends is caderousse   153.6695517126248
hearing cries and seeing a chariot they could not understand it   90.37426967001936
during this time the jeweller made the diamond play and sparkle in the lamplight and the gem threw out jets of light which made him unmindful of those which precursors of the storm began to play in at the windows   146.87717383543375
ah i see the eye of a father is no more to be deceived than his heart   108.99152064899603
asked the general   123.54017490452016
you wore a robe of green satin embroidered with gold and silver hanging sleeves knotted upon your beautiful arms those lovely arms with large diamonds   187.50890943068768
the king went straight to him   164.43162459067696
i valued it much said mazarin giving a last look at it   23.597212904560536
d artagnan on the contrary quite full of his plans of conciliation and courtesy approached the young men with a profound bow accompanied by a most gracious smile   198.44520162309104
that is all i was obliged to know and i beg i may not be asked for any further particulars   160.19634386506647
he had till then forgotten the date   90.81686125463357
at the same time the crowd opened upset trodden down and an officer of the musketeers striking and cutting right and left rushed up to raoul and took him in his arms just as he was about to fall   122.56715353312363
a summer ball the same day during the interview between madame danglars and the procureur a travelling carriage entered the rue du helder passed through the gateway of no   122.65659097981374
this is why i wish to set out again as soon as possible   93.85002908174465
and here is your fowl   149.93269412057444
tomorrow immediately when you please   130.7995374449812
and in spite of himself the young man began to laugh aloud looking round carefully however to see that his solitary laugh without a cause in the eyes of passers by offended no one   68.53401843597564
we were forbidden to draw first and we were marching toward the spaniards who were on a height with lowered muskets   134.44982232459358
friend cried planchet   130.3081787284103
what do you say to this mother   116.0866293605367
but it is my lord giulio who cares about them   184.68867094683367
now resumed grimaud i ve only one thing more to ask that your highness will continue to detest me   99.31823576217259
help me to deliver him   93.05962968769666
in fact at half past eight in the evening the grand salon the gallery adjoining and the three other drawing rooms on the same floor were filled with a perfumed crowd who sympathized but little in the event but who all participated in that love of being present wherever there is anything fresh to be seen   117.89722461343246
said d artagnan you know you will not be my prisoner very long   47.81412023424414
since his majesty still lives since the honor of the throne is safe everything else is a matter of indifference to me   198.72246706899045
it is necessary that we should be more than complaisant to the count   97.51970889568662
and he began to laugh loudly but nervously   11.94422510766752
but really no matter go on   68.16145327635975
oh that would be too much   132.72590471075353
you recollect perfectly all i have told you do you not   123.91546409717276
i needed nothing less than that consideration my dear d artagnan to persuade myself to adopt the role of jailer   28.766818293159957
what should i care for either riches or poverty if my valentine was near me and i felt certain that no one could deprive me of her   106.89124034713805
we have said that at half past twelve o clock madame danglars had ordered her horses and had left home in the carriage   106.32232700991108
however i will not go back on my word and i will give 45 000   125.15767411446154
i am john francis de winter he repeated and that woman well that woman   95.93633572940912
my father said i was his joy you style me your love and both of you have called me my child   3.6371046348014033
then he offered us our liberty and we accepted it   164.35713323328036
the king entertained great regard for my father who had fallen at the siege of arras and the uniform was granted   117.71942897793458
said d artagnan rising and brushing his knees   110.83206782848987
certainly for he told me   106.73218288137865
there was profound silence   108.98600420514528
and then myself covered with ridicule through the villany of benedetto   115.12980705474558
but if it occurs a fourth time i shall complain of it so never mind   91.71980477375237
will you depart will you depart if i give you that you demand   146.33238228470574
at that instant he felt himself ready to reveal all   80.14829998233044
aramis porthos and d artagnan drew their chairs near him   2.5610332111779996
yes sir answered caderousse   133.7642530895122
the duke in pronouncing these words suited as we have said the action to the words   174.90372492101866
short and stout   168.02200597191117
and he renewed the flame of his lance with a gesture which made one think of dionysus of old crete   110.23203007590614
you understand that interested as i am in this affair i can not see it in the same light as you do   77.66736834339261
because it is a grievous thing for me to meet again those two men who caused the failure of our enterprise   173.70964617125568
alas alas sir have pity on me   119.15189841820396
and without awaiting any reply disappeared behind a clump of trees and escaped to the house by a lateral alley   124.77828254549704
the comb was to be a leaden one because his beard like that of most fair people was rather red   97.25222785347111
go from hence to blangy and from blangy to neufchâtel   200.07742250786964
you have no witness one of these gentlemen will serve you   124.549966631006
he said i fancied this castle belonged to the ancient branch of orleans   73.0379889204003
as for you your captain is the prince understand that rightly   187.9282483564323
but said he did you observe one very singular thing   129.63838976890824
dantès saluted villefort and retired   91.30260782757398
d avrigny alone had followed madame de villefort with his eyes and watched her hurried retreat   82.85552378656891
suddenly a light passed over his face a smile played round his set mouth and his haggard eyes were fixed in thought   109.88521186962362
all these successive accidents were perhaps the result of chance   110.96187961674454
my dear father said villefort i am on the contrary delighted   73.04648430568076
he had doublets cut out of his old clothes and cast off cloaks for mousqueton and thanks to a very intelligent tailor who made his clothes look as good as new by turning them and whose wife was suspected of wishing to make porthos descend from his aristocratic habits mousqueton made a very good figure when attending on his master   113.93010820272274
you were among them you were   152.4084667859469
on our honor as gentlemen   67.45710988331652
of what consequence   78.82345286258644
on your brow i read despair your lips falter ere you announce some terrible tidings your hands tremble   76.9622135622499
well and it is that my opinion is that all these old podestàs these ancient condottieri for the cavalcanti have commanded armies and governed provinces my opinion i say is that they have buried their millions in corners the secret of which they have transmitted only to their eldest sons who have done the same from generation to generation   33.05561664895204
teresa uttered a cry of admiration   72.90917687838801
inquired monte cristo   111.09732692432142
besides he is a turbulent fellow who will ruin our party   139.32343104485275
the drop of water chapter lxiv   56.95708097833509
it is at least a consolation to know that some who have so often risked their lives for us are safe   160.846596885728
grimaud therefore added nothing to his speech but contented himself with pointing his index finger in the direction of the hedge announcing by this gesture the cardinal and his escort   70.65759253092048
but these last words this supreme insult relaxed her hands her strength and even her will   91.49862544256727
the slab turned and the orange tree resumed its place   45.41789225415198
dear grandpapa cried she what has happened   106.63760357710797
nor can i see how i can be a stumbling block in the way of your salvation said d artagnan   117.18309356427315
no you will not for he will tell you what is very true that perhaps there were fifty officers in the greek army bearing the same name   97.45370212141461
your hand dantès   77.13974992751704
their connection could not last long without ruining both   118.35881999498089
always the same always the child s corpse coming every night in my dreams rising from the earth and hovering over the grave with menacing look and gesture   118.64614826577083
and the young man who had never shrunk from danger shrank before monte cristo with indescribable terror   106.04885862932994
by following it we may perhaps discover something more certain   120.82502748402212
so that we are like those misers who are unable to absent themselves from their treasures   82.64264682547815
if you drag us both before a tribunal i will still say no my daughter is not guilty   78.24881607265661
that is true monsieur cardinal said the king and you were right as you always are   193.19806522611532
in a moment the plan of the battle which on the following day was to save france the second time from invasion was unrolled in his mind   128.60368638295262
she renewed the order relative to the gascon   107.62588282511233
hold your tongue stupid fellow said d artagnan   109.85717283904566
and why pray master la ramee   3.478523109428437
the clock of the invalides struck one   148.99296983742627
but in the obscurity of the church these things were not seen and porthos was still the handsome porthos   96.85263497377088
it means madame that the report has spread that the queen has left the palais royal carrying off the king and the people ask to have proof to the contrary or threaten to demolish the palais royal   89.6693150144399
d artagnan has abducted my wife   57.194948004658734
at length i heard the well known noise of the door which opened and shut   96.85092727090783
is it too long   101.90161503459751
i will not repent   125.81258422205067
about a year ago i talked of retiring to a convent   134.5132703958912
sir said planchet you must know   128.67450825896393
patience said athos whose eyes were fixed in the direction of the rue du bac patience   45.640501852379586
it was not over the downfall of the man but over the defeat of the napoleonic idea that they rejoiced and in this they foresaw for themselves the bright and cheering prospect of a revivified political existence   34.07484501526535
you believe and yet you leave me in the hands of mine enemies of the enemy of england of the enemy of god   93.36125040719993
he passed his hand over his brow got into the carriage the door was closed on him and the vehicle quickly disappeared down the other side of the hill in a whirlwind of dust and noise   128.9723143487033
we only said he would escape   134.256365821456
he rushed towards the door found it bolted and stopped shuddering   125.52307302145654
ah said monte cristo taking it from her hand   206.76542514536254
so much that i wonder how a man who can cook thus can complain of hard living   142.96313520018936
de bonaparte   83.46514177820497
faith yes with a haughty presence a fine equipage   86.69800178151257
cæsar thought they could make use of one of the means which he always had ready for his friends that is to say in the first place the famous key which was given to certain persons with the request that they go and open a designated cupboard   145.7296546798673
you see it makes a very respectable appearance   121.04608182720986
come come said danglars to himself now the thing is at work and it will effect its purpose unassisted   81.8519587261251
he set out and on the saturday evening reached the place de la douane by the mail coach   66.6797655072983
fighting here are you   111.50295819328758
that in triumphing over england he triumphed over buckingham in short that in humiliating england in the eyes of europe he humiliated buckingham in the eyes of the queen   87.48179774603487
around the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at such a time among people sufficiently free from the demands of social position not to feel the trammels of etiquette   122.21385192224551
madame i serve the king   168.1084647120168
she was sitting on a sofa placed in an angle of the room with her legs crossed under her in the eastern fashion and seemed to have made for herself as it were a kind of nest in the rich indian silks which enveloped her   89.55165486774918
let me live   78.50676865706846
for he has to atone for past dereliction while i have no other impulse than warm decided preference and conviction   145.99273503627344
besides you must have perceived that the countess was really alarmed   88.04542546986255
once the cab was also passed by a calash rapidly whirled along by two post horses   83.7376463262048
the two travelers knocked at the door   84.20048785337552
when she was only about three steps from him he turned his head round fixing his eyes steadfastly upon the lady with the red cushion who had risen and was approaching followed by her black boy and her woman   156.67052588673542
he examined the register and found the following note concerning him edmond dantès violent bonapartist   148.8981800975571
take some she said   76.61040707506004
you will receive for them fifty or sixty thousand francs   98.28717717347028
then continued milady then i collected all my strength   59.93416937390475
yes just so   94.18510258872783
he then endeavored to re enter the marvellous grottos but they had suddenly receded and now the path became a labyrinth and then the entrance vanished and in vain did he tax his memory for the magic and mysterious word which opened the splendid caverns of ali baba to the arabian fisherman   117.09771805457993
with an intellectual and animated physiognomy   88.54118700952621
ah replied the duke here i think is one of my servants who is seeking you   105.9681458892604
you incline me to think so said the king   95.84717105286515
villefort and madame danglars remained for a moment as if rooted to their seats   41.07475385095684
de tréville was the man whose name was perhaps most frequently repeated by the military and even by citizens   86.97079046572556
word of honor   130.2408276600317
they had however what supplied the place of those fine qualities replied the young man and that was fanaticism   163.73715800516626
their doors seemed closed like their shutters but they were only pushed to in such a manner as to open and allow the men who seemed fearful of showing what they carried to enter closing immediately   103.88811713829811
said d artagnan do you begin to believe that it s a ruined cause and that what with your harrisons joyces bridges and cromwells we shall never get the upper hand   76.55593092080498
the king is but a man   26.743650024362225
de salvieux my brother s chamberlain   77.48619708975684
he might have become a bishop and perhaps a cardinal   200.96840548954214
bayonne   96.389813095141
stay said mazarin drawing the ring from his finger my dear d artagnan there is a diamond which belonged to you formerly it is but just it should return to you   109.72137985253339
then was heard a great noise of fagots being removed and of the groaning of posts   48.224207338004945
whichever you please there to the left   103.58125539582817
he is a gentleman in whom your majesty may confide entirely in case your majesty may have some verbal or written order to remit to me   216.88709797616104
so saying he displayed a sharp strong blade with a handle made of beechwood   133.62496527809645
this was an easy feat to him for he usually attracted a crowd of spectators in the bay before the lighthouse at marseilles when he swam there and was unanimously declared to be the best swimmer in the port   140.85407640935657
what are the turks to such men as the comte de la fere and the abbé d herblay   174.84654554674898
athos shuddered from head to foot   195.16352909703767
the second was called the comte de la fere   104.61266228002485
and besides an idea had struck me   119.22784388984022
repeated dantès   78.30965813841514
the curtain rose and the attention of franz was attracted by the actors   202.35859207937978
at length his eyes opened but they were at first fixed and expressionless   97.0456121177316
you are among friends said athos in english   67.52505038021454
then collecting all her remaining strength she forced herself to close her eyes   32.27280808098678
and are there no cardinals that can fight   43.441906214793164
at the cry uttered by the duke and the scream of patrick the man whom felton had met in the antechamber rushed into the chamber   164.77756291064276
and i say to you fabulous as it may seem i tell it as a true one from beginning to end   91.61327106283584
prayed the kneeling suppliant protect my husband guard my son and take my wretched life instead   37.0835431145218
cried renée unable to hide her emotion at this unexpected announcement   64.36012016676304
so important a negotiation should i think be conducted by the respective fathers of the young people   111.89063075279454
will you promise me not to repeat a single word of what i am about to tell you   216.74637280682134
well are you going away in that manner   49.04997909603139
the young girl looked at morrel   100.56922843978478
a signed statement chapter 76   242.5989396135517
he found the old man suspended from one of the branches of the oak which shaded his daughter s grave   95.39942720571231
did you not observe his despair on the journey   128.95529604238155
the moccoletto is like life man has found but one means of transmitting it and that one comes from god   76.8870587081017
but i have nothing to fear while i have you to protect me   72.53409933868886
why that i should think it very amusing replied franz if it had happened to anyone but poor albert   167.36327771034092
my very self replied planchet   79.32740208349222
the young man turned round thinking that danglars or monte cristo had forgotten something they wished to tell him and had returned just as they were starting   63.64824642098464
read then   118.71519199611231
behind my bed   144.19786541635278
but there the confidence of d artagnan stopped   22.571625058222082
three or four palikares fell with their bodies literally ploughed with wounds   84.41343494092536
but you are sure you are not mistaken   112.66214966172043
d artagnan asked the poor girl what was the matter with her   23.36805417083758
now said aramis tell me a little what you do fear   100.3025721685618
well ever since then the infernal project has been ripening in her brain   119.36085249081718
and be assured that you shall be accompanied by one who will blow your brains out at the first attempt you make to return to england or the continent   92.72423613594846
yes happy as myself said he   56.60248227431542
and rochefort went hastily out of the apartment   48.48461641729739
he had lost all hope of detecting the secret of the grotto   118.18191187825816
to imprison him monseigneur   15.006303365940326
the result was that even if the king s troops remained quietly in their camp it was evident that some day or other buckingham who only continued in the isle from obstinacy would be obliged to raise the siege   35.15094938620413
well i should say   76.9093895764899
nevertheless his brow was armed with a severity more austere than ever   134.82417031607997
and d artagnan dressed himself in an instant   147.55915189524174
i have been myself to the best engraver of the palais royal who did the plate in my presence   60.217165667679325
i shall use it again upon occasion   113.06968805758795
your mother   118.317534109446
he is really dead   116.75326730011837
then as if to render an account to herself of the changes she could place upon her countenance so mobile and so expressive she made it take all expressions from that of passionate anger which convulsed her features to that of the most sweet most affectionate and most seducing smile   94.62825346390127
then all his strength give way and he fell prostrate at the feet of monte cristo   88.54220614116241
the eyes of both were fixed upon the spot indicated by the sailor and on the blue line separating the sky from the mediterranean sea they perceived a large white sail   127.6582026609625
pardieu monsieur   74.93869805609998
this dear friend said d artagnan carefully avoiding to utter either the former name borne by porthos or his new one then he has not forgotten me   102.58303671077462
oh heavens cried beauchamp the minister quotes béranger what shall we come to next   171.40078181461178
it was indeed strange in this unknown spot to find the young man whose misfortunes had made so much noise in paris   18.66362247077717
monseigneur said d artagnan this was what happened to me never mind never mind   177.59374658920711
do you think she loves this italian so much as they say she does   185.3863209103259
it is true said he in so low a tone that he could hardly be heard   100.89412236364429
she saw the young officer suspended over the abyss by a ladder of ropes   145.99224034572327
dantès thought as they passed so closely to the island whose name was so interesting to him that he had only to leap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised land   132.79262192104338
afterwards one taking the head the other the feet they placed her in the grave   66.03109123528799
you do not understand me maximilian   139.1631891280403
oh as for that said danglars angry at this prolongation of the jest as for that you won t get them at all   175.53516335593835
asked villefort rushing from his room   3.4186714415191375
and you you are a woman a miserable woman stupid and brutal   57.91864377561348
you aramis know anne of austria better than i do   83.28226505468305
the inspector turned smilingly to the governor   110.15350467071563
the young girl no longer breathed no breath issued through the half closed teeth   148.02783664690088
she conceived that heaven denied its aid and she remained in the attitude in which she had fallen her head drooping and her hands clasped   204.28660874706986
i can not thus in a moment relinquish the respect the confidence and pride with which a father s untarnished name inspires a son   188.11676858836267
but neither in the street he had passed through nor in the one which his eager glance pervaded could he see anyone   97.42480304575292
afraid of being heard   120.0251745227562
this crisis past i endeavored to catch your eye but could not   105.92507313729273
the queen who was scarcely less afraid of monsieur de beaufort than the cardinal himself and who was almost as superstitious as he was made him repeat word for word all la ramee s praises of his deputy   175.71354711679388
oh why did i not tell you all   107.6348391868954
is it mazarin s proximity that makes you so prudent   182.11021211598455
these gentlemen comminges are not prisoners returned mazarin with his ironical smile only guests   212.47638357503916
cocles appeared and the young man bade him conduct the stranger to m   87.99377864613938
the doctor was a friend of the family and at the same time one of the cleverest men of the day and very fond of valentine whose birth he had witnessed   66.93959481967707
and at this moment perhaps felton is paying with his head for the crime of this fury   111.15196055469691
ah sir replied mousqueton his eyes filling with tears why did you re enter the army   43.16900772091637
rest assured we shall not see her   171.8518512715316
they passed silently into the breakfast room and everyone took his place   143.50250662321676
under that pretense you run against me   147.88837383188798
bonacieux for such protestations may be made with the worst intentions in the world   59.4356378614988
come you are accounted for you are here but where are your friends   103.92635888893439
you and your two friends and then i shall have an escort to excite envy in his majesty if we should meet him   192.8834336626583
i will denounce you before men as i have denounced you before god   82.37027815972803
a kind of steward appeared just as d artagnan and his companions were prepared to mount   65.13071216246585
at this moment the door of the dining room unclosed with a creak and porthos perceived through the half open flap the little clerk who not being allowed to take part in the feast ate his dry bread in the passage with the double odor of the dining room and kitchen   73.489062246842
what has happened is quite natural and in conformity with the law of reprisals   81.38772437118729
besides milady knew the masters and did not know the lackeys   84.66076197767947
i have not enough you said when you had more than you before possessed and you committed a third crime without reason without excuse   72.10323065479199
but we all have our faults   70.87450352595287
no doubt the host knew what illustrious visitor was expected and had consequently sent intruders out of the way   65.9221715948378
i will stay   160.8478218336728
in a game of tennis   75.09044472548075
the woman kneels on a prie dieu of painted wood and at a short distance from her stands the young girl leaning against a chair weeping   160.34444280244645
i mean m   84.07444509306906
you are laughing at me and want to try me   172.54237206982992
a croak answered this signal   141.61498417758875
who is this wretch who takes my comb and puts it in his pocket   130.43748562822338
monte cristo turned round hastily and saw madame de morcerf at the entrance of the salon at the door opposite to that by which her husband had entered pale and motionless   160.32858357511736
he vaulted hastily from his horse whilst planchet with a smile on his lips advanced toward the master of the house   100.04743779258183
and since monsieur le curé can answer for you i answer for him said the curate   143.09007981587993
yes i know him very well   66.21065631038603
mademoiselle de villefort will share them with you   157.27571988748517
he was rather above the middle height with thin reddish whiskers light complexion and light hair turning rather gray   108.85572359319946
it might be expected that the attack if indeed an attack was projected would be made from the staircase of the ground floor and not from a window   105.06253476663782
for you are dishonored by delay and death is preferable to shame   92.22694666313942
in that case we will put on an air of mourning and he will pluck for us his black fowls   111.47967606273355
take notice that you are shut up captured   135.46526950704947
yes i have said it and i now repeat it our destinies are irrevocably united although we now pursue divergent roads   125.37279328669528
what is the matter sire   99.67052820291764
that if they serve me as well as they served the queen my gratitude shall be magnificent   116.1913051061638
come then said lord winter   98.76459708502243
the first opportunity you have confirm her in her opinion   147.063822615495
as was his custom d artagnan presented himself at milady s at about nine o clock   65.54001082291539
he is at vincennes   65.58391806497333
father said mercédès stopping when she had reached the centre of the table sit i pray you on my right hand   25.584310769892753
no replied d artagnan if i recollect well what you said it was nothing out of the common way   68.57560641368863
flee alone and leave you here   101.64869323931106
dark or fair   102.62834326364123
the most vague and wild thoughts passed through his mind   141.00677409431444
on my word i think you are right lucien said albert absently   97.27901809698105
athos though now cool and collected put his hand to his belt where his loaded pistols yet remained   198.77857841870488
at length with a violent effort at self control the name of that woman   90.93282252703396
i never jest   136.40497890489922
sign an order for his release and all will be said replied the cardinal   47.66551871561484
you can understand can you not that to have acted as i have done to have broken that glass to have intruded on the solitude of a friend you can understand that to have done all this i must have been actuated by real uneasiness or rather by a terrible conviction   99.89951587889655
your advice then   15.894284687691083
merri was announced   166.8703769315326
but i am content   147.0505644007788
muttered mazarin unable to recover from his astonishment   135.47298933423048
yes since madame de morcerf invites me   88.92414332949959
has not m   135.20882996643996
like a philosopher   118.0689592004181
the noble and distinguished air of athos those flashes of greatness which from time to time broke out from the shade in which he voluntarily kept himself that unalterable equality of temper which made him the most pleasant companion in the world that forced and cynical gaiety that bravery which might have been termed blind if it had not been the result of the rarest coolness such qualities attracted more than the esteem more than the friendship of d artagnan   106.79266049071146
an unhappy lapse of fortune and the absence of my protector have cast me down certainly but not forever   101.60155291217406
a fête was so rare a thing for poor anne of austria that at this announcement as the cardinal had predicted the last trace of her resentment disappeared if not from her heart at least from her countenance   149.83201085904906
he has at the request of your father opened an account of 5 000 francs a month at m   101.48918750259199
poor edward is as much m   81.7806206103288
de saint méran wished to sell it   1.070277799852832
beauchamp was thunderstruck   163.90766367296996
no more ships   141.57092883693434
good good   187.35316625469238
and still further upon my honor i don t like english horses   58.34340579178581
it was not the one she wished for most but it seemed as if a part of her past life had returned to her   180.36577273511023
0233m the physician may be mistaken   154.6583311123
he was with you just now   30.725691124207074
murmured coquenard and he tried to smile   138.48887153190987
are you disposed to take a part in a little civil war should we have one and put at the command of the leader should we find one your personal influence and the influence you have acquired over your comrades   135.2269389141133
and the four friends seconded by grimaud pushed with the barrels of their muskets an enormous sheet of the wall which bent as if pushed by the wind and detaching itself from its base fell with a horrible crash into the ditch   145.98291135441937
come hither said mazarin in his softest voice   136.36887927205277
very willingly if it be necessary to reassure you answered the minister and mazarin who was delighted to get off so cheaply led the way in high spirits to the corridor and opened the door   101.64831723593181
said porthos protruding his lips with contempt   100.92699634192053
the father s   221.10676870812046
his eyes remained open and menacing   79.62444268175224
you mean then that if i leave you haydée i should die   169.68763846619282
said d artagnan in a low voice as soon as the bolts were fast let me get out of the hôtel   103.38956303153233
and tomorrow to the wheel to the gallows   90.39723119100003
on his left was porthos whilst d artagnan was on his right   115.17077997470709
he has put out the lamp i can see nothing now   112.72713420111978
i know it and appeal to your penetration   65.55527294786332
no but it will be said caderousse as surely as dantès will be captain of the pharaon eh danglars   225.3386503679062
the cavalier entered the second hall which was guarded by the musketeers and doorkeepers   81.49967807048712
the two friends met her in the corridor greatly troubled and much upset by such strange events   119.82871360501163
pardon madame but i think that either i have expressed myself badly or your majesty has imperfectly understood me   179.35135665448527
alight planchet and inquire for i confess that i have scarcely courage so to do   69.63873458762995
ah sir do leave a few crowns for me at the gate that i may have some things i am in need of   139.4501040006918
there s my hand i promise   116.00951848400346
are you not aware that we are never seen one without the others and that we are called among the musketeers and the guards at court and in the city athos porthos and aramis or the three inseparables   77.27981392588947
i feigned a criminal process and employed all the most acute bloodhounds and skilful agents in search of her   30.156104161212454
then i thought she would remember it was through my chamber you had penetrated hers and that then she would suppose i was your accomplice   104.83202159783565
i heard that the colonel of the regiment that escorted charles was killed said cromwell staring very fixedly at mordaunt   96.8515361955739
but wait a moment do not let us get angry or at least not yet   88.16162025525772
selim repeated from time to time the sacred words god is great   49.45744548791772
very well be here at midnight   102.58121413793128
caderousse looked full at fernand he was ghastly pale   64.97060252972736
it is not for you to interrogate but to answer   117.77019509232673
said he with the resignation of a fanatic   76.49642353194758
he repeated his question   131.1831404152101
now then to breakfast said beauchamp   87.46026845109355
however he regrets your absence extremely   25.191136409566738
well said d artagnan to athos you see my dear friend that this is war to the death   90.13781558309236
in the first place said he i wish my lackey placed with me fully armed   117.82029474465227
they were perhaps in league with him   70.73378177492017
is my father here   51.53084044316621
expiation chapter 112   94.13045832539123
ah that is really original said beauchamp   138.63033518465983
who could these men be   125.02584470388956
it is not so bad for a novice   112.71497681652782
it is understood of course that when we say the queen mazarin is meant   93.09485219078528
presently there are not a sufficient number of people here yet   125.61703575665551
mark s column at venice and on the borders of the arno at florence little imagining at the time that they would be arranged in order within the walls of the château d if   176.55669509517097
they rose about eight o clock in the winter about six in summer and went to take the countersign and see how things went on at m   92.30080108292445
not their application certainly but their principles you may   97.6465997021575
for were the gentleman a montmorency and the diplomatist a metternich we will breakfast at eleven   132.06831298275836
he has just gone and i am sure he ll be exceedingly sorry not to have had the pleasure of seeing you before he went   138.40548432270177
now if aramis had been at home when planchet came to his abode he had doubtless hastened to the rue des fossoyeurs and finding nobody there but his other two companions perhaps they would not be able to conceive what all this meant   107.61870137478927
villefort you will not displease the marchioness and tomorrow you will sign the contract which will bind you to your husband   189.90827703423304
ah said monte cristo you promised me never to mention that circumstance   94.85308609283268
do not insult them unless you wish to be held responsible   145.9563686195266
cavalcanti the elder had returned to his service not in the army of his majesty the emperor of austria but at the gaming table of the baths of lucca of which he was one of the most assiduous courtiers   39.425058751780824
come come give it to me   174.9229673898347
d artagnan took up his camp tin cup filled it with wine and arose   125.52361365692775
i was called to see him on his dying bed that i might administer to him the consolations of religion   86.9400078455354
everybody is looking at her   38.137781257185495
the order given by mordaunt to the sergeant had been heard by d artagnan who accordingly by an expressive glance warned athos and aramis to exercise extreme caution   99.73320387611842
the prince is beaten since he can no longer fight   136.71969593961717
a moment afterwards he thought he heard his own name pronounced distinctly   57.054990810478174
this poor fellow whom caderousse had forgotten had not forgotten him and at his death he bequeathed this diamond to him   99.88840929905888
i can not return you many thanks for the drive of yesterday   44.17411656518651
how young this d artagnan is   108.67800041947905
grimaud himself understand   45.92783048597566
besides i long ago determined to put an end to all these petty intrigues of policy and love   62.80001687175825
i say since you command me mercédès i must die   67.09286845573683
there was connected with the remembrance of this girl a remembrance of anger   39.71693925465165
your death   45.48642628761681
well madame it proved to be as we had supposed   185.44333738297718
he grants a full pardon to the vizier ali and not only gives him his life but restores to him his fortune and his possessions   39.2152390598292
from the signs of respect the valet paid him he saw that his note had produced a good effect   161.0091795675378
but what then must be done   85.33705626843306
at this moment the duke s surgeon arrived quite terrified   128.7002273769756
the fanciful exists no longer in the east   119.15106089436887
sir answered a voice from the depths of the earth   110.79890643372252
he told me he knew nothing about the matter that the orders i had received did not come from him and that if i had the audacity to mention his name as being concerned in this disturbance he would have me hanged   214.1074596105836
their course was clearly defined they were to follow the road toward compiegne and on emerging from the forest turn to the right   90.93539236860319
but on my word of honor i had no idea that it was so much   143.63853602055892
but one morning at the commencement of the month of november everything was explained to him by this letter dated from villeroy m   98.05323799335173
and she leaned against the window   138.38385528936485
what have i done to you   187.17009436079707
you are perfectly right in objecting to them for this one great fault that they have not yet had time to become old   108.27267090923586
andrea gave the innkeeper twenty francs and in taking them from his pocket dropped a visiting card   81.77409473616922
i have the key but make haste   129.10734451756727
inquired the king triumphantly and pausing for a moment from the voluminous scholiast before him   99.26261771135003
patrick uttered a loud cry   78.98537491480772
added he with that misanthropic tone which was peculiar to him perhaps sooner than you wish   134.3265158561781
the curtain which had risen at the close of the scene with albert again fell and a rap was heard at the door   86.63898560437212
moreover from being so long in twilight or darkness his eyes had acquired the faculty of distinguishing objects in the night common to the hyena and the wolf   102.81304617666767
why i meant to pass it over to you my dear athos   136.11283809377457
at all events if you want me remember the rue tiquetonne hotel de la chevrette   158.8449269041446
villefort would probably have rather stood opposite the muzzle of a pistol at five and twenty paces than have heard this name spoken   164.8650415296856
well said porthos in the first place make a bargain with the mercer and a good bargain   146.9267719337854
at last in an hour after the scene we have just described she heard someone speaking in a low voice at the door   136.36700397065056
everything is possible   150.52531082256414
i gathered myself up my knife in my hand and when i saw him near me stretching out his arms to find his victim then with the last cry of agony and despair i struck him in the middle of his breast   137.78742704580486
de guise   74.95530512218005
you have not by chance married a protestant for a third husband have you   120.53085622349604
a learned italian chapter 17   100.97164572362213
have they any fortune   48.85116773733302
whether by chance or mistrust the queen made madame de surgis sleep in her chamber and detained her all day   119.07848346767096
then turning to ali she directed him to bring coffee and pipes and when he had left the room to execute the orders of his young mistress she beckoned albert to approach nearer to her   170.07092330637758
he owed three quarters rent and they threatened to turn him out   138.7983779445912
you don t comprehend that i want you and your three friends to be of use to me   112.57210430149519
he easily understood why his son did not come to see him before he went to avenge his father s honor   70.43225016177168
which would make him lose a part of his advantage since when known to milady as he knew her he played only an equal game with her   162.659370290637
we will embark for algiers for england for america or if you prefer it retire to the country and only return to paris when our friends have reconciled your family   167.31264917518536
they all asked together in a low tone   94.5542154221289
he insisted upon it declaring beforehand that he was willing to make any sacrifice the other wished   111.23698129695032
i have lent him to a friend who will understand the signs he makes   117.87276407004747
i recommend you to sink forthwith to the bottom of the sea   188.3352410060362
then he thought it was time to make the last trial and he put the phial to the purple lips of faria and without having occasion to force open his jaws which had remained extended he poured the whole of the liquid down his throat   81.85126049804116
monsieur continued she turning to monte cristo will you do us the honor of passing the rest of the day with us   117.4897950325688
the duke signed   157.3439024142433
nevertheless said d artagnan the people are bowing very low to this person   113.84289348635606
said d artagnan there are two of them then   113.71529529760744
she thanked them both with a smile   178.9228116615083
d artagnan seemed iron   61.595405654510394
to wait for me   230.65138151946914
besides of what importance to you is the life or death of a condemned wretch   95.60282709735486
d artagnan to wait   73.65109256811263
dantès entire dinner service consisted of one plate there was no alternative   59.13140682978931
i raised the stones and found a rope ladder and some tools   162.69801221924007
milady called undressed sent away kitty and shut the door   147.49802971173673
and you will add to them this knife said the duke pressing the hand of laporte   18.92045941561426
after this he took from his cupboard the bank notes and gold he had put there thrust the one into the pocket of his trousers and the other into that of his waistcoat hastily tied up a small bundle of linen and rushing towards the door disappeared in the darkness of the night   66.05268194060804
de richelieu had sent for him to propose to him to enter into his guards with the rank of ensign and that he had refused   163.95455926819312
well sir said danglars in case your proposals which do me honor are accepted by my wife and daughter by whom shall the preliminary arrangements be settled   193.89874227366076
and by whom was your wife abducted   80.0775846770988
he shall see how a gentleman can die   116.62578050954508
but this is droll cried d artagnan consoled and holding his sides with laughter   143.51272241892423
oh do not kill me   72.49626926372258
two poniards a knotted rope and a poire d angoisse   136.64037972962333
i remember too well how sometimes we were stopped for want of money and but for that diamond which i was obliged to sell we should have remained on the road   115.71339920290605
since you have commenced your sacred office deign to continue it   113.5217711884476
nevertheless i have remarked you   122.96097107489992
it was this idea that had brought dantès back to the circular rock   162.10074988048495
adieu count said the abbé d herblay   132.2818624676659
and if that did not restore her courage he pointed to a crow perched on some dead branch took aim touched the trigger and the bird fell dead at the foot of the tree   82.45547395865688
well that s what puzzles me replied danglars   61.70620873792325
but because it suited me to marry you as soon as possible on account of certain commercial speculations i am desirous of entering into   108.93211434945397
you know that when he left here he was taken to the palais de justice   142.142478996227
this is but a trifling inquietude i know but one that may be appreciated   76.0075947270816
as for me i remain in my humility and indolence   94.47995671398826
2 impossible   191.85047230573642
i say that valentine is dead   145.92784088888865
all without had heard as we have said athos porthos and aramis called and had guessed from m   125.00208839231033
two of his comrades of the guards immediately sprang forward and two other soldiers having joined them the number was deemed sufficient   146.86878021778045
what is the matter maximilian   152.9680071711468
he recollected the prayers his mother had taught him and discovered a new meaning in every word   184.65618159803037
de boville said nothing but nodded his head and took up the portfolio   60.82841990586824
but by our holy father the pope cut it short for i shall prune you in my turn i warn you   179.47763620279713
sir said he do you suppose for a moment that a man can sustain a physical shock such as m   183.52617284858638
two millions   125.3189232285406
monsieur bertuccio chapter 43   71.94126230352589
i say that she was my mother   107.2982259753245
undeceive yourself comrade you are not monsieur de tréville   105.5858988033621
captain or mate m   65.50628241313242
after every action requiring exertion it is conscience that saves us for it supplies us with a thousand good excuses of which we alone are judges   110.26533136188503
beauchamp said albert it is of your journal that i come to speak   224.51904025520577
say to the comte de salvieux that i would like to see him   33.12906600201762
one ball struck the head of the already wounded guard and the other flattened itself against a rock after having passed within two inches of d artagnan   1.4008946238797364
we must confess these three strange names struck us   210.04566971149336
and in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced   59.85281015290845
so far from the sensation excited in the parisian circles by the appearance of the count of monte cristo having abated i take upon myself to declare that it is as strong as ever   109.51280554698359
still further in spite of sword thrusts which weaken and painful exercises which fatigue he had become one of the most gallant frequenters of revels one of the most insinuating lady s men one of the softest whisperers of interesting nothings of his day   164.68623593478497
ah cursed priest   234.0599949892599
in the name of heaven my lord   115.1489478525353
you are right said the countess and my fears are weakness especially when directed against a man who has saved your life   234.69221781363558
la ramee began to be uneasy   113.8294203277834
i wish to be sure of my revenge   114.30036688094425
i would confide my life to them but i should hesitate ere i trusted them with your majesty s   47.03616193714731
are they all full   176.6386757482779
and you will submit to the reparation he may require   153.43655867943454
in the queen s name   140.52567821001983
at that letter the old man signified yes   149.3103198888497
as soon as monsieur had left and disappeared round the corner of the street monsieur bonacieux took his hat shut his door and set off at a quick pace in an opposite direction   130.48331191081343
but you were right to return as soon as possible my boy   97.50224583604209
a second blow struck him almost immediately in the side and he fell calling help murder   128.98724855831108
i therefore purchased immediately as many shares as i could of the haitian debt and i gained 400 000 francs by it of which 100 000 have been honestly paid to you   99.87415941607875
no indeed sir answered raoul   113.08437077479293
we both are servants of the queen are we not   111.87213293423468
he described to him his interview with the cardinal and said for the third time drawing his commission from his pocket you our friend our intelligence our invisible protector accept this commission   141.0523079526672
this thought the house of morrel is about to stop payment bent him to the earth more than twenty years would otherwise have done   126.70817792193736
for your majesty can not be ignorant that the musketeers who belong to the king and nobody but the king are the natural enemies of the guardsmen who belong to the cardinal   171.53200977323195
at that moment the violins sounded the signal for the ballet   62.79357859586321
for it is evident that your happy return has something to do with the joy of the king the triumph of the queen and the humiliation of his eminence   84.42266527495669
he looked upon her less severely and bowing to her said slowly farewell madame farewell   115.63758791056975
you were still fast asleep and i did not know what to do with myself   134.404517411554
he even told me he had not the slightest doubt that my father would give me the capital instead of the interest of my property   165.21171979961707
sir said the queen to him thinking he was the leader of the band you wished to see the king and therefore i determined to show him to you myself   179.66241190941793
for brave men are very dear to the king and the king knows that his musketeers are the bravest on the earth   117.46863339447424
and what is more however the man speaks for himself my preserver   70.73873332271799
the two gendarmes who were opposite to him descended first then he was ordered to alight and the gendarmes on each side of him followed his example   69.4649333938745
morrel danglars and caderousse were despatched in search of the bridegroom to convey to him the intelligence of the arrival of the important personage whose coming had created such a lively sensation and to beseech him to make haste   120.69094424242186
the article was not inserted by me i was not even aware of it   158.2003007447539
they entered   108.13867494519017
said debray who had not failed to notice the agitation of madame danglars   133.80022108403108
and a brave captain of spahis can not risk this even to gratify a pretty woman which is in my opinion one of the most sacred obligations in the world   86.87481755706335
the lackeys followed armed to the teeth   150.17776387652782
confess how you obtained this animal   132.94862440599655
oh then i remember as if it were but yesterday sitting under the shade of some sycamore trees on the borders of a lake in the waters of which the trembling foliage was reflected as in a mirror   85.82591087737188
said madame de chevreuse with a slight sigh and a little movement of her eyebrows that was peculiarly her own since that time everything has changed   141.39679622353083
put your other hand here   52.11924767947707
i am afraid for the king s safety   122.07542715609613
you have cut her to the heart   152.89353399822113
then drawing in the open streets as if it were the best of all possible sports   122.30135239612282
silence monsieur   90.48902619971362
robert le diable the pretext of an opera engagement was so much the more feasible as there chanced to be on that very night a more than ordinary attraction at the académie royale   136.22590166062895
we never joke replied peppino solemn as a quaker   119.82872561916898
she had one hope which was that felton would appear at the breakfast hour   54.15322369646291
50047m and saying this andrea who had now put on his boots and cravat stole gently to the window and a second time lifted up the muslin curtain   116.96200335198984
and he pronounced these words with such a solemn air and with such a real appearance of terror that athos eagerly seized his hand crying are you wounded my friend   111.95751748487402
i was only speaking in reference to the second rate fortunes we were mentioning just now   65.43700385854319
pull down the blinds said d artagnan   69.39683185914528
interrupted tréville   139.5506558820465
that who was here   89.74942673652737
my vocation commands me   105.87405799197191
you very well know porthos that i continue to study theology for that purpose   145.0653928322884
and what is the news   152.38765018616488
the chances always balance and at the month s end nothing is gained or lost   128.14238540459326
and why parry   144.9520708637122
then you refuse me   108.72353385926665
only continued m   37.58630450988818
good muttered mazarin sitting down we shall soon see something startling   160.73851494360912
the more she has forgotten the high position in which she was placed the more degrading is her fall   116.88869021530401
i loved her therefore i slew her   88.6599169002912
the one who gave me being and the other who conferred knowledge and intelligence on me   162.04509587760532
d artagnan related to athos all that had passed at the church between porthos and the procurator s wife and how their comrade was probably by that time in a fair way to be equipped   107.23338951708773
he was supercargo   86.78913097408373
the procurator s wife shed a tear   139.22653677111614
no your excellency i had never heard of him before and never but once afterwards and that was from the abbé busoni himself when i saw him in the prison at nîmes   168.61291541997323
monsieur de chavigny who at heart detested the cardinal took pains to tell the story to two or three friends who put it into immediate circulation   82.49732567343803
your eminence may perceive that if we had not taken this precaution we should have been exposed to allowing you to pass without presenting you our respects or offering you our thanks for the favor you have done us in uniting us   132.70131309969668
i really am quite ashamed to have been the cause of your undergoing such severe self examination   62.82125971795155
it was a model of taste and simple elegance   102.26661149050514
the flash extinct all remained in darkness   99.45620453361396
but shall you be allowed to go into normandy   113.97116879376043
now said the deputy answer me frankly not as a prisoner to a judge but as one man to another who takes an interest in him what truth is there in the accusation contained in this anonymous letter   124.94046017411942
another hope defeated   96.34392087899222
ten would have destroyed him   104.02742984727054
d artagnan observed on the bench nearest to the pillar against which porthos leaned a sort of ripe beauty rather yellow and rather dry but erect and haughty under her black hood   167.0390993375868
he sold my father to the turks and the fortune he boasts of was the price of his treachery   129.22921727151552
be satisfied replied d artagnan   132.9317157342815
i confess i prefer the convent of noisy   126.57822523265529
as next to the queen she was the most considerable personage of the fête she was received by the city officials and placed in a box opposite to that which the queen was to occupy   106.81681009620846
albert looked around him   96.20924603483888
as for me replied athos to this recital i am quite at my ease   189.08660037051328
i was conducting some friends musketeers one of whom by the by had a dispute with a stranger a man who sought a quarrel with him for i don t know what   102.10898614558575
and i advised him to invest all he had in an annuity   111.34829653465738
it had evidently been rolled across the pass by some arm of giant strength   165.22716136431112
20049m august rolled by in unceasing efforts on the part of morrel to renew his credit or revive the old   1.354586074106905
she was thinking of something else   115.01990038867004
oh yes monsieur raoul   133.99212247229832
at this last thought mercédès burst into a flood of tears and wrung her hands in agony   95.89716989541373
both commands alike   122.04504308962983
he promised to be back by eight o clock and eight is striking   100.45067484656761
a stretch of smooth turf extended down the middle and at the corners were clumps of trees with thick and massy foliage that made a background for the shrubs and flowers   38.91386714741253
she could scarcely believe in her happiness   190.06926945312955
chapter 58   107.90371223058021
then you believe the papers   67.10422368889954
but i will answer for these two words being delivered to their address   113.30559083879793
and he richelieu the french minister the national minister would be ruined   173.63609893320518
one minute that knife one minute a single minute and i will restore it to you through the grating of the door   165.4564733258939
wait till i assure myself that nobody hears us   127.35435955838243
he turned and was about to utter an exclamation of surprise when the other made to him a sign of silence   165.66052619510808
then they fear me   158.34622035502773
they know my habits   102.64199488305164
high cheek bones a sign of sagacity   141.26989657896422
grimaud saluted in his politest manner and withdrew as was his custom on the entrance of his superior   155.64269560515262
fire then   51.89238431213984
but that command must come from the queen herself   33.95920725489785
and while he spoke with a lofty air and twisted his mustache disdainfully all admired his embroidered baldric and d artagnan more than anyone   142.81860766800258
she is capable of anything or everything   124.13083695974944
what new victim is going to accuse you of weakness before god   117.29949417479568
finally he promised that he would leave her mistress s presence at an early hour that evening and that when he left the mistress he would ascend with the maid   95.08867005902886
at night in addition to complines and matins they were further obliged to leap twenty times out of their beds and prostrate themselves on the floor of their cells   102.22925610217156
villefort placed the arm of madame de saint méran within his own and conducted her to his apartment   124.99645753941203
d artagnan knocked and upon the bidding to come in which came from inside he entered the chamber   96.43097222333995
then tell me haydée do you believe you shall be able to accustom yourself to our present mode of life   160.3882522113883
0091m that is true answered the marquis   117.09428386208607
and yet notwithstanding these precautions i remained for some time in a terrible agitation of mind   82.69258537470638
they are ready to open for you make use of them   64.09974619537122
but he is gone and can no longer send us news of himself either to me or to your father   106.37296438007768
we will charge upon you then said he if you disobey   93.34550837703074
muttered athos as if arrested by some recollection   108.8833748377231
shall i call on him as i pass   54.779373991725805
gentlemen i will see the king this evening   67.33260751603964
they then at the same instant perceived a large lantern carried on a pole appear on the deck defining the forms of shadows behind it   109.49412084418127
i am here said the monk quickly coming back to him   197.0446073376312
sir said mazarin to him an emeute is spoken of in paris   153.73832197976196
but how to take them sire   123.50475125948222
villefort becoming somewhat reassured perceived that to avert the maternal storm gathering over his head he must inspire madame danglars with the terror he felt   139.08592526571158
indeed said the italian was your excellency then aware of my visit   61.428305970397986
really monsieur said madame de chevreuse unless you are the devil in person i don t know how you could become acquainted with all these details   64.47945817163395
jump then monsieur pistache   74.1512138827949
and then above all this this extreme measure which was not at all repugnant to the king good catholic as he was always fell before this argument of the besieging generals la rochelle is impregnable except to famine   30.665368843534026
i live as it were between two graves   55.33480827632767
have you no particular commands to leave with me my father   112.42768046757158
to their great surprise they found the citizens still encamped there drinking and bantering each other although doubtless mourned by their families who thought they were at charenton in the thickest of the fighting   76.20726963281788
and she began to shriek more loudly clinging to the bars of the window help   97.89221589433285
he rose to his seat and found himself lying on his bournous in a bed of dry heather very soft and odoriferous   52.83615216224446
but you have then a valet de chambre who knows paris   85.69949751974548
but within three months the penitent reappeared in the world with the reputation of being the most terrible possessed that ever existed   123.82099872180292
they menace you with two wars if you do not dismiss me   97.75317521927364
god will punish you   68.24633443590093
and d artagnan pushed the half stupefied mercer among the guards saying to him you are a shabby old fellow my dear   189.8813655947383
soubrette and mistress meantime as we have said despite the cries of his conscience and the wise counsels of athos d artagnan became hourly more in love with milady   167.76135537643043
it was easy to ascertain this   90.24145571887799
albert passed his hand over his forehead as if to try his strength as a man who is preparing to defend his life proves his shield and bends his sword   133.79963206950276
did you come here to fetch me   174.2390297155925
the poor boy wherefore   108.07747144650003
the young man overwhelmed by the weight of his anguish fell heavily on his knees before the bed which his fingers grasped with convulsive energy   22.839550591746587
but one thing i can tell you of which i do not think you are aware   115.1450650580648
he had only time to creep into an alcove to avoid them   74.06235084351337
but this examination was as useless as the first and with a bursting heart i returned to the thicket which now contained no hope for me   89.03970058380526
does madame de lannoy know what was in that casket   15.851572113284831
let us then hope for the best   181.06373485270615
lord de winter rose saluted her ironically and went out   120.0727239359137
villefort immediately despatched a messenger   140.96409361795637
do you mean to say that it was he who bestowed that severe thrust at jussac   174.0929450828571
a clump of trees concealed me   131.3757600546943
bonacieux against buckingham but above all against d artagnan projects lost in the distance of the future   75.64125309387146
suddenly a terrible cry a cry of despair was wafted through space   205.08588649820263
see see   125.04436618801857
30233m good   68.7901727674454
and further franz bethought him of having heard his singular entertainer speak both of tunis and palermo proving thereby how largely his circle of acquaintances extended   68.74383479996209
the count was erect and triumphant like the avenging angel   2.607339615453469
i have the means of making myself feared   100.68854295135085
have you   122.00026373227877
the manuscript was the great work by the abbé faria upon the kingdoms of italy   99.36540590998952
cried the procurator s wife   101.65901188439125
the clerks gone mme   94.10539935220356
do you need money   126.83291475674062
when he learned my resolution i shall never forget the reproachful look which he cast on me and the tears of utter despair which chased each other down his lifeless cheeks   40.72794117971648
the king smiling turned a few steps back   117.60196236740842
i thought i had said porthos resuming his melancholy air   98.97675984697432
no sire   86.96072431693504
not badly by any means said the young man   143.21763309983112
his palace was my paradise   98.39642226032558
40294m at the moment when d avrigny was returning to valentine s room accompanied by villefort an italian priest of serious demeanor and calm and firm tone hired for his use the house adjoining the hotel of m   106.05471675348306
you have been free to choose your career observed the count of morcerf with a sigh   91.62381173125681
but he thought of that courageous woman who had come to plead for her son s life to whom he had offered his and who had now saved it by the revelation of a dreadful family secret capable of destroying forever in that young man s heart every feeling of filial piety   155.22966145896098
to see him so self satisfied reconciles me with myself   49.18736423643741
only i tell you beforehand the carriage will cost you six piastres a day   126.34393612917621
on the other side of the house to match with the library was the conservatory ornamented with rare flowers that bloomed in china jars   156.91824022185102
he has been running very fast on an errand with which my grandfather charged him and when he returned took nothing but a glass of lemonade   43.25979307238046
and we must trust to the vigilance of m   127.13589488855085
every one shuddered and there was a moment of silence during which the queen pressed her hand to her side evidently to still the beatings of her heart   141.51220771805765
and raoul could hardly understand his replies containing a mixture of flemish and alsatian   108.95219455855877
had d artagnan continued his intimacy with these three men he would have become a superior character   147.41149993181583
revolving all this in her mind she cast her eyes around her and arranged the topography of the garden in her head   137.67512752466087
then bowing to the two musketeers with his most gracious smile he re entered his closet more calmly for on the departure of de gondy the uproar had ceased as though by enchantment   108.95915232190374
on arriving at the hotel de bouillon they came across a little troop of three cavaliers who seemed to know every possible password   75.96517311305581
madame you are deceived said porthos   91.35385200454331
andrea read in a low voice you are poor   79.36155851763934
cried d artagnan pale with anger and with the sweat on his brow it is he   134.12198693411176
said rochefort   99.96107540628265
then in accordance with his usual custom and judging from experience that few people could hide anything from him when he began to question them fixing his eyes upon them at the same time he thus addressed the messenger you are very young monsieur mordaunt for this difficult task of ambassador in which the oldest diplomatists often fail   82.48931879181222
about a hundred tons   162.81940835563847
as for andrea he was launched and when he was once launched nothing stopped him   152.0545398277615
demanded debray   159.98517506854716
cried mousqueton about whom there was a remnant of his ancient marauding character left   53.78545669420017
one might have supposed him thunderstruck   131.22750632138508
the hand of god chapter 84   185.53550142528817
but carlini would not quit the forest without knowing what had become of rita s father   138.2394697999419
i was not aware that you were so intimate with her   116.94757281158878
mademoiselle de villefort may retire during the prescribed three months to her estate of saint méran   178.3691882792255
50219m there had been no prisoners confined in the château d if since the revolution of july   109.79015131924447
can he be afraid of this boy   55.94782379905332
five letters to put before his three names a tiny coronet to paint upon the panels of his carriage   169.5294396462808
he is cold said debray   84.4804440991457
on the ground floor dining room two drawing rooms billiard room staircase in the hall and a little back staircase   78.91576015760819
that is a slight difficulty said porthos and a good push with the shoulders for god s sake porthos my friend reserve your feats of strength or they will not have when needed the honor they deserve   85.67694389952163
god who can read my heart all the gratitude i feel will reward you   173.093729008606
then they allow the lackey to remain with him   133.92092763963657
these two men then went toward the compartment in which grimaud was secreted   118.50504708970801
they made all speed to come up to this gentleman who appeared to be in great haste   116.94585165481553
no sire replied athos   164.2183402865553
you shall however have his answer   57.83843364012625
is that your opinion d herblay   107.80640021122164
believe me to seek a quarrel with a man is a bad method of pleasing the woman who loves that man   149.85033371463493
four and a fifth whom they carried away wounded   94.69883115969986
he who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience supreme happiness   111.99927932255717
yes that disturbs you   124.2377946580091
we consent to that   117.79124719680314
the count s first idea was that this was an artifice a gross deception to draw his attention from a minor danger in order to expose him to a greater   191.29918995937817
in three days i will tell them who i am and they can not fail to let me go   125.57664290594879
he has shown very great courage and resolution for he exposed his own life to stop the horses that were running away with us and would certainly have dashed the carriage to pieces   119.88723256769534
milady put him from her slowly with her hand while drawing him nearer with her look   158.47746571818317
between honest men such excessive precaution is i think quite unnecessary   38.060899171528106
his hatred like a powerless though furious wave was broken against the strong ascendancy which mercédès exercised over him   71.12003952745084
tell her some fine morning an unheard of piece of intelligence some telegraphic despatch of which you alone are in possession   59.52207289244936
i hope to be captain without that said dantès   183.55776737109602
delaunay in which he offers to purchase the good will of the house to unite with his own for 300 000 francs   70.36764275751841
two of my good friends lord wilmore and the abbé busoni   81.98980937105789
i will give you 45 000 said he but not a sou more   85.35592227539968
once or twice the thought crossed his mind that he might be separated from this unknown whom he loved already   135.80781611620606
we shall meet again master d artagnan continued the leader raising his voice   116.18102274089033
in france people fight with the sword or pistol in the colonies with the carbine in arabia with the dagger   96.00374578684175
the rest of the night was employed by these cavaliers in traveling with the wonderful rapidity of former days   69.1792840876617
no doubt she belongs to the same horrible race he does and is like himself a dealer in magical arts   68.43848853297456
well said maximilian death came a third time and neither the master of the house nor the doctor said a word   142.68196775376217
the coadjutor let the storm pass over his head and resumed still with the same tranquillity madame if the opinion i have submitted to you does not please you it is doubtless because you have better counsels to follow   150.04308783737937
how should he have been otherwise   93.3945717382633
she will not hear what we say   136.2767890923803
at the end of every month i am tormented by remorse   123.80026208764639
he escapes us   40.10986236901621
am i to say what you told me   120.69578646888804
then i wrote   88.93968297017807
hear me said the novice   104.60802743740003
because i happened to be in the ante chamber when the cardinal called me by the merest chance   111.93738108034653
i kept the third for myself and i had it hollowed out which reduced its value but rendered it more commodious for the purpose i intended   42.95998194754982
retire within bertuccio and tranquillize your mind   90.40199953102488
and then the comte de morcerf is a soldier and it is pleasing to see the integrity of a bayard united to the poverty of a duguesclin   115.5733868843013
then said the stranger coolly he must be some prince in disguise   177.23915576739358
she had had for an instant an inclination to be reconducted to the cardinal and relate everything to him   83.28253001506964
i like your manner raoul and your politeness has touched me   161.45670775834353
i should like another sort of oath better said d artagnan to himself   41.64080854048011
i stood in the same attitude and threw myself down   77.56296848770441
ah these musketeers of yours are very devils fellows to be hanged   63.67428438819707
and this is to be achieved   64.31941483290831
but you forgot to leave me the key   54.32889792401932
you were deceived sir   97.40364068393067
which would not prevent me said d artagnan if i knew where the duke of buckingham was from taking him by the hand and conducting him to the queen were it only to enrage the cardinal and if we could find means to play him a sharp turn i vow that i would voluntarily risk my head in doing it   53.06397723543382
he uttered and reflected for a moment   159.17924614493796
but what was real and not less incredible was the purse he held in his hand the acceptance receipted the splendid diamond   114.11465676882108
this introduction to milady clarik occupied the head of our gascon greatly   47.83315305854315
yes gentlemen the king in person the king who has come to ask for some account of what has happened   125.74630488457659
aramis pushed his so vigorously that after going back fifty paces the man ended by fairly taking to his heels and disappeared amid the hooting of the lackeys   164.20564557569975
but a strong hand pushed him back and the carriage rolled on   111.06521839009389
a moonbeam fell upon the blade of the large sword   159.94314201474697
yes particularly if you follow the instructions i am about to give you   172.5181706438173
what became of this little boy   96.75100801239974
i have been sufficiently unjust to believe so   130.5953671124906
the grooms supped for it was already late and their two masters impatient to return appointed a place of meeting with them on the jetty and desired them on no account to exchange a word with any one   92.09001593427847
have you not observed that the captain of your little vessel on entering the roadstead sent forward in order to obtain permission to enter the port a little boat bearing his logbook and the register of his voyagers   163.96692826630039
people cry out long live the king   158.0312988143771
you have to deal with a cardinal of another kind   103.35158263887219
well he is a man of bad taste and is still more enchanted with another   149.7643991654334
my dear vicomte returned monte cristo i do not see in all i have done anything that merits either from you or these gentlemen the pretended eulogies i have received   169.567643554374
it was for this i had annulled the lease it was for this i had come it was for this i was waiting   149.0393491302865
mercédès let them fall and sighed   140.8322607918547
you tried to kill her   98.36675507462172
50025m no one could deny that the rooms were splendidly illuminated   87.44895359328208
prorsus admirabile   69.3644878805733
my friend d artagnan interrupted as i don t understand english and we all understand spanish have the kindness to speak to us in that language which since it is your own you must find pleasure in using when you have the chance   112.62151798814452
oh second father he exclaimed thou who hast given me liberty knowledge riches   96.83822442110724
i was brought up in the country and my father in his leisure time was something of a poacher   100.0015708516454
and as if the weakness of the woman overpowered the enthusiasm of the inspired fanatic she said but no it is not for me to be the judith to deliver bethulia from this holofernes   139.84178880248436
the orders are issued   165.34140067896857
but danglars instead of receiving this address in the favorable manner which morcerf had expected knit his brow and without inviting the count who was still standing to take a seat he said monsieur it will be necessary to reflect before i give you an answer   84.66433423531896
i will make planchet brush my boots   202.50742442087005
oh yes monsieur le comte you know me and i know you   130.9178771205949
perhaps he would accept   114.19344709391926
whilst saying that to himself monsieur de beaufort smiled pleasantly and imagined himself already outside breathing the air of the plains and the forests pressing a strong horse between his knees and crying out in a loud voice i am free   99.70351912288181
that you have proofs of the interview granted at the louvre by the queen to a certain italian astrologer who was no other than the duke of buckingham   115.08423604792206
why not sir   89.67821877100283
i believe mother it is merely a title   76.20998017514557
that s another thing said d artagnan and i should not mind waiting in london a whole year for a chance of meeting this mordaunt in question   97.52301126549291
everyone looked at monte cristo with astonishment   157.64893453674802
a carriage waits your orders and ali and myrtho will accompany you whithersoever you desire to go   13.460500295678315
my father the comte de morcerf although of spanish origin possesses considerable influence both at the court of france and madrid and i unhesitatingly place the best services of myself and all to whom my life is dear at your disposal   150.7884170543307
on account of the famous luigi vampa   77.90913134514184
the sight of this creature who had nothing of the woman about her recalled awful remembrances   123.3900877772387
i may be besieged in my turn and i shall not be sorry for him to be able to let me enjoy the same advantages with which you gratify your master   90.40915608196391
and you sold it   143.29279570851824
there s nothing i wish more replied mazarin   163.31893303086372
you will say then to my good and faithful parisians continued anne with a smile the expression of which did not deceive d artagnan that you have seen the king in bed asleep and the queen also ready to retire   33.99530033486195
i know what i am saying continued the marchioness   91.65964844464344
no certainly not   95.99714418577017
the host insisted   146.35548068130637
we have already said that there was something in the count which attracted universal attention wherever he appeared   69.49101430126511
at the same time aramis made his appearance at the other end of the street upon a superb english charger   88.83809510690878
the man was one of those puritans half preacher and half soldier who swarmed around cromwell   123.6073251678174
valentine chapter 94   105.87658302154524
the quick eye of monte cristo however marked his coming   91.53508641192583
was felton suspected by the baron about to fail her at the decisive moment   203.5664191682884
and honest porthos burst into tears as he embraced athos   98.96525071126977
valentine clasped her hands as if in prayer   144.24227716612987
said a clear voice which seemed accustomed to command   196.5058826441374
next day m   115.4407049697628
the count then motioned the valet de chambre to retire and to ali to follow to his study where they conversed long and earnestly together   18.650789258846913
monsieur bertuccio said the count you have procured me windows looking on the piazza del popolo as i ordered you yesterday   151.29364383914415
indeed i imagine that mademoiselle danglars is as good as m   174.06883078128985
it must be indeed a dreadful blow which would deprive him of courage to defend himself   101.15841810307202
his interview with that personage and his receiving in place of the packet brought a letter addressed to a monsieur noirtier his arrival at marseilles and interview with his father his affection for mercédès and their nuptual feast his arrest and subsequent examination his temporary detention at the palais de justice and his final imprisonment in the château d if   149.4661700667621
said he i hope all is over explained and settled   102.0769601289312

the congregation went out to get stones to stone me with but whilst they were away i found means to conciliate the priests who were present so that my foe was pelted instead of me   155.5814413045288
come now i have hopes of obtaining what i have been for years endeavoring to persuade the marquise to promise   72.94951287572084
you child why there is not a man who has not believed as you do that his mistress loved him and there lives not a man who has not been deceived by his mistress   94.59360565876062
let each of us wait at a gate of the palace with three musketeers behind him   142.23192217534825
i have just left the count sir said he   98.78081970871821
did i hear rightly monsieur said monte cristo that you served at yanina   80.92576060083505
the door of the guardhouse opens as you see   137.61658128858915
enervated prostrate and breathless he became unconscious of outward objects   97.55204744649875
my dear athos cried aramis i think you consented to accompany me only to give me a lesson god forgive me   106.88622048611748
do you know   120.74644965547517
but when it becomes a question of serving the cardinal or of fighting him of being mazarinists or frondists then we are only two   203.64462736137278
just as ordinarily faces are colored by blood his face seemed dyed by hatred and became livid   143.36257660577488
she then made an extraordinary effort to receive him but never did a more distressed countenance give the lie to a more amiable smile   99.1573886625528
every transport of a daughter finding a father all the delight of a mistress seeing an adored lover were felt by haydée during the first moments of this meeting which she had so eagerly expected   104.20904981175231
de tréville looking at the clock   114.57463398014703
how he had responded   90.7774355256266
and wonderful to see in front of the tower of saint jean was a ship bearing on her stern these words printed in white letters the pharaon morrel son of marseilles   125.73374760458445
the study does not take long   112.79803277176404
they are certainly less particular with a foreigner than with a frenchman   166.8458733146058
i swear he said with a calm brow and kindly glance but in a voice still trembling with recent emotion i swear that i no longer bear animosity to those who were once my friends   126.49194614700563
a second hearse decked with the same funereal pomp was brought to m   36.785220146880945
the ball fired by porthos s foe went through the throat of his horse which fell groaning   114.90370222400806
it is running now   70.61963649853372
she lived in a small town with her brother who was a curate   122.40155774295503
and for myself i will write to you depend on me   91.65489842995797
does his action appear like that of an enemy   28.42983489749257
the king waved his hand to tréville who left him and rejoined the musketeers whom he found sharing the forty pistoles with d artagnan   144.58872102549307
gentlemen i have not forgotten the night in which you served me as an escort to the red dovecot   103.47175507434149
after the death of barrois my suspicions were directed towards an angel those suspicions which even when there is no crime are always alive in my heart   153.51751243177634
do not give this key to your father said he and tomorrow morning if possible do not quit him for a moment   146.4411593469291
you have life before you my dear albert for you are yet scarcely twenty two years old   77.59219060623079
during the night between the 4th and 5th of september madame morrel remained listening for every sound and until three o clock in the morning she heard her husband pacing the room in great agitation   95.12561579026367
i hope so if the marriage should take place and confirm my credit   53.812819206497124
responded caderousse waving his hand in token of adieu to danglars and bending his steps towards the allées de meilhan moving his head to and fro and muttering as he went after the manner of one whose mind was overcharged with one absorbing idea   105.37085656272575
50025m yes replied the count   140.3092960983296
good so much the better said caderousse his eyes sparkling with avarice   26.748423461284503
this burn in the heel is decisive   152.51341056438753
the quarters of monsieur were at dompierre   171.17137569266205
his mouth was large and the lips which had not yet regained their color were particularly thin   157.9602419958526
the officer looked at me with astonishment and then said what is your business with me monsieur   153.02988300106855
so you would rob the count of monte cristo   168.6018958196318
then he will tell it me himself   105.8513913486606
in that case i must say adieu to you as i am compelled to go to naples and shall not return hither before saturday evening or sunday morning   154.47074999324778
by its light between the island of lemaire and cape croiselle a quarter of a league distant dantès saw a fishing boat driven rapidly like a spectre before the power of winds and waves   76.5580820232336
i give you my word of honor sir said dantès   92.3742504123278
said d artagnan to himself the moment for confidences has not yet come   64.35855914933357
he paraded his musketeers before the cardinal armand duplessis with an insolent air which made the gray moustache of his eminence curl with ire   119.82375018735104
the latter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl absorbed by her affection and he also like morrel followed those traces of inward suffering which was so little perceptible to a common observer that they escaped the notice of everyone but the grandfather and the lover   91.87422601552564
thank you madame i am aware of them now   71.3115075831812
as easily found as the cart   88.09691688416495
repeated debray   76.40284336583701
broussel had been conducted out of paris without further resistance and was at this time in the prison of saint germain   127.54033959198242
one thing only perplexed edmond and destroyed his theory   121.01756144165431
that is replied the jeweller i offered 40 000 francs   56.53874211885163
it is not natural that a man like you should possess such a diamond   110.63038618662225
they reached saint german without any accident   134.69526682893127
besides my friend providence has warned us that we may be on our guard   86.88566092288897
this moment come my lord said d artagnan   62.505475104932145
and we were impatiently waited for at paris were we not   216.17022360780965
laughed the three friends not a bad bargain   69.61375722073004
thank you monsieur dulaurier said the queen   26.817676409682278
does the cardinal refuse to receive the king   73.05396044230338
it was very natural he being the only person in the whole assemblage except the king the queen and the duke of orleans who slept gratuitously   215.33874848336066
my lord said d artagnan advancing toward the cardinal it seems to me that your eminence is losing precious time   185.24886966513316
these two instantly mounted the coachman of the latter replacing d artagnan on the coach box of the royal coach   238.20303912954893
i shall not have time today   132.0940856637973
grimaud made a sign that he was not   141.41957244737853
the investigation would begin at eight o clock that evening in the committee room and if postponement were necessary the proceedings would be resumed each evening at the same hour   43.09519263665764
mistrust everybody your friend your brother your mistress your mistress above all   63.333300162418816
marriage is a civil affair in france and in order to marry in an orthodox manner you must have papers which undeniably establish your identity   70.81455538311903
she is a foreigner a stranger   92.42532852419211
the abbot ch   127.90326166030327
you have written it   182.33376946484952
the man was an enigma to franz   150.77741756969903
tréville bowed very respectfully with a joy that was not unmixed with fear   107.91728003558465
but i know you my lad said athos appearing on the threshold   94.79842363477381
now what is vague is doubtful   94.45624213990057
i have been told said the count that you do not always yourselves understand the signals you repeat   110.24485083467557
de boville but not for the survivor   131.57659503701743
whence can it arise then   130.17674843199646
well sir you have in your establishment or in your family perhaps one of the frightful monstrosities of which each century produces only one   134.61465444617627
possibly my father in law trusted to its general notoriety   88.29072185802181
we are all mortal my poor friends   129.80153115282258
well here is an opportunity made to your hand and it would be difficult to contrive a better   89.29857711371251
he looked well around him to see if olivain and the host might not be watching him whilst he impressed a kiss upon the paper a mute and touching caress which the heart of athos might well divine on opening the letter   56.98949924600749
in passing by the house where the scene which we have related took place he remarked that the window was again lighted up and he was convinced that aramis had not yet returned to his own apartment and that when he did it would not be alone   104.70942329397802
murmured kitty he has not even waited for the hour he himself named   89.35559017803936
and yet bowing his head as if humiliated he said yes yes my dear count i feel that you are right   117.43275465269542
i am m   194.43587616519108
aramis resumed his pen reflected a little and wrote the following lines which he immediately submitted to the approbation of his friends   25.90752495520023
one day he carried off a young girl the daughter of a surveyor of frosinone   96.45171694061764
andrea cavalcanti the young man in a black coat looking at murillo s madonna   12.997185589907872
one of the most charming persons that lives mademoiselle frances d aubigne   140.82655074813167
tis that which has made me so cross since yesterday   44.00866668885885
as he left the room debray called out loudly my carriage   71.69164165808134
aramis is your brother as well as mine and aramis has once loved you as i love you now and as i have ever loved you   97.76904800558489
the servant announced m   101.18349125013555
that is right cried the marquise   18.408332455258687
your conversation is full of instructive things   74.72659672968302
really said d artagnan these people are very ingenious   27.484384855071852
and madame danglars and m   179.6863195187725
my life is always at your service and should i lose it i should still owe you something   147.13192927247732
well but then you will not be able to fulfill your commission said d artagnan   57.223763169099165
in a word and i repeat it because it expresses all i wish to convey we will wait   131.22160495257444
she must have a long arm   130.2144927932597
the waves dashing themselves against it wetted him with their spray   85.50879716025443
he ejaculated   119.50887215115674
brail up the spanker   114.90935669697872
but as i am very ignorant in matters of this kind and as the humility which i profess obliges me not to rest on my own judgment but to ask the opinion of others i have inquired eh   63.70844076324275
well my lord   54.811880423527235
i see you know him exclaimed the wife   67.69437123018935
will you be good enough to explain your meaning   125.2872119233941
at the foot of the hill the count dismounted and began to ascend by a little winding path about eighteen inches wide   132.73502855523418
so rocked by them she soon fell asleep   117.61902696675561
angelo   94.28487680955608
but one of these balls launched by porthos herculean hand passed so close to d artagnan s face that he thought that if instead of passing near it had hit him his audience would have been probably lost as it would have been impossible for him to present himself before the king   177.40923997542734
should i not receive a reply in the space of fifteen days i shall presume my letter will have miscarried   66.89685171227976
two methods of self destruction were at his disposal   114.88931504005194
that may possibly be true said maximilian and he again subsided into his thoughtful mood   108.28805436269933
and he saw that the complement was not half empty   87.40187513595677
that s exactly what my wife said monseigneur   146.98148022435973
if the poor abbé had not been in such a hurry he might have had his requiem   112.27928344486648
raoul looked surprised and his eyes met those of the young lady who smiled   64.11974540987185
in the middle of the lawn i stopped to light it then i continued my path   125.29812956388733
however replied the abbé with an affable smile when that report is in accordance with the truth everybody must believe it the police as well as all the rest   133.07941455355288
fearing however to make use of any valuable piece of paper i hesitated for a moment then recollected that i had seen in the famous breviary which was on the table beside me an old paper quite yellow with age and which had served as a marker for centuries kept there by the request of the heirs   125.618851326245
but i don t care   94.88553155059739
she has always been opposed to this marriage and i should not be at all surprised if what we have just seen and heard is nothing but the execution of a plan concerted between them   150.4760344360723
said d artagnan looking at her for the first time with much attention   141.8430579880302
he fell back almost fainting in his chair   129.24558907954244
the baroness who had signed returned the pen to the notary   87.04326738423039
god who might have directed the assassin s dagger so as to end your career in a moment has given you this quarter of an hour for repentance   115.935558008031
the usual guide from the hotel having followed them they had paid two conductors nor is it possible at rome to avoid this abundant supply of guides   110.66846549679829
no d artagnan considered that things are never well done when they are not reserved to their proper time   101.25789421934692
my dear friend said d artagnan if you annoy us in this manner we will all four go and shut ourselves up in your cellar and we will see if the mischief is as great as you say   129.97320624086154
what dost thou there rascal   92.82658282499557
milady had hastened her departure by an hour and a half   49.50324808139867
said madame de villefort there is not much doubt on that subject   143.07634932185707
will you have two three five per cent or even more   104.86325709224977
those who were to fly with the court had the word of command and they were each severally desired to be from twelve o clock to one at cours la reine   104.83840317293611
it may be imagined that d artagnan listened to these details with increasing interest   83.30443574686058
then the two young girls having told him to take it to no   103.26189387361902
that   73.18722932394027
he must have been dreadfully hurt for he did not stir from the place where he fell   117.08278259886374
they are friends   120.36908718617161
the hostler enchanted with the good day s work he had done returned to the yard   157.06919331775114
the affair is still in projection   30.7549111146204
d artagnan took possession of his command   113.0924172744644
yes they might do well if they had any leader to unite them in one body   138.8196834537045
under this head also bragelonne had much more to hear than to tell   63.54650752672987
at a few minutes to seven returned the duke suiting the action to the words i raise the crust of the pie   57.39107734346244
ah true said monte cristo there is a postscript   41.255258685310665
do you know with what design m   130.83199622175582
so he opened the door and beckoned the young man in   163.93924632911208
how i have longed for royal wealth to purchase a million of secrets from a million of men and to find mine among them   77.59548178158431
yes but he has forbidden me so strictly to say so   134.09890212963322
listen to me my son has also guessed who you are he attributes his father s misfortunes to you   125.92173730308265
this must be impossible   128.89382438158222
after several blows he perceived that the stones were not cemented but had been merely placed one upon the other and covered with stucco   170.17005839267375
the duke looked furiously at grimaud   118.01686858732712
i hear a noise   99.05965465459782
he will inform against you   106.84480395907819
the king even while obeying him like a child hated him as a child hates his master and would abandon him to the personal vengeance of monsieur and the queen   119.98381780756974
i should be ungrateful said athos and i regard ingratitude not as a fault or a crime but as a vice which is much worse   171.84098254532893
it will be time to think about it when we next halt   168.10850670942574
it is unnecessary to say that from the day i saw raoul i loved him   91.72899012794826
villefort drew back and looked with astonishment on the young man who almost a stranger to him called noirtier his father   171.53199727407542
all he possessed was 15 257 francs   97.99011644582227
this house isolated from the rest had besides the main entrance another in the rue de ponthieu   182.84127730746422
will the marquis honor me by a few moments private conversation   179.32586080034048
ah my head   125.56899249759435
i could scarcely walk when my mother who was called vasiliki which means royal said the young girl tossing her head proudly took me by the hand and after putting in our purse all the money we possessed we went out both covered with veils to solicit alms for the prisoners saying he who giveth to the poor lendeth to the lord   126.01989052296179
milady put her charming blond head out at the window and gave her orders to her maid   170.56473806606954
no only add two bottles of champagne and the difference will be for the napkins   86.69527219432871
well merit this pretended happiness then   135.0963486192834
how delighted i am to have found you   71.49605958600867
i was deceived as it appears and i ask your pardon   87.55354955957148
and so edmond s father died as he had lived without doing harm to anyone   135.0070459387165
you must go away immediately   71.45049707621445
a change of ideas presented themselves to his brain like a new design on the kaleidoscope   79.0483530405289
with these four elements paris is ours in a week   152.31252482622006
impossible my lord   163.93380043442988
thanks sire thanks said the duke   130.30493898331127
you must be much fatigued after your voyage   113.64007367317717
besides if he will do nothing officially he will answer any questions you propose to him   175.40146919304817
shall i send word to him as coming from you   97.52034382562714
but said d artagnan in the ear of athos you are going to get us all killed without mercy   139.43620552072844
madame de villefort stretched out her hands and fell on her knees   64.49835033267499
blood   108.57143893199759
the examination no sooner had villefort left the salon than he assumed the grave air of a man who holds the balance of life and death in his hands   32.261509888398066
i have heard speak said porthos of a certain milo of crotona who performed wonderful feats such as binding his forehead with a cord and bursting it of killing an ox with a blow of his fist and carrying it home on his shoulders et cetera   85.26464378830491
thank you my adored valentine thank you   130.56906104372516
said athos leaning and stretching out his arm to mordaunt with that air of dignity and nobility of soul habitual to him   99.34073050803747
and advancing toward the door opposite to that by which he came in he opened it and disappeared behind it shutting it as he went   116.11794453582961
by this means the end of the month was passed but his resources were now exhausted   131.61119953192076
the man who had followed danglars sat down on a bench   173.95510758542153
there is something in what you have just said said beauchamp laughing   203.16994661900975
therefore i shall go at once and fetch one   94.57720518518273
please to understand that s enough   151.73630454491962
an instant after the man he asked for was before him booted and spurred   153.1876006181452
i did not look on caderousse as a bad man and i thought him incapable of committing a crime or even a theft   150.61744756523294
he raised his face red with shame and bathed in tears and seizing beauchamp s arm my friend said he my life is ended   224.54513792693365
d artagnan s plan was very simple   188.4556422712675
that may be true replied porthos   58.14533408767565
it is done gentlemen said athos   210.17369891986567
but as my motive in travelling to your capital would not have been for the pleasure of dabbling in stocks i stayed away till some favorable chance should present itself of carrying my wish into execution   165.65234546928872
are on either side of the gate which you see there   103.05180895283058
and i am curious to know how it will end   150.90580945730593
it is a great honor to me returned monte cristo to be thus on the first day of my arrival in paris brought in contact with a man whose merit equals his reputation and to whom fortune has for once been equitable but has she not still on the plains of mitidja or in the mountains of atlas a marshal s staff to offer you   76.61832927058522
and in what have i been so unfortunate as to displease your majesty   69.20047181144011
replied d artagnan surprised   126.14619577234483
but i then replied probably monsieur de chavigny is afraid your pastry is not good   87.26049408672115
but you know athos porthos and aramis and you know if i can dispose of them   106.85296389437055
run waiter   70.87866979004235
the groom returned to the carriage   199.23242351630262
who were those men   11.408020892465686
oh miserable creature that i am   19.843746343099454
and when he had seen him seated resumed his own chair   188.58738110080282
do you wish to see the powder room   142.92082028233344
then turning towards albert it is a pity you do not understand either ancient or modern greek both of which haydée speaks so fluently   88.8097397430004
it is hoped that no ties of friendship or humane consideration will induce you to conceal the truth   81.60749432813589
andrea he has some secretaire with a spring   129.6126023708865
the two men in black bowed in their turn   180.7087177152053
and as you have been unjustly suspected well you must be indemnified   116.05830893944658
i once spoke to you of four men   104.96182794379371
what is it you want   122.80848698965198
believe me then when i swear to you that you have wronged no man but on the contrary have benefited mankind   166.15282621056764
at this epoch the ideas of pride which are in fashion in our days did not prevail   135.15511834216258
do you know monsieur de rochefort   141.15785376653065
planchet my friend said porthos in a melancholy voice i am very ill   45.00594196802271
four hundred at a louis each make four hundred louis   115.43181081896157
and are you going to leave me at such a time   107.44499467802747
that s true said dantès   114.06097677957808
and above all i will not have occasion given for the cardinal s guards who are brave quiet skillful men who never put themselves in a position to be arrested and who besides never allow themselves to be arrested to laugh at you   103.84618131801007
hardly had the door closed when villefort threw himself half fainting into a chair   37.226864376933705
yes and for a considerable sum   149.10096531428155
but i am now obliged to return to the dangerous and wandering life of party faction   99.65939783731487
the air was soft and clear as it generally is at that early hour of the morning   36.692747471337896
monsieur le comte said the duchess giving him a letter here is what i promised you   122.79166086730632
is it not by chance that the unfortunate child was disinterred under the trees   104.78573237384741
most assuredly responded madame de villefort in the same tone   146.09409160116257
the two friends exchanged a smile of contempt   159.53073428004961
you do not guess   157.9514557087893
besides although she avoided coming within speaking distance valentine arranged so that maximilian could see her pass and repass and each time she went by she managed unperceived by her companion to cast an expressive look at the young man which seemed to say have patience   94.10335251321561
the bearer of this letter will tell you madame what i dare not trust to pen and paper and the risks of transit   97.5562330383735
but yet m   92.65182204587447
well sir go said louis xviii   145.80437818202589
at a quarter of a league from the city   58.49858361065806
you have spoken truly maximilian   117.24756006847846
i must however do him the justice to add that he assured me if ever he had regretted the repugnance he felt to such a step it was on this occasion because he thought the projected union would be a happy and suitable one   171.07631143957
the count allowed him to pay the homage he felt due to him   105.74981957425292
accused said the president your name and surname   97.38109443907007
again he climbed the rocky height he had ascended the previous evening and strained his view to catch every peculiarity of the landscape   119.15734203640461
andrea ran to the other door leading to the gallery ready to rush out   102.92044655342296
i will not answer for it said monte cristo   130.76166499006962
others proposed the anguille another kind of recreation in which a handkerchief is filled with sand pebbles and two sous pieces when they have them which the wretches beat like a flail over the head and shoulders of the unhappy sufferer   55.70506765519648
the report was that he had been a naval officer who had been confined for plotting with the bonapartists   56.54600493444805
now we shall make use of your shoulder friend porthos if this door proves to be locked   85.46886003187359
open this book and i will swear upon it with my hand on the crucifix   63.06054349861297
madame danglars mechanically took the check the bond and the heap of bank notes   129.58226095808885
for one hour before monsieur athos who i will confide it to your majesty is really a man of the highest quality did me the honor after having dined with me to be conversing in the saloon of my hôtel with the duc de la trémouille and the comte de châlus who happened to be there   178.7110185119057
d artagnan came to his relief with his whip in his hand   89.27070921663372
yes i know that   200.99089403432254
morrel looked towards noirtier for permission to retire   168.61062716421736
15 a turkish pasha in command of the troops of a province   61.27641581674626
willingly said the cardinal   69.29135217181636
for a man so well off will never change his happy condition and i shall fail with him as i have already done with aramis   158.43310403654553
if you have been culpable it was imprudence and this imprudence was in obedience to the orders of your captain   104.53227088771108
halloo there grimaud olivain and blaisois   10.397029704900206
ah then you at length understand   137.2081113957127
he will not sail   53.3286323000057
but you continued m   128.49201457615845
what is the use of seeing me after we have made all our arrangements   75.0033539725062
dessessart ought to be his passport   110.30110763135734
then we will not talk of it until tomorrow   77.84407230741965
can i be deceived   53.029597044607144
my advice is this said monsieur d arminges and if needs be my will that we beat a retreat   72.53920620855537
the king saved we shall assemble our friends together we will head the puritans reconquer england   110.83537781467683
she saw that he took nothing and even noticed his gesture of refusal   184.74249976780834
indeed madame said monte cristo i scarcely know if i dare tell you where i am going   217.49709528715874
he had walked as one walks in a dream   91.77004526676242
what does the animal say   86.08515100312547
i state only what we all know   74.92708859000786
father cried maximilian how could you say the pharaon was lost   48.86620380441615
morrel followed her on tiptoe   133.5207670475045
i have no objection to that said aramis from whom the letter and the gold had removed as by magic his ideas of conversion   172.83023945586322
he had rolled down a declivity of twelve or fifteen feet   54.21928711892248
but i did so because i was happy because i had not courted death because to be cast upon a bed of rocks and seaweed seemed terrible because i was unwilling that i a creature made for the service of god should serve for food to the gulls and ravens   35.36476084364435
these gentlemen added he pointing to the bodies can not hear us   94.74276867883893
do not you recollect i came about six weeks ago to plead for clemency as i come today to plead for justice   155.6062380045271
albert was right   24.12661255555794
some provençal it appears   107.86550082421005
if we hesitate what will the servants do   83.33799339155809
the count had just opened a door   153.97494273331503
how can you read   120.58884840749997
attend to monsieur le cardinal gentlemen said d artagnan   156.29132192814944
in all three clerks and a half which for the time argued a very extensive clientage   36.411861412743534
i have heard here and there that this sister in law was a hussy   70.65191332676577
you are referring to the demands of the rebels and to the tone in which they stated them   144.8974648123493
you will assure us that justice yes yes   22.54014134711933
from habit that is all   156.59717446381842
a month of fever could not have changed her more than this one night of sleeplessness and sorrow   52.01339028613997
exclaimed a voice from behind the trees   63.3096034366605
screamed d artagnan throwing open the window   71.01120989404572
no said cromwell   33.94821967138134
well he did remain with them   137.3752372159941
if we release the prisoner thus we shall never know the truth   132.74193715179084
let the queen remain in perfect security   60.952580593795325
i call those first rate which are composed of treasures one possesses under one s hand such as mines lands and funded property in such states as france austria and england provided these treasures and property form a total of about a hundred millions   50.36287630029704
yes let us do so   89.06808957257738
of whom i bought her said monte cristo as i told you albert with the emerald which formed a match to the one i had made into a box for the purpose of holding my hashish pills   123.66087602458965
conclusion on the sixth of the following month the king in compliance with the promise he had made the cardinal to return to la rochelle left his capital still in amazement at the news which began to spread itself of buckingham s assassination   129.76092020850822
the queen remained silent   85.69978396823811
exclaimed at the same moment athos and aramis unmasking as they addressed the duc de beaufort whilst d artagnan and porthos stepped backward   189.12419370651048
bazin who was crossing the ante chamber majestically in his clerical dress turned around to see who the impertinent gentleman was who thus addressed him   92.814247820829
when daylight dawned he saw that he was near a stream   53.71007759027049
ah yes the hashish is beginning its work   52.52035906832914
and the roads were so bad that i brought back all this mud which i have not yet had time to remove   162.13910563786203
and in spite of bradshaw s gaze she has not turned pale   101.60440920618325
the other has many years to live   126.33889788419819
chrysostom kicking about famously the sheets of the thesis which had fallen on the floor   43.04408900768898
instinct made poor kitty guess a part of what was to happen   96.99922122002201
once more replied the major   138.17985842521375
to make you out a victim of the cardinal in order that the abbess may entertain no suspicion   173.7715986599269
sit down morrel and wait   164.17420294169267
it was thus and by mere accident may god pardon me if i blaspheme that he heard the confession of the executioner of bethune   75.897849523204
but who said it was buried alive   99.75665553608222
i will not too hastily tell you which but would rather leave you to guess it   134.0539728451146
and planchet ran to inform the other sentinels that it was useless to keep guard longer as his master had come out safe from the palais cardinal   156.18923395090434
and athos like the spectre of vengeance leaped into the room   110.14035322316637
it is our mission to forestall our duties   137.51309185434422
then casting an expressive glance at his betrothed which seemed to say fear not for your dear sake my justice shall be tempered with mercy and receiving a sweet and approving smile in return villefort departed with paradise in his heart   119.55137542881921
murmured the count   102.5795421122217
but the husband has been punished since and i have obtained full satisfaction   94.61517201288534
the other bowed respectfully and offered his arm to assist the count in descending   173.24101237521865
come and open then   163.58789414182365
the decanter was nearly full with the exception of a little which had been already drunk by m   151.10240193491512
mother nanette began by picking up the louis   130.75496725430887
d artagnan and planchet had hardly turned the corner when porthos recognized them   155.32756575060222
here they separated and bidding adieu to guitant in the court of the palais royal mazarin approached an officer who was walking up and down within that inclosure   79.22170774092595
as a result of the sympathetic devotion which jacopo had from the first bestowed on edmond the latter was moved to a certain degree of affection   87.21608965234068
i have heard monsieur d artagnan spoken of as a very brave young man said the citizen   54.13112557499772
now for my idea   57.168218431849525
no carriage to be had   129.68027559997324
and instead of the lively liquor expected by blaisois and mousqueton he found beneath his fingers the grains of some coarse powder   82.5787234860485
as soon as the plank was withdrawn the captain took his place at the tiller and made a sign to one of the sailors who boat hook in hand began to push out from the labyrinth of boats in which they were involved   98.94238926400399
but how shall we get back   101.25322388142908
he remembered the count of monte cristo   116.81866586895383
what unforseen events might not open his prison door and restore him to liberty   114.41036869748325
the englishman looked and was seized with astonishment   12.208079682164907
now how could a sailor find room in his pocket for a portfolio large enough to contain an official letter   123.51530542223826
well sir said the abbé you have spoken unreservedly   23.297617787289198
and about two o clock he had his two horses saddled and followed by planchet he quitted paris by the barriere de la villete   83.71841239427928
on seeing the prince they hastened to meet him   148.64446242910773
formerly a brewer replied the gascon   208.34626660053124
then fitting it into its place he said you removed this stone very carelessly   160.62044919272583
i know not if it is finished my beloved child said monte cristo taking the young girl s hands   121.64338113251404
you confuse me replied athos with his gentlemanly air   172.60601184252454
why bury it there if it were dead   167.8882337055691
in that case you will not get beyond bondy   125.69601275339375
if i should disturb a rendezvous that would not be the best means of commencing an acquaintance   92.74177775945276
in the name of heaven duke leave me go   212.79246824965537
the penknife was sharp and keen as a razor   49.596072586612074
some further discovery will be made which will bring this dreadful tragedy to a close   142.45206198182484
but mio caro did not reply   136.65215396766968
danglars accompanied him to the door where he again assured albert that no motive of personal hatred had influenced him against the count of morcerf   91.6986138712889
a greenish pallor spread over the count s cheeks and his eyes became bloodshot at these terrible imputations which were listened to by the assembly with ominous silence   95.79560398088934
he prayed and supplicated in terms so moving that even the officer was touched and although firm in his duty he kindly said my worthy friend let me beg of you to calm your apprehensions   102.03057441947001
all it seemed to say was it is not only your reserve which afflicts me   156.16175745899204
he will set out upon receiving an order from me without knowing what he carries and he will carry your majesty s letter without even knowing it is from your majesty to the address which is on it   134.48258325396085
to m   160.84572926399866
no but you can take out two or three boards of the partition answered blaisois and make a hole in the cask with a gimlet   52.06216390243502
a real father   148.59728583184986
we will fill our carriage with pistols blunderbusses and double barrelled guns   104.29153920859166
in the court are orange trees in pots turf and clumps of flowers   114.57294161055657
asked a voice   207.9405454561107
for if i were a father and felt such excessive grief as the old man does and did not find in my memory or heart all he is now saying i should throw myself into the sea at once for i could not bear it   232.33345321951236
now gentlemen said d artagnan go up to your room again   111.61665188401038
the goldsmith knew the duke   72.92799592564009
at least d artagnan said to himself as he took the road to villars cotterets at least i shall not be alone in my undertaking   39.53199688172285
that poor count de rochefort   83.87011302818543
after approaching milady with a slow and solemn step so that the table alone separated them the unknown took off his mask   61.06962224726374
i replied the gascon i believe in devotion as a word at one s baptism for instance which naturally comes before one s proper name   121.9441945796273
allies   72.62310275142318
villefort drew back and clasping his hands together exclaimed dead   159.35406150519853
you have friends left and the ashes i have already mentioned and above all the liberty i hasten to restore to you   161.52186151369335
he had read in the countenances of luigi and teresa their steadfast resolution not to surrender him and he drew from his pocket a purse full of gold which he offered to them   45.19665326148754
and at every one he uttered an exclamation which betrayed to his friend that he had not lost sight of the idea which possessed his brain   170.86126701552809
his face had lost the expression of careless gayety it had worn like a mask the whole day   100.7413493549654
then he entreated peppino as he would a guardian angel to give him food   160.34326706645948
why that is that you would have acted much more wisely if you had not required me to make myself known   174.93105317499757
he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum and again entered the cavern   34.68083199790854
at the end of three months he had learned to write   133.02045250459747
he is a millionaire and they have made him a baron and now he is the baron danglars with a fine residence in the rue du mont blanc with ten horses in his stables six footmen in his antechamber and i know not how many millions in his strongbox   110.30649699161654
you see i can not escape even if i intended   82.87670590622895
very well sir said the host i ll give the pie and the bottle of wine to your servant and in this way you will have the pen and ink into the bargain   141.09295416583208
at length i received this letter from your friend which states that my father is in paris and authorizes me to address myself to you for information respecting him   126.26385210485857
athos killed his adversary first   117.175674411718
they will no doubt bleed him   102.0891246489567
it is then interesting and even necessary that we should say a few words about it particularly as many details of this siege are connected in too important a manner with the story we have undertaken to relate to allow us to pass it over in silence   96.35138748657522
the countess left the arm of monte cristo and gathered a bunch of muscatel grapes   76.12570608289306
but you tell me also that the house of thomson french have constantly denied having rendered you this service   61.67697474064042
the man hearing nothing more stood erect and while monte cristo was completing his disguise had advanced straight to the secretaire whose lock was beginning to crack under his nightingale   142.24648594729638
i shall stay here for a few days longer   36.88238163139275
or kill yourself   131.8462101388318
there caressing as he pretended the animal with his hand he put this bit of burning tinder in his ear   161.2873696837149
and what else does your worship wish for   43.70411539526249
what have you done with that gentleman against whom you had the audacity about twelve days ago to make an accusation of passing false money   143.18666628415687
aramis hesitated   96.81746323985998
all noise in the streets had ceased and the silence was frightful   169.92568101215426
proceed was heard on all sides   73.43578728660671
she had almost all the honors of the quadrille and if she were envious of the count of san felice s daughter we will not undertake to say that carmela was not jealous of her   108.25066897727939
you have merited it more than any of us by your wisdom and your counsels always followed by such happy results   69.14282723267688
and you approve of what she said that is to say you declare that the signs which she mentioned are really those by means of which you are accustomed to convey your thoughts   93.3429400694152
your eminence said comminges as i was re conducting the young man for whom you have asked he approached the glass door of the gallery and gazed intently upon some object doubtless the picture by raphael which is opposite the door   166.03469656605327

he eagerly advanced and with the quickness of perception that no one but a prisoner possesses saw that there in all probability the opening must be   117.93548283016563
d artagnan knew what she wanted   147.50896204083557
at the third knock however steps were heard inside   64.38560895627448
fortunately as d artagnan had thought it was not dangerous   105.71725186896566
another whom he recognized as the one who had cried out courage   118.32955623220128

immediately on the arrival of m   149.99566775157118
cried felton oh pardon   59.820435718279164

when he reached the landing he placed the armchair on the floor and rapidly rolled it into valentine s room   127.69642945369868

and you reply i do not know   79.48691116784993
do you wish to speak to us   96.48858371710443
they cried   76.56623297025828
this amusement lasted from the barriere des sergens to the place of notre dame and friquet found in it very real enjoyment   62.113086447087205
they asked together   114.54146789122584
that is the very reason i refused to go back to brussels   142.6361020754282
ask that woman said the man in the red cloak for you may plainly see she knows me   92.66097667482276
and i think that by taking all these precautions we can be quite undisturbed   37.59249685275033

planchet proceeded toward the rue du colombier and d artagnan toward the rue férou   106.17438219489988
noirtier paler than even the young girl more eager than villefort for the decision was watching also intently and affectionately   81.15729457566087
your letter has frightened me and i have come hither with all speed   139.68240095317375
you are right that is the principle on which i wish to act   43.010410347363134
it is said to have been a congestion of the brain or apoplexy which is the same thing is it not   159.6306237080471
as a reply he wrote the following letter do not depend upon me madame for the next meeting   167.03092692962014
it could not be said that it was wine which produced this sadness   110.05627522753932
chapter 10   82.47580987374782
the generation who follow us are very precocious   86.73943947259394
and now said d artagnan to the governor s   122.09541991261244
his banker   197.19453301785518
touch me not   112.17351090256895

but i solemnly promise you to restrain all this ardor this fervor and intensity of feeling until you yourself shall require me to render them available in serving or assisting you   21.220320853057473
you know they are select affairs   136.04467945446754
how was this jealousy manifested   118.41043853003382
but since the end of the month m   61.13827250689469
and a first rate seaman one who had seen long and honorable service as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as that of morrel son replied danglars   153.4761677890687

roman bandits the next morning franz woke first and instantly rang the bell   141.56443276397277
i do not know if that is her reason said albert but one thing i do know that if this marriage be consummated it will render her quite miserable   140.72002623075136
villefort being called on to prove the crime was preparing his brief with the same ardor that he was accustomed to exercise when required to speak in criminal cases   90.02670955397345
why this evening said the abbess   110.37648934185613
just ask yourself my good fellow whether there are not many persons of our acquaintance who assume the names of lands and properties they never in their lives were masters of   204.38398065368898
you are born to good fortune said franz as he returned the letter   97.21844330953526
sir replied the mayor   85.8968768035299
collect all your courage for you have not yet heard all   94.04142839895897
the third act had begun   81.38718392856599
• you comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of project gutenberg™ works   82.39526337737948
so much penetration so much frankness created admiration but did not entirely remove his suspicions   100.05259482346129
well then madame yes i did feel fear   45.69087566257585
you leave me then   95.58477888871701
the monk exclaimed   163.41933124399753
then if i should require more continued monte cristo in a careless manner why of course i should draw upon you   145.62585846683305
the island of monte cristo thus at length by one of the unexpected strokes of fortune which sometimes befall those who have for a long time been the victims of an evil destiny dantès was about to secure the opportunity he wished for by simple and natural means and land on the island without incurring any suspicion   75.1126748076997
and believing that no one could execute the commission better than himself grimaud set off at full speed   129.01507623190054
valery he found a horse quite ready and awaiting him   141.53307179074514
the countess had this portrait painted during the count s absence   213.08448516282294
you have perhaps no money   141.0105076562166
these are mademoiselle eugénie danglars and mademoiselle louise d armilly   170.55539089062842
gentlemen said aramis the principal question is not to know which of our four lackeys is the most discreet the most strong the most clever or the most brave   144.2115798870567
but apropos you belong to the fronde do you not   92.07472806637817
well then so i will   145.17051783046207
but as we have said d artagnan paid no attention to this persistence of poor kitty   163.66812581933561
begone then   118.54270806009758
d artagnan thought it would suffice for him and he sprang forward like a dart between them   119.50122212152311
the good abbess had naturally consented to her request   70.12824733815549
this will be added noirtier with a smile one means by which you may a second time save me if the political balance should some day take another turn and cast you aloft while hurling me down   128.55604253098085
as for eugénie she was as strong as a judith or a delilah   148.5244643829769
he had only to turn his eyes on one side and allow andrea to fly and follow up the crime under that shadow of guilt called contempt of court   41.721417645336544
these are distinctions very suitable under a constitutional government   234.74042990686726
fourteen years   113.86661468115486
i was about to be mustered into the royal marines when he fell   120.21955799432295
cried friquet you re meddling too   38.03866955636386
bertuccio bowed and resumed his story   73.62634084660255
d épinay it is not perhaps the moment for mademoiselle valentine who is in deep distress to think of a husband   92.93818574537474
how fortunate that the ornaments were worth more than the watch   214.23431860835683
it would frighten you too much   139.2300940265397
you say then that the guardsmen sought a quarrel with the musketeers   140.90748353456644
so that for a trifling sum he was as well lodged and as perfectly shut out from observation as the inhabitants of the finest mansion in the faubourg st   99.10209227462914
i can not tell you that replied the inspector   91.54385298286246
don t you see in the darkness something pass by like shadows   116.38291412977874
one moment longer and all would disappear   120.33299309021362
noirtier s eye began to dilate and his eyelids trembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an individual about to speak and he darted a lightning glance at madame de villefort and his son   131.12105909340792
here is the paper   89.76299942598358
all these he bequeathed to me with a thousand roman crowns which he had in ready money on condition that i would have anniversary masses said for the repose of his soul and that i would draw up a genealogical tree and history of his house   82.01162294077439
for the rest in the memoirs of this period which has left so many memoirs one does not find this worthy gentleman blamed even by his enemies   27.43044516087754
with your talents you would make your fortune in three or four years   46.866557482948764
cried the king astounded   110.88562345925395
but quick as it was it did not escape d artagnan s observation   117.38133273411053
take care for i warn you that the first man that comes within the length of my sword and my sword is long i rip him up   96.57949012620017
the count dismissing his carriage followed him about a hundred paces behind   101.49082733174747
then he added monsieur you may rest assured i shall perform my duty impartially and that if he be innocent you shall not have appealed to me in vain   70.59244907915178
she loved villefort and he left her at the moment he was about to become her husband   126.68892997520555
i learned that she had been assassinated by my relation aided by four friends but i was already aware that i had been robbed of my wealth and degraded from my nobility by king charles i   68.58017431349322
so then the rabbit dies and justice takes no notice   104.07717799663742
at the moment when he opened the door such a gust of wind came in that the lamp was nearly extinguished   42.23505369987697
by a lackey named lubin   135.77384253409028
it is past noon said she and today is saturday   152.4118873652261
there were not lacking however evidences of what we may call the intelligent egoism of a youth who is charmed with the indolent careless life of an only son and who lives as it were in a gilded cage   152.60754580638644
it was then three o clock in the morning   195.0984648836929
porthos abated no doubt of his too great confidence by his adventure of chantilly played with skill and prudence   168.11338937806022
it is but you will not look will you   81.32263730065863
then turning without the least change of countenance to porthos he said looking him full in the face friend porthos listen to this   53.17777418621743
my lord perhaps they are not in paris   113.86502278161997
besides what a charming outlook it would have been to serve the cardinal   82.62804807445039
this is the first time i ever heard his name pronounced   33.51501654648243
your betrothed valentine de villefort   92.37679991754294
but i have still something left   91.24017920697334
yes doubtless replied d artagnan who had never been able to cram the first rudiments of that language into his head and who had by his ignorance driven his master to despair yes doubtless there is one   108.14606910096433
the pistols were loaded   108.6655500943635
and athos i don t see athos   149.63346001433848
how useless   137.5463580471836
monte cristo exchanged a ceremonious bow with m   112.85224628525532
dantès as we have said had traced the marks along the rocks and he had noticed that they led to a small creek which was hidden like the bath of some ancient nymph   89.09612378633369
take your glass then and let us drink   112.43268580022388
i know that i suffer that s all   99.42480944162205
he had stanched the wound and the man was better   50.01731460364268
cried the man in the name of heaven put your sword back into the sheath and don t kill me unheard   163.5794255897245
ah mon dieu yes you are right athos replied   116.57008891725842
nor indeed had she fallen into that state of depression where it is impossible to conceal the garb of misery   89.528198922311
who i believe is the mainspring of all this i confess said the cardinal   127.80590483468296
sir said beauchamp who had not yet spoken you appear to accuse the count who is absent from paris at this moment and can not justify himself   198.68420248299046
half an hour an hour an hour and a half elapsed and during this period of anguish edmond leaned over his friend his hand applied to his heart and felt the body gradually grow cold and the heart s pulsation become more and more deep and dull until at length it stopped   109.51547594120785
poor dear man he is innocence itself   82.15254388612277
alas what would become of me who can only atone for evil by doing good   133.96299806295863
there is not one in fact who would have dared to speak of me as i have spoken of them this day   60.668134103955495
richelieu the cardinal after having read these two lines sank into a profound reverie   76.4328250106853
andrea pretended to go towards the hotel of the cheval rouge but after leaning an instant against the door and hearing the last sound of the cab which was disappearing from view he went on his road and with a lusty stride soon traversed the space of two leagues   144.64613772317796
a better idea however came into her mind before going to bed   211.8842196950497
but where is athos now   48.01813222220767
but why should i meddle in the matter   135.665075564587
as for you illustrious descendant of william tell you will straightway get together your clothes which are in my room and which annoy me and go out quickly to another lodging   68.76860038715887
i am content to suffer and to await death   84.07988136435435
in the service of the four friends grimaud had had so frequent occasion to make lint and bandages that he had become something of a surgeon   143.55530073044423
the bolt gave way and the door opened   172.74426823615704
the clock was striking twelve   51.173996843204236
they both approached the window and through a slit in the shutter they saw bonacieux talking with a man in a cloak   106.79547929700698
certainly that is most in accord with your own principles replied milady frigidly   126.96675484088979
i had not yet fully recovered consciousness when again i heard groans mingled with half stifled cries as if from persons engaged in a deadly struggle   248.10414204764817
de wardes with such terrible coin   148.29512384191176
come one may easily see vicomte that you are lately from the provinces and have never so much as seen him   169.7315601506761
oh do you then know him   52.11645262913765
the count had just pulled the silken check string which was fastened to ali s finger   47.90891688460121
it is nothing   184.55841436746715
fresh inquiries will be made and the case will be tried next session by another magistrate   96.51848181733732
he was not however a good sleeper   158.9333158290724
what i am about to say is very serious   133.7740707195128
true replied the marquise without wincing in the slightest degree at the tragic remembrance thus called up   139.8118726329553
he came down into the kitchen where your doublet was   72.26225106943221
the real reason madame i can assure you   64.40108371996428
but unfortunately the cardinal was at the louvre with the king   60.600027813900525
and when we have seen the cardinal remember what i tell you athos we shall be reunited to our friends but not in the way you wish   77.39610460911194
show him in said milady in a quick tone but so piercing that d artagnan heard her in the antechamber   103.48991487392952
d artagnan returned to the rue tiquetonne with porthos still possessed by the wish to find out who the man was that he had killed   110.12548082264239
a night is soon passed   202.03499846123364
good day commander   86.2874922465017
he tried it on his left hand   76.81452507568883
all we can now do is to wait   41.25984942227204
we have plenty of thieves though not so many as is said   97.98485441327533
why then didn t you reply   154.42464307708948
now that you are no longer beside me i am afraid every moment of erring   106.04753637821705
chapter 78   112.8782416772622
nothing that would lead you to suppose   159.20681947942376
then it is settled   47.290207475346136
you are not judges   65.32224732095014
said mordaunt with a terrible smile   158.6559084719848
this was the gist of his strange story the first barrel that grimaud had found on passing into the compartment he struck it was empty   125.4297653558581
all that edmond had been able to do was to drag himself about a dozen paces forward to lean against a moss grown rock   160.76646375009915
as for the world it is a sepulcher and nothing else   193.1112516732925
sire i entreat you to do so   155.00700149226773
screamed patrick   104.73340096479289
exclaimed she   155.6610069701199
they then advanced two and two and saluted each other politely   117.21834548864963
one drop of that elixir sufficed to recall life to a dying child but three drops would have impelled the blood into his lungs in such a way as to have produced most violent palpitations   107.58621782058094
and you are the person whom m   143.25445735399455
those fellows strike hard and don t leave off in a hurry   97.86621256838137
she knew her brother in law to be a worthy gentleman a bold hunter an intrepid player enterprising with women but by no means remarkable for his skill in intrigues   71.36874294293605
it seems however that i have unconsciously stumbled upon the truth   132.70440240367097
i said danglars have always intended giving my daughter 500 000 francs as her dowry   34.575030268341294
this is recent news sir continued she and i thank you for having made such haste to bring it to me   23.89429090737545
if i had relaxed my hold for a moment i should have fallen   135.18588165153574
albert threw himself on the divan tore off the cover of two or three of the papers looked at the theatre announcements made a face seeing they gave an opera and not a ballet   123.86977817127642
you don t choose to discover yourself because you are the leader of an ambuscade returned d artagnan   154.7178130009395
d artagnan went last still shaking his head   89.10447769505123
i had often heard him complain of the disproportion of his rank with his fortune   70.13741938566955
i heard of it the day it happened   76.34634782415651
replace him on his orange horse and let him begone   165.137135376476
i was mistaken   22.38412485664786
my eyes pierce the inmost recesses of the earth and are dazzled at the sight of so much riches   38.22927254136768
i merely ask you did you not refuse to go to brussels for the queen whilst you had consented to go there to do some service for the late cardinal   82.1632556577948
thank god i am not a bravo   181.99744771767857
ah sire you recompense but badly this poor young man who has come so far and with so much ardor to give your majesty useful information   204.7771303547737
cried anne when he had retired stretching out her arm to the scarcely closed door one day i will make you drink the dregs of the atrocious gall you have poured out on me to day   80.47977658954588
oh yes replied the count   97.92823030402076
it seemed as though rome under the magic breath of some demon of the night had suddenly changed into a vast tomb   122.02611340201949
are you my friend caderousse   116.50525981597046
oh do not fear the scaffold madame said the magistrate   190.9919526733422
they promised indeed to negotiate with the pope for a cardinal s hat for him   163.8607963482134
those two words your mass and a simple glance cast upon felton revealed to her all the importance of the reply she was about to make   118.64071979155958
the other ten were sunk three hundred fathoms deep into the sea   136.62310963534688
come recover   135.16911857253464
at length he met a belated passenger went up to him and spoke a few words to him   65.40749051112087
at last she found out raoul and her eyes sparkled   140.45116071448092
to travel perhaps   46.89085322361984
without her captain   95.32111530312848
d artagnan did the same   10.187043344359509
amidst all these alternations of hope and fear the clock struck ten   5.457016576105204
get down into the longboat   48.49361994799807
where will he receive me   126.736598210174
he pardoned and having pardoned he remained   144.32899905142773
stop a bit said the abbé taking up what he called his pen and after dipping it into the ink he wrote on a piece of prepared linen with his left hand the first two or three words of the accusation   136.15222757451104
that sort of intoxication is not dangerous and will have no bad effects   111.97335226503111
the chocolate was inoffensive for m   86.8458742467594
very well monsieur said planchet   132.0213157884065
athos made him a sign to come with them   89.2069635488638
today arrives the firman of the master and my fate will be decided   68.19968076295527
and who recommended this man to you   134.268530947072
de la trémouille come out   155.80874235472575
breathing that sea breeze so much more invigorating and balsamic as the land is approached contemplating all the power of those preparations she was commissioned to destroy all the power of that army which she was to combat alone she a woman with a few bags of gold milady compared herself mentally to judith the terrible jewess when she penetrated the camp of the assyrians and beheld the enormous mass of chariots horses men and arms which a gesture of her hand was to dissipate like a cloud of smoke   103.81728175841565
for one day listen my son one day if you do so they will doom you to destruction head and crown too and then you will not be able to die with a calm conscience as i die   103.89735287633458
they were influenced by hatred by avarice and by self love   52.88414386303374
and you had no other object in coming to england but to see me   106.07068092728505
asked de comminges   144.5024889892306
if you do me sir such honor i shall be grateful all my life   127.52877907398212
said porthos with his loud laugh   185.58035905752672
the count recalled baptistin who had left the room after delivering the letter   94.88772523798214
if he returns to beaucaire without the diamond he will inform against us and as he says who knows if we shall ever again see the abbé busoni   165.25624797415736
the governor laughed   140.87614269416798
become a frondist my friend belong to the fronde and remember that i fill the count s place in everything   69.61978249986527
athos began to laugh for this juvenile escapade of his appeared to be as amusing as if some one had related it of another person   63.30384350147384
a mathematician might have calculated that in two years supposing that the rock was not encountered a passage twenty feet long and two feet broad might be formed   96.83569446441983
beppo told him he was going to take him to a villa a league from rome   95.689927222803
the conversation between milady and the cavalier was so animated that d artagnan stopped on the other side of the carriage without anyone but the pretty soubrette perceiving his presence   182.1989785191596
one evening he cast off the painter of a sailboat from the iron ring that secured it to the dock at leghorn wrapped himself in his coat and lay down and said to the crew to the island of elba   153.7206947724985
the young king slowly raised his little hand and held it out to the musketeer   148.40546160562897
the king is with us and his generals are the duke of orleans and the prince de condé although i must add tis almost impossible now to know to which party any one belongs   123.51442323017568
besides i believe between ourselves she did this in order to distract her mind that she might forget   87.52007187390512
it was scarcely eleven o clock in the morning and yet this morning had already brought him into disgrace with m   146.49802808601424
the age of this singular man who is of no age is then i am certain thirty five   128.83972465816436
these last words fell on mousqueton like a thunderbolt   175.35114718880288
sky blue velvet breeches fastened above the knee with diamond buckles   145.3673545627191
this uneasiness amounting almost to frenzy arose from the report morcerf s adventure had made in the world for the affair at the opera was generally known   78.44712348190691
d artagnan stopped before them and they stopped before him   153.51457159244828
then my friend take back this ring to which i see you attach much value   158.37989150266577
though mordaunt had been so completely taken by surprise and had mounted the stairs in such utter confusion when once seated he recovered himself as it were and prepared to seize any possible opportunity of escape   71.90382884916865
but of clement vii   141.77896102655663
30263m you   132.41002661626692
it is likely he replied that we shall soon be obliged to separate unless you love me well enough to follow me to italy   93.50199451818553
the door of their cabin was opened   93.4677143154302
dear lady said mme   116.38947282670901
the worthy merchant had been more fortunate   61.801100009100885
but on condition continued the prisoner that your highness will swear that my life shall be safe   117.44242723158195
you think me rather parsimonious don t you   120.575816098996
ah said monte cristo i did not expect that the affair would be so promptly concluded   169.22402053843336
said the sergeant with a cunning smile you are mazarinists who are sent as spies   148.54322064644467
how uneasy they must be at this moment at rueil and saint germain said aramis   109.79994525852781
in whom can i trust   109.42488098039496
i unknown and unperceived by them incite them to cry out long live the duke de beaufort one day   230.3793641708058
eugénie apparently calm although in all probability her heart beat somewhat faster than usual went out in her turn   104.54234641361482
he has done us the honor to remain here   137.68549737566454
so d artagnan began sir he said with desperate politeness it seems to me that you change your costume almost as rapidly as i have seen the italian mummers do whom the cardinal mazarin brought over from bergamo and whom he doubtless took you to see during your travels in france   21.229585424285474
bravery is always respected even in an enemy   95.13661602503552
he is in the small salon excellency returned bertuccio   201.11666333840105
speak comte de la fere   141.52129768770826
i see you to tell you that everything separates us the depths of the sea the enmity of kingdoms the sanctity of vows   193.35845773752663
de tréville began to disquiet the devil   57.629036854127506
perhaps there may be the bond of crime   100.95527236195825
lord de winter is not capable of such a crime   118.59696705073553
the guests were still at table and the heated and energetic conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then agitated each dweller of the south where unhappily for five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the violence of party feeling   120.63782237896997
come said the abbé closing his hiding place and pushing the bed back to its original situation let me hear your story   128.71171097801164
you do not know your own good fortune   106.3945432706943
i shall then be far away   38.20143651790566
but milady felt herself denounced even by his terror   116.7442185359023
on their part the three friends had reloaded their arms   131.69304738361504
he remained motionless on the spot pressing with his left hand something he had concealed under his coat   81.84259450956803
and now that you know who i am do me the honor to inform me who you are   58.949362375178175
i will pay twenty five piastres for my passage back to leghorn   156.40017220918986
by order of cromwell royal honors will be accorded to it   22.98590473381641
meantime here we are enemies   26.65387740344569
what do you want to ask these people   76.48945470416413
do not think so brisemont said d artagnan   110.32066208761844
that is the most just remark replied the stranger i ever heard made concerning myself   94.36110556013205
but if you are very well behaved you will be allowed to walk about and some day you will meet the governor and if he chooses to reply that is his affair   3.623480818909613
said the king to the two gentlemen who were held by d artagnan and porthos   182.36232360698665
danglars will not fight with me i will kill his son in law   88.16600014328733
don t you see how you are frightening us   83.66045779651941
possibly said monte cristo i have indeed thought of you but the magnetic wire i was guiding acted indeed without my knowledge   117.71605672257576
returned danglars   3.305774297684323
tomorrow   115.45955175158082
only i fancied that the honest messager was an exception to the rule and that it only announced telegraphic despatches   135.13745006396888
i will answer that question as well as the rest mr   118.21331291561813
certainly d artagnan said to himself he wishes to make me speak out   135.9134940912203
after having been for some time after the death of louis xiii   94.66699978932445
no sooner had he uttered this cry than the door opened and athos and aramis rushed out   95.69164049168505
he said raising his fine eyes to d artagnan moist with tears the count has left paris without seeing me   58.22513332725891
everyone had arrived almost before the usual hour and was conversing on the melancholy event which was to attract the attention of the public towards one of their most illustrious colleagues   39.98152122768266
to kill the turnkey   99.55686131042089
be calm for i am sure that d artagnan and porthos are at rueil alive and well   73.38981705630616
as to athos faithful to his system of reticence he contented himself with interrogating d artagnan by a look   83.91693639302648
the hour came for him to retire   84.72981380086134
nothing she replied with a violent effort   117.89251906233899
well said athos don t you hear monsieur de busigny who does you the honor to ask you a question   18.361785786690774
well you can ask my servant or rather him who will no longer be my servant tomorrow it was the talk of the house   180.7994986697088
i swear to you it is true   73.94027025966452
d artagnan then perceived a thing that he had not before remarked for nothing had led him to the examination that the ground trampled here and hoofmarked there presented confused traces of men and horses   146.95985239886528
it is very convenient then   116.81264973883522
the young man took his carbine and fired it in the air but without any idea that the noise could be heard at the distance which separated the yacht from the shore   113.90089029628483
said the young captain   208.68192198760102
madame replied d artagnan i have nought to say save that my life is ever at your majesty s service and that i shall only be happy the day i lose it for you   110.64228077431073
are they paid   51.22350030811868
at the slightest noise he bounded towards the door   170.57940935482634
the actors made their entries and exits unobserved or unthought of   151.31841883769968
about half past six   151.495361838405
monsieur you appear to be in great haste   93.6904681914799
yes they would have all been blown up   69.24535296204348
at your service sir he continued   110.06257247141694
sir cried the latter am i no longer at liberty to receive whom i choose in my house   171.0940703458434
by good luck it had not been extinguished   24.177247542258726
you cry very loud you end by doing nothing   40.070937652018415
the thing is done dear friend said athos   153.68524374782163
your host   121.01424096283735
at the foot of the staircase de winter stopped   137.45148460985558
now chevalier he added turning to aramis let us go   85.45448745433622
that is different replied monte cristo   117.2413184839528
he was however forced to hold his tongue from not comprehending half the language they employed   103.01186535145423
whatever news you bring speak out   127.24309277407144
like an impetuous mob a wave of human beings came to meet the carriage and rolled tumultuously into the rue saint honore   93.04245281481121
for who is there who does not say to himself in a society as incongruously organized as ours perhaps some day i shall have to do with the king s attorney   127.90711244022692
and is the reason known   114.1520143669554
said aramis the black points and the red points are visibly enlarging   113.79885010019468
i really did not remember   96.7427536346862
i know not why but i feel that this crime you acknowledge then the existence of the crime   154.02533808833024
you must know monsieur that marie michon when she returned to france in 1643 immediately sought for information about that child   75.2675036867223
but she added poor angel whom that monster of a gascon barely failed to kill   81.61765121801608
he has purchased the title of count somewhere in tuscany   108.33118727089597
de tréville m   50.99097297414163
danglars feelings were hurt and not wishing to put himself under obligations to the brute the banker threw himself down again on his goat skin and did not breathe another word   50.45803760171759
he therefore narrated to the prince what they had seen from the inn at mazingarbe   54.55142996040823
oh as i told you before i think the old fellow is very close   88.60310359949592
he found planchet all ready   102.9391680475247
he said there he is at his post   85.20565847608712
and where was that   118.6021343649228
he fixed his haughty eye upon the stranger and perceived a man of from forty to forty five years of age with black and piercing eyes pale complexion a strongly marked nose and a black and well shaped mustache   54.29121051296564
i swear it   59.81601409643665
chapter xl   70.56806593780348
on the contrary sir i have ten   172.62151786872346
the englishman delighted at having to do with a gentleman of such a kind disposition pressed d artagnan in his arms and paid a thousand compliments to the three musketeers and as porthos s adversary was already installed in the carriage and as aramis s had taken to his heels they had nothing to think about but the dead   138.2985363862325
eagerly demanded all his three friends   98.68093367919137
i took it and advanced towards the thicket   156.9970348324773
he was at the moment conversing cheerfully with morrel but he was well prepared for what might happen   88.15745283500294
we intend to visit the abbé scarron for whom i have a letter of introduction and at whose house i expect to meet some of my friends   124.26375639741116
the carriage rolled with a thundering noise over the pavement and everyone turned to notice the dazzling meteor   50.04954295815163
oh not a word said she in a concentrated voice not a word of all that i have said to you to this man or i am lost and it would be you you then as the steps drew near she became silent for fear of being heard applying with a gesture of infinite terror her beautiful hand to felton s mouth   116.102032173705
certainly not longer   170.40932478897548
but the host was unable to decide to which of the two nations the traveller belonged   57.936803498407365
would it not be a sweet revenge for him when he found that i had not died from the blow of his dagger   106.12331664478931
and your first is still living   75.05524357539522
adieu then edmond   126.3147805745505
i will not harm you   54.40356865860841
i yield to your protestations i yield to your assurances   157.1139290362516
we dined so very late hastily interposed la carconte   170.95545182741648
that will do said he   97.5908345319443
he fixed his eyes upon d artagnan even more earnestly than before   82.47279295613393
i narrowly escaped catching a fever there   83.09024668678497
you belong to the court doubtless yet i have never seen you at court   87.30016593245385
i fear i am committing a great imprudence   69.91832737452356
intrigues terrify me   155.04132641735245
then wait said aramis   73.58687827696635
farther on a still greater terror seized him on passing by the cemetery of st   62.090549680590364
my lord answered comminges he begs to be taken to the place where monsieur d artagnan is confined that is in the hunting lodge opposite the orangery   154.26854757493555
while the rest slept then we went away a short distance   58.41935124448067
i tell you it is too late   132.15706912053886
do you think she said with a ghastly smile that i shall be inclined to reopen this coffer to answer any future accusations   69.48142140887076
before a woman you would dare not fly i presume   70.58718236579605
noirtier made such an effort that his lips expanded into a smile   105.2746104357835
and yet you spoke of him at once   76.81327050816452
have what time you require dantès   51.51547020550284
but they may do as they please the brave gentlemen   127.59841734574442
you are a fool m   128.10481758868525
your italian prince   11.50156135911493
adieu dear friend   152.93852967326436
they need not have asked his sentiments which were well known   124.88519503498743
no for i will not allow you to do so   135.86569066683563
he dismounted and knocked on the door   87.20579018285198
here is the prisoner   55.3362506521633
i will do so   155.92328272564328
sell this ring a ring which comes from my sovereign   118.49983493648048
it is well said the abbé   165.7969536917937
this gentleman was a young man scarcely sixteen years of age now white with anger   105.00061033221239
unfortunately i have just breakfasted   186.79148848848183
their number was great   109.1150490508194
meanwhile raoul closely observed the young general already made so famous by the battles of rocroy fribourg and nordlingen   143.70164517887343
then he added so my friend it s your opinion that monsieur de beaufort will escape   163.34005504077464
my faith my good host said d artagnan filling the two glasses i asked for a bottle of your best wine and if you have deceived me you will be punished in what you have sinned   113.22965026078978
and with whom   30.493845482803465
since as i told you before i do not wish to comprehend it   114.0856270810167
murmured felton   30.238104981100648
listen said monte cristo   157.36618476508988
d artagnan i ask your pardon for having yesterday crossed swords with you   56.51712832228489
and improbable as it seemed at first it may be true   91.17887780270522
my dear friend said the baroness while the two young people were shaking hands i and eugénie are come to be the first to announce to you the approaching marriage of my daughter with prince cavalcanti   116.617236624891
that s unpardonable in a man of your age and who besides has such a pretty wife as yours   130.7123792631358
and he awaited with impatience the moment always in the future when aramis would throw aside the uniform and assume the cassock   137.01592967892987
felton cried she you are as great as judas maccabeus   156.10047055535765
each of you take a horse by the bridle he said to porthos and mousqueton   90.32896718598474
the people were in an excited mood but like a swarm of frightened bees seemed not to know at what point to concentrate   83.5894391807105
this first moment had been delayed five days which under any other circumstances might have appeared rather long to m   111.88222180577785
ali sprung forwards imitating the action of one throwing the lasso then of a strangled lion   138.55099200324548
scarcely however had he touched edmond s hand when he felt he had done all he could do and rushed hastily out of the house   117.42798578914247
i have given the signal   131.59179613515434
danglars resembled a timid animal excited in the chase   99.49589163920298
germain or in the pré aux clercs   48.32883773149128
did he not conduct you to the ruins of the colosseum and suck your blood   136.1022550333518
but all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which was familiar to d artagnan and a well known voice said monsieur i have brought your cloak   90.61737826256272
the vessel resembled a swan with its wings opened towards the wind gliding on the water   107.88352920405956
an infamous scoundrel monseigneur a scoundrel   123.2863344356961
when they had advanced about twenty yards danglars looked back and saw fernand stoop pick up the crumpled paper and putting it into his pocket then rush out of the arbor towards pillon   83.57126691219968
her usual feverish tremulousness was intensified her countenance had become livid and her eyes resembled burning coals   141.4881025917059
ten minutes elapsed during which d artagnan made every effort to read through the first envelope what was written on the second   162.96847850885007
that the enemy have left the town and are now closing the passages of the tyne against us   74.4359223821172
father and daughter we saw in a preceding chapter how madame danglars went formally to announce to madame de villefort the approaching marriage of eugénie danglars and m   191.8204530927324
here are more than 4 000 francs settled on you   197.82884514633196
de tréville had the right of entry at all times   121.72832012418966
the monks had no longer an instant of repose   139.17599641357845
to calais said d artagnan   159.24964148192268
you know that with bankers nothing but a written document will be valid   36.798917740600615
fortunately he had no opportunity to give the duke this proof of his devotion and the young woman and the handsome musketeer entered the louvre by the wicket of the echelle without any interference   52.42882382183438
he only changed his sword hand and fought with his left hand   143.86154559421436
but by careful search it might be recovered   88.49460115096859
all these preparations had collected a number of idlers round the door of signor pastrini s   141.711675681475
dessessart pointing to d artagnan   33.12373636811658
albert rose   69.39304670390354
the count opened the letter and read m   152.7598898105822
i learned it since i have been in prison and that from the conversation of monsieur the commissary an amiable man   246.15991570311547
coquenard is going to the house of the duc de chaulnes who has sent for him   168.59070855961943
cried the young queen affecting surprise you are giving me then two more i shall have fourteen   161.52986729739052
i understand that mazarin is at this very moment extremely uneasy as to the state of affairs   99.06408286607966
they will not be strangers they will be friends   98.30105131162918
and it was of this man that i intended to ask shelter   139.64349900315605
open the door then my lord and be so good as to remember once for all that on the slightest attempt to escape or the faintest cry for help our position being very critical indeed you must not be angry with us if we go to extremities   71.43166141866257
would it be impertinent signor sinbad said franz to ask you the particulars of this kindness   61.273345075113866
and withdrawing the knife from the wound in rita s bosom he held it out to the old man with one hand while with the other he tore open his vest   120.53012631311773
on the steps of the scaffold death tears off the mask that has been worn through life and the real visage is disclosed   95.76439522270269
but doctor you see me already so grieved how can i introduce into my house so much scandal after so much sorrow   98.10932521728094
ried in a place he knows   37.75775871967616
and what a coat sir for a prince of the cavalcanti   131.10637076100633
can we have destroyed them all from the first to the last   83.81608767057357
what a noise behind us   208.7453973854247
he owes money to the office and is backward in his pay   224.9233721747794
that is true murmured mazarin in a low tone but as thy life is not mine i suppose i must buy it must i not   95.06602294673914
the pistol fell from his hands   153.90548911525747
i forgot you and m   87.99725526302066
i will show you the way and he went in first   8.247718542660422
the marquis took his arm and they left the salon   106.14515234971596
but albert a first rate pugilist sent them rolling in the street one after the other and continued his course towards the church of san giacomo   77.15384995930889
he cried this time we shall be pursued   91.03257309722507
the count again struck the gong   69.7077050340877
well he received in the scrimmage a sword stroke on the head   132.31761998038337
it is certainly ten years since the house had been occupied said château renaud and it was quite melancholy to look at it with the blinds closed the doors locked and the weeds in the court   109.49555841616088
and with this fearful injunction the count disappeared through the door which noiselessly closed after him   154.31015036430622
your excellency said the man you are fully persuaded of my entire devotion to you are you not   144.26162518074793
thank you madame said mazarin   126.23151520931607
from what you relate i suppose it to have been the evening of madame de saint méran s death   194.0136674186246
if the letter must be written under your censure my faith i renounce the task   117.01903177221217
it would be difficult to say whether his emotion were caused by fear or passion   151.49482786641425
ough   145.22085770105102
no valentine for i have foreseen all their plots   106.21638228712533
to know if you have seen a young man pass fifteen years of age mounted on a chestnut horse and followed by a groom   108.17423654869302
i only love him and a young girl called mercédès   144.86943973101842
but i shall explain to him your state of health and make excuses for you for the scene can not fail of being a most ridiculous one   215.0943987583954
then suddenly pausing he added your pardon sire but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget not the respect i have for that is too deeply engraved in my heart but the rules of etiquette   75.22561219022877
as he thought thus he looked alternately at the window with red curtains and the three windows with white curtains   180.5201689596248
but apropos of debray how is it that i have not seen him lately at the baron s house   132.2724701404702
nevertheless i perceive some hidden plot in the arrangement something in fact more than is apparent on a casual view of the subject   122.5836338499984
is it my fault if fortune which has frowned on you has been kind to me   94.98408761980001
said d artagnan by heaven   96.61913652902501
de tréville s recommendation recurred this animal will end by making me afraid   47.4729627872713
i once thought continued faria of removing these iron bars and letting myself down from the window which as you see is somewhat wider than yours although i should have enlarged it still more preparatory to my flight   101.94176931318553
i had a bad opinion of him the moment i saw his wound and since he asked for a monk you know that it was his opinion too that death would follow   114.9809840191581
they did not know if it was a comedy monte cristo was playing but every word he uttered had such an air of simplicity that it was impossible to suppose what he said was false besides why should he tell a falsehood   120.65525103072403
andrea assumed his most charming smile and asked if he could have no   75.184709624236
de salvieux   131.48022280023653
that mood lasted some time   160.94189747769033
beauchamp   80.77148067524227
very well monsieur   176.62761529111464
however i hope you will excuse the two or three seconds i am behindhand   50.034564027331
then overcoming his manifest repugnance he pronounced the required oath but in so low a tone as to be scarcely audible to the majority of the members who insisted on his repeating it clearly and distinctly which he did   111.18368232570688
i can scarcely contain myself at the bare idea   94.02853377633744
his colorless hair was short and scarcely extended beyond the circle formed by the hat around his head and his light blue eyes seemed destitute of any expression   197.46768557623238
i however do not understand said porthos   68.91820229252954
i do not quite understand you replied franz   176.62574159912873
the event which had occurred had in some degree broken the thread of his ideas   51.27336903280706
in the first place do you accept   60.40120621635009
yesterday he wrote again   157.28651947694578
we have supplicated heaven in vain to grant us this favor but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we can not comprehend we have been guided by an invisible hand a hand as powerful as that of an enchanter   119.30930269950974
you are right said the duke   110.36032991237042
not exactly replied the mendicant   149.0095238930753
it was still about a quarter full as we before stated   62.16339095138322
monte cristo entered the tower which was divided into three stories   205.87645448663386
asked the monk   176.869781738434
to this flow of words not perhaps in the best taste but characteristic of d artagnan whose principal object was to divert his opponent s attention mordaunt did not reply but continuing to turn around he succeeded in changing places with d artagnan   142.75983856985746
it had been agreed that the old man should express his approbation by closing his eyes his refusal by winking them several times and if he had some desire or feeling to express he raised them to heaven   66.50839794438451
we do conspire as your eminence might have seen the other morning   135.28426186603832
why sir a man of about fifty   56.54960212071331
so you hate each other   71.39732195749211
on the contrary let us speak about it   120.87184551318603
the musketeer met with a superb andalusian horse black as jet nostrils of fire legs clean and elegant rising six years   161.05047934201755
compelled as they were to await a night sufficiently dark to favor their flight they were obliged to defer their final attempt till that auspicious moment should arrive   107.22703327893248
but first let haydée be informed that i have returned   120.32183376542261
i congratulate him upon it   90.81754063096828
then i should like to have three sons   68.84716573427876
he extended his hand and rang the bell thrice   17.934741802642776
at that moment porthos entered   94.44093161803534
seek then my lord seek these gentlemen   104.10597897370826
lord winter s tent was pitched by the side of the royal marquee a kind of corridor communicating between the two   172.98480339755235
you looked more like a brigand than an honest man with your beard six inches and your hair a foot long   141.91791933513218
besides it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at paris that you should not see one anywhere else   138.74075234853652
yes yes guitant said mazarin   110.63771328349482
someone was walking down before them and this person hearing the rustling of a silk dress turned around   125.01983821474809
i will not torment you much but only on condition that you become a frondist my young friend and a hearty frondist too   93.44544482620434
they have vexed you and you are angry   90.94531526900201
his horse had received a bullet in his neck and he had difficulty in controlling him maddened by pain   177.05172026206893
de villefort sent to tell valentine to be ready in the drawing room in half an hour as he expected the notary and m   99.98143871966941
then bending his face down to athos s ear what is the object of this visit   179.92153272496034
it is unnecessary for you to understand   53.78646680625928
said he it is a pity they are not really related   102.44833936234099
that evening continued bertuccio i could have killed the procureur but as i was not sufficiently acquainted with the neighborhood i was fearful of not killing him on the spot and that if his cries were overheard i might be taken   63.42410530670097
said d artagnan to the youth   66.7154148226243
the woman gazed at it a moment and then said in a gloomy voice suppose it s false   83.2232652019001
on my soul handsome stirrups   35.465254333740944
but how the devil would you have me retire on twelve hundred francs   58.675627419981744
however the sight of the emerald made them naturally incline to the former belief   100.3580336941497
and how does it concern me what you have learned   132.5655875258873
you know how difficult it is to discover the truth   98.91607144200005
then in spite of the failure of his first search he began a second after having told gaetano to roast one of the two kids   151.32067627913042
notwithstanding the judges were so few the trial was to continue   104.90668109057862
but i only came back on one condition that i would transmit to your majesty the will of the people   244.63712117397512
believe me madame as true a thing as it is that a heart beats in this bosom a heart devoted to you believe that you have been the idol of our lives   126.35556721161527
sign the liberation of milady de winter said felton holding out a paper to the duke   111.90439866676468
de wardes that provoked her thus   145.62472864359464
now then said d artagnan this is something like   179.48784029303306
this embarrassment had completely escaped albert but it caused lucien to shorten his visit   95.67446139805575
he had not even a knitting needle   130.40803881200753
with regard to d artagnan we know how he was lodged and we have already made acquaintance with his lackey master planchet   74.21274421862674
he proceeded slowly and in deep reverie   74.84002143851494
none sir   116.70919245873068
yes and your conversation is most interesting   154.13610509209167
and kourchid pointed out one who had more than any contributed to the death of my father said haydée in a tone of chastened anger   116.42875411769496
and bernouin do i not take him with me   132.70838403285495
and i shall be together with my brother in law emmanuel at the disposition of the count whenever he thinks fit to honor us   118.51983241291882
and he added with a smile he will consequently make a few changes in his personal appearance   96.75566127430542
she has always believed me sire to be her enemy   122.15592691203574
d artagnan stretched out his arm in which he held the lantern put his head in at the half opened door and seeing that the cabin was nothing better than a shed good he said   66.80495514994927
you will enter by the rue neuve sainte catherine   58.20813443828121
at the same instant four men armed to the teeth entered by side doors and rushed upon athos   54.209093472260356
let us go in said monte cristo   201.76114903407088
you forgive me then sir said raoul and you will deign to tell me who is the person that you call the young indian   148.1693003796103
fortunately as we have said they were within a hundred paces of the city   67.56618403523407
that is because we are talking spanish my dear friend said athos   96.03089937762499
and walking in a straight line he went to the wall at the foot of which they all four arrived at the same instant   83.05593903522566
it was the first billet he had received   90.14946977276571
and i too he exclaimed in a low voice i unite with m   145.23730200135927
i ought to have known you better by this time   107.61530228388122
to the boats my lads as quick as you can   160.5224426356923
albert took the letter opened and read it then looked round for bertuccio but he was gone   8.44486742788456
this brought back to franz in spite of himself the recollection of the terror with which the count had inspired the countess g and her firm conviction that the man in the opposite box was a vampire   94.48479242387221
better then pursue our enterprise   156.4554163316542
come said danglars will you take a million   58.75647665981545
they were at that part of the quai des ormes where the steps lead down to the river   104.01109386153803
but nevertheless i retain the privilege of laughing when i please   184.92140615698867
he was a medical man i think   117.7242258787881
i married her in opposition to the wishes of all my family   115.52131906174098
but the count completely baffled the procureur and prevented him from discovering anything beneath the never varying smile he was so constantly in the habit of assuming   132.4737053468945
we shed we mingled our blood together and too probably i may still add that there may be yet a bond between us closer even than that of friendship   15.862932991439664
long live the emperor   116.07481744613135
in his arms he held the child whom no skill had been able to recall to life   131.86742507839344
albert however hoped to indemnify himself for all these slights and indifferences during the carnival knowing full well that among the different states and kingdoms in which this festivity is celebrated rome is the spot where even the wisest and gravest throw off the usual rigidity of their lives and deign to mingle in the follies of this time of liberty and relaxation   47.51573425810743
that was a superb throw so i left off there   138.30869133904406
mademoiselle de villefort is in deep sorrow is she not   96.78981214872995
a probable thing   67.9295032229463
he would break you like glass   68.54175327416786
he had but one thought to go forward   121.01481516284865
i do this oh my god said he with his eyes raised to heaven as much for thy honor as for mine   84.4124513735764
this letter as he spoke maximilian drew a letter from the purse and gave it to the count this letter was written by him the day that my father had taken a desperate resolution and this diamond was given by the generous unknown to my sister as her dowry   96.89879873919065
the steward s emotion had continued to augment as they entered the village   101.54817223792129
well said d artagnan rising we have them friend porthos and even something better   66.58194314065446
but would it be just to allow me to go to a possible death without having given me at least something more than hope   59.815931156013455
and then he like the first saluted the nocturnal visitors making a sign that they might proceed   151.79280999175626
i shall leave you the saucepan and pour your soup into that   130.5824802644643
yes yes edmond that is true but you forgot at that time a little debt to our neighbor caderousse   100.33644209443456
so i will not abandon this bouquet   137.47474690011566
my friend my father said morrel with excitement have a care i again repeat for the power you wield over me alarms me   39.58158897731835
you will know presently my friend   73.63768206466221
if you repent there is still time   94.98943587762993
he proceeded toward his abode very thoughtfully looking behind him from time to him to contemplate the dark and silent frontage of the louvre   46.98468764137867
the nocturnal visitor ignorant of the fact that the count had removed the staples might now think himself at home and pursue his purpose with full security   195.22777166046637
come continued athos executioner do your duty   114.26326341250791
but once free and placed in communication with laporte matters resumed their course and she accomplished the perilous enterprise which but for her arrest would have been executed three days earlier   141.7107892193488
for the first three days i heard him walking about as usual but on the fourth i heard nothing   69.05554748125496
i am all attention said d artagnan   132.4864159121806
were you condemned were you innocent were you a martyr replied felton the greater would be the necessity for prayer   142.51037660713695
did you fancy yourself dying   105.88195844162178
come then said the prince   141.91364070779582
from england   46.1512123961451
it matters little   117.04524108112189
i am not difficult of access sir   168.45655204140724
and as he was very avaricious he was in an excellent humor   141.22366478726929
but why don t you come there also   94.83602392363659
welcome   94.13044695774332
give way   113.42020396116365

he went down to the stables picked out a pie bald andalusian horse saddled and bridled it himself for athos had advised him to trust no one with those important offices at a time of danger and went to rejoin the prince who at that moment mounted his horse   135.8977914888612
i shall get them all in time   78.59389935299066
cried the young girl extending her hand through the opening and seizing maximilian by his coat for she understood from her own agitated feelings that her lover s calmness could not be real   109.26063398324615
the accusation m   126.79931943141321
his father went up to him took him in his arms and kissed his forehead   90.12301368354211
and what was it   85.61532725068889
mordaunt made a last effort rose seized the hand thus extended to him and grasped it with the vehemence of despair   79.72214556267745
how can we be implicated in any way   88.14970802946094
and the tremulous voice of dantès surprised in the midst of his happiness struck a sympathetic chord in his own bosom he also was on the point of being married and he was summoned from his own happiness to destroy that of another   196.41185730458466
chapter 46   174.47856990462572
but you sent for me my dear child   78.04415544443881
too many diamonds too much gold and splendor are now reflected by the mirror in which monte cristo seeks to behold dantès   101.65243607511692
for that party no one dares openly to recruit and when people recruit for it it is with averted eyes and humble voice   201.97732806392264
you may madame said he with emphasis   101.72377071781969
this time the lieutenant did not wait for the opposite party to speak   119.78534107464559
he went into his cabin and came back with a brace of pistols   111.4168564489798
have you decided   104.40716455708095
all the servants surrounded her offering her assistance   121.15372894893467
that s all that is necessary said athos   115.18257078878669
who has displeased you   25.771752510445552
i see nothing in that very extraordinary   114.81299810171296
franz found himself in utter darkness   124.53501154433697
valentine shuddered   132.11971788098984
when one is going to be married there is nothing like implicit confidence   93.07075632889118
that s true murmured the commissary   108.19273949499674
in falling my hand relaxing its hold of the laburnum felt the coldness of the stone   1.0362199910920964
on the morning of the eighth day bazin fresh as ever and smiling according to custom entered the cabaret of the parpaillot as the four friends were sitting down to breakfast saying as had been agreed upon monsieur aramis the answer from your cousin   206.29982559390183
let me see continued the stranger i am one of your largest creditors   107.32662215929967
but the mazzolata still remains which is a very curious punishment when seen for the first time and even the second while the other as you must know is very simple   79.42966745389668
because it has awakened and has begun to beat again because i have yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast by a woman s voice   159.03964762672203
stir but a step said they and you are a dead man   150.96947622704073
what does she say   163.295257057924
d artagnan relates that on his first visit to m   126.3326369240085
his thin face deeply furrowed by care and the bold outline of his strongly marked features betokened a man more accustomed to exercise his mental faculties than his physical strength   163.73517248807062
shall i see you again before your departure   187.79642846703024
danglars looked absolutely stupefied   121.66166705905128
inconvenience us   64.00560281445915
some time has elapsed since our plans were formed and they are not yet executed   86.46049003532627
he must be indeed a strange man   47.37944896408557
you go to madame d aguillon s and you pay your court to her   165.0260441880077
but you are wounded it seems said planchet   203.482938927642
not a sound was heard in the castle except of a footstep up and down in the chamber above as he supposed the bedroom of athos   119.69559372329104
but let us see   127.0887099737054
believe me i know the people   130.0313630084998
his energetic spirit that would have exalted in thus revisiting the past was imprisoned like an eagle in a cage   96.37481035705505
felton no doubt felt within himself that his strength was abandoning him and he made several steps toward the door   115.66127374928486
but do you believe you could arrest the progress of two horses rushing forwards with ungovernable fury   49.50659829421425
but said he so long as i do remain in paris and nothing forces me to quit it do you mean to tell me that i may rely on receiving the sum you just now mentioned to me   210.22569935199203
was it m   144.0274786815965
don t be distressed   215.0501393603895
the deep glow of indignation suffused the cheeks of dantès   16.7342878507812
for three months i watched m   55.63841409095435
the coal black hair large bright glittering eyes in which a wild unearthly fire seems burning the same ghastly paleness   92.20379121627732
meantime aramis had drawn near to the coadjutor who smiling all the while contrived to drop some words into his ear   25.967159557522493
sire it was impossible to learn   40.37709890656882
yes but you understand french and mazarin laid his hand upon guitant s shoulder   163.25053100988296
well every time i have seen mercédès come into the city she has been accompanied by a tall strapping black eyed catalan with a red complexion brown skin and fierce air whom she calls cousin   134.61895157706772
the town is in open revolt and just now as i was crossing the rue montorgueil with monsieur du vallon who is here and is your humble servant they wanted in spite of my uniform or perhaps because of my uniform to make us cry long live broussel   137.8687114637374
she had just poisoned a young woman who was her rival and before leaving england she had it was believed caused the favorite of the king to be murdered   182.32883826802663
said emmanuel thinking of morcerf and danglars   151.78627115174714
their apparent bickerings are only feints to deceive fools   110.80652590949383
but why should it   185.6206812226834
d artagnan who had loved him so tenderly loved him still although a mazarinist   85.10485584766201
ah said he we have at pisa ugolino s tower   82.91725289820522
and that is what is amusing you at this moment   132.96221226486057
during the days of his prosperity not a festivity took place without himself and wife being among the spectators   128.99560439100594
i heard they had fallen victims to their sorrow and perhaps to their poverty   73.49570317878756
how long did the queen remain out of the chamber   150.77467215439736
chapter xiii   42.54989796175937
aramis smiled   36.84547791356704
why from the french government   109.17673550259259
this silence self control and struggle lasted about twenty seconds then the count raised his pallid face   74.9796980915065
an instant after porthos and aramis re entered the surgeon and m   171.798517419788
the cavalier addressed some words in english to his sister   126.49060748612219
you are right exclaimed danglars rising quickly i will write today   134.99839635446864
these men are the ones who saved her   127.03357972274831
that manoeuvre has saved my life several times   147.618330152473
in the course of a quarter of an hour everyone had assembled in the chamber of the paralytic   72.95757505571493
take the hundred pistoles   118.43831594222641
but if it should occur to me presently i will tell you   107.52262372238016
the spectators followed the little vessel with their eyes as long as it remained visible   91.47802183294428
seven or eight leagues at the most   168.16758106208223
when the emperor returned from the island of elba my brother instantly joined the army was slightly wounded at waterloo and retired with the army beyond the loire   123.58902663048595
friquet had put on his sunday clothes under the pretext of having a swollen face which he had managed to simulate by introducing a handful of cherry kernels into one side of his mouth and had procured a whole holiday from bazin   138.28203212318368
the soldiers seized dantès who followed passively   104.93338065895276
you should install yourself here and cheer my solitude   117.33307779485855
one of the forty methods of escape of the duc de beaufort   150.35249537608894
valentine looked at him a moment with her large scrutinizing eyes endeavoring not to let morrel discover the grief which struggled in her heart   99.46874804174422
he was struck by a sudden idea   159.14798503222798
sit down at the table and let us drink   130.2716452641817
said d artagnan to raoul you were just in time to stay my hand   85.75191638413192
i will then   134.7046941361334
i beg you therefore to excuse if you find anything in me too turkish too italian or too arabian   118.69001620667837
his room like all those on the same floor had but one outlet to the gallery in the sight of everybody   96.51287271534595
bazin my friend said aramis i believe you meddle with my conversation   114.98605534353078
tell your good superior that in order that we may be as much together as possible you ask her permission to share my repast   150.01415022051404
well observed franz this chief is very polite and i see no objection the more so as i bring my share of the supper   93.49869670618395
why bind thee   69.25526372619076
and you abuse my love   211.55143210494768
i shall buy a chestnut colored suit   143.19448022365697
the man at the telegraph said he must either engage a gardener or devote himself passionately to agriculture   75.6220872513245
four men always supporting one another never yielding executing singly or together the resolutions formed in common   105.93227593621687
you will have the horses fully equipped monsieur   112.95276596034628
the half pistole is for me   125.21428007476571
raoul went out and when athos heard his young joyous voice calling to grimaud and olivain he sighed   74.79034856707683
i gave the custom house officers a copy of our bill of lading   101.46938017319394
500 000   144.3282063479422
see said d avrigny to villefort nature knows how to alleviate the deepest sorrow   120.38258713614832
everything is possible said monte cristo rising from the bench on which he had been sitting   155.4175010838858
sir said the baroness humbly are you not aware that the man employed there was dismissed that they talked of going to law with him that orders were issued to arrest him and that this order would have been put into execution if he had not escaped by flight which proves that he was either mad or guilty   151.02144689671718
exclaimed the countess   108.6774245276404
i will give them to you on condition that you let me go   87.0073987977245
both of them attempted to lead his prisoner off the battle field   146.20219647488722
be christians   90.46976361244552
but still he is charged with what   108.45490122687266
farther still perhaps   16.74589037716835
the young officer stood upright before her awaiting her words as if to devour them   189.85194565164863
and what i have told you is really the case added to the ill humor you remarked but which i did not think it worth while to allude to   116.14593114519147
richelieu whom they hated during his lifetime and whom they now praise after his death was even less popular than i am   50.742965511140625
help help help   68.27795318305219
for i am aware that m   222.84300461096035
i am going said albert as he made his parting bow   49.66419707671528
now for the wager   178.66518935419052
the other was a convent of jesuits and was the property a by no means unusual circumstance of these worthy fathers   97.0286119629537
you have called haydée your sister let her become so indeed valentine   193.91877247903201
oh pray name it   64.02871881006504
i paused but i had already drunk half a glass   75.01013449069437
i then perceived that he was hiding something under his mantle which he laid on the grass in order to dig more freely   123.50224778539632
behind a glass window by the light of the cardinal s lantern which had been placed on the floor in the midst of the gallery they saw the orange and pomegranate trees of the castle of rueil in long lines forming one great alley and two smaller side alleys   131.8579637421872
he was a man between thirty nine and forty years of age of medium height but a very well proportioned figure   114.72357281614258
as well as i could judge by the light of the sun the day was already two thirds gone   58.94558583724273
from dieppe   159.04412026231938
at times he thought of those brave french gentlemen who had appeared to him from a distance of a hundred leagues fabulous and unreal like the forms that appear in dreams   116.2259642367337
i speak of the adventure eh you know well what i mean   190.05873289777554
follow us planchet   131.35207289578648
let my lord at two o clock ask leave to make up a game at tennis with la ramee and let him send two or three balls over the ramparts   90.67164227931151
what is that line   166.83138664234264
the cemetery of père lachaise chapter 106   122.07081227905809
well what   90.39363257310129
but said d artagnan now i think of it what is to prevent our beginning to night   67.7046973152323
this time it was the hour and from this moment milady waited with impatience   147.82662348276466
the pupils of his eyes as he gazed at monte cristo dilated horribly   122.59065813466239
but i forgot added the gascon smiling pardon i forgot you are no longer athos   93.88734391196289
he is said monte cristo   162.13855153507473
i have no doubt of it   64.79153089916417
de morcerf so early   125.77357980165239
and grimaud threw the dagger on the table   135.35947199396796
come he was the first of us to go   173.67834442083193
the affair was not long i assure you   133.8662477007133
only this cellar has a ventilating hole   137.2471925965303
but you know that even such an acquaintance as that might warrant my doing what you ask   122.37327141168203
the thing suited him wonderfully well   86.97319855558399
nevertheless you come as one in authority   130.3991345436254
the musketeers rode the whole length of the faubourg saint antoine and of the road to vincennes and soon found themselves out of the town then in a forest and then within sight of a village   103.3558606578495
here it is sir and the sailor took from his coat a handkerchief tied at each corner   162.65111774143125
cried porthos like the crows you always bring bad omens   8.627294506531541
but what is the matter albert   142.77385915295105
does this oath satisfy you   48.811159528628224
exclaimed athos smiling you have a duel in prospect   53.290394803059556
i had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a hillock and in the light of the sun its black arms bending in every direction always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle and i assure you it was never without emotion that i gazed on it for i could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the opposite extremity and all this effected by a simple act of volition on the part of the sender of the message   63.257914198869486
but i have since learned that you had that right   89.41951367713939
pray don t heed him sir   159.7714143318637
then in the midst of the songs of his sailors songs so clear and sonorous that they would have made a divine harmony had their notes been taken down he saw the island of monte cristo no longer as a threatening rock in the midst of the waves but as an oasis in the desert   95.93658563840559
well that she may have no doubt on that head i will go and inform her myself   177.57163955035045
but what do i see in the water something struggling   0.04715380005036707
she turned upon him no longer like a furious woman but like a wounded panther   139.2363245957062
au revoir then   68.5621833019556
how strange that it should not have occurred to me before   52.86411021830972
i have one but not one from cardinal mazarin   79.13123722273207
the tiger whose nature teaches him to delight in shedding blood needs but the sense of smell to show him when his prey is within his reach and by following this instinct he is enabled to measure the leap necessary to permit him to spring on his victim   69.85111218407897
de villefort has so many important and urgent occupations   114.90123738253645
oh the champs élysées   110.0221614528203
he s too stupid to imagine such a scheme   83.71744021677739
the procurator s wife uttered a groan   125.98117572781608
ah i can understand that   100.66263076623223
in one of those halts he heard the steps of several horses on the road   157.9877983717854
sir said villefort have you any enemies at least that you know   79.980200427958
75 in the rue de la harpe   137.8581591770862
to love you cry fie   105.81884953197104
do not fancy that i do you a favor   113.92872002028133
that will be better and you will be more useful to me   66.17973467554549
you are an intelligent fellow my friend   110.21160478148519
said athos sipping a glass of sparkling wine   126.93356465251959
under your auspices i will receive any person you please but you must not expect me to be too confiding   153.39975416820255
this calm tone and perfect ease made andrea feel that he was for the moment restrained by a more muscular hand than his own and that the restraint could not be easily broken through   162.40273536627163
madame de vernet was driven from me putange was exiled madame de chevreuse fell into disgrace and when you wished to come back as ambassador to france the king himself remember my lord the king himself opposed it   119.89505144025996
i have not quitted you since yesterday returned fernand sorrowfully   94.21435120424378
they can move their arms they can and that is much   163.96652466127506
but as he could serve us in other ways i wished to inform him   134.8754324697208
that milady s son has left england that he is in france on his road to paris if he be not here already   104.37018142838605
stuart begged this favor and harrison consented   164.795496435537
but what changes occur   171.41152776815574
chapter xlv   127.17875036173862
it is you who set out seven or eight months ago from your country to seek your fortune in the capital   97.81300042222544
considering the gravity of the occasion i permit you to speak my friend   48.144832344118655
my very good friend and excellent neighbor replied the count with a smile you really exaggerate my trifling exertions   107.32117080670339
then she broke the silence to cry out you are cowards miserable assassins ten men combined to murder one woman   119.73202437750103
i supposed said athos that last night s conferences would modify those warlike arrangements   34.03761720400237
captivity the first day let us return to milady whom a glance thrown upon the coast of france has made us lose sight of for an instant   132.8902124513732
said porthos it would be a pity   58.37106067926107
the fragments of the jug broke and after an hour of useless toil dantès paused with anguish on his brow   85.91742024715204
or have you forgotten them   136.09695396675883
well then a good journey to you said caderousse   182.24027170968628
not to my knowledge   132.31282556368782
comminges so to speak threw broussel into the carriage and sprang in after him   151.4405704460396
some grew rich and some were ruined   163.31293227439286
asked the young girl with an authoritative tone the count had never observed before and which startled him   109.88008815685177
oh he said he is mad   145.3171328500367
it had not been used   212.5968513629491
but i have already met m   129.42206388922864
and now i think entirely as he does   119.14471054364171
mademoiselle replied morrel with a bitter smile i am selfish you have already said so and as a selfish man i think not of what others would do in my situation but of what i intend doing myself   81.96440772986321
the young and high spirited officer required all his strength of mind to resist breaking his oath   155.56495259479226
his hair had turned white time and sorrow had ploughed deep furrows on his brow and his look once so firm and penetrating was now irresolute and wandering as if he feared being forced to fix his attention on some particular thought or person   59.55692643577486
you receive 1 500 francs per annum for your services here more than many a brave subaltern who continually risks his life for his country obtains   102.14436246377235
d art exclaimed athos whilst the gascon covered his mouth with his hand   105.04535898940777
but felton did not give him time to draw it   129.0257389888497
said d artagnan to athos your king has thoroughly taken me and i am quite at his service   130.89116613497362
valentine would you rather denounce your stepmother   79.0856298813102
albert de morcerf said beauchamp rising in his turn i can not throw you out of window for three weeks that is to say for twenty four days to come nor have you any right to split my skull open till that time has elapsed   137.28437404745094
you are his friend be ours also   120.3206283136184
we shall see each other again after the campaign   105.44035041950255
afterward we shall see   209.69443241111236
ah my dear sir you are most welcome   113.40431331220373
in the meantime they were advancing toward the square and the moment the coadjutor and the curate put their feet on the first church step the mendicant arose and proffered his brush   41.9715268243055
but i assure you mother i have a strong intention of defending my person and i never felt half so strong an inclination to live as i do now   83.47628925291612
no sooner said than done   162.13506214296106
suppose there were a window in this wall   104.22781723502492
but i serve the one with joy and the other against my will   13.943497900141168
since they force me to wear a hat of a form which does not become me said gondy i wish at least that the hat should be red   89.96222417251356
no sir no said grimaud   132.3715944861677
cried aramis that accounts for the cry i heard   98.42776701626873
make use of it i pray you for your pleasure or your business   143.67142232802206
today even   65.3519659613182
write my lord he said   105.24203960136644
bertuccio said he i intend going this evening to normandy instead of tomorrow or the next day   86.97425949269271
you are a christian   141.11018017059558
that is all i can say to you   170.32405236772655
what were you doing on that armchair   157.9068970089536
after supper when they are perfected i will communicate my plans to you   136.71234256265498
and have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody   50.241511586349134
quite attractive by jupiter   158.00263477823134
dantès obeyed and the conjointed pieces gave the following 0245m this 25th day of april 1498 be   182.7733365113786
i should think so indeed almost as high as a tower   111.84104554614332
then albert launched out in praise of mademoiselle danglars voice and on his regret after what he had just heard that he had been unable to be present the previous evening   159.52298755060883
he asked in a low voice   83.44684901383195
oh mother he exclaimed such a misfortune has happened   155.98192528982406
shall two members of the house be sent to yanina   65.8515026089774
but his place was well filled by the duc d elbeuf and his four sons ranged around him like a staff   89.67727831095117
morrel replied the young man a great misfortune for me especially   127.11264324169312
this state of mental anguish is however less terrible than the sufferings that precede or the punishment that possibly will follow   131.0750036156061
i received a letter from him yesterday but i do not think the hour was mentioned   108.77653989919813
no said villefort   112.5401316209624
but you might have shown more confidence in me   125.42205979493282
and what would you do my dear diplomatist replied morcerf with a slight degree of irony in his voice if you did nothing   169.90240570637445
de villefort was the first to give the signal of departure   130.13078848862784
happily i am neither charged with the power of pardoning nor punishing   42.33160877554876
see how regularly i live and how easy i am here   122.10420978374006
mercédès said caderousse eagerly   38.297507981693485
25   203.76289195210097
but de winter seemed not to hear his words and made no reply   167.86834318435396
whereas the stranger on the contrary in spite of all his rodomontades quickly threw him on his back   22.52953782218377
dantès raised himself up and began to talk about everything   193.71414398068399
he rushed headlong to the street and like the greek from marathon who fell in the square at athens with his laurel in his hand friquet reached councillor broussel s threshold and then fell exhausted scattering on the floor the louis disgorged by his leather bag   40.24929219289547
said caderousse rising with all the offended dignity of a drunken man i can t keep on my legs   103.65511483677928
you mean monsieur zaccone i presume   188.71130108702715
as to the horse we can easily find some excuse for its disappearance   168.44154369421136
and lastly the most convincing proof i can offer after an anonymous attack and that is the absence of any witness against my veracity and the purity of my military life   67.8943832117721
day came the jailer entered   91.03919830399187
morrel seized their hands and opening the door exclaimed in a voice choked with sobs on your knees on your knees he is our benefactor the saviour of our father   129.80603043547433
he approached the other door and taking off his hat respectfully said madame will you permit me to offer you my services   94.49967444674547
monte cristo glanced at bertuccio who became whiter than the wall against which he leaned to prevent himself from falling   110.84492889334916
the king s musketeers and the cardinal s guards chapter vi   101.86042568251824
with your idle nonsense yesterday about escaping you worried me so that i dreamed that i was trying to escape and broke my neck in doing so   258.22927860350575
my lord continued felton becoming more excited as he spoke my lord beware   144.7761207544299
confound it interrupted porthos with an explosion of passion which sent mousqueton to the other end of the room   174.00931878541763
then advancing to the president s desk what is the form said he   101.18645282132931
the queen charged me to tell you to watch over yourself for she had advice that your assassination would be attempted   152.52229794953527
villefort ceased to contend   153.57207519808273
this chamber was a sort of garret situated in the rue des fossoyeurs near the luxembourg   101.02881515171161
i will take him dead that s all   159.74336638711355
guides are useful people who will turn their hands to anything   21.46604101736567
i know these lovers   72.34633748559985
for though the child went to school during the day his mother could not allow him to be separated from her at night   108.58970214691553
from that point the passage became much narrower and barely permitted one to creep through on hands and knees   110.28389882639185
i heard you cry out without understanding what you said   38.780969779869196
it s my spanish wine that has got into your head is it not   69.84693037407331
and nervous tremblings which agitated her frame disappeared and she remained folded within herself like a fatigued serpent in repose   144.55416902657515
asked the priest anxiously and eagerly   70.35234525220467
come he said you have me in a snare gentlemen   100.39022055773775
just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be called upon to prescribe for headaches measles and the stings of wasps or any other slight affection of the epidermis   122.49896519934413
it is because he has a wife and family and ambitious desires for himself and them   59.62489267267107
mercédès   40.192318938841126
why if my information prove correct a sort of bonapartist conspiracy has just been discovered   127.69805068213816
in the hands of the devil you mean   114.83095516052596
we have seen that on the first rumor which reached the salon he had gradually approached the door and crossing two or three rooms at last disappeared   142.29961581770453
cried one of the guests   123.74729048856985
my scruples do not go thus far   27.05144909975131
it was evident that she was making unnatural efforts to subdue her anger   88.65482656003482
her carriage was that of a queen or a goddess   100.27918611091094
day gilded the tops of the houses   122.04989542548734
soon i heard steps on the staircase which terrified me as much as the footsteps of the commander did don juan   145.93012079804822
it is nevertheless conclusive to my mind   82.60961217683972
athos had followed him with a glance in which the deepest melancholy and pity were expressed   210.38426564860887
do you not think on reflection said he to him that you have done wrong in thus speaking of your mother in law in the presence of m   53.45884142374576
i regret to see that we hitherto united are opposed to each other   68.68411074492764
villefort shuddered at the suggestion   41.89545208054176
ali smiled with triumphant pride as he signified that he had indeed both chased and captured many lions   206.0500214528362
and who is the countess g   75.17472324994534
during this time valentine at once terrified and happy after having embraced and thanked the feeble old man for thus breaking with a single blow the chain which she had been accustomed to consider as irrefragable asked leave to retire to her own room in order to recover her composure   89.15424009762744
that you will fire first   127.63978065664813
you have this evening carried off and conveyed hither the viscount albert de morcerf   196.75643083777538
from pontoise another express was sent to the next stage and in six hours all the horses stationed on the road were ready   71.3217806645347
no more than a drop of water in the ocean   136.87109972991593
yes he s not a man to allow himself to be taken anyhow   129.77718917071834
the sport was bad   96.74148552490512
my faith said d artagnan it appears that i was more drunk than you since i remember nothing of the kind   71.88809767976898
nor i said aramis   52.39310291174387
said d artagnan you are insupportable   131.65318022876238
laporte could not leave the louvre   126.78932890518118
monsieur mordaunt he said since after running after one another so long chance has at last brought us together let us have a little conversation if you please   143.97728076265207
woman is fickle   237.00930229907092
besides the wheels of a carriage which appeared to have come from paris had made a deep impression in the soft earth which did not extend beyond the pavilion but turned again toward paris   53.597029825546336
resumed the procurator s wife with a sigh   112.45217147050236
yes look at yourself in that glass   90.40826937304764
first she fancied she saw her stepmother threatening her then morrel stretched his arms towards her   55.443070605486696
the count of monte cristo continued the servant begs these gentlemen s permission to wait upon them as their neighbor and he will be honored by an intimation of what time they will please to receive him   143.64915157564184
they are indiscreet   42.78378666548858
valentine instinctively raised her eyes as if to thank heaven   150.15723104861038
he remembered in what a strange manner this woman had hitherto been mixed up in his destiny   142.5389824502852
so much the better said athos   62.774407942799336
he is a bully and so am i   37.47554444005712
cried d artagnan i see black points and red points moving yonder   97.26494634526517
faith you are indeed right not to return to it   151.6279654107705
yes my dear boy replied the old man it is very fortunate   98.82318366041564
they all cried out straw   77.36225086322608
and when is this to be consummated   104.95313715174261
their return was quite an event but as they entered together all uneasiness on albert s account ceased instantly   80.16266953771098
he knocked and the door was opened   158.24336459560934
the queen standing near the door d artagnan half out of his hiding place the king raised on his elbow ready to fall down on his bed again at the slightest sound that would indicate the return of the multitude but instead of approaching the noise became more and more distant and very soon it died entirely away   174.0328330128231
franz perceived how completely he was in his element   128.5812934926993
the brigands had carried me off and conducted me to a gloomy spot called the catacombs of saint sebastian   149.90908714190903
with whom is he then   61.6038079886767
valentine valentine   117.66217998194179
but i repeat i am made up of contradictions   175.13001465497496
the dining room was scarcely less striking than the room he had just left   117.82366052090516
replied morrel   97.59303579644758
i think albert you have adopted the system of feeding me on smoke this morning   126.28291875198532
well said the cardinal everybody seems to have passed the evening with you   115.95664750166813
you want me to throw again do you not   124.93600244441791
if you had me taken to a private room only to tell me this you might have saved yourself the trouble   121.28845156293205
he remembered that morcerf had been taxed at 4 000 crowns and as he considered himself of much greater importance than morcerf he fixed his own price at 8 000 crowns   117.2766327932165
and this elixir where is it   125.45700716513127
from my childhood i have seen too much and understood too much of what has passed around me for misfortune to have an undue power over me   115.06199489562998
i then resolved to go up to him at all risks   194.37932045269002
yes indeed but one   126.6056711057
do you think it is worth while   197.00815410477577
a customs officer was laid low and two sailors wounded   70.17688863503207
andrea who was sitting before the piano with mademoiselle eugénie started up like a jack in the box   180.97793581155025
her ladyship is waiting to receive you gentlemen said the servant who had gone to inquire the pleasure of his mistress   85.02587643962312
although this man was scarcely thirty six or thirty seven years of age hair mustaches and royal all began to be gray   116.20471438167864
still if people will shut themselves up said albert and can not be seen because they are bathing dining or asleep we must avail ourselves of the opportunity whenever they are to be seen   202.68818291500224
you come from noyon in picardy   94.27444270504019
danglars was there also you recollect m   62.2765692956335
neither of them spoke to him   99.38786732513577
did he give you any details   58.89487750885994
if i had not the hope of peeping with madame coquenard into her husband s chest   42.048005716077256
i gave my sister who constantly defended the unfortunate boy good advice and as she confessed that she had several times missed money to a considerable amount i showed her a safe place in which to conceal our little treasure for the future   85.16456934608829
the same as ever my friend   61.26449065319518
and he said nothing as he died   83.50350653753125
dantès said the shipowner turning towards the young man come this way   134.46586079554174
at the end of five hundred paces more or less they came to a rivulet which they forded   117.26011869982122
i listen to you and i wonder at you sir said the queen   157.00305631509025
i have seen russians devour without being visibly inconvenienced vegetable substances which would infallibly have killed a neapolitan or an arab   117.86494398264921
athos nevertheless was visibly anxious to find someone of whom he could ask a question   123.32009615759688
i was there this very day   106.12641178382754
lord de winter placed him in the hands of the guards who led him while awaiting further orders to a little terrace commanding the sea   94.38663910254272
let all be forgotten as a sorrowful dream said beauchamp   132.34100711595406
all this was answered by an expression of d artagnan s   138.48541206768485
whom does this belong to   30.981610932427785
i bring him to you madame said athos withdrawing his hand hoping that in your turn you will do something for him   202.26188100495403
it would be better to take her to her carriage   194.77497637743352
oh mercy m   128.1619678272983
asked the editor of the ministerial paper   114.03528667378724
but if you have entertained any doubt as naturally you may i feel that i am ruining myself by speaking the truth   100.66839888198598
porthos rose always ready for this kind of adventure   132.31367986725698
i am rancorous the only stigma that proves me to be a churchman   102.5426316668632
on the staircase they met a beautiful girl of sixteen or seventeen who looked with anxiety at the stranger   74.70666265628182
it was more especially when this man was speaking in a manner half jesting half bitter that franz s ear recalled most vividly the deep sonorous yet well pitched voice that had addressed him in the grotto of monte cristo and which he heard for the second time amid the darkness and ruined grandeur of the colosseum   129.60405176830452
morrel was only thirty one barrois was sixty years of age   141.19218067636103
from the day i first saw you all my hopes of happiness have been in securing your affection   149.0178091558821
upon my soul everything degenerates   115.1348587483339
demanded the musketeer recoiling a step and with a foreign accent which proved to d artagnan that he was deceived in one of his conjectures   89.82755168949147
i ve still two pistols charged   156.1239445940672
mazarin sent us to cromwell   136.91500090710434
next morning d artagnan was the first to rise   67.92619183117822
i had a betrothed albert a lovely girl whom i adored and i was bringing to my betrothed a hundred and fifty louis painfully amassed by ceaseless toil   127.26385063654175
when he was only a few paces from me i saw that what i had taken for a weapon was only a spade   108.72084686798816
the king has spoiled him of his name and property   101.45136306290287
i accept it interposed d artagnan proudly   102.15409640836907
he will do everything wrong   123.63339244194967
you are a woman at once full of spirit and resignation   90.90093664245711
the matter had been named to him by d artagnan who in the first place pointed out the money to him then the glory and then the danger   133.7282236537143
that little stratagem may serve to keep off interlopers   16.44786386328248
why you see edmond replied the owner who appeared more comforted at every moment we are all mortal and the old must make way for the young   126.16532136319255
as to porthos his barony was perhaps dependent on that affair   62.746876940810516
did the people shout at all   133.72736344637588
how great is the power of a woman who has made so courageous a resolution   120.10544796802688
i shall kill him i can not help it   96.42430061721585
knock said the count and announce me   143.65516457618511
no you are right said athos   129.5114407630097
tried on before the glass a narrow brimmed hat of his son s which appeared to fit him perfectly and leaving his cane in the corner where he had deposited it he took up a small bamboo switch cut the air with it once or twice and walked about with that easy swagger which was one of his principal characteristics   86.35186898942653
but someone else will not be so easy as i am or content himself with the same story   95.33239759436438
i took the mule and the horse for what he owed us   136.8691902486545
coquenard s chamber   92.74221719386233
it had been handed down from father to son   71.06655539045349
noirtier watched the expression of each one and preserved his dignified and commanding attitude   102.57749101454803
good the luxembourg   145.12130287814824
emmanuel looked around the room and caught sight of the pistols   119.8653477964013
i love him devotedly   77.12806385417062
an englishman said monte cristo who grew uneasy at the attention with which julie looked at him   105.90887962928093
i can believe that it is the dignity of your rank alone which makes you cruel to me   132.44489683161405
the following morning with the banker s usual punctuality the eighty thousand francs were placed in the young man s hands as he was on the point of starting after having left two hundred francs for caderousse   157.65064967457585
then milady attempted to tear down the doorcase with a strength apparently above that of a woman   0.5517310529929631

but if you bring him back to me dead or alive you may ask all you wish   137.89363753505785
because she was in fear of being arrested   147.83515709817928
and it seemed to me that he was borne away with his two companions   89.70396342856958
does she wish that   123.0713418575073
let him be conquered exiled proscribed provided he still lives   113.5335642152642
and i am ready to offer you all i possess on loan   85.22855627328684
i answer   220.4552487837025
i can not allow him to acquire the habit of expecting to be recompensed for every trifling service he may render   160.4729830340014
let those who have ears hear and those who have eyes see   123.47354780919355
madame de villefort   114.90441242068437
oh as to that i shall take care i assure you   99.8126017464364
and you monsieur d artagnan what do you want   169.72859536124002
can it be with me   85.67400319486906
exactly opposite the other   94.84838483525624
you look at me and you are going to laugh at me   92.12603122651703

soubrette and mistress chapter xxxiv   96.89153686172565
bertuccio had outdone himself in the taste displayed in furnishing and in the rapidity with which it was executed   140.39845671565016
i understand why you accepted it and i grant you my pardon   92.19840341884819
argumentum omni denudatum ornamento   137.78131069991502
the sitting commences at two   88.8272650779756
shall i tell you each ornament of your toilet   163.2116972552253
i make no account of the harm mordaunt can do   88.66954053065292
i have my sword   74.10495092500864
ah monseigneur how dearly have i paid for that fault unhappy wretch as i am   60.773865820884325
replied d artagnan who wished for nothing better than an opportunity to distinguish himself under the eye of the lieutenant general   207.5947027039676
noirtier s room was opened like all the rest   202.38259112508982
my lord the day after to morrow is pentecost   126.46288588755675
faria still continuing to instruct dantès by conversing with him sometimes in one language sometimes in another   22.851085783059588
do you not form a very rash judgment emmanuel   71.20319726329728
when the wind shook all the doors behind which i continually expected to see some spy concealed i trembled   45.02756437044401
you have no right for you are not my father   188.6756510281285
but i have neither my women nor my servants   63.09990509586871
he has but a handful of men with him and armies will be despatched against him   118.95922558411591
and so as we have said the iron gate leading into the kitchen garden had been closed up and left to the rust which bade fair before long to eat off its hinges while to prevent the ignoble glances of the diggers and delvers of the ground from presuming to sully the aristocratic enclosure belonging to the mansion the gate had been boarded up to a height of six feet   96.06402767279079
really this is too absurd said villefort   129.53962319769425
there is one thing the queen has not signed her assent to the treaty   127.4695415364899
the old man who had preserved all his usual coolness made a sign to him to do so   153.7128453226856
death to the guards   162.88223593815962
at this name a murmur of astonishment passed around the group of spectators of this scene   45.05992303073117
but when you leave him for instance   76.98181653140085
no no cried dantès   70.06221559057907
cromwell makes you an important person as ambassador   109.67550045217598
while as though dreading to put to flight the agreeable ideas hovering over his patron s meditations whatever they were the faithful nubian walked on tiptoe towards the door holding his breath lest its faintest sound should dissipate his master s happy reverie   117.36867280337073
the punishment   54.66068900386109
mother replied the young man you have special reasons for telling me to conciliate that man   145.79628250830888
do i not hear a carriage in the courtyard   47.65960196880542
barrois who wished to go to bed himself observed that after such sad events everyone stood in need of rest   115.44714880544076
then the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it   79.65306286446233
that i had none as yet   163.56295252394116
how strong and courageous you are   124.97241582609637
he had not chatted ten minutes with the people of the tavern before he learned that a woman had come there alone about eleven o clock the night before had engaged a chamber had sent for the master of the hôtel and told him she desired to remain some time in the neighborhood   122.41546549436808
very droll he muttered very droll indeed and he again began to carve the fowl when peppino stopped the baron s right hand with his left and held out his other hand   145.9720902298832
the host will tell you i have three or four more so that you will not inconvenience me in any way   107.51945694934562
go sir said the queen   64.02097641107301
the four friends looked at one another   2.145204582881675
have they allowed the headsman to escape   93.06402907824467
but added he glancing an inquiring look at ali   34.29025627059514
then i consent to cut throats with you   103.79897856398814
said jacopo   135.18008514276363
all is ready sire said he   115.79391850603007
it was only a way of speaking   77.90820903474861
and i have come at once to see you   121.23683060216936
so if the second matter which you regret being unable to attend to is not more important than the first oh   115.67958475623135
and he fixed his eyes upon edmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts   76.25435478877783
but as he had not forgotten that it was in presence of this young man that m   36.78386315628369
i am not so sure of that   209.79534497620403
villefort himself was obliged to open to them   83.99609356500811
the two harnesses were worth three hundred pistoles   104.60872695638795
anne de bueil murmured the wounded man   145.98202614081646
bonacieux looked at the young man restrained for a minute by a last hesitation   56.624913989590866
creatures of the people armed with halberds guarding your doors   127.86298859697783
the bracieux estate was a few leagues from villars cotterets   104.81482404414447
gone said morrel   122.59114674501612
the baron appears thoughtful today said monte cristo to her   29.717129858163645
we were speaking of hanging   27.007207891785967
grimaud contented himself with pointing d artagnan out to his master with his finger   124.53896880280813
may i at least return   7.307339933031827
these leaders had corn in abundance and would not let them partake of it   27.541288731110157
what have you done with monsieur de beaufort   27.422045851331234
but i knew his step i knew his voice i knew him by that imposing bearing which hell has bestowed upon his person for the curse of humanity   139.2479687859526
he must be made to speak in order that he might be spoken to for milady very well knew that her greatest seduction was in her voice which so skillfully ran over the whole gamut of tones from human speech to language celestial   46.02244882764498
haydée still calm but with a calmness more dreadful than the anger of another would have been handed to the president the record of her sale written in arabic   169.58037832210852
the same had been done for the queen and madame the president   53.102560698018515
this caused a universal burst of laughter   75.94540161811504
and he threw away his pistol   109.16758875895371
do not think so   121.01670247067392
tomorrow then sire   86.87192134392386
it is true i fought with tolerable success   85.03048963333835
do   147.39201722898957
he calls himself so   123.39023153692732
mockery muttered athos savagely   138.16571699181674
i will depart from the strict line of my duty to aid you in discovering the author of this accusation   88.00667699483961
bonacieux was just the woman to walk with in the plain st   114.4039910183742
at the door he paused for a moment to wipe his damp pale brow   57.542850587782304
de tréville s entrance he turned round   125.12981707655825
no no cried maximilian quite unable to restrain his feelings   186.2162712132142
fortunately the storm began to subside but still the sea was disturbed   4.0963773477978265
i will go and find buckingham   100.61197496235421
surely so trifling a circumstance can not deserve a place in your remembrance   0.38930658980380883
said milady who had already overcome her agitation and recovered all her presence of mind   160.8412484813701
there are three others do you know anything of their situation   83.9359409557685
let us hope my child cried the marquis that m   186.04318653256541
when his patience was exhausted he called his valet   144.58054297028627
it was his son alone that there was cause to fear   72.66539716568414
said porthos opening his large eyes   131.06510179024286
liked a pleasant jest   120.72630333489278
besides what did i ask of you   128.64725664708527
the sand with which the alleys were covered deadened the sound of footsteps   120.01366402114378
what for me only   212.8056662176366
the duke frowned the officer felt the point of the poniard which having penetrated through his clothes was close to his heart   61.88523194737731
has anything been sent for from a chemist s that i have not examined   87.31008011273559
an astrologer predicted that   133.4546330902839
i do not know whether the wine of chios produces melancholy but certainly everything appears to me black in this house said debray   96.41617416723058
meanwhile i am the bearer of an order of arrest and although i most reluctantly perform the task assigned me it must nevertheless be fulfilled   131.17038489630036
no indeed i am not   137.40290529092445
bank notes   107.60488303268357
oh said she seizing the count s hand and raising it to her lips   66.29374699461886
that s right said athos   166.41199289297646
aramis with sword and pistol in his hands athos with his sword in his scabbard his pistol in his saddle bags   133.0515766797388
mala ducis avi domum continued louis xviii   137.17920353624996
50239m ten minutes afterwards the baron entered his apartment and peppino stationed himself on the bench outside the door of the hotel after having whispered something in the ear of one of the descendants of marius and the gracchi whom we noticed at the beginning of the chapter who immediately ran down the road leading to the capitol at his fullest speed   72.80810207835037
said the brigadier   142.20673416728195
at this moment the coadjutor was announced   68.61341358791879
let him be removed from the house that he may not see master edward is not downstairs sir replied the valet   97.75172938460092
as for the sailors although they appeared perfectly tranquil yet it was evident that they were on the alert and that they carefully watched the glassy surface over which they were sailing and on which a few fishing boats with their white sails were alone visible   89.79526491155575
exclaimed villefort   112.39237128897608
and he returned to his guests while bertuccio leaning against the wall succeeded in reaching the dining room   78.39396583759698
the procurator repeated several times ah madame coquenard   63.50264924137906
do you really believe i can acquire all these things in so short a time   165.69070216921747
athos and aramis walked down toward the port   145.62007878017266
he thought of his wife   90.24989755344127
he is a coward indeed grumbled the host drawing near to d artagnan and endeavoring by this little flattery to make up matters with the young man as the heron of the fable did with the snail he had despised the evening before   140.62433726434983
the young man was thrown from the top of the rock   186.88131740583677
if a thunderbolt had fallen at the banker s feet he could not have experienced greater terror   90.48201109613998
oh no answered the abbé   90.2376037208798
well to take his part   140.8011172992683
so young   69.01613188304655
each retired to his own apartment   159.60632317925464
she had however just power to give one parting look to her grandfather who in losing her seemed to be resigning his very soul   100.72303289311819
said felton making a step toward the duke   102.55473602416598
it is usual certainly   136.99864099619433
he would no longer be alone   128.18642121588869
here are some lozenges which i have made up on purpose   81.684564056975
everything goes on capitally my dear monsieur bernouin but here is a man whom i must beg you to put in a safe place   160.16935831842835
i am not forgotten   67.79441729185433
and you are a fool for having said anything about it said a voice from the top of the stairs   45.46252112834057
the baroness became pale   57.48246072262258
english and french the hour having come they went with their four lackeys to a spot behind the luxembourg given up to the feeding of goats   78.694333692936
it is i who cherish no resentment   106.6515828104845
oh as for the composition of the letter there is nothing to be said   135.26527331750054
he read preserve my memory   131.136066794073
you intend visiting il colosseo   136.81378250381198
yes replied aramis and the sloop out there making ready to sail must be that which is to take us to our destination   125.05575425904087
come let us talk a little about my father   94.50418641968675
but when you held her in your power why did you not drown her strangle her hang her   151.4751565141432
i have not a penny about me   123.22685779541409
what are you saying doctor   109.10975878416072
if i were still capable of serving you   39.83489362801966
franz s only reply was to take a teaspoonful of the marvellous preparation about as much in quantity as his host had eaten and lift it to his mouth   111.51454198258952
said albert seeing that beauchamp hesitated   178.89724342573814
of the d artagnan checked himself   75.315827554584
did you see nothing there   121.50258924346775
the marriage will take place in less than three months said villefort   108.13487078566567
then turning to aramis he said it is now your turn monsieur le chevalier   83.33185593914354
but the three millions   129.70051918337987
oh as to his name i know nothing about it   103.6053074153285
her disorders i know them not   147.38047519523883
and the count who was assuming his masquerade costume   159.91033057407796
certainly monsieur speak he said softening his stern accented tones as if he were speaking to a woman   111.62384041326776
perhaps he would say nothing but he would see   98.12575044179009
you know what it is to be in love   124.72585159236583
franz waited until all was in order and when the sail was filled and the four sailors had taken their places three forward and one at the helm he resumed the conversation   108.81095836817728
i deserted the church for the world for you know that i forced myself when i became a musketeer   87.18492212161854
before an hour has passed you will be discovered arrested obliged to kill me which would be a crime unworthy of loyal gentlemen like you   66.78314021235386
cried porthos almost choked with dust and chewing his bridle as a horse chews his bit   148.12673261860823
if that is what you meant by your observation my worthy friend you are right   106.00277181776416
shall we go together   130.60848085403669
now replied monte cristo there is only one source of uneasiness left in your father s mind which is this he is anxious to know how you have been employed during your long absence from him how you have been treated by your persecutors and if they have conducted themselves towards you with all the deference due to your rank   117.66406759174271
then you feel quite sure that it was your misfortune he deplored   127.40084731197146
that of dying together   135.86109979178056
asked de winter turning around   79.03924766092632
my dear athos i admire you but nevertheless we were in the wrong after all   61.77543171656396
but madame henrietta is a daughter of france and was entitled to the hospitality of france   32.444558054311116
i wish you to do so said he   214.91114602731426
he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife into me   133.72670489850776
oh yes sir he told me   133.17340083278165
and then you ungrateful being you are not pleased to see an old friend   55.755696074785725
on the contrary she often says morcerf i believe the count has a noble nature   163.4310866471395
who was the invisible chief   95.59339369383486
why you see he has a good understanding with the shepherds in the plains the fishermen of the tiber and the smugglers of the coast   156.62951043892974
pistache my friend come here   113.64016206939414
i pretended that i had a disorder of the skin and asked for a little sulphur which was readily supplied   94.91759689818463
when i shall lay my head on the block and say remember   224.55724670923678
do you repent   87.84307773811538
coupé thirty five francs   67.3853421822048
it was the king speaking on the scaffold   175.7110741039496
what would the abbé please to have   172.73992732504342
besides he wore the uniform of the guards which next to that of the musketeers was most admired by the ladies   187.1517777597811
i have charged myself with this affair   52.438266461395585
40164m then i shall believe god has forgiven you and i will forgive you too   96.81387227317788
mousqueton blushed so confusedly that the gascon began to laugh at him and said porthos would be angry my dear monsieur mousqueton but i pardon you only let us remember that this gold must serve us as a joke so be gay come along   98.32733988537579
and aramis pushed forward a large easy chair in which d artagnan stretched himself out   89.50068231723796
de tréville wanted   84.29868309205052
dantès first impulse was to escape but fortunately he did not attempt it   145.18162450068553
you are charged with a letter of introduction addressed to me are you not   66.48209908759047
he went therefore to his appointment with athos without a second determined to be satisfied with those his adversary should choose   103.85624450886914
but now answer me   113.37427811176846
the name of porthos produced its effect upon the clerks who began to laugh   32.264698740967276
the house ali had chosen and which was to serve as a town residence to monte cristo was situated on the right hand as you ascend the champs élysées   155.39326192768075
besides whether at home or not whether in paris or cairo the abbé always left something to give away which the valet distributed through this wicket in his master s name   112.71034060885131
dessessart and the company of musketeers of m   96.66027275713931
let us go back to the jew s again   142.76700989365506
shame shame for four musketeers to allow an unfortunate fellow who cried for help to be arrested in their midst   94.63724433071557
although he did not yet speak italian he understood it very well   80.45234837976993
why having recognized you and i the only one to do so why was i able to save my son alone   43.531166178245044
coming as usual i presume from the extreme end of the globe   200.86073419804123
the duke was the grandson of henry iv   131.96445041653269
so much the worse or rather so much the better   180.91191348489838
as to the time it will not require very much more than the generality of wills   83.83207354793596
valentine shook her head   123.9837530834295
and you hurt me devilishly i can tell you   209.9232381727523
d artagnan went instantly in search of the inn and easily discovered it by the riotous noise which resounded from it   133.81195768734054
whole hours sometimes passed while faria was giving instructions to dantès instructions which were to serve him when he was at liberty   70.63323749417592
this is indeed the reason why i begged you to alter the order of the questions   200.0332078738167
now let me behold the curious pens with which you have written your work   167.19849293166192
she fainted   42.256430215840496
we are compelled to admit to our readers that d artagnan thought nothing about him in any way   160.61760469804526
we consider it useless to draw a physical or moral portrait of grimaud   149.9453320735738
the thing is simple enough   211.7189071789025
said buckingham becoming so pale that d artagnan feared he would faint as he broke the seal   93.85337636077992
you now understand haydée said the count that from this moment you are absolutely free   137.35864501707852
his consent would be your justification in god s sight   112.63128670008349
and with the door locked and orders given that he should not be disturbed excepting for important business he sat down in his armchair and began to ponder over the events the remembrance of which had during the last eight days filled his mind with so many gloomy thoughts and bitter recollections   55.572727518614776
this knife is the knife with which felton stabbed him   132.146656544746
the mind alone is still active in this human machine and that is faint and flickering like the light of a lamp about to expire   122.35074519334032
she asked in great distress   122.20812404120532
to do with you my lord   98.57271567971921
yet he could not restrain a hope that in italy as elsewhere there might be an exception to the general rule   232.25570442759908
you are a brave soldier one of the few remaining veterans of the days of henry iv   149.81565748379452
no said valentine you might meet someone   130.9239243144938
i have an idea about them   144.46348610211746
the master of la jeune amélie who was very desirous of retaining amongst his crew a man of edmond s value had offered to advance him funds out of his future profits which edmond had accepted   174.8676092860457
asked the guardsman with the same jeering air   112.1850794741048
oh murmured the count shall i then be permitted to love again   106.38456386604409
as for you who are young and active delay not on my account but fly go i give you back your promise   100.53247249226092
my title of popular banker has gained me the confidence of charitable institutions and the five millions and a half belong to them   148.91296147796143
yes but i could give him the order i guitant and i preferred to give it to you   69.27642563776712
grimaud alone was calm as ever   82.55369488156768
maximilian we said we would be to each other as two voices two shadows   158.72341239407663
one would think it had been placed here on purpose   66.17842628911401
all would then be easily arranged if the baroness and her daughter are willing   58.16864813084968
you are alone one alone shall answer you   137.13830134761787
look at his uniform monsieur commissary look at his uniform   98.119848527453
if we ever escape together half this treasure is yours   163.73467134093914
at this moment grimaud came in   93.14318869537718
as soon as we are married he shall come and live with us instead of one child he shall have two   96.54421751005323
the death of buckingham was written there at full length   157.27938701478033
but tell me does the count of morcerf never visit the opera   107.7192193980037
haydée will soon be here   104.8119256842006
i told you so athos said d artagnan shrugging his shoulders   133.17726446510812
what did he answer   40.0159139997034
on arriving at the angle of the trench which was to serve them as a rampart one of the guardsmen fell   67.58377449983585
at this moment the countess perceived albert and returned his salutation with a smile   132.36229977158848
you must nevertheless make up your mind to go and get it or i swear you shall die by my hand   87.02964888219147
then no longer able to resist he called out   88.20987983500048
so serious that i come to beg you to render me a service   132.5988310607048
he uttered the most dreadful sob which ever escaped from the bosom of a father abandoned at the same time by his wife and son   83.28662262867142
the muskets are for us   151.4667860956323
i have still fifty pistoles   197.62947387843596
by a miracle monsieur i must acknowledge with a sword thrust in my breast and by nailing the comte de wardes on the byroad to calais like a butterfly on a tapestry   34.93744075797072
had you then that sum   122.71413991984825
this affair made a great noise   132.4736621675492
de boville retired with this exclamation after expressing acute sympathy with the father   61.71969546325228
these words of felton s passed like ice through her veins   83.00440841957152
i should do her justice by sending her to tyburn said buckingham   70.28731735048983
noirtier cast an appealing look on valentine which look was at once so earnest and imperative that she answered immediately   73.09124273426856
they all rushed towards him for all loved edmond in spite of his superiority   113.67990793382833
the wretch is dying and it is horrible to let a man die without extending a hand to save him   122.54340433203434
well what good wind blows you hither at this hour   48.302303525875715
like all other things of this world after having had a beginning had an end and after this end our four companions began to be somewhat embarrassed   124.00349563536437
at twelve this man was replaced by another functionary and danglars wishing to catch sight of his new guardian approached the door again   92.6395244014497
when you return i will set the fuse myself but be careful to conceal your face so that you can not be recognized by them   121.96602366348614
since you have no further interrogations to make leave me i beseech you she said   163.63537183672878
you are the master   87.22799446573347
murmured fernand   16.454974489689846
oh this is very interesting said debray   14.430784327771661
they found the door ajar   131.0564242805604
i searched the whole thicket   175.62525921234652
beautiful   127.73762253044511
it is true the queen is for him   79.9320419849182
the man placed his finger on her lips   114.87629056035202
if an angel appeared to that young man as an accuser of milady he would take him in the mental disposition in which he now found himself for a messenger sent by the devil   122.886710042355
now if you marry m   106.93548307946071
we are ready   132.8031668029487
for like diana of poictiers and ninon anne of austria enjoyed the privilege of remaining ever beautiful   81.47599329516814
de tréville captain of the king s musketeers he met in the antechamber three young men serving in the illustrious corps into which he was soliciting the honor of being received bearing the names of athos porthos and aramis   126.17002615020336
i am afraid if we offer them double that we shall not procure a carriage   83.3104174973528
mistrust athos therefore who will not prosecute the affairs of any one even his own   136.7308170060929
they did not come   145.53402642803064
but he also was spurred on by a ferocious desire of vengeance   97.82637313873471
the lackeys were sent on before with the baggage and they set out on the morning of the sixteenth   84.29932542188848
true said caderousse   141.18053999646753
what are your commands lieutenant   133.93395987804115
40026m i am prejudiced against beauchamp said albert drawing franz away and leaving the former to finish his philosophical dissertation with debray   100.2136035032934
what is the use of boring one s self with so many things   48.09896574587923
there was no end to the inextinguishable laughter at the rochellais   1.16814794515075
mademoiselle said albert replying to this direct appeal i can give you very exact information on that subject as well as on most points relative to the mysterious person of whom we are now conversing the young woman is a greek   107.9045812269035
so i summoned up all my courage and read it as firmly and as steadily as i could   94.53587158437156
after having deprived me of my liberty after having deprived me of death after having recalled me to existence my god have pity on me and do not let me die in despair   11.77685116562597
said he in the most natural tone in the world   128.81629645788797
the old man obeyed   160.73940998183204
i will go on foot then   138.903234174918
and for that reason i did myself the honor of calling upon you in order to beg for an explanation   157.09607668355792
bonacieux and if his life had depended upon the spot to which she was going or upon the person who should accompany her d artagnan would have returned home since he had so promised   138.70914517368107
it was this fear that restrained him so powerful is the influence of a truly great character on all that surrounds it   141.05092827497182
he fancied that these two forms were looking at the sea   214.4306855897188
then through the grating to which she had drawn near milady saw the young man make a sign with delirious fervor and depart in an apparent transport of joy   42.4740039267505
he questioned them as to the news they had each been charged to obtain but nothing positive had been learned   76.69928919928003
why do you say so   110.82789852501745
certainly remarked porthos   48.54685872510241
heaven forfend   90.92516174727498
he must be a prophet then said valentine smiling   59.01826278006234
and he read that welcome postscript which made him forget the abruptness of the letter   193.73744831808347
you are only the victim of perfidious plots   76.82142099712328
it was not fatigue that stayed andrea here   99.26806935986276
that is to say she was there replied milady   172.1619023471476
the next day just as debray was signing the deed that is about five o clock in the afternoon madame de morcerf after having affectionately embraced her son entered the coupé of the diligence which closed upon her   49.61670322581615
i have eight men on guard you know   163.5224890026219
chapter 39   183.72511889468365
no you sounded me nothing more   138.99710372336676
it is war said the prince   133.87464290547678
all the mundane objects that generally strike the eye on entering the room of a young man particularly when that young man is a musketeer had disappeared as if by enchantment   172.70652141639033
have you any weight on the chest   169.76203523509537
what our enemies say of us is then true   193.8654138613661
i had only an indistinct understanding of what was passing around me   191.16372469672407
grimaud my friend said the viscount will you leave me thus in such anxiety   152.2192143397957
you will not abandon me   130.47788081080176
it is only used for political prisoners   7.384365320074792
they therefore began operations as soon as the telegraphic despatch arrived and the bell and bottle being the best known hotel in the town they had naturally directed their first inquiries there   109.19345516371766
rejoined caderousse quickly   104.25596218365028
to me   59.70842254062951
he turned up a king   104.43183659641394
the king was winning   119.10811528951028
ah what a misfortune   133.1526151266693
and i said porthos rolling his large eyes remember i will skin you alive   135.78406616353445
of the handkerchief   124.34352401650426
after breakfast the abbess came to pay her a visit   39.15505008771153
she had raised her veil and with her face hidden by her hands was giving free scope to the sighs and tears which had been so long restrained by the presence of her son   91.17764974564453
in the morning when they entered her chamber she was still in bed   144.92901217593186
no said she you will avenge me   75.11299147265692
d artagnan remained therefore alone   16.250006942107007
my dear fellow said albert turning to franz here is an admirable adventure   207.11819722460268
the rascal is rich then   56.79082600229457
may god accept my atonement in the preservation of these two existences   112.94148630692688
and the only difference was that instead of entering by the doors people entered by the windows   209.46993973148142
no no by no means said villefort who was afraid of seeming to abandon his ground   92.75804822188917
i did not say that the owner was a smuggler replied the sailor   166.0832918551574
now that this marriage which i know you so much disliked is done away with i come to you on an errand which neither m   179.2383987930632
devil take it my lord   164.6562168111987
oh it is impossible said he i must be dreaming   183.89332368956553
but that they give me no uneasiness since at the first step he takes i will ruin the queen   158.2858195576407
muttered mazarin i do believe he is going off with the diamond   17.14899169643776
he saw in fancy the burial of his father and the marriage of mercédès   145.76522179489768
i have my pride for men serpents always ready to threaten everyone who would pass without crushing them under foot   114.6800689078236
it was indeed the same color as the draught she had poured into the glass and which valentine had drunk   182.0310009533358
still further monsieur de tréville gains ten thousand crowns a year   149.7980606835917
bartholomew they sometimes came to seek refuge   76.61191342890723
why should you not be there   91.45390621489547
asked the commissary   88.34449060455567
willingly monseigneur said the executioner   79.90780577899329
now as they had already traveled eleven leagues d artagnan thought it time to stop whether porthos were or were not in the inn   153.83962509826793
he was intently watching for a shadow to appear among the trees and awaiting with anxiety the sound of a light step on the gravel walk   55.838259478245575
this time maximilian was the first to arrive   114.79151457522514
you would have been summoned to the gate   81.6093734551467
and all the bad taste of decorations which had only their richness to boast of shone in its splendor   121.36117806046917
armentières read porthos   169.1475490726089
no replied morcerf my father is most anxious about it   34.040280937007324
as to my health since it has stood five years of prison with monsieur de chavigny to boot tis excellent   165.71457854451842
but on the contrary to his great surprise it grew darker and darker   135.98375236202045
franz pondered the matter for a few moments concluded that a man so rich could not have any intention of plundering him of what little he had and seeing only the prospect of a good supper accepted   39.999050093146366
she comes from india also   148.92246655276557
the work of revolt continued the whole night thus   96.8224582452266
to be sure there would only be a swiss the less in the world   87.86256373677105
chapter 110   57.493796331445495
as to the poisoner they had heard no tidings of her whatever only that she must have made her escape through the garden on the sand of which her footsteps could be traced and the door of which had been found shut   105.29110734092696
the departure for belgium chapter 98   186.85908986990785
cease then to allow yourself to be duped by vain hopes that even your own excellent heart refuses to believe in   100.83641742491477
go away from here and leave the place to us   122.02939292590911
it was fastened with three magnificent diamond clasps   133.71572777320154
well what shall you do with this money count   108.48629439569369
at the noise made by d artagnan in entering aramis lifted up his head and beheld his friend   98.55397788096748
what are we to say to this   61.74289096357568
the queen pressed her brother and the emperor of austria to appear to be wounded as they really were by the policy of richelieu the eternal object of which was the abasement of the house of austria to declare war against france and as a condition of peace to insist upon the dismissal of the cardinal   131.75787008833063
we will not go till evening   38.773987779636485
the officer took from the table the papers pointed out gave them to him who asked for them bowed to the ground and retired   90.19251042332247
porthos and aramis trembled with rage   123.09850977305354
and while we are still gaping with wonder at the news you come and tell us today let us say no more about it   47.192644514411555
behind him pale indeed but marching with a firm step was charles stuart who advanced between two priests followed by a few superior officers appointed to preside at the execution and attended by two files of partisans who took their places on opposite sides of the scaffold   116.38895218311586
permit me said the notary turning first to villefort and then to valentine permit me to state that the case in question is just one of those in which a public officer like myself can not proceed to act without thereby incurring a dangerous responsibility   81.82038406345622
there are the acts signed   217.13639520561355
our four friends in particular astonished their comrades   126.73001874570522
opposite the scaffold   91.08534409818375
for a mind so perspicuous as that of d artagnan this indulgence was a light by which he caught a glimpse of a better future   95.64563361200253
and as m   91.2133098662688
and you were wrong madame   109.5220811870044
know of the existence of this treasure which may amount to nearly two mil   49.33855654794368
monsieur replied the count with a chilling air i am very happy to have been the means of preserving a son to his mother for they say that the sentiment of maternity is the most holy of all   192.3160500000705
what is yonder   169.86390556552553
the countess was present at the races in the champ de mars said château renaud   164.8141817474995
repeated mousqueton   60.78061735137622
you wish me to get out at that window   32.40156839449867
but we must say farewell edmond and let us part   91.58761448398403
a few minutes afterwards a flash of light which was extinguished instantly was seen on the land and the sound of firearms reached the yacht   176.46699753045846
of which i invite you to take advantage my friend   83.44784600131914
winter turned his horse and the two friends rode on   85.29713811822585
i really don t know what hotel it is   110.95118965216355
at daybreak he awoke and took a turn around his room   119.4940174054372
pray reflect a little   100.87085151159391
take care athos   142.86101309383253
and besides as matters were it was much more to his advantage that the prefect of police should triumph over him than that he should humiliate the prefect   184.4096263279177
chrysostom in folio which made the table bend beneath its weight   79.01852703567582
at the end of his speech the king looked tenderly around upon the people   51.266847144524334
he looked around   68.21876813760423
but sit down dear friend to table   192.31540629238143
you are right athos said aramis   111.43154116771147
it is absolutely necessary for me to return to the chateau   96.23442566664194
but i heard that a marriage between the prince of wales and mademoiselle d orleans was spoken of said de winter   60.26287356528538
ask of me as mayor what is my opinion of m   117.61095835467802
gondy went to a box and drew forth a bag   132.37357036554312
de morcerf opened the door himself and as the carriage rolled away he passed up the walk rang and entered the open door with his servant   56.34209978726949
suddenly two dark forms seemed to separate from the mass advanced grew in size and as they loomed up larger and larger assumed the appearance of two horsemen   176.11736696034603
yes i know what brand you are talking about   132.01011016887406
my mistress sir   65.26175658703735
he was in a most elegant hunting costume   225.5145186130378
he possesses a noble heart madame replied the count and he has acted rightly   108.6267053324355
answer or we charge   160.30129088275046
mordaunt reappeared   101.2507638952862
will you accept my offering   200.38690390218358
so cried milady as if she could not resist giving utterance to a holy indignation you a pious man you who are called a just man you ask but one thing and that is that you may not be inculpated annoyed by my death   93.99764852320426
and he set off to follow the two friends   99.56674773557482

his voice yet echoed in the archway when a handsome graceful and half naked young man appeared bearing a fowl in a silver dish on his head without the assistance of his hands   35.652913244817015
but i love her my lord and was jealous   81.44239300991775
gentlemen said château renaud it is not morcerf coming in that carriage   108.23370407947657

my brother is only your second husband   98.94524918243658
she entered by one door at the time when mercédès appeared at the door   153.70987950347424
he was already enjoying the sweet dream engendered by the possession of two hundred and nineteen louis made in a quarter of an hour when a voice was heard at the door of the hall which made him stir   150.9332342318263
on his part the king returned to his apartment   106.66502913936566

but none the less anne of austria has forgotten us for twenty years   85.52891948218456
felton sat down upon an armchair which happened to be near the door and waited without speaking a word without making a gesture   147.99355350319294
shortly a human form appeared in the shade of the corridor and the young lieutenant with whom we are already acquainted stopped at the threshold to receive the orders of the baron   167.11988049631464
and he measured ten double handfuls of pearls diamonds and other gems many of which mounted by the most famous workmen were valuable beyond their intrinsic worth   145.38188794328332
either they respect or they fear me which is more likely but they let me trample down the clover with my dogs insult and obstruct every one and i come back still more weary and low spirited that s all   144.41038047484165

go straight to his box   110.8578751904261
the captain pointed towards the island up the side of which ascended a volume of smoke increasing as it rose   127.07856820893124
said he addressing d artagnan don t you remember that face which is blinking yonder   112.23314777914845

sir replied m   131.81664206083443
villefort therefore gained nothing save the king s gratitude which was rather likely to injure him at the present time and the cross of the legion of honor which he had the prudence not to wear although m   171.76715672772477
so that our hostelry is daily going to ruin   208.56623565481544
and pray what may it be   140.29041271934014

beauchamp was in his bath   106.45593230238546
they all alighted and hastened to pay their respects to the king and queen in their coach   98.8864525302183

a superhuman joy expanded the old man s eyes which were raised towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude   166.47011306254137
franz was fascinated by the horrible spectacle   77.33717430459964

once sir when i was grafting a rose tree   62.61900337427579
she is amiable and well behaved   163.35079856844305
he questioned me concerning captain leclere s death   66.82264733993776
what do you wish me to do   61.6738684162302
exclaimed the young girl enthusiastically   51.895467335289894
this toast recalling at once the patient exile of hartwell and the peace loving king of france excited universal enthusiasm   75.83474278540018
but this counsel effectually decided mademoiselle danglars never to commit herself by being seen in public with one destined for a theatrical life   132.9343542848003
go on my good parry unless you are tired   103.3823395823572
it seems to me said emmanuel that i see two young men down there who are evidently waiting   87.20761291444254
by the streets   53.139833337803225
the two friends made an appointment for ten o clock on the following day   129.02397609933763
a woman who will draw you into a snare in which you will leave your head   68.59002313070337
penelon had it would seem made good use of his money for he was newly clad   50.60290904097846
half the escort were exhausted and several horses fell down   164.25381288983166
it was useless   30.729324109480046
and in half an hour said maximilian in a gloomy voice our name is dishonored   68.11690462108628
as d artagnan had foreseen athos was not within   179.6061329651838
presently the door opened and she perceived felton   105.28618853840814
well then we will put simply my lord do you remember a certain little enclosure where your life was spared   101.54891807098889
i go far from men who thus so bitterly injure each other   126.53561211281766
it may be judged whether d artagnan looked or listened with avidity   121.45291937156422
some contribute their talents others their industry   111.88869006096249
we must be expeditious   119.11022746143581
i faith yes   132.024241905584
to give ten francs to this honest fellow replied raoul taking a pistole from his pocket   67.37481018650206
she then crossed the corridor and led the way down a narrow staircase to m   62.20355987033041
inquired the countess   135.35145950969834
i could go in as well as grimaud said mousqueton a little piqued   64.75992627235797
athos as a diplomatist   82.6391443344952
directly sir   103.08520147516826
i left him five days ago said d artagnan and he portrayed with gascon wit and sprightliness the magnificence of porthos in his chateau of pierrefonds   67.23090132278445
what are you saying to her   68.16948067723672
but my dear fellow those are things that bear postponement and you must put it off especially with so good an excuse to give on your return yes if i return   103.6421455045792
what must the mistrustful restless suspicious cardinal think of her silence the cardinal not merely her only support her only prop her only protector at present but still further the principal instrument of her future fortune and vengeance   88.3895401123738
the chancellor made a profound reverence   99.94702341783858
ah he has a niece   144.502832344837
the musketeers hastening to the hôtel of m   148.25435789294025

go to the assistance of madame de villefort he said to the nurse   110.70277796155807
aramis bowed rather with respect than pleasure at the compliment   150.88481372251275
de villefort who sat half bowed over in his chair offering him consolation encouragement and protestations of zeal and sympathy   139.84491939894897
for the king s service we need horses   115.09632963124429
nothing escapes him   136.80842834722407
he now wished to be amongst them in order to see some other face besides that of his jailer   90.97282788331053
no i had no such idea   161.83684518441046
noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort because she is going to marry m   144.38890422236946
that is an idea   55.70101517817223
in a few minutes he had extracted three boards   149.3054565685298
of course naively replied the servant   120.01342487581768
it is decided that you are to live at marseilles and that i am to leave for africa where i will earn for myself the right to use the name i now bear instead of the one i have thrown aside   93.45304504016593

the door of the back staircase opened then the side gate of the garden and ali and his master were on the spot with lights   24.58630722273675
you who know his life and his crime   78.44763828945084
i have lost two customers but this one remains of whom i am pretty certain for some days to come   75.19751344418823
0029m right dantès quite right   70.53615018685983
and don t you know where he is   124.43065035262038
i read it a little while since   88.0935871480454
i am a prisoner then   150.9595992803855
this screaming mob are they or are they not my subjects   128.02910224992868
napoleon certainly he knew something of inasmuch as he had seen and spoken with him   142.60451804835606
he comes possibly from the holy land and one of his ancestors possessed calvary as the mortemarts did the dead sea   188.95406676603807
yes that is true as the gospel said porthos   49.919254214934014
murmured the abbé   102.04155603892957
taste this and the boundaries of possibility disappear   131.29561168244544
now i have been buried alive or very nearly so   148.57889565951297
but such as is my hermitage it is at your disposal   150.14247200558694
but he heard nothing   111.6642531772524
but let me hear this second proof which you yourself own to be absurd   194.7946133266466
ah yes i am indeed deserted   117.1594187364926
should that diamond ever fall into my hands again he reflected i would turn it at once into money   88.19154254569631
the bell rang at this moment for the rising of the curtain   119.97211962140894
but you madame prudent as you are think if you were to be arrested with that handkerchief and that handkerchief were to be seized would you not be compromised   71.9855015601938
d artagnan pressed nothing but a corpse in his arms   87.80115611627548
all along the road what athos had said respecting mme   209.23257776052944
said athos we are overheard   175.9322997488324
and the troop grumbling angrily disappeared in the darkness and took the road to paris   85.20593858609385
said the prince turning with a triumphant air toward marshal de grammont and the other officers   113.5169206894749
that is what we must find out returned gaetano fixing his eyes on this terrestrial star   158.3957893720515
should we by being arrested be all four together again we should not i am not sure be twenty four hours in prison without getting free   126.89679262736202
let go the bowlin s haul the brace lower the top gallant sails haul out the reef tackles on the yards   121.96787695467646
what do you want with a notary   27.29134552435886
i really do not think after all it is anything of consequence   133.50046383261875
by doing a thing which you know will be agreeable to her   100.67701301968384
bonacieux with some embarrassment the cause of this event   150.79722851382715
have you seen   131.70878609543985
however that may be d artagnan replied athos without falling into the snare which his gascon friend had prepared for him by an appeal to his parental love however that may be you know in the bottom of your heart that it is true   151.12783357200115
edmond uttered a cry of agony and quite out of his senses rushed towards the door exclaiming help help   99.64192156493274
my brother had arrived the previous evening at nîmes and at the very door of the house where he was about to demand hospitality he had been assassinated   118.78917533206116
come i beseech you lend me twenty francs so that i may buy a dressing gown   204.82120696442928

and when i told you i had foreseen the result it is the honor of your visit i alluded to   176.11063792211988
the servant who had travelled at the back of the carriage waited on him   64.79835708401765
he had ordered his three musketeers and their companion to be with him at half past six in the morning   143.68772550591055
have you not taken a bastion   163.21029478080476
i should not have guessed it   175.45231868359429
30289m are you at variance with the englishman   137.00390266920104
how much do you want   196.69107704065306
and the one received his commission the other his patent of nobility   97.7469311614194
she crushed the paper in her hand and turning with flashing eyes upon kitty she cried what is this letter   62.19704172278024
of fighting man to man without discomfiture against the comte de la fere and the chevalier d herblay and of surrendering only to fifty men   74.20197469199462
cried haydée   42.05253714274424
mercédès uttered a cry which made the tears start from monte cristo s eyes   110.51701118576896
the conduct of the son in seeking to avenge his father was so natural that château renaud did not seek to dissuade him and was content with renewing his assurances of devotion   106.29208080264425
de villefort so as to prevent his listening to what you said   100.13693642127842
you heard m   104.407075822094
thou must add said d artagnan that a gentleman who is passing by wishes to have the honor of paying his respects to the comte de la fere and if thou art satisfied with what thou hearest then mention my name   69.21749895912598
it bore no signature but it announced to the general that someone would call for him if he would be ready at nine o clock   107.08446832421264
until now it had been undecided whether the supper should take place in the dining room or under a long tent erected on the lawn but the beautiful blue sky studded with stars had settled the question in favor of the lawn   81.98930994817204
planchet said he   64.47372868855045
you were walking one day behind the chartreux when it would have been better if you had been elsewhere   125.87188275367434
caderousse raised his clenched hands towards heaven   91.06615497677771
said the gascon proud to display so rich a gift in the eyes of his friends   83.70478308949322
as being the friends edmond esteemed most faithful and devoted to him   137.39262848755868
she is besides my sole heiress   172.01052348835552
you will observe gentlemen said athos that porthos has made the best bargain of any of us   83.97214213571951
happen what will the devil take them they can t eat us   93.91024075912512
cried d artagnan in a loud voice   38.13370117374711
but it s of no importance continued d artagnan with natural assurance   139.43553425203544
i made inquiries and found that the house in the champs élysées is his own property and certainly it was very decently kept up   139.17498574471063
cried he guardian of the fire do your duty   136.9428391256522
the carriage creaked and rattled as it flew over the rough stones and the slightest obstacle under the wheels would have caused disaster   150.01826256786362
we can dispose of the business if we please in an hour for i have received a letter from m   128.73464662755447
said athos and he threw two pistoles majestically on the table   177.83479059693968
i only wish i could see it now as plainly as i saw it lying all crushed and crumpled in a corner of the arbor   230.92523784928596
it was midnight   134.91009981605112
the happiest thing that could occur to me would be to die in my father s stead   194.8999401403978
he had hastened to milady s chamber had found it empty the window open and the bars filed had remembered the verbal caution d artagnan had transmitted to him by his messenger had trembled for the duke and running to the stable without taking time to have a horse saddled had jumped upon the first he found had galloped off like the wind had alighted below in the courtyard had ascended the stairs precipitately and on the top step as we have said had encountered felton   86.19111015697044
i have but one man on board and i am as sure of him as i am of myself   207.74881923094665
when they arrived at the madeleine since we are out said beauchamp let us call on m   112.54291945691847

and i hope that this time he whom he ought to chastise will not escape him as before   179.16110556982272
making no reply grimaud opened the poor man s jacket to feel if the heart beat whilst the host approached in his turn   114.34229517355452
the meetings were always held from that time till midnight   72.1564180915189
god will respect his profession and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a priest   197.24074328613955
kitty had been accused of negligence and severely scolded   84.93589241644453
take this peach then she said   168.27409662560285
the french government without protecting them openly as you know gave countenance to volunteer assistance   140.49213759576085
well madame said mazarin bowing i desire that you give me a share in your friends as i have shared with you the little industry and talent that heaven has given me   159.38813445296717
my lord replied la ramee i think if it depended on the cardinal your wishes would be fulfilled   72.88641802708077
then they returned to the rospoli palace   37.96814893140156
it is a long rectangle divided by two upright gratings placed at a distance of three feet from one another to prevent a visitor from shaking hands with or passing anything to the prisoners   166.92462520652884
they wished only to be allowed to fall on their knees before their sovereign and that they might move her to compassion   162.56735056555857
i don t doubt it   53.596059117918095
the lieutenant s entrance produced a burst of laughter in the great drawing room   156.25541822960463
be it understood we are speaking of athos   59.21888004174027
cried athos suddenly where have you brought us   88.39701848700989
any one except grimaud   66.97380225955646
with a calm smile and a gentle wave of the hand monte cristo signed to the distracted mother to lay aside her apprehensions   260.7261601847154
you see said dantès quitting the helm i shall be of some use to you at least during the voyage   35.73398711826526
athos shrunk into his corner pale and motionless as a bas relief   113.29944712014607
was i not nearly your husband   76.08109699367013
the leader of the posse would perhaps have doubted the sincerity of d artagnan if the wine had been bad   102.38797195085132
franz approached the chief advancing several steps to meet him   100.55618353301585
very well cardinal very well   161.05807373398517
let there be only one man in every district who can do as much and by to morrow we shall have quite a powerful army   50.6048912520626
so that when the illustrious companion of the great henry died the only inheritance he was able to leave his son was his sword and his motto   119.44708553612621
de morcerf on account of loving another   114.22874936301726
grimaud sprang toward an open window which looked into the courtyard   184.6816323609477
but how my god   97.27751879968754
but the women will ruin you   72.46838659100348
shall we go forward   51.75140102229516
their lackeys likewise were absent and nothing had been heard of either the one or the other   191.71051568941851
he placed it on the ground passed his hand over his brow and remounted the stairs alleging to himself as an excuse a desire to be assured that no one was watching him but in reality because he felt that he was about to faint   71.54850880875779
grimaud had now finished his accounts   89.90774083326583
now do you want a horse or will you go afoot   64.57558479001707
the voices soon ceased and it seemed to him as if everyone had left the cell   135.49111877634226
danglars no longer had a daughter   160.08774575409205
i shall soon return   158.25312269544747
i shall rent a room in some respectable house wear a decent coat shave every day and go and read the papers in a café   99.99990274131885
it ought to do so at least   40.04516513694155
i have hired a cedar wherry as light as a canoe as easy on the wing as any swallow   96.22085784847175
approaching her mistress she spoke some words in an undertone   98.88637553182055
propositions have been made to me and i confess to you frankly that the coadjutor has made me speak out   77.93282150163253
was the woman handsome   21.958383518317305
why should we not imagine this the apartment of an honest mother   149.54094254802828
what cried all the guests you have not eaten for four and twenty hours   160.89002591068714
as we were sure of finding him there we left him alone   144.32228538950594
i can well believe it replied d artagnan and that was why i got three crowns for him   124.3597043641045
certainly not if as you said just now you have the means of having dantès arrested   121.38693071841186
he no doubt feared that by this opening she might still by some diabolical means corrupt her guards   133.28271417614965
he said pointing to the bodies of his wife and child see are you well avenged   144.71556657126445
four persons have been assassinated in the rue st   154.00999544864163
madame bonacieux found again   225.28737837486904
and though he s but a boy yet since your soul lives again in him dear athos i shall always fancy that you are near me sustaining and encouraging me   88.82196672956977
cried julie whose eyes sparkled with joy   113.76111303859146
then not a word but set to work   111.28379716010217
said the latter with apparent coolness but with deep emotion have you another invalid   115.31139427829609
40262m until one of us dies repeated monte cristo moving his head slightly up and down   107.30364369890414
it is i said athos and what is the name of the person   87.21227125865015
at noon they rode into the avenue of pierrefonds   101.91049343895055
the procureur felt more at ease although he had learned nothing really satisfactory and for the first time since the dinner party at auteuil he slept soundly   92.74753050659024
a murmur of approbation ran through the assembly   159.76199568198967
but what makes you sigh   90.49465057287914
charles without replying a single word turned his head in another direction and pulled his felt hat over it   139.84553735909864
danglars said monte cristo   104.20543568802321
pardon me my friend   121.66268229670067
you ought to be satisfied   129.10340672062478
athos not only failed to reply he even changed the subject of conversation   108.87369353299785
should you be glad to hear that the comte de la fere is well   135.90784201563176
you have saved my life once save me again   110.82375662405929
it is indeed thee   81.90378502041403
oh if such a thought could present itself i would stab myself to punish my heart for having for one instant harbored it   112.12743378739502
oh yes indeed madame continued monte cristo the secret dramas of the east begin with a love philtre and end with a death potion begin with paradise and end with hell   16.584866206007746
d artagnan and planchet took each a post horse and a postillion rode before them   119.70032202563849
then no misfortune has happened to you   133.00801655294595
but in the movement made by the man in stooping a portion of his face was uncovered and d artagnan recognized the coadjutor   213.72966727238477
stammered d artagnan   114.42169958876424
my dear friend said lucien with an air of sovereign contempt do i ever read the papers   81.20382072061601
besides here is a piquant fricandeau and a fillet of beef   89.60472317458202
i am in the power of men upon whom i can have no more influence than upon statues of bronze or granite   176.36508271476725
asked de guiche   102.96051968868579
grimaud then took from the pocket of the officer all the keys it contained and first opened the door of the room in which they were then shut it and double locked it and both he and the duke proceeded rapidly down the gallery which led to the little inclosure   57.49845673654322
will your eminence deign to open the door which leads to the count s room and in ten minutes all will be settled   169.712468979644
replied athos with a deep sigh   111.60199098654176
continue to seek for this man sir said the king to the minister of police   107.77862151824003
explain to me   138.14343800293688
she exclaimed as he entered   96.34387371224207
no returned she but i feel some emotion on seeing for the first time the man without whose intervention we should have been in tears and desolation   168.09701584845635
people might employ themselves in a family affair before all the world   124.87124458754414
you have no doubt some order from the cardinal about you   50.79647262040576
do you not think that they have sent for you both for the same thing   106.89030772233936
there was formerly a fireplace in my dungeon replied faria but it was closed up long ere i became an occupant of this prison   97.35364123912348
oh gentlemen   109.79665969051217
i had chosen this text tell me dear d artagnan if it is not to your taste non inutile est desiderium in oblatione   124.49250236345604
the past and the future   93.15466627928726
he renewed against danglars fernand and villefort the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in his dungeon   0.2800605966885854
thanks guitant   93.8209780752597
he had been contented for the convenience of the house to lodge in the fourth story   95.06212232173506
one day we received a letter   102.91915313335765
she is sure of it   113.13761953429898
that is to say whom you do not like returned the queen   128.61748014625618
he received also the office of admiral which had been held by his father the duc de vendome and an indemnity for his houses and castles demolished by the parliament of bretagne   149.59031996900276
the appointed hour was about to strike   142.3319434957119
of whom i have spoken to you madame   28.173302761896267
when arrived there the cause of the hubbub was apparent to all   176.92568520870816
besides porthos can not owe you much   103.41333084347241
as they approached the piazza del popolo the crowd became more dense and above the heads of the multitude two objects were visible the obelisk surmounted by a cross which marks the centre of the square and in front of the obelisk at the point where the three streets del babuino del corso and di ripetta meet the two uprights of the scaffold between which glittered the curved knife of the mandaïa   31.82362012083422
i have adopted her as my daughter having no one else to love in the world   122.60252142184957
he will treat me better the next time i see him   139.56721441012
provincial diffidence that slight varnish the ephemeral flower that down of the peach had evaporated to the winds through the little orthodox counsels which the three musketeers gave their friend   126.78490599465913
you are placed on high my lord but tremble   175.17367682796612
now four days had elapsed and valentine still lived   117.76491368304201
and yet he had not let fall a single word indicating any previous acquaintance between them   90.00192262173928
you are on the contrary adorable   177.22941878423325
glasses were elevated in the air à l anglaise and the ladies snatching their bouquets from their fair bosoms strewed the table with their floral treasures   130.74671082264527
he was no doubt engaged on board some other vessel and thus his bashfulness arose from the fact of his not having if we may so express ourselves worn mourning for the pharaon longer   131.03419399973635
try and make an effort to do so my good man   52.89212284910347
there is but little reason why i should delay you   165.24308313989505
he raised him almost stifling him as he drew him through the aperture at the risk of flaying him in the passage   136.00682359320297
i mean that i shall be travelling on one of the thirty or forty roads leading out of france   75.98146516326689
then aloud oh madame m   135.22995668844524
the matter was no longer doubtful   133.02558065161168
and who told you to defend the king   69.10222717329897
d artagnan followed him amid cries which strongly resembled curses   77.41152080964653
bless me   176.28318467941057
and who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap himself up in a blue coat embroidered with green   115.61187047926097
and at what distance   122.5393459965509
he bowed   83.63428498781471
the result then of six more such months as this would be to reduce the third rate house to despair   103.37377512294647
come i feel ill here and the two young men spurred on   86.78702187127233
do you know him then   71.80278635198076
sir said the prudent planchet in the first place are you on good terms with monsieur de rochefort   128.3176665606857
happily marie and a follower of hers named kitty could disguise themselves admirably in men s clothes   154.82026580199994
what is that again   95.1143714257467
i don t know what devil of an insect stung me and made me ambitious   43.86001267197969
it is not of my wife i hope   108.46656992668387
for as to the letter addressed to m   84.86665829636172
but indeed i am not prejudiced beyond the power of conviction   69.57784511527478
he was beginning to ask full explanation of that breaking in on his sleep which was very annoying to him when d artagnan instead of explaining closed his mouth with his hand   177.6375021790805
my lord either with the officers of the guard with the other prisoners or with me   170.01455991345773
madame danglars whispered a few words in the ear of debray who approached monte cristo saying the baroness wishes to know what you paid her husband for the horses   117.4131438294841
oh madame i do not presume to call myself your friend but at all times i am your most respectful servant   97.09966403355205
she was an orphan born at valmontone and was named teresa   71.73154542049932
the groom turned toward him with a look of surprise but made no reply   182.8208570763133
he had instructed porthos to profit by this opportunity to see the ceremony   114.57461696899313
you are to obey the commands of the personage to whom i have addressed the inclosed letter   93.62501020810359
then is it not resumed the duke the superintendent emery who gave his son when he was married three hundred thousand francs and a house compared to which the tuileries are a heap of ruins and the louvre a paltry building   73.15372873287255
cried the boy his eyes sparkling with joy if i can find out where bazin is going   80.69495242196658
i shall content myself with being presented to your sister and her husband if you will do me the honor to introduce me   92.60391100376994
the king s service   112.78926921861158
monte cristo shuddered   86.71646020233021
everyone must live   83.47716897078844
faithful friend noble heart   126.52152855057366
daughter of one of your majesty s most faithful servants   55.88409721993131
morrel i beg of you said he not to say a word to dantès on the subject   89.94158797615971
from time to time chills ran through his whole body and clutched his heart in a grasp of ice   82.20475754300762
ferdinand street   165.34668391566032
bonacieux mechanically yes let us be gone   93.86422622479913
has not your excellency heard that the french chargé d affaires was robbed six months ago within five hundred paces of velletri   103.28128180555323
he has been guilty of certain escapades and fears he may be disturbed   86.8788416403899
she opened the drawer and found a key   100.2903184957617
but it is with men that i struggle and i am but a woman to them   123.8313441559331
then he arose and after finishing off the beer at one draught he advanced majestically to the door of the compartment where the wine was   106.08090233485379
and there were in the plan which our lover had devised for milady he was sure certain things that would not obtain the assent of this puritan   63.63603219356407
and i renew my promise   98.23188805997715
and the best hack   170.89058377059484
the safety of a cavalier often depends on the prompt obedience of his horse   179.7650114710475
really my dear monsieur d artagnan said the cardinal your coolness startles me   134.7129635097644
and as every inconvenience deserves its indemnification here is in addition to the price of the studs an order for a thousand pistoles to make you forget the annoyance i cause you   116.79388921128512
athos on the other hand reflected that this recent gentleness of his friends most certainly arose from some plan formed by d artagnan   165.05962140528933
but now he made no reply but turned pale and bit his lips with anger   186.43091772088115
you know that my means are limited and that i am what would be designated a man of moderate pretensions   106.37074838647126
as he was perfectly acquainted with the details of gastronomy d artagnan and aramis made no objection to abandoning this important care to him   98.87701402929252
she saw d avrigny curiously examining the glass which she felt certain of having emptied during the night   127.70809248644116
send him away and all will then be well   97.69562628278966
for your father is indeed here and is seeking you   104.12374746464104
though once i confess i envied him his good fortune   81.18076589843221
ah i recognize you i recognize you   79.91705498800263
by the word of a gentleman you shall have no cause to repent of your confidence   150.67389585980308
the countenances of all gave evidence of terror for notwithstanding the friendly adieu of his eminence they plainly perceived that the cardinal went away with rage in his heart   158.06399549818622
business like persons pay very little attention to women and madame danglars crossed the hall without exciting any more attention than any other woman calling upon her lawyer   54.316262515773
and in the interesting trial that young lady is anxious to witness the case would only be still more aggravated   109.97361918176492
oh cried morrel almost tempted to throw himself on his knees before noirtier and valentine and to adore them as two superior beings what have i ever done in my life to merit such unbounded happiness   19.287676438595284
milady under the influence of inexpressible terror sat down without uttering a word   54.268805119348706
here is a soup which is rather inviting   123.518791118077
hardly had they given the bridles of their horses to their lackeys and rid themselves of their cloaks when a man approached them and after looking at them for an instant by the doubtful light of the lantern hung in the centre of the courtyard he uttered an exclamation of joy and ran to embrace them   139.79558387320054
our holy father the pope has made him a knight of jesus christ for the services he rendered to the christians in the east   108.17715649507697
yes i know that he said but give me the particulars   36.81069927927177
ah gentlemen he cried as the two friends entered you are very happy   146.91541138661015
others besides you have undergone such monsieur athos and have replied thereto   147.6311613068469
make room   167.24011840198563
count said morrel you are the epitome of all human knowledge and you seem like a being descended from a wiser and more advanced world than ours   156.49318565924432
they thought this order did not concern me sir   184.97832647416203
address yourself to m   89.6859082347014
50269m i believe all you tell me without questioning its meaning   152.77385589096806
as no attempt was made to prevent it the door was opened and a magistrate wearing his official scarf presented himself followed by four soldiers and a corporal   115.05030179099086
he is my demon apparently   118.42802866527583
my money boxes are my pactolus as i think m   61.96362258750523
on entering the banker s mansion they perceived the phaeton and servant of m   158.88549384949096
yes yes to be sure kitty said d artagnan   64.40492038195976
dreaming   221.69040999634362
what does it signify to you if the castle of yanina was given up by a french officer   147.96918562487636
he stopped however at the door for an instant   184.24366670003997
monte cristo pointed to a chair which the procureur was obliged to take the trouble to move forwards himself while the count merely fell back into his own on which he had been kneeling when m   130.29896017565557
stay count he added you who may be called the emperor if i claim the title of king of finance have you many pieces of paper of this size each worth a million   74.54123790943838
unhappy father said monte cristo   93.17230418173979
tis then all settled   152.98170378883003
i have just left him answered caderousse   153.9608421437434
most undoubtedly replied monte cristo   149.61363706531412
noirtier said madame de villefort   115.90053089700532
groslow began turning the cards one after another   122.12751314002489
instead of signing i will go to you and we will fly   54.585842413603615
mercédès was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which deprived her of edmond   82.44483223143034
he stopped them to offer his compliments upon their appointments which in an instant drew round them a hundred gapers   152.4545221418971
hate reproach the man that has spared my son s life   132.3939573562043
you will soon know   32.116183242614184
oh why is not the world a wilderness   156.03937422186902
the more honorable men there are here the better i shall be satisfied   97.6667386538892
every day   88.94288872236596
you told me yourself that that ring that ring i have   63.059365772242664
mouston has a very fine appearance   117.22720150473125
oh i can not believe you   123.6030350622076
the same evening the following was read in le messager by telegraph   127.00812212232991
he could not help thinking of m   160.3632438877475
that horse was to have identified us in the day of battle   221.06829949144964
but no doubt i was mistaken   226.91826526461023
and god has poured balm into your wounds as he does into those of all who are in affliction   151.76930293972944
with the sun gaiety revived   138.35579518969286
it was like the eve of a battle   99.85361159781081
it was for this reason as he said to those around him that he had put on his cloak   205.33036980720732
i have a father who is seventy if he yet lives   106.07422563138006
it would not be astonishing   107.5709475923307
and so am i replied athos   22.421234056703184
in exchange for all this he had acquired the protection and good will of the queen   47.20756297674136
we have seen many other such   87.21571168345056
i m afraid we are prisoners whispered d artagnan to his friend   126.68622597673941
what i propose to do is fair in war   119.28917936149234
a sailor   136.76023776154273
one of the salient points of his character was the search for adventures and a love of romance   164.56174882574055
a waiter opened the door   122.85459596928264
give us the clergy and the people of whom you can dispose and i will bring you the citizens and the parliament   78.94984971962685
it was an order the count had just given for immediately ali went noiselessly and returned bearing a black dress and a three cornered hat   116.12302717273899
the count looked up and fixed his eyes on mercédès who arose partly from her seat and extended both her hands towards him   66.80684276163859
suppose for instance the prisoner as is more than probable to have served under napoleon well can you expect for an instant that one accustomed at the word of his commander to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe will scruple more to drive a stiletto into the heart of one he knows to be his personal enemy than to slaughter his fellow creatures merely because bidden to do so by one he is bound to obey   102.68317556661474
how can you find out   93.67983017360527
de villefort replied by ordering the strictest inquiries to be made respecting these two persons   121.44308911541911
tomorrow morning   61.225653714467704
fools said charles do they take me for a coward like themselves   45.26723597595279
the young people felt a mutual esteem   85.31521012656361
why replied monte cristo since we mutually understand each other for such i presume is the case   164.84661106916877
what is this light   101.76000561585006
what do you say edmond   58.36314652927336
ah there you are marechal cried anne of austria joyfully   109.42483699389632
the count placed his hand on his brow as if to collect his thoughts   232.22107596769342
on whom do my hopes rest   108.86812585440475
in spite of his usual command over himself dantès could not restrain his impetuosity   102.32904317348657
his hair of a chestnut color was curled slightly   239.77360510116586
can i do anything for you gentlemen   45.01042861096488
why yes replied d artagnan with embarrassment   70.49527785843398
lieutenant felton from lord de winter said patrick   75.92407190441739
no not tomorrow morning if you please but immediately   18.146009728425213
and i shall always do so replied d avrigny for it has never for one instant ceased to retain possession of my mind   44.419074643044894
the three musketeers   57.20103517514982
you are examining my den said aramis   147.1963544710215
that s against all rules   64.50639690512455
pardon me you are right   76.74720416899422
chapelain   185.9969116778356
my lord what have you done with your sister your sister who was my mother   78.579782689963
and if tomorrow your curiosity still continues as great pursue your researches if you will   116.72069634089753
that a spaniard by birth should have fought against the spaniards   112.55446039563002
i have 1 060 000 francs remaining he said   103.01172308646562
it seems you are right planchet   170.31276837721373
thus villefort passed through the mass of spectators and officers of the palais and withdrew   200.05176722906631
de chevreuse not only served the queen in her political intrigues but what tormented him still more in her amorous intrigues   125.84153324104636
but the sentinel who knew that mordaunt was one of the most confidential friends of the general thought the order did not extend to the young man   119.36016729903997
there was a study for emmanuel who never studied and a music room for julie who never played   133.4806647462765
he is gone to noisy   49.472118527662595
he was thunderstruck   74.25643445306704
they soon arrived at the silent solitary inn   116.9231174858677
in the middle of the stream he stopped the boat and suspending his burden over the water cried in a loud voice let the justice of god be done   150.22697481752084
is it heaven that opens before me   114.21558550908652
he murmured as he left the threshold of the palace ungrateful court   67.85696855346968
that will be for another time   110.97179021734415
what did the prince do then   11.696508446280205
why the music you have been listening to   50.26622343972197
be of good heart planchet you shall preserve your reputation as a veracious man   48.316836590050656
what can they have done with him   95.50410795056871
i need to know whether i am among enemies or friends   70.33300229915949
friends   92.15993523229989
i can show you answered the gascon   66.71335543647663
and monsters of all shapes and kinds requiring to be overcome ere victory is ours   22.92273388716488
his health hurrah   136.28955511228352
what i was saying villefort was that the bonapartists had not our sincerity enthusiasm or devotion   89.05760526794921
franz himself however saw his way more plainly in proportion as he went on towards the light which served in some manner as a guide   67.62253485840591
yes saddled and bridled   138.35184045331837
sometimes one and the same thing said morrel with a smile   150.28454532632333
three curates remained those of st   164.77337239326525
she was of a noble family of fiesole count   97.76617904986234
come come enough of such compliments   62.3646423283895
is he in bed   68.23470297421919
and did you catch any of his words   55.629724914372815
monte cristo had endeavored completely to overturn the parisian ideas and to feed the curiosity as much as the appetite of his guests   142.83889307466941
oh i entreat you exclaimed morrel in a low voice do not speak another word count   94.6499836414099
valentine said morrel with a trembling voice i had waited since half past eight and did not see you come   18.112122569175185
his breast was covered with a coat of mail   234.7408968162142
i believe he found you in some unpleasant position but do not know of what nature for i did not ask not being inquisitive   204.09340842241232
the patrol passed   112.48767065745261
we are much more likely to be killed said athos if we do not go   82.36662788126728
the court of anne of austria was full of gayety and animation   142.65018241111522
the king s request had undoubtedly been acceded to by an affirmative sign for in firm sonorous accents which vibrated in the depths of athos s heart the king began his speech explaining his conduct and counseling the welfare of the kingdom   31.286530391938996
the baroness danglars   145.16327656602974
tis true he said   142.7962959933682
i do not know but he wishes to speak to you   155.14129336311643
cried the young girl while raoul turned pale at the idea of his being perhaps the cause of her disaster   141.76027470585473
said d artagnan pressing athos s hand   94.69251031113309
it is for me to reply to that   133.3873592478656
and in my past life they might find something far more grave than the selling of smuggled cigars or barrels of brandy without a permit   124.23178292275004
at this instant the sergeant who had been for his orders returned and pointing to the three gentlemen in cloaks said the passports are in order   100.87458116873871
yes it is indeed he   45.69168517181839
then you feel pretty much as you generally do after you have had the dose which i am accustomed to give you every sunday   169.4921262969308
nevertheless he bowed to the very ground in gratitude for mazarin s compliment   111.4522089360293
stop rascal   89.86144774565997
burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to the magistrate to hear his words   88.50138939403223
thanks my dear friend said madame danglars trying to smile   82.50969870031186
at half past one they descended the coachman and footman had put on their livery over their disguises which gave them a more ridiculous appearance than ever and which gained them the applause of franz and albert   46.5602985042819
and madame de villefort were beginning to speak in parables appeared to pay no attention to the conversation and feigned to be busily engaged in watching edward who was mischievously pouring some ink into the bird s water glass   139.3811891357413
she was ignorant of the change that had taken place in him with respect to the cardinal a change which had since been strengthened by two or three visits from the comte de rochefort who had become the best friend of bonacieux and had persuaded him without much trouble that no culpable sentiments had prompted the abduction of his wife but that it was only a political precaution   73.06383438197125
what upset him completely was that the four friends seemed to have no acquaintance with one another   79.92466666631326
stammered morcerf   168.12461837052294
andrea examined it carefully to ascertain if the letter had been opened or if any indiscreet eyes had seen its contents   161.29660978044316
my cloak said grimaud from the bottom of the hold   115.04160616351945
and if their faces were unknown to him or displeased him he replied that the abbé was not in paris an answer which satisfied most persons because the abbé was known to be a great traveller   74.62282999599333
it is right said athos   124.99213537026513
terror recalled me to myself   111.06321115015807
i believe the fellow is here on his own account for i have heard that these gentlemen born beyond the tweed are very vindictive   167.35765638780498
well if you do not go this very instant i will have you arrested by the queen s orders and i will have you placed in the bastille which you dread so much   133.89992174866583
what do you expect to get   126.8061282396822
on the contrary he felt a certain degree of lightness a faculty for absorbing the pure air and enjoying the bright sunshine more vividly than ever   90.0571257886622
but take care the same thing does not happen to you in selling the diamond you feared with the gold   66.4404514034344
do you know she is going to embrace a religious life   79.10992584066409
is she then preparing for a stroke   35.6807369117344
said i to him   117.18336369163899
the child stuck out his lips and turned away his head in a disdainful manner saying he s too ugly   151.13420672671748
but grimaud had already mounted the staircase and was waiting on the last step   20.02221131539973
yet perhaps if i had found you humble and penitent i might have prevented benedetto from killing you   42.59830765072512
but they did not do so with m   90.76365586930456
i allowed it to become quite dark   146.95513023462382
they understood then from the few words which escaped from d artagnan what affair was in hand and as they thought that overtaking his man or losing sight of him d artagnan would return to his rooms they kept on their way   107.33996615728985
but in what carriage do we start   57.706139582161164
and now i think of it by heavens he may have sent the letter itself   129.69421706609248
then he turned to the officer   180.8675499367285
a serious matter said the count looking at franz with the earnestness usual to him   82.45819913893675
each person s attention was occupied   104.73911887743036
in his projects of intrigue for the future and determined as he was to make his three friends the instruments of his fortune d artagnan was not sorry at getting into his grasp beforehand the invisible strings by which he reckoned upon moving them   119.25520941202376
send for some oil of turpentine and tartar emetic   132.71389188527834
that man had the power to crush him and yet he had not done so   67.35283576796502
what the devil are you going to do   127.74136893181725
where are you going marechal   165.48160573717504
well then i want you to take me up in your fine carriage and carry me back   77.57736201264817
there was a moment of silence during which the two men looked at each other as if to make a preliminary acquaintance after which d artagnan bowed as a sign that he listened   166.89750362530614
which is not quite the same thing   116.529557373125
d artagnan not less forward than they did likewise and all ran out in order to repair to their posts   94.24193309670441
does she know you   113.87534278239815
he paused exchanged two words with the sentinel   85.99330773945776
i shot two with my double barrelled gun and two more with my pistols but i was then disarmed and two were still left   109.60910779150704
and d artagnan displayed four gunshot holes in his cloak and two in his beaver   32.61359792879023
gervais and we will remain there an hour by the watch whatever the enemy may do to dislodge us   114.88266192908061
woe is me   118.06489742118777
chevalier said the king when the door was closed i believe you are right and that this man only came here with evil intentions   170.25710101821534
aramis saluted then turning toward athos i don t care to camp on the place royale with all these people he said   175.52651697286632
in june the profit amounted to 900 000   128.9633655443048
it was therefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the principal cities in italy without having excited the most trifling observation   150.42344538277786
do not utter that name   58.18737889465676
here is a beautiful lawn   147.5054478913014
this man is still your friend and you perhaps make use of him as your accomplice   51.71610947316324
well said albert in a determined tone you see that your paper has insulted a member of my family and i insist on a retractation being made   100.65234831469405
soldiers are big children   93.76531025671066
d artagnan of the king s guards company dessessart is expected at the palais cardinal this evening at eight o clock   154.96937742228525
you will have sufficient time before five o clock   103.44293581517024
well albert this money which was formerly designed to promote the comfort and tranquillity of the woman i adored may now through strange and painful circumstances be devoted to the same purpose   91.29641684931173
finally ten months and a half had gone by and no favorable change had taken place and dantès began to fancy the inspector s visit but a dream an illusion of the brain   102.2812485504442
the eye of aramis kindled in spite of himself   150.09286967451354
that was the sloop   57.03084326187391
oh i don t doubt that   113.99036596855613
pray let me know who you really are   58.171057487205
no doubt you come to join the princes   57.304593236656785
surrounded i suppose only by clodhoppers with whom you could not associate   45.921111764228414
the executioner opened his eyes turned toward the young man and grasped his arm   107.38787800687462
then turning towards the paralytic he said you possess then 900 000 francs of capital which according to the manner in which you have invested it ought to bring in an income of about 40 000 livres   96.18369192162476
yes were it only out of curiosity   115.69804809658152
and yet said athos with his habitual calmness if it be monsieur d artagnan who is concerned in this matter i do not perceive how i can take his place   157.8389122749082
a secret voice seems to whisper to me that there must be something more than chance in this unexpected reciprocity of friendship   112.729830680076
exclaimed athos extending his hand to d artagnan   88.87214822986404
and yet it is very hard added she that a man upon whose affection i thought i might depend treats me thus unkindly and will not comply with any of my fancies   110.12988956891034
there is someone then concealed here whose throat this amiable lady is desirous of cutting said de winter in an ironical contemptuous tone   162.08059518883448
i thought said franz to the count that you told me there would be but one execution   81.74859191092723
against my murderer   130.70833051426405
it is indeed said danglars   123.52659472241022
you will excuse us sir but we are told that a battle is expected and we do not wish to arrive the day after it   208.77177147471684
we parted at hyères   140.8679615986661
as for myself as soon as i recovered my senses i went to monsieur the governor to whom i related all that had passed and asked what i should do with my prisoner   167.61016258280532
serves for me the fate of cardinals caprara and bentivoglio who were poisoned   125.169233474338
a violent convulsion attacked the old man   64.24119584204823
teresa had a great desire to see this ball   86.83260049355103
monsieur de retz wished to become archbishop in his uncle s place and cardinal like mazarin   114.23387597981036
milady seized the occasion   34.34221570998736
beware my lord you are in the hands of god   97.8678511498454
nothing replied bonacieux nothing   173.905740526957
that would be too terrible   176.71666965306625
a pistole is not enough said d artagnan tis worth a louis   128.04661223356086
information about the project gutenberg literary archive foundation the project gutenberg literary archive foundation is a non profit 501 c 3 educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the internal revenue service   93.96669768432123
the two notaries were holding a consultation as to the best means of proceeding with the affair   89.91019484044543
said milady with a smile which might have disarmed the angel of the last judgment   157.1211715346722
at length after a journey of nearly an hour the carriage stopped before an iron gate which closed an avenue leading to a castle severe in form massive and isolated   1.2419522845321467
these horsemen were our friends or rather an avant garde composed of d artagnan and athos   54.61626519630048
the overseer would not have objected while he was about it to have made some improvements in the garden but the count had positively forbidden it to be touched   35.23594656550286
in one of the mourning coaches beauchamp debray and château renaud were talking of the very sudden death of the marchioness   103.08400376753995
father   180.6932878023954
madame de saint méran had three successive attacks at intervals of some minutes each one more serious than the former   118.392074364284
well at the height of his despair god assisted him through human means   99.97170923691331
i have replied d artagnan pulling out his treasure from his pocket and placing it on the table   47.03898339123643
as i expected my officer was there   105.57470795427788
for yesterday if my memory does not deceive me you were at my house   160.50345174470297
and he emptied his pockets on the table the contents consisting of a dozen gold pieces five or six five franc pieces and some smaller coin   94.08863371998406
i need to see you strong in your courageous assurance to recover myself   97.49976438379973
two or three hundred roman crowns   43.380483548486055
the four friends resumed their own clothes girded on their swords ordered mousqueton and blaisois to pay the bill and to arrange everything for immediate departure and wrapped in their large cloaks left in search of their game   188.4402977578473
yes to escort him into the capital   119.52166816624631
his apartment consisted of two small chambers very nicely fitted up in a furnished house the hostess of which still young and still really handsome cast tender glances uselessly at him   104.24829543076255
the regiment of the guards was recruited among the first gentlemen of the kingdom   89.44906386958979
my lord he has been for three days at the rue cassette   44.58243772036474
in truth i was fated said she   107.20113802956745
now as d artagnan used no ceremony with aramis seeing that bazin forgot to announce him he announced himself   147.8510543399434
but we shall indubitably attract a ball   107.30762446386747
desrues was however i must confess more skilful   108.369850334639
so you see that i am not likely to do any of these things   192.38937120747295
how came it known   86.0915011834781
as a result she raised her head opened her eyes and sighed deeply   145.31891635687083
therefore leaving directions at every place for grimaud they took a crossroad which conducted the little troop by the bank of a small stream flowing into the lys   98.52101943589463
i shall follow the count s directions   129.2060793491118
but he does wrong to use his privilege   106.32024392994235
i thought the abbé busoni had told your excellency   132.13428281362596
four or five cloaks had already been lifted with a dexterity without parallel and not one of the victims had dared to say a word when some fool of a fellow less patient than the others took it into his head to cry out guard   153.55983724349147
i give you 45 000 francs that is 2 500 livres of income a fortune such as i wish i had myself and you are not satisfied   108.98029494663132
we are almost there and i want no one to see me getting out of your carriage   86.15767777679099
in consequence he brought them the key of his own at least such was the apparent motive of his visit   117.28084318584237
assuming a dignified air she turned round to debray without answering her husband   50.95398250495034
this rough appeal marked by the eloquence which characterized mazarin when he spoke in italian or spanish and which he lost entirely in speaking french was uttered with such impenetrable expression that gondy clever physiognomist as he was had no suspicion of its being more than a simple warning to be more subdued   169.1908229779308
and sitting down he wrote a letter to his broker ordering him to sell out at the market price   117.33610191452904

as the count was immensely rich excepting the danger carmela had run and the marvellous manner in which she had escaped made that appear to him rather a favor of providence than a real misfortune the loss occasioned by the conflagration was to him but a trifle   86.54155823244355

la jeune amélie had a very active crew very obedient to their captain who lost as little time as possible   60.211121866225795

you will ruin both yourself and me by your folly   95.82949032245769
these are doubtless your family arms   124.36336868500301
just at that moment voices were heard hailing the concierge   61.50391710308322
god forbid   109.60658634657739
he then returned to his place but did not sit down   119.41897727805045
while a spit loaded with partridges was turning before the fire and on each side of a large chimneypiece over two chafing dishes were boiling two stewpans from which exhaled a double odor of rabbit and fish stews rejoicing to the smell   113.6422359920706
alack   176.67225264185095
the soul of milady was bathed in an infernal joy   95.17984715398185
he asked with his flattering manner   119.52738256331635
but now i have forgiven the world for the love of you   141.10027258174895

after a short time the cardinal arranged his shoulder belt then looked with great complacency at his hands which were most elegant and of which he took the greatest care   142.1234320116897
poor fellow poor fellow   109.34069935997914

i will then wait until the last moment and when my misery is certain irremediable hopeless i will write a confidential letter to my brother in law another to the prefect of police to acquaint them with my intention and at the corner of some wood on the brink of some abyss on the bank of some river i will put an end to my existence as certainly as i am the son of the most honest man who ever lived in france   120.79045184955682
and if he doesn t go straight i will crush him that s all   181.58761938212888

very well wait a minute   128.43879787435884
but monte cristo looked at him with so melancholy and sweet a smile that maximilian felt the tears filling his eyes   46.02318848734123

this is the fourth which you have let fall and i have picked up   120.43543982537228
in fact the minister who in the plenitude of his power had been unable to unearth napoleon s secret might in despair at his own downfall interrogate dantès and so lay bare the motives of villefort s plot   58.27280411562739
with a slight inclination of the head danglars signed to the count to be seated pointing significantly to a gilded armchair covered with white satin embroidered with gold   88.27218203239998
cried i   75.04596192310913

one morning he threatened her with the severest consequences if she did not supply him with what he desired and disappeared and remained away all day leaving the kind hearted assunta who loved him as if he were her own child to weep over his conduct and bewail his absence   137.08195002105322
oh enough of this enough of this he cried   116.71062212582302
it had been supposed some of the papers might be in the arabian romaic or turkish language and the interpreter of the house was in attendance   116.46302237461367
motionless with her burning and fixed glances in her solitary apartment how well the outbursts of passion which at times escape from the depths of her chest with her respiration accompany the sound of the surf which rises growls roars and breaks itself like an eternal and powerless despair against the rocks on which is built this dark and lofty castle   146.79699982937797
you will not watch me   81.99593759710206
did he send you   125.5667092178721

laporte place the king in bed   126.71334751521051
but i had such a sudden attack of indisposition real   176.56512126837762
i am glad of it   87.97653120793106
they are beating the general alarm   70.70317232113948
there was a moment at which he felt something like remorse   106.91438119946932
on reaching the pont neuf the coadjutor found it strictly guarded and a man approached him   128.73745794541412
so much the better cried porthos   154.1931118224867
d avrigny s door   34.49945885733645
you are very humble today remarked the governor   140.36771881161516
are we not eating a horse porthos   107.88239872876566
oh monsieur if i could believe i might trust in your discretion   66.1439549979143
oh valentine were i in your place and did i feel conscious as you do of being worshipped adored with such a love as mine a hundred times at least should i have passed my hand between these iron bars and said take this hand dearest maximilian and believe that living or dead i am yours yours only and forever   101.59331364521401
i answer for bazin said aramis   137.21875922761365
how can it be   140.91529329753644
oh he was decidedly   111.6648617551812
yes i paid them nothing and yet they are gone   134.70983658229508
hardly however had he taken ten steps before he returned   188.75753392256314
cried the novice in her turn seizing the hands of milady and devouring her with her eyes   66.77851781000152
but they will not be content with that   175.73058739172936
and had the pretty madeleine no news   63.7040723382381
said the count in a tone which showed how gladly he would have been admitted to the secret   113.07871237230445
the waking chapter 33   72.82803712109025
come my friend he said thrusting his hand through the opening where are we going   25.15552438739168
no cried felton no   180.81312800269674
they are here   107.5477084676998
la chesnaye go and see if by rummaging all my pockets you can find forty pistoles   69.83552934905151
but do you think we ought to accept these 3 000 francs   209.0744098208994
executioner as you were of king charles   135.06728184856794
the young man wishing to spare his employer the pain of this interview questioned the new comer   173.46506208153906
have you seen him since i left him   97.65993547230613
for heaven s sake do not serve as a conductor between that man and me   142.2458357811056
those who wish to respect him as a master would not buy him as a slave   180.42505104038634
his mania   120.53976769372922
well there sir is another proof that good people are never rewarded on this earth and that none but the wicked prosper   101.05010443909815
d artagnan followed him and mousqueton having closed the door mounted behind the carriage with many groans   117.112258749263
it was just light enough for her to see who was coming   54.93479405444931
cried mercédès with an angry look at her cousin   74.96474872577397
he was an annoyance to the cardinal   106.93362918806886
although in justice the people who arrest and imprison you ought at least to feed you   118.02862637222302
the duke was not mistaken   112.11225824900589
you will certainly need it to morrow   87.03238367667974
that will cost you a hundred francs   170.06133250677908
are you going to leave me   77.40948339442349
you may well say perchance replied the banker   95.96936888988009
withdraw him gently from the queen whom he does not like from mazarin whom he despises   197.25061899196146
tired   77.24022962674695
we will not part with it for that sum   85.99921141834736
she passed first   181.15403465622654
it will require four or five days for the transmission of the money four or five days for her to return   179.24973010041475
what are you thinking of   138.21829721047382
the night at the louvre   119.57597037044722
said the mendicant   142.6031344201893
the ticket bore the name of diavolaccio   157.36801347868555
in one of the despatches the cardinal declares to the queen that the treasury is empty and that her majesty has no more money   163.51795200104758
at other times he would return home to write a treatise and requested his friends not to disturb him   163.25300793251412
then i understood from your countenance there was more to fear than i had thought   139.86696592827266
the morcerfs   138.04183542998493
i supplicate you i implore you on my knees let me die and my last sigh shall be a blessing for my preserver   61.78966290800749
that is all i have to say today   47.057312260656005
i will make the journey on purpose to see him if it is worth while   110.77216063116784
meanwhile you will raise my monthly allowance to five hundred francs my little fellow   162.20171299820004
they may give him the honors of the sack   201.02409751454633
can it gentlemen   102.23154258791999
then i am afraid i shall very much inconvenience you   58.03434559224026
pardon my frankness too my lord   170.44302287756642
fetch the nearest   118.22955859522779
to him no doubt   170.3728490403997
besides it began to grow late and then as today people went to bed early in the quarter of the luxembourg   246.77519284886358
very well my dear sir   93.06274020892238
are we to pass the night in the king s room   165.32650380735032
and as a proof of what i say here is mine in my pocket   88.01983975931763
i will not   154.51010838241274
holà bazin come here this minute   99.50729617292029
at court provided you have ever the honor to go there continued m   88.77450643596947
i am not condemning you for this monsieur baptistin   95.0268924435617
but to that i answer that it is impossible   94.63737156310141
well then hearken to me   14.378049564608148
finally the rest of the equipment was successively debated in the same manner   108.08279551071342
mazarin sent us with a letter to general cromwell   110.97947581678596
barrois was now showing signs of returning consciousness   180.20908884390155
the turnkey obeyed and the inspector gazed curiously into the chamber of the mad abbé as the prisoner was usually called   188.4903568295844
and you did cry   49.76349515993014
explain yourself my pretty sibyl   133.14571321104074
the reason why i am now dissatisfied is that i have not a clear appreciation of the past   184.00796403997316
so much so replied monte cristo that while you call yourself baron you are not willing to call anybody else count   77.80597705379384
d artagnan descended by the staircase at which he had entered and found athos and the four musketeers waiting his appearance and beginning to grow uneasy   102.57635608585767
the translation of this new question occupied another five minutes   117.99246378788646
stake your diamond then   93.92953349436725
having obtained the light he hurried upstairs again and once more i heard his rapid and uneasy footsteps   83.91426490572434
de monte cristo s friend   152.05308326962466
there was no longer a doubt that felton was convinced   126.92321276240884
as i told you it is an old family jewel   132.3823351360511
perfectly madame   75.78096559238026
bonacieux we must have them back again   140.08852341218986
i believe i did   90.55611540382544
god would not permit such a crime   122.30735529485814
it therefore only now remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she is destined   60.8661689083036
yes said monte cristo i perfectly recollect him   92.0906932488286
he was therefore about to return to the palazzo bracciano without loss of time when suddenly a luminous idea crossed his mind   195.80600359452458
d épinay return   189.51147660841434
have i not a single friend in the world who will aid me either to live or to die   98.25504972102806
as she advanced she fancied she heard a voice speaking her name   130.02130996037744
he was no   52.397368524493245
good replied aramis calmly   170.08028019922153
then run to the door and open it yourself   169.9029104694035
no madame i was ignorant of that said the musketeer   141.60194666159722
gentlemen replied d artagnan i have already received by monsieur de cavois a similar invitation from his eminence   65.26893448863481
the two women who thus knelt in united prayer were the daughter and grand daughter of henry iv   175.0816509203292
can i believe my ears   156.41446882562013
nothing and he read you have not answered my first note   161.39476505185723
everybody pities you sir   98.02499179322298
presently they heard milady retire to her room   150.43186605362337
charles having proceeded with aramis as with athos embraced them both   164.35755091823026
the similarity in the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances is so great that were i obliged to affirm by oath what i have now stated i should hesitate   69.83545197704771
lips of stone turned to flame breasts of ice became like heated lava so that to franz yielding for the first time to the sway of the drug love was a sorrow and voluptuousness a torture as burning mouths were pressed to his thirsty lips and he was held in cool serpent like embraces   94.79570568310697
the young man reflected for a moment then an expression of sublime resignation appeared in his eyes and with a slow and sad gesture he took off his two epaulets the insignia of his rank   180.33826556239745
the count watched albert waving his hand to him   106.08578259352409
oh not much from twelve to thirteen hundred thousand francs   122.01957700330682
let us consider first the ancient rights   95.94823867524435
nothing i should like better   109.82636253584909
at the end of the second he had ceased to mark the lapse of time   90.20528335959878
dantès my friend you are not yet registered number one on board the good ship pharaon   45.86013443144127
when you have purchased the estate i desire i want constant relays of horses at ten leagues apart along the northern and southern road   60.69690091031575
he was never seen at the theatres at concerts or in any place of public resort   178.9018324449977
alas our own wars quite absorb the time and the mind of a poor incapable infirm old minister like me   64.20606919351529
yes you will receive it from your father personally but lord wilmore will be the security for the money   82.76514747522036
well will you take me or shall i take edward   152.2809991540064
two guards attended the mercer who made him traverse a court and enter a corridor in which were three sentinels opened a door and pushed him unceremoniously into a low room where the only furniture was a table a chair and a commissary   34.50441773348716
what is he doing up there   57.84847256991333
for the singular clause of the only will that had been found had caused it to be regarded as a genuine relic preserved in the family with superstitious veneration   146.05283357126532
on arriving there with an air as majestic as that of an emperor he stretched his hand towards that one of the roads which the traveller was to follow   77.40326401530976
de villefort entered his father s room followed by madame de villefort   131.76350250057345
there answered the traveler pointing to the table   132.36836936736253
the reader must now cross the seine with us and follow us to the door of the carmelite convent in the rue saint jacques   151.70393559223885
there is the little door opening into the garden   97.88438908845005
the young man stood before her sorrowful and resolute   126.65268116943147
no unfortunately   100.71230977873128
cromwell s letter   118.63186771811712
a corridor   127.6155062810785
the most urgent thing now is to learn where the enemy is and what he is doing   125.70391183635961
how i worked how i hoped how i struck every piece of turf thinking to find some resistance to my spade   114.09875229044555
the beggar shook his head   120.50777737620936
well how has all gone off   41.16097554504769
what then has monsieur de flamarens been telling me   184.90634590927618
oh it is impossible   97.98518589477595
draw nearer penelon said the young man and tell us all about it   39.33009249035007
the baron went out sobbing   168.47560642399483
as a punishment for the crime i had committed answered bertuccio   160.26186322032004
what undertaking can have brought him to paris   60.42236309464954
he placed himself at the table and wrote a little note which he sealed with a ring and gave the billet to kitty   64.5734202757659
exclaimed mordaunt thank you   51.80084049265179
de tréville possessed at the commencement of his   141.71060230415344
and young as i was i quite understood that some imminent danger was hanging over our heads   182.14612525183236
and having again recommended porthos to the care of mousqueton and paid his bill to the host he resumed his route with planchet already relieved of one of his led horses   114.67664422420398
agreed   136.65593678346139
bertuccio said the count since you have been in paris you have become quite nervous and apparently out of your element   74.13141577465491
felton blushed   177.465131450755
i know his character   192.90506955273827
you have permitted me to converse with you from time to time valentine but forbidden my ever following you in your walks or elsewhere have i not obeyed   103.57177327732481
exclaimed the terrible interrogator   91.45973840911023
a woman will often from mere wilfulness prefer that which is dangerous to that which is safe   170.11873650298622
on approaching the house he perceived m   143.12193946350217
yes sir i will give my attention to the subject   70.50476325029248
he is one of your friends then monsieur le comte   11.38919452252442
we and his majesty will lead the second   127.74613893790182
the queen looked with surprise at this strange man whose brilliant courage made him the equal of the bravest and who was by his fine and quick intelligence the equal of the most astute   114.24878856606314
is it possible said he that where your liberty is at stake you can allow any such scruple to deter you from obtaining it   104.44973596537908
although in reality a liberal he negotiated a loan of six millions for charles x   33.60979690801777
the soul forms its own horizons   63.7844090802079
bazin who looked at his master without comprehending the cause of this change in a melancholy manner allowed the omelet to slip into the spinach and the spinach onto the floor   159.44908600950043
noirtier s grandchild as valentine and yet if she had not been going to marry m   60.489899346318566
his boots were of black leather and at his girdle hung that sword with a magnificent hilt that porthos had so often admired in the rue feron   131.8216851134139
albert reflected   93.31618865212693
de troisville as his family was still called in gascony or m   108.68045862132139
the king asked to remain up having he said no wish to sleep   142.84773938443652
so that the news of the approaching exit ran like a train of lighted gunpowder along the streets   131.45458500645796
the bell and bottle tavern and now let us leave mademoiselle danglars and her friend pursuing their way to brussels and return to poor andrea cavalcanti so inopportunely interrupted in his rise to fortune   63.22675646502879
dawn was shedding its pallid placid glimmer on the purple ocean when at the distance of a musket shot from them was seen a dark gray mass above which gleamed a triangular sail   136.5474571879995
go on signor pastrini continued franz smiling at his friend s susceptibility   48.72455480535591
de villefort send for the priest   143.1444895807591
my dear friend said aramis remember that he goes in an opposite direction from that in which we are going that he has a fresh horse and ours are fatigued so that we shall disable our own horses without even a chance of overtaking him   166.38938987547996
madame danglars returned in another cab to the passage on the other side of which she found her carriage and her coachman sleeping peacefully on his box while waiting for her   198.23854232784984
but to crown all these advantages albert de morcerf commanded an income of 50 000 livres a more than sufficient sum to render him a personage of considerable importance in paris   110.38192159277274
the world calls me beautiful   137.92784223449894
keep my signatures   95.43068979772954
to prison with him   129.72060566212588
master broussel is being strangled   81.33447958992238
de saint méran villefort s father in law   128.37112669588322
asked the mercer piqued to the quick   121.1539101461572
now said d artagnan to himself noticing that silent play of countenance i am sure of it   164.25114602904773
oh i have often heard whispers of things that seem to me most strange the father a bonapartist the son a royalist   132.9645636171374
de tréville who was waiting for them already informed of this fresh disturbance   131.09404548532612
milady tried to open the door in order to throw herself out   46.60930509584978
a man appeared on the threshold   79.6633860126248
what will you do with the letter then   37.810433174502606
i uttered a cry of joy   128.8924786565306
are you then a coward   68.80900268809359
after a short time the count saw bertuccio who until then had been occupied on the other side of the house glide into an adjoining room   106.32444256781135
and for what kind of talent are they celebrated   142.70696188833432
but if you yourselves should be struck   128.96295766897683
but suppose one pass as is permissible in philology from the word itself to its softened synonym then instead of committing an ignoble assassination you make an elimination   110.10351994313369
resumed mazarin   110.09256789439782
and when he was alone in the world i tried by absolute devotion to his will to make up to him all he had done for me during ten years of unremitting kindness   109.05957609381754
instead of striking between the sixth and seventh left ribs as your countrymen do you must have struck higher or lower and life is very tenacious in these lawyers or rather there is no truth in anything you have told me it was a fright of the imagination a dream of your fancy   162.81814442737345
it seems to me i did my duty   99.59279998701689
30333m valentine trembled convulsively   98.70283145068576
that which i had done by the impulse of my best feelings produced the same effect as though it had been the result of calculation   88.15972599530367
20281m my dear monsieur bertuccio said monte cristo laughing control yourself   49.37056409515433
cried he in an accent of greater astonishment than before your second witness is monsieur aramis   179.85215535730498
he and she   63.2684506232226
said he but help me to die if you can   195.38417040393358
in some parts of france yes excellency   125.24100537603276
when he had heard and comprehended all to the fullest extent he replied that he was a royalist   102.46398871188008
he had an only daughter who married m   112.41222509690083
peppino pretended not to hear him and without even turning his head continued to eat slowly   129.404830813811
the same noise of a door opening and shutting was repeated the instant afterward   71.18996751826076
bazin bowed low sighed and left the room   63.15086801244697
to what end   123.45847255424621
but so far from that sire i know the duke to be a royal gentleman and i refer the matter to him but upon one condition sire   96.6937915456178
gaetano who had proposed the expedition had taken all the responsibility on himself   180.2211274707002
so much the better muttered athos   169.64573787030002
true replied danglars   94.24420478947533
bertuccio according to the command which had been given him had two hours before left for auteuil when a cab stopped at the door and after depositing its occupant at the gate immediately hurried away as if ashamed of its employment   97.26370526205994
my dear albert said franz leave all to our host   190.4502635979379
we will see about that presently said d artagnan with a slight smile   157.9571703387638
you are disputing which shall fight me first but you do not consult me who am most concerned in the matter   100.9929762153943
aramis went so close to chatillon as almost to touch him   102.23677682481298
so my lord deign to receive my most respectful homage   219.61015017373552
i should tell you that we lived in the little village of rogliano at the extremity of cap corse   87.85506702042552
but i have none   137.51698402838565
they had formed a circle round the invalid   173.96598017386384
de monte cristo is whence he comes where he goes and why he speaks in our presence of children that have been disinterred in a garden   177.57504088725727
at these words the public attention became more intense and all eyes were turned towards the door through which benedetto was to enter   68.03433905541006
it is an infernal apparition   172.53741174258397
about this time a band of brigands that had established itself in the lepini mountains began to be much spoken of   46.28665868975472
and so you see lest he might do you an injury well   154.8886883030413
d artagnan opened the door and called out to a waiter to desire madeleine to come upstairs   160.16455868246487
at five o clock the next morning she again proceeded and in three hours after entered béthune   145.3126644242766
but i have a partner and you know the italian proverb chi ha compagno ha padrone he who has a partner has a master   181.27804974194026
monseigneur said d artagnan quite confused i went hunting at windsor or elsewhere that concerns nobody   103.9331051484711
but seeing his friends he went up to them quickly and expressed delight at seeing them   97.4636467918398
the people who wrote are anglo germans you know   48.295882990246014
i beg your pardon madame but you were about to relate some story were you not   144.1765411806822
at that moment the countenance of mme   39.643082403832736
there lies in him a sanguinary predisposition   119.60119807214933
i wish it with all my heart said comminges   36.32966922672905
30069m well replied monte cristo suppose then that this poison was brucine and you were to take a milligramme the first day two milligrammes the second day and so on   109.77363150265504
do you wish to know why he bought it   120.17476875028733
not like monsieur de richelieu who went on just as he pleased   93.8470228607461
go on monsieur   113.3270920772124
it was himself who was apparently beloved   141.1112501111866
but a serious minded man deserving all my confidence and charged by me to watch over the south the duke hesitated as he pronounced these words has arrived by post to tell me that a great peril threatens the king and so i hastened to you sire   98.99231576838953
now to the point   55.06729472567621
how do you know the motives that person may have for trying to extract all he can from you   120.90463917490248
on reaching the door he bowed   134.17721449281262
at auteuil   68.89288915621128
captivity the fourth day the next day when felton entered milady s apartment he found her standing mounted upon a chair holding in her hands a cord made by means of torn cambric handkerchiefs twisted into a kind of rope one with another and tied at the ends   123.607578361053
but fortunately we have no oliver cromwell in france replied the queen   49.792591300169114
ah try it   131.77722196336535
he esteems me highly   146.88463535669823
his gravity made him look older than he was   122.81604368067512
he the man who would be popular can not forgive the count of morcerf for being created a peer   124.46591094996104
monte cristo only answered by extending his hand to the young man   147.76312841769118
let us give the money to the lackeys not to our lackeys but to the lackeys of the englishmen   69.85086004949541
i will tell him that   89.6874488937822
this advice appeared good to the future chancellor   143.38576888357744
my senses fail me amid such a chaos of iniquities   152.7602489799416
the walls hung with brocaded silk of the most magnificent designs and texture   108.80047377764573
and if i have any counsel to give it is always lose   36.57753623311207
but for god s sake do not forget as you yourself said athos that we only write to him concerning a family affair   121.63059338035097
take in two reefs in the top sails cried the captain   157.70778066135588
with dilated eyes growling as he paced along by the bars of a window looking upon the yard of servant s offices   71.47268708334852
said monte cristo you do not appear to be in the possession of your senses   161.63860186535533
kitchens   37.708424755996816
he remained there all night not knowing where he was   112.45782886287596
he left the box and dice where they fell threw the purse to the wounded man and eagerly opened the pocketbook   64.59265084726601
a hundred crowns yes sir   40.4168936104856
we were obliged to keep silent upon the dreadful catastrophe   73.97224580212452
oh he never was a friend of mine i did not know him and i had nothing to ask of him   150.30268962101763
as the steward had said the notary awaited him in the small salon   78.38433886094103
that you are blindfolded and do not take off the bandage until he himself bids you   176.91689776431502
it would have been more simple   96.39894814164481
by the way said m   152.86546320179207
halloo planchet   144.9402641047257
but if such persons are among my acquaintances i prefer not to know it because then i should be forced to hate them   86.9869578285153
can it be bad news   116.93887777254855
but supposing our enemy should not allow us to do so   124.60638760409532
they passed in silence through the little village of festubert where the wounded servant was and then skirted the wood of richebourg   58.9574510389275
how have i deviated from those principles monsieur   54.54725327485726
said d artagnan coming back to recommend courage to his lackey   85.38698159411086
it was directed to monsieur oliver cromwell general of the army of the english nation   143.25071894812336
that nobleman was you   115.75538841856114
you are going to make a patriarch of him   203.23675586758065
with the first light dantès resumed his search   159.012845108007
but pshaw   81.7327755742721
the cardinal saw that it was now high time to come to the assistance of anne   73.62572063477043
at length villefort the most composed of all spoke sir said he to maximilian you say you loved valentine that you were betrothed to her   138.05724286809422
the prisoner reproached himself with not having thus employed the hours he had passed in vain hopes prayer and despondency   2.698043998630311
he was an eccentric being and did not believe in the existence of gratitude   131.00181594153347
the despatch simply stated the fact of the landing and the route taken by the usurper   99.73181552171306
the soldiers then saw him stretch his limbs little by little and under the pretense of much heat throw off the scotch plaid which covered him   126.65998874125417
albert was on the point of pronouncing his father s name when monte cristo gently held up his finger in token of reproach   4.686204599049148
and think you that we should find him at this hour at his post   94.54121665947712
the queen had confidence in the courage of d artagnan which she knew and the cardinal in the strength of porthos which he had experienced   118.95798933984537
if while he was being carried out the grave diggers should discover that they were bearing a live instead of a dead body dantès did not intend to give them time to recognize him but with a sudden cut of the knife he meant to open the sack from top to bottom and profiting by their alarm escape   54.91042715031038
but you receive him at your house   156.6603106910548
his wife on the contrary whose maiden name had been madeleine radelle was pale meagre and sickly looking   62.11217026586367
beauchamp told the truth when he said that on his way to the funeral he had met monte cristo who was directing his steps towards the rue de la chaussée d antin to m   22.55056986453731
if you stay out late be always followed by your lackey and let your lackey be armed if by the by you can be sure of your lackey   60.3591040312127
debray was admitted to the house for this grand ceremony but on the same plane with everyone else and without any particular privilege   51.74600003825091
i once possessed piety innocence and love the three ingredients of the happiness of angels and now what am i   105.38447515729493
in a quarter of an hour he returned accompanied by a tall man masked and wrapped in a large red cloak   57.29241088585241
and the destruction of your future prospects replied noirtier   89.07241671204036
there still remains that of bernajoux but you must not be too confident   78.26657568594021
i am lost murmured she   95.64254509520717
i regret i did not inform you sooner of this circumstance   91.39601822111166
well but put on this dressing gown first said the musketeer to his friend   44.67497531906571
at the same time he felt a sharp pain in his knee   91.26746373033686
after a pause which appeared an age to rochefort mazarin took from a bundle of papers a letter and showing it to the count he said i find here a letter in which you sue for liberty monsieur de rochefort   159.11340668613857
his mother the councillor s old servant opened it   151.87433798752323
my military weapons   1.1298915073746088
the idiot   107.05445182227264
be happy and tomorrow we shall have more   116.2659675374976
we have that sir replied bernouin   140.64783523250006
you are mistaken i am not the count of monte cristo   85.13911433127628
brought up in paris where raoul had been but once   81.53046814096028
you see he has a truly royal escort   102.336026683859
and during its progress the count of morcerf according to his promise made his appearance in the box of madame danglars   100.17199153485613
cardinal   128.9501780208648
30093m i am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth 32 000 francs wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at 5 000 francs each   132.76490587023864

when we are alarmed we see double   76.48538488265922
he squeezed jacopo s hand warmly but nothing could shake his determination to remain and remain alone   129.6542626202102
i have reflected and i can not must not be guilty of such a sin   133.01490641867778
i shall die of hunger as old dantès did while fernand and danglars are rolling in wealth   214.32055681698205
an attendant arose at a sign from a confidential clerk at the first desk   118.8349609924476
there were sicily pine apples pomegranates from malaga oranges from the balearic isles peaches from france and dates from tunis   163.44105204384965
it is feared that it may be the smallpox sir replied porthos desirous of taking his turn in the conversation   92.30317124772567
pray go valentine said   58.73506643754861
d artagnan bowed and thought both at the same hour   80.6017573674278
just remember what they said   88.90621954907515
was he awake or was it but a dream   147.03992117872176
the boat they were in could not make a long voyage   56.28598911435514
two men jealous of him sir   118.56933013227777
are you quite sure of that   99.769400231572
no for two hundred thousand francs   53.6960442046654
but resumed la ramee that is only a way of corresponding   60.118910707422884
satisfy my impatience   101.39500621225237
what say you to that crime of which i have the proof   145.96364259342374
well monsieur said he you appear to be more stupid than i am for you forget there is a little quarrel to arrange between us two   31.15713097556396
she never goes to bed before midnight   117.2973972430751
so much the better said porthos   197.19370256088584
and why on earth does she want to speak to me at all   222.27265243731506
what can be more wretched than the man who has lost all he loved and desired in the world   67.50387570612133
had morrel been a more quick sighted man or better versed in these matters he would have been surprised at the king s procureur answering him on such a subject instead of referring him to the governors of the prison or the prefect of the department   191.43471419301414
precisely so cried monte cristo precisely so   111.99726900055863
de villefort is here   45.62766121161846
poor d artagnan said athos with the charming melancholy that was one of the traits of his character so brave so good so terrible to the enemies of those he loves   84.51770098379264
as to d artagnan he sprang toward jussac himself   102.0255900272008
suddenly she heard a step she knew turned anxiously around the door opened and fernand dressed in the uniform of a sub lieutenant stood before her   163.54056882861124
the cardinal s enemy   106.20287222603568
oh if you know him tell me   87.59281550162994
my dear count replied albert i was announcing your visit to some of my friends whom i had invited in consequence of the promise you did me the honor to make and whom i now present to you   205.8273262646824
while we wait time will be progressing events will succeed each other   197.73249620058635
before or after whichever you please   114.59191255571437
a second discharge followed the first and three balls by passing through it made the napkin really a flag   132.62007169546428
ask them to sing one more song   142.62746707859702
but at that period we were not at war   67.34907699708069
willingly said maximilian   159.86725818606578
added caderousse with his hoarse laugh   154.18499874114374
he s the second to day   56.12095776097807
de tréville s where he had dined   34.43263706289521
meanwhile do you know where the duchesse de chevreuse and the duke of buckingham are now concealed   89.40940450718601
then you were aware of dantès being engaged in a conspiracy   78.78677032696685
i no longer belonged to myself for i had my sister in law to protect and provide for   59.93531798719002
but as the hour of audience granted by his majesty was past instead of claiming the entrée by the back stairs he placed himself with the four young men in the antechamber   124.09959257813664
the repast had been ordered by athos and the lackey furnished by porthos   120.89362767746238
no no never   61.6102669200563
a long pause ensued which lasted until all the flowers were removed   116.81737258223346
next day next day sir you must have seen plain enough what they had been doing yet you said nothing though you were present when dantès was arrested   147.12210329734276
he then seemed more easy   131.02020236522947
my dear mother said he do you know if m   155.3099429733361
come now recall the four cardinals that at the head of armies have equalled monsieur de guebriant and monsieur de gassion   142.11835362787832
his dress half artist half dandy did not excite any suspicion and consequently no disquietude   185.58855765942263
it was an oriental feast that he offered to them but of such a kind as the arabian fairies might be supposed to prepare   174.2165943872385
i am to wait   94.98389175848155
then count if you will not wait we must look upon these projects as if they had never been entertained   97.89247936925513
then he went to call on monte cristo and heard still more   40.2908507686584
the hand of the lord is stretched over him said felton   92.20070169123554
de motteville will not be astonished at this reply   38.474592166314196
then i understand it all   130.71254561676358
it must be nearly four o clock   98.9594295160573
perhaps you are right said morcerf   134.51801949629098
because monsieur replied kitty my mistress loves you not at all   53.01111918661381
and you found it   59.97127164698117
exclaimed the gascon   126.56303629345334
the unknown chapter 26   119.78470355907046
has morrel whom we know been killed   180.6843953045916
madame danglars moved rapidly as though she would spring from her chair but villefort stopped and clasped his hands as if to implore her attention   28.93384180573699
and as it was known that bands of the enemy were prowling about the country no one dared to accompany the good man so i offered to do so   51.41123432451911
how absurd as if one crown were not as good as another   155.23233934020132
you are laughing at me   3.2412281946590724
it was at the corner of two streets and had in the rear bordering on the side street stables and a sort of garden   70.52585347016395
oh do not fear   108.30666710468627
does his mother then keep poisons in her laboratory   138.04246671720716
but blaisois ventured to say i have heard you relate monsieur mousqueton that once on a time at chantilly you fed your master and yourself by taking partridges in a snare carp with a line and bottles with a slipnoose   158.68496131880033
he took the child in his arms embraced him shook him called him but the child made no response   126.15042104520415
he was alone   128.4455214227896
yes madame in your oratory   154.08604350224869
it cost me more but i have nothing to fear   146.09461701616846
this is no act of selfishness but of delicacy   82.37936614950533
but my dear friend i have one thing to confess to you   143.1279728536254
patrick remain here or rather join the king wherever he may be and tell his majesty that i humbly beg him to excuse me but an affair of the greatest importance recalls me to london   102.49308760527191
then that which spurred her on additionally in the midst of all this was the remembrance of the cardinal   107.64155377189189
cried the astonished woman   52.020754867391815
well asked he of the count what has then happened   140.8888664646264
he mounted the skirting stone that his eyes might look over the curtain   101.46851174364961
yes with frenchmen and frenchmen like you   137.63839395365784
7 the knife which is shaped like a crescent that cuts with the convex side falls from a less height and that is all the difference   113.77603782269806
prince cavalcanti appears to be a young man of rare qualities   19.968337287587502
her voice of immense power and sublime expression gave to the rude unpolished poetry of these psalms a magic and an effect which the most exalted puritans rarely found in the songs of their brethren and which they were forced to ornament with all the resources of their imagination   152.8977815678586
ah monsieur he was no longer a man he was a devil   147.68219552367412
come have you committed some crime pursued by human justice from which i can protect you   59.75420694506474
cried aramis throwing his skullcap in his face   82.656254244585
the next moment the door opened and mordaunt appeared on the threshold face to face with d artagnan   80.58594610069272
for part of the day he went into the courtyard seated himself on a stone with his head bare and exposed to the blazing sun   111.74718937312615
de villefort for three months he took not a step out of doors without my following him   94.43642178877037
it is not he who plays   84.48541113813414
and villefort with his papers under his arm and hat in hand directed his steps toward the apartment of his wife   137.53643709120226
the young man bit his lips and whispered to his sergeant you will follow these men and not lose sight of them   141.1746093709714
between the past and the present was an ineffable abyss   157.34501512310018
the woman screamed and cried for help   140.58863779479088
no but perhaps you will permit me to call to mind stay   149.25228610141787
bah said athos we were always dry   13.050964129885529
repeated the sailors   79.19386072689042
it was said that madame de longueville for whom the prince had more than a brother s affection and in whom he had confided had been indiscreet   155.72406956069176

it is difficult to form an idea of the perfect change that had taken place   137.3692961660984
no one who knew the count could mistake his expression when on entering he said ali bring me my pistols with the ivory cross   148.77770441374187
but they are calling me   79.3222353805418
and who was that   90.98647546805134
richelieu as everyone knows had loved the queen   143.98377208807878
you have two unruly prisoners there sir   137.73808081472276
that is all i promise you   98.83935014652397
it is buried in the cellars of newcastle keep   97.13366790165506
what on earth can you have been saying to that bulldog   89.3469612915232
gentlemen he said you will admit that when arrived at a certain degree of fortune the superfluities of life are all that can be desired   107.92408662034318
yes looked the old man   58.69764320109325
villefort remained silent for a moment and dented his pale cheeks with his nails   157.8048325256666
be satisfied beautiful constance   103.02956732466052
then arousing from his reverie now sir i have one request to make to you which you will understand even if it should be disagreeable to you   93.92702185715501
it would be exceedingly droll   109.59899953964204
then in a last convulsion which this time he had not the power to combat he slipped from the sofa to the floor   197.95448600695102
i will tell it cried milady with a feigned exultation on the day when i shall have suffered sufficiently for my faith   144.89445843530515
it was necessary to compel him to open it as the sergeant had been compelled to speak and this took another ten minutes   52.134031633617575
don t be a coward or i shall cut off your ears   136.9951181075144
the enemy   159.78240117611224
their number was formidable now that he had begun to fear and yet these names powerful though they were had often caused him to smile with the same kind of satisfaction experienced by a traveller who from the summit of a mountain beholds at his feet the craggy eminences the almost impassable paths and the fearful chasms through which he has so perilously climbed   189.37290396484025
athos walked about in a contemplative mood   165.6535177156508
at the first beat porthos rushed out and stood on the other side of the door   120.79442716676529
we say the gravel he trod under his feet for d artagnan made these reflections while walking solitarily along a pretty little road which led from the camp to the village of angoutin   56.64365973764558
drunk if you like   115.66409401306065
cavalcanti will certainly fight   89.78819125477995
but the eyes of his three companions were fixed upon him their ears were wide open and there were no means of retreat   66.12551289519668
you are naked   155.12665541009014
tell us news of yourself as often as you can   139.91090092171433
oh this is too much cried hermine choking you are worse than despicable   210.37948077643188
yes your excellency said the captain we have reached it   139.64137174659461
said the cardinal and for what purpose   136.01864647374404
yes count and a splendid duel too   117.49184236495107
meanwhile the young man had darted in to his chamber and opened the letter   73.75753209373099
by the scorn i will throw upon her   95.32488550364293
i hope madame that the cardinal will not enter into negotiations with such men   110.45154863311484
the greatest captains of antiquity amused themselves by casting pebbles into the ocean see plutarch s life of scipio africanus   117.38951946975591
i will give you the baton of the marechal de la meilleraie who does not seem to be much in favor just now   111.44060411920687
no was there one   66.32928578687195
athos drew d artagnan aside   11.982544416490583
the austere puritan lies   135.01517560802853
he was masked likewise   139.80008355658396
you are in the wrong to tell me that my lord   158.73150336923229
but in the present instance the confidential nature of the conversation he had overheard made him with propriety judge that his appearance at such a time would be anything but agreeable   148.95788690082713
that s well said he to planchet when the latter added the portmanteau to the equipment   114.41455723427939
he is a particular friend of mine   150.34956767575295
that s true replied jacopo   198.4013432759727
cried barrois who felt another fit coming   116.04694594414707
if i could but do as you do and eat pates and drink burgundy at the house of father marteau s successor   142.21774986850937
i am no longer hungry   35.45914907280198
god wills it that man whom he has created and in whose heart he has so profoundly rooted the love of life should do all in his power to preserve that existence which however painful it may be is yet always so dear   32.99399517353369
pity   175.28348541561792
you must not stop an instant on the way   150.57272949993126
the assassins comprehended that if they fled toward the camp without having killed their man they should be accused by him   68.26299467737034
tomorrow then   91.18662338397971
and as the king began to lose what he had won he was not sorry to find an excuse for playing charlemagne if we may use a gaming phrase of whose origin we confess our ignorance   146.55310955856197
have pity on me count   130.96469301062666
i have been waiting for someone who has not come   105.14303658723524
king of france who was formidable still in spite of his recent reverses   93.25640781120116
besides here s the end of the cable   102.3356714434912
he occupied that post for twenty years   132.80463628478387
edmond s hair stood on end and he rose to his knees   21.482176750494048
not at all i assure you   95.10087835610523
shall you have the courage   70.6202362208949
he formed therefore the resolution of believing for the present all that was said of their past hoping for more certain and extended revelations in the future   163.66778611295345
you know the affairs of the deceased are in perfect order and her will bequeaths to valentine the entire property of the saint méran family   99.86543250594427
why have you hated him   147.3879459589973
answered caderousse you merely threw it by i saw it lying in a corner   73.6215689998609
and throwing his arm around the young girl s waist he pressed the hand of valentine and disappeared   149.9202953355542
but sit down said monte cristo   133.240748758243
he started   137.28867973429516
anne of austria looked with a sort of terror at the threatening aspect of the cardinal his physiognomy in such moments was not destitute of a certain grandeur   103.48054388622666
well do you comprehend now   63.76687929971328
ah sir the poor fellow told you the truth   82.5560147933595
morrel looked at her with astonishment   190.44232872486918
you do   76.69059815077307
she corrupted this man   10.074952151043775
yes monseigneur replied the faithful cloak bearer of anne of austria but too late perhaps   82.85332828409304
hearing of your refusal to obey her she looked upon it as a declaration of war and as she considers you a man of superior talent and consequently dangerous she desired me to make sure of you   94.45393055668457
he was then as punctual as the samaritan woman and the most rigorous casuist with regard to duels could have nothing to say   98.47047551341468
he was there   97.92918193966605
oh you can not believe what you say   138.3646064394058
d artagnan left athos s chamber and went to that of porthos   203.3910991498343
very well my lord   171.69814611039874
meanwhile the queen every hour had been sending for d artagnan   78.8260064448431
at last they reached the tennis court   108.25652433239613
how i have suffered   98.97149576079235
said she hurriedly you know poor grandmamma died an hour since and now i have no friend in the world but you   120.94347766441336
it shall be the last can you prove the authenticity of what you have now stated   133.72120422119102
can it be can it possibly be the illustrious coxcomb mazarin de piscina hey   55.9073291541037
then he resumed in his turn discipline monseigneur has i hope in no way been forgotten by us   77.23519201126547
then turning to the young man he exclaimed a fine prize   51.949750887551396
rest assured gentlemen that within three days in a less time than justice would demand the revenge i shall have taken for the murder of my child will be such as to make the boldest heart tremble   136.24943163360223
and it was time for you were sinking   221.9837683217239
he had moreover his right of entry into the omnibus box   164.9934465912526
you have given me all you can give me and from to day your debt is paid   229.11697289025406
no replied athos fortunately monsieur d artagnan has only fainted   72.18718018178923
and the two separated saying till this evening   162.4933142833133
the young man took the helm felt to see if the vessel answered the rudder promptly and seeing that without being a first rate sailor she yet was tolerably obedient   104.22670717474574
one of a most dangerous kind i give you notice   103.84805536346619
no you shall live honored and pure   120.71530627392428
they had seen no one   150.7847269254118
that gentleman i say what has become of him   86.37218346942035
yes monseigneur replied the young man   131.78485156338675
morrel and i adore mercédès   73.36613334019755
general said the president do not alarm yourself   127.59118752583328
oh exclaimed morrel why do they not come   179.1661171548871
athos took a pistol from his belt looked to see if it was properly primed cocked it and placed the muzzle close to grimaud s ear   108.05553984047413
indeed sir said milady you must be either drunk or mad   50.375086839331445
i will wait to pay you my next visit till you are in a better humor   122.70263199493462
exclaimed signor pastrini utterly impossible   104.53244172556902
cried aramis turning around   107.83333104374108
nearly at the same instant the door was opened and the count of monte cristo appeared on the threshold   111.3605542386648
i shall know about that soon for i shall soon speak out to athos   114.14013930800039
too ardently perhaps   75.85655849713358
that was most probable   45.85239404015958
we expect him every moment   119.74854615402086
shall i receive it from my father   46.997733791249175
in those times of disturbance he went about with numerous followers and often disguised himself   122.45720983403064
said she simpering   138.55214363220244
at this sigh felton turned round   48.33412488952709
oh yes him   98.39875341195649
then sitting down by the fire my supper said he   95.01811588940502
do what monsieur de la fere requests   180.00857830570163
who am i   95.59430423208899
i will keep it returned morcerf   124.55903969202836
this brought them by the end of the repast to swallowing a drink which from the color of the ruby had passed to that of a pale topaz   91.0149948907495
i recommend the cardinal to your attention   100.99015842254126
but it was plain that all assistance was useless all the features of the dying man were distorted with agony   77.14314479689426
i dare not say more in a letter   49.0483610783014
and you complain of that   179.97470282049844
louise pressed with all the strength of her little hands on the top of the portmanteau   158.5929797464861
what do you ask of me   143.9805166240365
and when all was arranged he went out quietly with the soldiers   114.34028505185732
the shade of richelieu was mazarin   28.972395819494565
albert that and he may know what to answer you   66.70406522897049
the fortunes of that monarch now are at low water   73.11304338969363
my dear viscount said monte cristo gravely you must have seen before today that at all times and in all places i have been at your disposal but the service which you have just demanded of me is one which it is out of my power to render you   98.19906179630004
still further the man wore the uniform of a musketeer   141.04045088664557
mistrust yourself john said he   122.95304155038573
0201m oh how i should like to see these products of your industry and patience   103.68782947685334
instead of fighting for cromwell we have served charles i   191.50489514614804
de la trémouille s testimony and himself   84.8474714842986
i am all attention said the abbé   98.90126263494007
mine are numerous   107.67496834828125
that there should be a famine   124.03226530968715
there is but one service i can render you and for that i place myself entirely at your orders that is to present or make my friends present you everywhere   221.94313115474193
he would not   106.30405746349288
yes my friend yes said the cardinal with that paternal tone which he sometimes knew how to assume but which deceived none who knew him   97.36627357452517
and the duke swooned   102.45459266277815
you see then d artagnan though princes often are ungrateful god never is   145.0291007582508
the expression was imprudent   105.3903723085849
oppressed mortified and persecuted day by day hour by hour minute by minute no person has cared for even observed my sufferings nor have i ever breathed one word on the subject save to yourself   58.60482496705509
d artagnan bowed with respect   50.025423474944
presently presently cried the latter when you haven t your cloak on   68.63094561686535
yes brigadier   137.45622900904058
only i concealed a glass of water which remained after my breakfast thirst having been the chief of my sufferings when i remained forty eight hours without eating or drinking   15.232382846417892
my dear friend said caderousse eat of my bread and take my advice   128.41655857170474
what was it then   102.65210348589395
and i also am to fight with this gentleman said aramis coming in his turn onto the place   235.9775013381718
certainly sir it is not such lords as you are who are allowed to wait in the ante chamber only just now he has a secret conference with monsieur de bruy   13.32583870384012
villefort cast a gloomy look around him   125.20379754039399
then the postscript well   131.66721999206285
that i may have the pleasure of seeing you my little fellow   125.64153948799557
i do not say replied andrea that you never make a good one   84.1356164448757
ah monsieur porthos cried the procurator s wife when she was assured that no one who was a stranger to the population of the locality could either see or hear her ah monsieur porthos you are a great conqueror as it appears   77.73526583745999
the young man burst into a laugh   85.51479343072384
at the same time as though to disprove the ogreish propensities the man took some black bread cheese and onions from his wallet which he began devouring voraciously   11.406866931533756
and what do they say of it in the world   85.56810563441071
a loan nothing more   155.15484517338024
said louise   7.500719979884025
her head hung back and her long hair swept the ground   98.95070495214685
is not his name monte cristo   119.24640020411114
hush the curtain is rising   168.95484720349495
no sentinels no one at any of the windows   76.83914560363178
the prince smiled   92.74998235716718
let me look for this letter   112.25272129819248
oh pardon me sir   79.6057167802795
the first feeling that pervaded paris on hearing of the flight to saint germain was that sort of affright which seizes children when they awake in the night and find themselves alone   113.23362570042775
edmond had not heard anyone speak save his jailer for four or five years   183.08423116386038
i hoped to find some traces which had escaped me in the darkness   101.62279056757926
caderousse was equally restless and uneasy but instead of seeking like m   178.73487850529628
i will be responsible for the barony   70.40697356172066
because i have been in such shocking spirits all the evening my friend said the baroness   67.32682504317145
the porter at the palace was about to close the gates but seeing such a handsome equipage he fancied that it was some visit of importance and the carriage was allowed to pass and to stop beneath the porch   83.59937973482069
the honorable functionary had scarcely expressed himself thus in that intonation which is peculiar to brigadiers of the gendarmerie when a loud scream accompanied by the violent ringing of a bell resounded through the court of the hotel   113.9927980472188
the man of meung the crowd was caused not by the expectation of a man to be hanged but by the contemplation of a man who was hanged   113.19091139131639
and to marry mademoiselle danglars would be awful   146.6701743512255
but now with a fragment of plaster he wrote the date 30th july 1816 and made a mark every day in order not to lose his reckoning again   94.70274943038837
with whom   28.44579861378763
he shouted again   22.952643450979977
ah mercy mercy   93.600871051335
the finger of god once pointed at him everyone was prepared to raise the hue and cry   170.20876455795334
then said the coadjutor this evening at ten o clock and if i am pleased with you another bag of five hundred pistoles will be at your disposal   51.93337178856428
the prisoner expected that he would be at no expense that day for like an economical man he had concealed half of his fowl and a piece of the bread in the corner of his cell   29.20090575148727
cavalcanti had done half an hour before   85.32633192170033
though his coming was announced in a very low tone madame de saint méran arose from her pillow   135.1713594524469
go to bed mademoiselle said milady   101.69631851265498
neither in the antechamber nor in the corridor nor beneath the great door   18.45187444362017
at least it was not i who ever encouraged you in that hope fernand replied mercédès   138.71425207977708
oh let us speak of it   127.57922404996543
he told himself that it was the enmity of man and not the vengeance of heaven that had thus plunged him into the deepest misery   132.8076555544251
it will be a work of time but those who have begun by crying out down with mazarin   66.96214005326931
you wish to remain alone with m   168.42693788680072
if i die here and you escape alone the whole belongs to you   98.84844216320484
de boville manifested signs of extraordinary admiration   190.5162042683266
but his illness becoming more serious he was forced to stop at villeroy   130.91680533976057
well madame   87.73175968104474
albert entered looking very handsome and in high spirits   152.1890383475641
you shall go to vincennes where monsieur de beaufort is confined   121.70553847358232
he gave a ball every year at which he appeared for a quarter of an hour only that is to say five and forty minutes less than the king is visible at his balls   97.31883736309634
friquet counterfeited surprise and twisting his new cap around in his fingers said it is not astonishing for you to know it monsieur broussel who knows everything   110.97223333554248
a keeper replied grimaud   102.55108852675383
come take them and monte cristo forced the bank notes into his hand   185.87705037929845
au revoir monsieur bonacieux au revoir   215.03263397904277
indeed you could not belong to him   190.68473420691703
i had forgotten it   197.2944544217645
so the two swords were crossed close to the hilts and as d artagnan stood firm it was his adversary who made the retreating step   134.04089906786336
but i am firm   54.80816247393266
but as planchet awoke in an instant and cried who goes there   137.04833675414028
the pickaxe struck for a moment with a dull sound that drew out of dantès forehead large drops of perspiration   187.20566312854015
and writes me thence   65.85096750093237
no said monte cristo which is precisely the reason which renders your kindness more meritorious it is in the country   21.30313923093287
i like that best replied lord de winter laughing   75.57290720980674
have you an exact idea of the amount of your fortune   95.06943518702141
oh ungrateful girl that i am cried valentine sobbing i will give up all even my dear old grandfather whom i had nearly forgotten   94.37625427397853
no truly you comfort me   90.98790537938893
i did go to monsieur d artagnan s   104.87476622092677
d avrigny returned about eight o clock in the morning   121.4238708260421
said aramis how did you manage it   75.42208463014404
noirtier interposed maximilian is celebrated throughout europe   147.46599332546552
and he drew away his friend as affectionate as a father as consoling as a priest noble as a man who has suffered much   195.4336917804009
i would not give up this paper if covered with as many gold pieces   110.23082635640513
but in face of the proof i was obliged to acknowledge the truth of the recital   88.03940754249354
she undertook his seduction and succeeded   120.69652467054865
without him i should probably at this moment be a dead fish in the nets at saint cloud for it was a question of nothing less than throwing me into the river   60.8022337976872
a week before his return lord de winter died leaving me his sole heir   9.69747845613145
12 jacques louis david a famous french painter 1748 1825   169.79383612140475
no doubt of it   153.20332648334946
pray how many men have you on board captain   73.11426248695096
women say those things but never do them   57.69129001312118
the rock yielded rolled over bounded from point to point and finally disappeared in the ocean   201.732768749888
i will have him come in if you really wish it   121.54848880251875
the substitution was made so carefully that my spies if i had any could have no suspicion of it   1.521368468063173
a burst of flame rose toward the skies with an explosion like that of a hundred cannon   166.19128353479766
will it be long first   179.39720666638573
i must know so that i may assist you if there is any chance   94.76435255886793
do you not see your friends or are you too proud to speak to them   156.94074981767022
thus we have exchanged ideas and no one has seen us do it   120.60634880671918
d artagnan told me that he had recommended him to your care in parting   93.61416675441404
signor pastrini remained silent a short time   35.332442057601014
a fiendish smile played over the features of caderousse who was about to break in upon the abbé s speech when the latter waving his hand said allow me to finish first and then if you have any observations to make you can do so afterwards   109.52316211066172
we let them tell their story out replied mousqueton   4.166819301721034
bonacieux inferred from this ah that the affair grew more and more intricate   145.09446534634134
if i can get enough to rebuild artagnan which my ancestors impoverished by the crusades allowed to fall into ruins and to buy thirty acres of land about it that is all i wish   137.18116157166398
but do not be too confident   78.03427891365106
everyone therefore ran to the court   160.95290465482663
valentine durst not oppose her grandmother s wish the cause of which she did not know and an instant afterwards villefort entered   65.27894607339147
and if we appear inclined to defend you they will arrest us with you   127.80709669271248
be at ease felton said lord de winter   7.689928733335634
the only way of doing that was to cause the disappearance of the london executioner   198.78858834055018
you say you desire my mother s good opinion   128.6419549392789
i had at the moment of being ordained a little difficulty with but that would not interest you and i am taking up your valuable time   89.74332221347979
but and i say it with some pride mercédès god needed me and i lived   124.93806797493548
they are the count of château renaud whose nobility goes back to the twelve peers and whose ancestors had a place at the round table   134.23325747566776
ah cried monte cristo remembering the abbé s two hiding places   126.30020787963154
lord who can say monsieur   131.63016252976792
that i alone   13.415826474779863
i believe while the countess g takes you for lord ruthven my mother imagines you to be cagliostro or the count saint germain   100.1576554809669
it might alienate my protector   48.30532962756172
for me i well know my sweet girl said d artagnan   121.6944429009602
be satisfied of that   109.67818634841232
but the stranger declared that he had nothing to say to m   108.39858845678452
what do you say maximilian   190.45462045190638
one does the work while the other stands guard   184.31435580425546
i have doubtless i am dreaming   100.42842624797582
he said you had engaged to pay seventy pounds if i landed you safe and sound at boulogne or any other port you choose in france   144.55145218772816
he promised   0.23397625344590267
she is in the prison of nantes   178.24122746440617
be reasonable   154.02805970477718
now then said the duke and as he spoke lowered the cane almost level with the ground   43.609292016107176
he went with groslow to the captain s berth a sort of temporary cabin of planks for the chief apartment had been given up by captain rogers to the passengers who were to be accommodated at the other end of the boat   150.6004071033604
yes said he yes anne of austria is my true queen   47.1776368338806
and he thus gained the name of the stoic   178.1129506481665
do you dance count   35.81709781239984
and as the romance of don quixote was then the fashion they said that he was sancho who after having lost one master had found two   54.53034527014382
and where are these four men   163.41924531527465
a candle of coarse tallow on a black table lighted up the handsome and resigned face of the king and that of his faithful retainer far less calm   128.40598770790373
we shall start the evening of the signing of the contract instead of the evening of the wedding that is all   161.28593669261332
we will   84.50919006339834
as i went away a purse fell at my feet it contained five and twenty louis   99.9539159565878
in reality observed albert he seemed to me somewhat eccentric   61.077485836427336
you are a delightful cicerone   103.7773038876464
he smiled more and more sarcastically and his smile began to make the gascon anxious   115.32829588280367
do you think anything else was to be expected of them   41.23413482237838
perhaps my heart was weaker than the hearts of most men and i suffered more than they would have done in my place   152.57747678759085
possibly after all   117.9120055688208
the pale face of the monk became so livid and his smile so strange that raoul whose eyes were still fixed upon him felt as if this smile had struck to his heart like an insult   80.72457742331375
my turn said athos himself trembling as the lion trembles at the sight of the serpent my turn   208.23965096416146
you see it is a serious annoyance said morcerf when beauchamp had finished the perusal of the paragraph   157.90532768439311
but he was soon aroused from these reflections by lubin who uttered loud cries and screamed for help with all his might   139.85925596464594
i should have thought the continual failures you have met with in all your own love affairs might have taught you better by this time   29.44348155257906
we must go and find lord winter   89.48104548752207
happily there is nothing of the kind and your majesty has just acquired a new proof of it   34.40814523089348
porthos my friend you know i am descended on the father s side from the prophets and on the mother s from the sybils and that i only speak in parables and riddles   115.26921979711106
cried milady in her turn   96.18070766623009
i think he is violently agitated   62.055447784425304
andrea got into the cab which passed rapidly through the faubourg saint denis along the faubourg saint martin crossed the barrier and threaded its way through the interminable villette   128.05429400228002
if mousqueton were here   7.209898219548137
i fear the cardinal   76.7190804824863
go out by the door turn to the right jump into your saddles all will be right   95.20567395803457
madame said villefort i ask where is m   128.53811125034323
lucullus dines with lucullus that is quite sufficient   102.67191322532851
but pass the pen over to monsieur abbé   47.24042614570561
d artagnan uttered a cry of surprise which was not quite free from joy   77.68565694091768
and danglars rose as if he meant to depart   67.92635917342398
athos as the name of raoul was pronounced looked inquisitively at d artagnan in order to see if any curiosity was painted on his face   139.74082321275955
the notary showed me the documents yesterday which will enable us to draw up the contract immediately   103.0444992199839
gentlemen said athos addressing at the same time his companions and their adversaries are we ready   84.9207403655041
but you are only two   106.28590659859165
they went through the alley mounted a flight of stairs and entered the assembly room   95.25976365566615
although about forty four or forty five years old she might have passed for thirty five   107.20574945293119
very well my dear sir you are the prisoner of a fellow countryman   104.38198305509171
exclaimed the executioner did you see the monk   134.63935623788439
no less said athos as pale as a corpse   113.95822446556694
if i had been wearing a handkerchief like yours on my head rags on my back and worn out shoes on my feet you would not have known me   146.13238635003933
there is no one but myself can so execute them that one can not tell the new from the old   166.51587089078546
five minutes afterwards the piano resounded to the touch of mademoiselle d armilly s fingers and mademoiselle danglars was singing brabantio s malediction on desdemona   167.94258631293928
yes replied he while he did the honors of the supper with much ease and grace yes he is a poor devil who is much devoted to me and does all he can to prove it   170.86761672953347
d épinay unlike you bears his misfortune patiently   130.72089130883774
at the worst he would have a companion and captivity that is shared is but half captivity   267.10401152138166
allow me then to enjoy it at my ease and taking her hand she drew her toward the armchair by the bedside   71.38608184997591
i am of monsieur de bassompierre s party   165.17500613582934
you shall see said eugénie   84.03638991239362
are people to be run against without warning   98.45326395623928
you never come to me without conferring pleasure   133.08577797002712
were you not already rich enough you who possess nearly a million   33.660589695797086
he is a churchman   116.79578384739112
the conditions required that at every hit the man touched should quit the game yielding his turn for the benefit of the adversary who had hit him   138.0586517434056
then the duke put to pistache this difficult question who was the greatest thief in the world   125.49597764442498
he appeared just at that moment of stupor which follows great catastrophes   41.55079388903205
what is the matter with you my friend   28.737334769843983
the bandits looked on with astonishment at this singular conduct until they heard footsteps   118.57555174088907
you were not certain my child was dead and you buried it   72.48648043074043
and this carte blanche said d artagnan this carte blanche does it remain in her hands   153.86920436223232
i have placed reliance upon you my friend   156.21785212273082
50223m ah yes   140.66384401270582
at last he sank   73.08813932179508
you met him at a dinner party at my house and you introduced yourself at his house   161.33265450704752
yes but you have not this little staircase said monte cristo opening a door concealed by the drapery   127.40275328617243
glad   133.4079804123888
this sir is all i can tell you and you see how uninteresting it is   101.34206974236267
that by an infamous treaty you have sold me for two hundred thousand pounds to parliament   78.4214566157872
it was quite evident by her manner that her uneasiness was not feigned   143.76514091852394
ah yes he said as if awaking from a dream   197.16387882174786
well renew these bills up to the 5th of september   78.14159592640442
and should any misfortune occur to you dear edmond she continued with the same calmness which proved to fernand that the young girl had read the very innermost depths of his sinister thought if misfortune should occur to you i would ascend the highest point of the cape de morgiou and cast myself headlong from it   146.22893534971303
mazarin still sombre and pensive permitted himself to be dragged along in this way   191.25902336777068
grimaud had every quality that could attract a man on duty who wishes to have a deputy   148.1672312164807
and you did not awaken me   153.50384741392963
chapter 24   51.59092793807291
add to that d artagnan s rapidity in action and that he is not the man to lose an hour knowing that we were expecting him   89.06221204293593
will you return to the salon   69.43459691168303
edmond shuddered when he heard the painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along   56.211129278845064
now what are we to do with you   157.4658168391117
come now he said   182.7060369478353
in short said d artagnan this has been the will of god   75.55252623067533
tell him also what you have just told me that mazarin has placed me in the pavilion of the orangery in order to make me a visit and assure him that i shall take advantage of this honor he proposes to accord to me to obtain from him some amelioration of our captivity   93.31412449536163
look well at his right hand on which he has a large wound   119.19657567047607
i shall not find amongst them such great hearts as yours   113.5327249465054
they are not like that unbelieving porthos who must see and touch before he will believe   111.23096489785041
and you replied to him with that notion   85.50173073583754
at that moment a hand touched his shoulder   48.186599763526786
he made morrel wait in the antechamber although he had no one with him for the simple reason that the king s procureur always makes everyone wait and after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers he ordered m   49.27262546437472
scattering money round about him as heaven sprinkles rain   73.91027557719971
that voice that voice   141.77777683573947
unhappily those times are past   187.23464017786438
and then made you swear never to utter the name of noirtier   123.19650340625888
they belong to the regiment that was at lens which the prince assigned to the cardinal   134.10774969481486
30275m i sleep soundly like a child   67.96606833018888
such was the state of affairs at the very moment we introduced our readers to the study of cardinal mazarin once that of cardinal richelieu   95.04134058710534
any other than yourself would have considered the disclosure of m   182.0427625614559
there disguised under other names and concealed under other costumes are police agents magistrates attorneys general and bailiffs   82.89745744331655
that the place royale is the termination to the main road to vendomois and nothing else   85.62137140094774
now speaking without any exaggeration is your mother really so very much averse to this marriage   139.5251172190052
draw up this note for us aramis   106.02349027820144
now he is turning   17.746696064347432
if he becomes certain that this war will cost the honor and perhaps the liberty of the lady of his thoughts as he says i will answer for it he will look twice   9.782574105925434
and be wise if you wish to preserve your heads   133.86067450351544
my father himself does not know who this president was and if he knows he can not tell you   115.84550056029438
his lips were straight and so thin that as they closed they were drawn in over the teeth   125.14310919144924
what number was it that rang   186.78925912833614
and when she finally returned did she bring that casket with her   159.83759739692303
milady perceived a bed   142.9474298890952
the executioner took her up in his arms and was carrying her toward the boat   70.1175939713919
as for me i have almost forgotten the little latin i have ever known   114.43799944262263
yes that may be   207.88473668400167
monsieur is not that the barrel of a musket which glitters yonder   141.94401969143757
and fixed on two men who were loosening the last hooks of the iron balcony   131.1250121553159
at least a year   154.20854101660103
his regiment which bore the name of the regiment of corinth from the name of his archbishopric darted after him and began the fight   136.3943403398089
but i am used to him and besides he wouldn t be willing to let me go without him he loves me so much   89.82769900722298
willingly answered the duke give me the pie   155.24855436289482
they took the shortest route and should have arrived before we did   142.0059546355402
it is the face of the count of monte cristo   60.89167024314431
nevertheless at that voice that accent and those gestures they felt a chill access of terror cramp their veins   93.94178820300493
they have left me my purse and pocket book   111.09003078324832
i know no one in paris morrel on whom i could confer that honor besides you and your brother emmanuel   62.87563188607948
the shadow of a cloud passed over aramis s face as quickly as that which in august passes over the field of grain   159.482080760948
he owed me for the councillor the pettifogger   112.97760814453058
it may be remembered that it was the hat and cloak belonging to monsieur de gondy s coachman   28.16630000577699
replied villefort   64.3379907592371
a large round rock placed solidly on its base was the only spot to which they seemed to lead   65.926044985544
but at each effort he fell back moaning and turning pale   87.70757222714475
i was worn out with fatigue   122.0443303421662
it is too late they are coming said eugénie   60.79780220378717
one more practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath a veil or at least have cast down her thickly fringed lashes so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes   55.38691116734982
you may become equal to monsieur de voiture and monsieur de benserade   173.0995277237083
i shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public and a sweet kiss in private   71.55079052601668
here it was the tradesmen who were running from shop to shop   151.1682350328997
when d artagnan arrived in sight of the bare spot of ground which extended along the foot of the monastery athos had been waiting about five minutes and twelve o clock was striking   67.84011588925424
ck from the small   118.51723107957069
you have recalled one of the most agreeable recollections of my youth   50.69644362322277
this was simply because he lived in the hôtel   87.78691054106173
what even for me   29.039546546693174
this hurt is just the fellow of the one i had on the road to amiens   84.57279052120643
i re enter it   161.47402599620347
alas alas murmured he if the procureur himself had been at marseilles i should have been ruined   144.7432866157827
haul taut   124.14600394760264
and d artagnan set the example   53.68542624536149
cried the friends tis then useless our seeing monsieur the coadjutor this evening said aramis so we give it up   98.87432327150988
in the country   77.04582939701643
he sought to tread water in order to rest himself   113.10890754774259
what a singular being you are   61.33408520759752
today is the 29th of august   127.84384234935831
exclaimed the young man hastily   133.82542638077777
in a fortnight the fellow will be marshal of france   117.93406713595337
and franz abandoned himself to that mute reverie into which we always sink when smoking excellent tobacco which seems to remove with its fume all the troubles of the mind and to give the smoker in exchange all the visions of the soul   93.84239903184124
planchet obtained from rochefort the rank of sergeant in the piedmont regiment   88.550934436641
if he lays his hand on the boat s edge i will cut it off regicide that he is   55.544921340906484
he then went straight to the door and knocked murmuring i will go myself and be caught in the mousetrap but woe be to the cats that shall pounce upon such a mouse   165.48939224323627
but as such cries on account of their frequency brought nobody in the rue des fossoyeurs and as lately the mercer s house had a bad name finding that nobody came he went out continuing to call his voice being heard fainter and fainter as he went in the direction of the rue du bac   145.9148346386219
de tréville being paid the pensive d artagnan took the longest way homeward   105.4420349861364
said the countess without replying to the question   110.15708722211878
morrel took her in his arms as if to defend her from some unknown danger   118.86229810681716
but you ll die of hunger said the patron   139.94139990296108
picture to yourself a pretty coach house at the right hand side where the ladders are kept   105.78880012233854
i will not make you a slave to your filial piety   148.67302437835625
poor athos   83.15963753201004
he hastened to cleave his way through them to see if he had not lost his strength   63.377212150921125
i asked you if you knew him   92.12134584168426
probabilities will not suffice only facts will justify a deadly combat with a friend   86.59880944814664
it is too late   126.41676639120818
major cavalcanti a worthy patrician of lucca a descendant of the cavalcanti of florence continued monte cristo reading aloud possessing an income of half a million   130.6059474929782
never mind replied villefort   99.49019912241562
uneasiness took possession of the tender constant heart of athos and fearful forecasts were the torment of the impulsive aramis   113.90076147466652
he will come and visit the comte de la fere   36.62180023408183
i tell you that with that wretched sum continued andrea i could obtain a coat and a room in which to receive the illustrious visitor i am daily expecting   207.8913324172296
besides the most corrupt minds only suspect evil when it would answer some interested end useless injury is repugnant to every mind   116.59720064146991
he commanded a retreat which began step by step foot by foot   82.96230792117518
it will be well employed i hope   107.31464249363553
barcelona has risen in his favor   101.78817227692775
athos then went to pay a visit to one of his friends absent at the time continued tréville to a young béarnais a cadet in his majesty s guards the company of monsieur dessessart but scarcely had he arrived at his friend s and taken up a book while waiting his return when a mixed crowd of bailiffs and soldiers came and laid siege to the house broke open several doors the cardinal made the king a sign which signified that was on account of the affair about which i spoke to you   169.91961098415302
let us take some heed of the welfare of her dear buckingham   110.27034556299911
demanded d artagnan in his turn   117.07462284448583
albert stretched out his arms rubbed his eyelids and opened his eyes   134.04182898062726
what do i think captain   144.71212058665577
the meeting after mercédès had left monte cristo he fell into profound gloom   62.76188954980511
where can you find them then   168.73865476892877
it signifies little said mazarin when he was alone   79.31466176383097
the only thing that astonishes me is that he did not strike me dead at once   133.12275097405723
i thought i saw said one of the servants horsemen dressed in yellow creeping along the bed of the stream   127.93915699958873
so much the better said d artagnan   34.95359420767795
monte cristo had already seen the breakfast room and the salon on the ground floor   125.29252072237358
ah i recollect you asked for a place at my window   119.0312898001433
then they knelt on each side of the grave and said the prayers of the dead   97.22221602656646
the major seated himself therefore by the side of danglars who was more and more charmed with the ideas of order and economy which ruled this man and yet who being able to allow his son 60 000 francs a year might be supposed to possess a fortune of 500 000 or 600 000 livres   114.11496546147251
we were then convinced my friend and i that there was some error of which we were the victims and that an explanation was called for between his eminence and ourselves   78.12502101713514
he saw two shadows approach his bed a third remaining at the door with a torch in its hand   141.42112375756278
was struck with this insistence and began to fancy that this recommendation concealed some mystery   162.53831979269393
he examined him and found him sound and without blemish   72.41963390036916
oh do not do that excellency   98.28797475482067
morrel said he again turning his quid as for that as for what   195.27379061958928
and the next moment luigi vampa appeared before danglars   132.95519874103212
i therefore may hesitate between you   130.8627385970913
yes she is come back and is going to commit some fresh folly or another   111.08159520782992
i know no better means than to act with candor   109.46751560776109
knew all and that the cardinal had persuaded him to employ this long dissimulation of seven or eight days which likewise was characteristic   76.67900082055132
and they called château renaud s attention to him   132.2203506261362
d artagnan freely applying his spurs was in advance of porthos two feet at the most   108.40536905379919
but a glance from the worthy broussel who in the midst of it all did not lose his presence of mind checked this foolhardy action of despair   140.5822916873894
you are not making any mistake are you   126.57182989693052
yes i have seen aramis   122.66492507314328
the slightest rustling of the foliage the least whistling of the wind attracted his attention and drew the perspiration to his brow   178.76377981572347
the knife fell to the ground   150.4026225892869
here s a good opportunity for getting something better than a diamond   101.0692963394821
oh i remember   92.0579167716575
they unsheathe and that s all that is said   208.35657762451535
i might as well say count benedetto   72.6428166902828
he murmured as he stepped into the oblong and grated vehicle which they call the salad basket   154.39728923882237
will not escape him   6.439038254260822
and a large sum   133.7200891204406
asked the king eagerly   117.23630347293243
then i may tell you all   87.87890300061324
dantès himself only knew that which personally concerned him for he never beheld again the five persons i have named to you or heard mention of anyone of them   82.1742373402297
i am the only man in the world having the right to say to you morrel your father s son shall not die today   99.28798055860256
my dear d artagnan said he if you please we will join our friends   204.99088923318124
and he rapped his pocket book in which he had just placed a letter   105.52842106241032
then athos looking into his friend s face and taking him by both hands said what ails you my lord   109.39453559139011
i know monsieur le curé said the beggar that you have always been very kind to me and therefore i in my turn will be serviceable to you   118.09186376490949
but said andrea why do you not act on the advice you gave me   97.45623299549655
name it sir i beg   151.83868644437104
and even when one is killed one rises again the proof of which is that here we are   63.153277251966536
still the presence of monte cristo at such an hour his mysterious fanciful and extraordinary entrance into her room through the wall might well seem impossibilities to her shattered reason   25.630734607208325
you have spared me yet of all those who have fallen under your vengeance i was the most guilty   81.7888663849076
you have your servant s clothes on you therefore keep a servant   132.7554702345576
i prefer listening to you here my dear m   108.85686600077169
but how shall i address the minister   101.35729607396095
no nothing at all   157.833564209333
three of them were overwhelmed and disabled by numerous assailants   162.21770873114656
not such as i have seen it but such as my dreams have painted it   132.86444884890656
in the midst of all this frightful tumult and these terrific cries two reports fearfully distinct followed by two shrieks more heartrending than all froze me with terror   138.62342274507768
he rang so violently that the porter was alarmed   90.90272396453575
it is well madame said mazarin   91.08286438339965
the accuracy of the aim had first given him the idea that a special weapon had been employed   52.953546255410906
do you see that ray of sunlight   89.7409712661898
d artagnan fought three times with rochefort and wounded him three times   47.20050119989172
certainly said danglars and this is further supported by the fact of their not possessing an inch of land   140.79036911263958
it is men whom i should hold responsible and i will hold them responsible   149.96315302936273
well said he friend what matters the regiment of guards to us and art thou not mad to make such a disturbance   93.68976157744633
the young man knelt down   134.29201460962298
said athos exchanging a smile with d artagnan and aramis it is very clear you acted nobly with regard to the poor lad   122.1542412786405
no my dear fellow   91.25869305287279
these words rang in dantès ears even beneath the waves   139.84185451759225
de villefort s is that there is an assassin in the house   141.4507141360093
that is true said the king   115.63344331755029
then turning to d artagnan she said sir you have given me this evening the best advice i have ever received   221.8269344395826
and the fact is i have gained 16 000 francs by the sale of them   89.15584707987733
marechal de grammont   75.06498824330527
the vessel was very old to risk that said the englishman   90.39561597533985
at least i hope not   132.27604440095956
monsieur said the count to albert i do not ask you to accompany me to my house as i can only show you a habitation fitted up in a hurry and i have as you know a reputation to keep up as regards not being taken by surprise   10.14452928411417
andrea took the pen with an imperceptible smile and began   120.43398123208841
one however fell at the duke s feet and seeing that it was intended for him he put it into his pocket   165.15302040716264
but reflect they will keep us here till daybreak   143.98438068467428
i have this said he   84.18533661469378
then it was the will of god that it should be so and this it is which makes it all so awful continued grimaud   127.63948320499263
ah said the count negligently looking attentively at morcerf is there not something like an execution upon the piazza del popolo   148.9075553233335
porthos and aramis resumed their places by the stovepipe   76.98857161366945
the siege of la rochelle chapter xlii   108.6579171327484
but the knee of mme   93.67343776630699
the soldier returned and felton gave him back his weapon   192.78084871206022
i fancy i have heard so   132.76045984473697
place yourself close to the coach door on the right   40.98634462770353
my god yes gave that is the word said porthos   114.73041805441413
good day said he   102.15832663529415
for himself he had no doubt she was a victim of the cardinal s vengeance   146.1705874985766
he will be one sooner or later   80.8656453702688
then he had run to the train impetuous as a man who is excited by revenge and full of confidence as are those whom god blinds he had set fire to the wick of nitre   190.88883866325887
cried morrel with one hand leaning on the back of the chair and the other extended towards valentine   129.49407701148525
and far from thinking myself guilty of a crime i believe i do society a kindness   152.4870738300274
yes i have replied franz   138.86945237816164
well said morcerf i may as well be magnanimous and tear myself away to forward your wishes   147.84447038324828
0175m but said the abbé i would speak to you of a large sum amounting to five millions   161.5494437070288
de monte cristo has just carried off their five millions   67.13852067998032
i shall be most grateful monsieur if you will at some future time renew your offer but i have been flattered with the hope of being introduced to the countess and i will therefore wait   72.09719066559255
dantès held down his head that the other might not see how joy at the thought of having a companion outweighed the sympathy he felt for the failure of the abbé s plans   47.65416579280674
something more terrible more fatal more alarming for us the child was perhaps alive and the assassin may have saved it   86.87640478961066
the houses today so smiling and animated were on that night dark mute and closed   73.1946937191706
if she caused his death you said that she caused his death   100.94619471928935
then a hundred steps from the village he took a narrow road hidden at the bottom of the valley   183.01703216588925
you may reckon upon me and upon fifty soldiers which the chevalier d humieres has promised me whenever i need them   31.652980334649854
the king was a few steps behind me when suddenly i saw something rise up in front of me like a huge shadow   70.43508925927642
why the devil   163.3239001626036
germain a glass of sherry and a biscuit   132.74890876448865
she repeated   123.36961112529518
come fernand won t you return to marseilles with us   94.06222856983433
his rider was a priest dressed in black and wearing a three cornered hat   89.51592964411743
oh said andrea my father s old servant   109.93747456795832
when he was only eleven he chose his companions from among the young men of eighteen or twenty the worst characters in bastia or indeed in corsica and they had already for some mischievous pranks been several times threatened with a prosecution   66.16575963371133
if on the contrary he refuses to do so it will then be quite time enough to admit two strangers into your secret   103.67574596221469
morrel had returned to his bedchamber which he was only this moment quitting   58.141584822786875
when i am rich i will order a statue of chance from klagmann or marochetti   177.7005051618027
milady remained silent   122.40803029924136
andrea took five and twenty louis from his pocket   141.93020460818897
athos again struck by this name which seemed to pursue him like an echo hesitated for a moment then slightly knitting his brows he calmly said i know it grimaud met him between bethune and arras and then came here to warn me of his presence   67.11568347074717
take some then and come back immediately   185.65851361216667
stop cried athos extending his hand to one of the grated windows by which the room was lighted   114.57750341597139
but felton that s another thing   62.00359751253996
and now your excellency added he allow me to repeat my apologies and i hope you will not entertain any resentment at what has occurred   124.31621795118598
gentlemen you see said the duke to those present who dared not even smile that it is the illustrious coxcomb who is the greatest thief in the world   165.30822255304915
this was the first time morrel had ever so spoken but he said it in a tone of paternal kindness and julie did not dare to disobey   247.91429681278498
oh no he exclaimed not die now after having lived and suffered so long and so much   84.91741067802661
albert came up to them at this moment with franz   70.56004042626984
murmured raoul   208.87447155393
who among the persons here assembled answers to the name of edmond dantès   134.1922139989862
in which we hear tidings of aramis   107.35292917475878
i recognized you some time since as the insolent dandy who so gracefully mounted his horse in the champs élysées   66.6024287100291
and it was to this address that he owed the long and constant favor of a king who has not left the reputation behind him of being very faithful in his friendships   193.69685966378796
and that ghost told me morrel that i had lived long enough   138.011397643976
but tell me how you made his acquaintance   119.08787187993363
antoine at paris where his owner sold him for three crowns which was a very good price considering that d artagnan had ridden him hard during the last stage   106.49228072565555
name to me such of your workmen as you need and point out the tools they must bring   149.91694931128308
mousqueton smiled disdainfully   95.94845352993991
danglars did not lose one pang that fernand endured   123.82517967861514
he will tell thee what has become of her   3.266260456026558
are you not the soldier fernand who deserted on the eve of the battle of waterloo   104.83432078645575
mazarin made a grimace which was quite indescribable and then turned to d artagnan   141.22300278580752
she made it her business therefore to amuse the good abbess with the worldly practices of the court of france mixed with the eccentric pursuits of the king   152.35941589767737
but without words protestations or vows my life has entwined itself with yours   71.28147108699321
the white flag morbleu   87.27084589834386
a physician was sought for but none was yet found   24.83502404413541
but it died away and he appeared more sorrowful than before   68.40153902207656
albert bathed took his supper and went to bed   140.0389113435211
the stranger advanced slowly and as he advanced after entering into the circle of light projected by the lamp milady involuntarily drew back   174.2868731207756
i must learn where we are going   125.11439860044263
but first listen to the history of this paper   146.0118768056669
what is her brother in law s name   150.24126851502407
asked danglars carelessly   167.0881681095694
if we should meet a little troop of enemies equal or even superior in number to our own shall we charge them raoul   30.852580046871267
i must not be cast down by the discovery that i have been deceived   88.74117094394288
albert looked at her with curiosity for she had not yet related what he most desired to know how she had become the slave of the count   89.281216938256
oh god be praised he said   121.95607348252493
replied anne with queen like dignity extending toward the open coffer an arm despite the lapse of years still beautiful   143.3683463030841
your grandmamma has just arrived valentine said m   178.693460258784
said milady with the utmost ingenuousness   132.21994002208416
albert soon left her ordered his horses and having arranged his toilet drove to the champs élysées to the house of monte cristo   35.53346575162078
yes said athos that s grimaud s business   73.65616588799358
is not that the duc de chatillon himself coming toward us with his brigadiers   41.27913457404473
but the queen was firm   61.726626680701514
anxiously inquired albert   123.63923779189153
it is done   136.66139592803347
de la trémouille but i warn you that i am well informed and all the fault is with your musketeers   92.72508878135784
speak gentlemen said the prince saluting them   25.759556327779308
what say you franz   136.2632801608161
you will be wise to do so   144.17385208896022
the lemonade chapter 80   72.8735073106931
but the king is asleep   110.97859984104522
the prince is with them ah   150.8148485110539
meanwhile emmanuel in a broken voice said to the count oh count how could you hearing us so often speak of our unknown benefactor seeing us pay such homage of gratitude and adoration to his memory how could you continue so long without discovering yourself to us   109.57497207630739
0165m mercédès was left alone face to face with the vast plain that had never seemed so barren and the sea that had never seemed so vast   90.81353053749186
the first he comes to   80.6256787895053
franz and debray exchanged some words in a whisper and morrel rejoiced at this unexpected incident went to fetch the count who was walking in a retired path with emmanuel   55.37713234230442
oh i need only one of them for the time being   134.08918467556134
the four friends followed him   35.40408043162239
well this waistcoat was discovered today covered with blood and with a hole over the heart   93.3508183335373
don t disturb yourself julie said he   72.7379967392096
you left it somewhere then in the meantime   116.25497189717603
let me have some dinner   154.98978654960732
the door had remained open so strong was the excitement produced by the arrival of athos whose wound though kept as a secret was known to all   176.25632866159398
yes said aramis   26.38591842425795
i have four harriers which are considered the swiftest in the county and a pack of hounds which are unequalled for twenty leagues around   112.3394539530455
then monsieur is satisfied   95.29111732482725
d artagnan searched his pockets and took from one of them the order for the passage   140.16768050257303
if so let dinner be served in her apartments   51.1216682606579
we have seen several ill looking faces on the road and we have even had a quarrel at the red dovecot with four of those faces   132.8537753884991
monsieur scarron do me the honor said raoul blushing to tell me the name of that young lady whose opinion seems so different from that of others of the company   210.59702826174833
in the meantime there is bread water and fresh straw   86.70684596532458
what is death for me   121.51802288482882
to be a baron   157.68431927309032
there is a poison which destroys life almost without leaving any perceptible traces   135.24188407690355
athos followed them then porthos then aramis   156.23724790896415
true interrupted the young man i had not looked upon it in that light   76.8971657817323
upon these you can live at least two years   93.28189960341496
fire then said athos   129.89952773547768
it is desirable i should know the real cause   165.83170035010966
and he seated himself at the table and ate as he did in the merry days of the rue des fossoyeurs whilst d artagnan walked to and fro and thought how he could make use of planchet under present circumstances   90.59761804846133
they had expected maximilian since the previous evening   76.83596598109858
inquired the owner   83.68402440568057
said nanette   112.97852286834576
look said d artagnan day is declining   42.655288598553796
mazarin turned the lock of a double door on the threshold of which they found athos ready to receive his illustrious guests according to the notice comminges had given him   169.12668662955556
these horsemen whoever they might be had halted there   139.63629758644595
then said aramis this falls out very well   20.98673114888011
well i am wrong   104.44296799877658
and finally he disappeared in the midst of the tall red herbage which seemed like the bristling mane of an enormous lion   189.72031643946985
beauchamp and château renaud exchanged looks of astonishment   93.64672246453998
cavalcanti senior then the baroness afterwards the future couple as they are styled in the abominable phraseology of legal documents   73.34291173824195
nevertheless knowing the weakness of her husband and more particularly his cupidity she did not despair of bringing him round to her purpose   86.1784857235654
cried out several voices deceived by the blue ribbon and chestnut horse of winter   125.25370003781242
in a word the island was inhabited yet edmond felt himself alone guided by the hand of god   110.43371313854007
if anything happens to us we shall blame you for it   144.5182186008871
can you tell us where we can obtain a sight of the piazza del popolo   164.44311120814424
a small white cloud which had attracted dantès attention crowned the summit of the bastion of the château d if   58.38583198049735
no object affects me   92.90114148306587
at the moment when peppino reached the foot of the mandaïa a priest arrived in some haste forced his way through the soldiers and advancing to the chief of the brotherhood gave him a folded paper   182.44117459871183
bonacieux prophesied   91.2193173886894
d artagnan went instantly to the hay dealer and bargained with him for a hundred and fifty trusses of straw which he obtained at the rate of three pistoles each   5.255658895093859
that is my failing a capital failing i admit   156.24568638500165
perhaps after all he was not the man you seek for   60.92082280103774
and who wishes to speak with me   56.74387940126538
adieu raoul said the count   121.68438659700318
sign my lord   179.53584881607605
you know the only reply that i desire said d artagnan the only one worthy of you and of me   153.99326755598463
take this ring   122.86347210120105
you are then doubtless the count of monte cristo of whom hermine has talked to me so much   126.92619628780574
as to your rank an annual income of 50 000 livres will enable you to support it admirably   14.487264344452285
aramis started back and drew his   97.2259693366438
but i perfectly remember that falling into the error which others had entertained respecting me you consulted me as to the health of mademoiselle de villefort   130.96966567449746
and gondy in surplice and cloak appeared moving tranquilly in the midst of the fusillade and bestowing his benedictions to the right and left as undisturbed as if he were leading a procession of the fete dieu   125.52201410649612
then after half an hour you can go away in your turn   20.685820492641753
if i am a prisoner what crime have i committed   261.0695423915612
in the evening they separated the count of san felice s flock from those of baron cervetri and the children returned to their respective farms promising to meet the next morning   88.10794311790713
the sight of this instead of exciting the anguish experienced by the count in the dungeon filled his heart with a soft and grateful sentiment and tears fell from his eyes   59.90876339695957
now this is the first part of this precious manuscript which we offer to our readers restoring it to the title which belongs to it and entering into an engagement that if of which we have no doubt this first part should obtain the success it merits we will publish the second immediately   144.13580890460696
you disturb me   109.12735126338845
the duke is in love to madness or rather to folly replied richelieu with great bitterness   13.024525860989698
although he professes to be my enemy i have sympathy for him and if he is reasonable perhaps we shall arrange matters   113.17181878623128
there were three candles alight each of which burnt before a window one looking upon the city the other upon the palais royal and a third upon the rue saint denis   102.20356067053628
and he laid the request of number 34 before the governor   144.38386513832205
why the number of persons condemned to suffer their names and description of the death they are to die   175.7784552279333
asked morrel with his open laugh   144.85604688901014
in the most simple and natural manner possible   123.53680811580156
as he spoke the abbé took the diamond from his pocket and giving it to caderousse said here my friend take this diamond it is yours   73.71109353604521
milady let her head sink as if crushed by this sentence   54.92973204153792
where for   75.40390342427233
are you going to give me a lesson porthos   66.07441163015748
but supposing he doesn t mount   151.955050421903
you are the chevalier s prisoner   83.15630251588252
i know nothing for certain   230.6268878405499
that the day of pentecost would not pass without your highness being out of vincennes   165.0894447963025
and this time the tone and manner in which the command was given betokened such growing hostility that the two young men perceived for the first time that the mandate was addressed to them   108.27730563110029
but monsieur mazarin is a mean wretch who won t dispossess himself of his diamond in my favor   101.99253569961985
but what are we to do   133.29212070890597
listen to me rather than add to my destruction rather than add to my ignominy   135.52749874177775
call an officer of justice he said   89.00038160781375
re echoed athos   92.60487332414473
the horses seemed to become more lively with each successive step   90.48922414314083
mother i must go said albert in a firm calm voice   103.27097692844394
by my grandfather   171.80953130435313
thanks for the comparison said albert with a bow   106.25956979409627
bonacieux away and convey her to a place of safety and there if matters required make her a hostage   55.70078818217195
then quitting the grotto he replaced the stone heaping on it broken masses of rocks and rough fragments of crumbling granite filling the interstices with earth into which he deftly inserted rapidly growing plants such as the wild myrtle and flowering thorn then carefully watering these new plantations he scrupulously effaced every trace of footsteps leaving the approach to the cavern as savage looking and untrodden as he had found it   53.488085415694336
what was all that to scarron   107.5377623703919
i shall be happy to do so   144.845115836737
i am happy to see m   106.19027647342031
had they been actuated equally by courage the one would have done great things for the other   175.43426278352578
at this name the count who had hitherto saluted everyone with courtesy but at the same time with coldness and formality stepped a pace forward and a slight tinge of red colored his pale cheeks   86.13211006010069
the child was born was given to me motionless breathless voiceless   36.012338913035705
and the monk   45.42220219610803
ah said morcerf i see you are a stickler for forms my dear sir and you would remind me that the ceremonial rites should not be omitted   92.86305060682045
meanwhile sir watch always watch carefully for perhaps the evil may not stop here   61.29411585168423
without remorse said he   92.57700463185506
as however he did not fall as he did not declare himself conquered but only broke away toward the hôtel of m   200.56681962211115
oh that is different cried the abbé   94.65761968644748
this gun had an excellent barrel made at brescia and carrying a ball with the precision of an english rifle   130.21531549826835
my child exclaimed the old lady sharply let us hear none of the conventional objections that deter weak minds from preparing for the future   153.54648155541167
the owner of the pharaon and patron of dantès   107.14942975523745
perhaps it was a mere whim on his part for he is falling they say into second childhood but i love him for showing so much interest in you   76.51626241044474
he sees me in despair and pretends he can not understand me   149.08295275732502
you are warned vicomte   197.0893951063873
danglars retreated a few steps   136.4450094546799
pronounced the famous i have been almost obliged to wait   183.3793539160342
since the death of madame de saint méran i have known that a poisoner lived in my house   137.88183984258563
it is true that all was like a dream but it was not the less frightful   131.99309861030787
fortunately they have left me all i had   134.05325048190176
aim at this command the mountain of populace thinned so suddenly that d artagnan could not repress a burst of homeric laughter   184.8100059901474
grimaud had made himself a kind of sentry box out of a hollow willow and as they drew near he put his head out and gave a low whistle   208.59411594181057
maximilian has just returned has he not madame   44.73347341343475
the servant understood them   134.37063618025482
the hesitation created some suspicion in the three friends and athos advancing a few paces in front of the others cried in a firm voice who goes there   90.12300336268864
you will wait for me then   55.1134384304468
ah said morcerf there goes a happy man   78.22952460891217
sir replied the young man honest men are not to be paid with such coin   44.97133867232533
when i say i want i mean the queen wants them   155.4323489397686
you don t think of holding out against a whole regiment do you   94.70665468069494
no in truth   157.95222406080342
milady with a rapid gesture opened her robe tore the cambric that covered her bosom and red with feigned anger and simulated shame showed the young man the ineffaceable impression which dishonored that beautiful shoulder   115.57762802167076
repeated bertuccio   134.2871520144679
d avrigny about the death of m   155.16251717504963
kill me   115.03325072133673
we must joke with the guards we must gain the good will of the soldiers since we can t corrupt them   127.59671413408715
shall i give you a line for the vicar of st   126.19046547738216
the count pretends i have not him to thank   148.50308631831328
i wished it to do so   200.55625070032409
he ran without stopping from the rue férou to the rue de vaugirard   139.94130004305438
and philip urged by his own curiosity entered the gallery   146.6812242331177
it is useless for you to say so count   82.41471669568264
she looked around for help and would have gone down to her grandfather s room but on the stairs she met m   173.80290893596015
his manners are admirable said the countess at least as far as i could judge in the few minutes he remained here   178.94689258495512
no she is a bordeaux vessel la gironde   98.2990101652358
i mean that miserable d artagnan   157.7337811446696
no be assured i am not mad   54.851253289954585
during the five years of this seclusion which would have improved and matured the intellect of any other man m   127.13850986533939
no certainly replied planchet rather astonished at the unexpected honor conferred upon him   144.69670471156968
i mean that my friends officers in the guards and mousquetaires came to keep me company and we passed the night in feasting drinking dicing   204.7159275294322
yes said the physician i repeat it   172.28575327036359
then when the latter appeared dangerous to me i entered as i have now done and substituted in the place of the poison a healthful draught   126.38575574519952
and as she is not in bad odor at court she may perhaps on some future day speak a word that will not prove useless to you   172.97404225008964
here monseigneur said aramis is the treaty proposed by the deputation of frondeurs   61.35634121019933
now what is it they want to know   89.94753573346266
the face of the latter became serious when he had cast his eyes upon the paper   68.11724179762045
they are veritable sponges   102.47011329260812
château renaud and albert looked at each other with amazement   90.8293299225342
you are the pearl of cashiers   81.11797033851772
he is a charming young man said monte cristo and i felt a lively interest in him the very first evening of my introduction when i met him in search of a supper and prevailed upon him to accept a portion of mine   116.34188022697823
you understand baron my grandfather wishes you to read this paper said valentine   14.491967612952678
as one confides a letter to the hollow of a tree to the wing of a pigeon to the collar of a dog   82.32216434086813
you are about to marry a pretty girl who loves you   64.37571420529585
oh from some heartbroken waiting woman some desponding grisette   184.83590250062716
dantès in his cell heard the noise of preparation sounds that at the depth where he lay would have been inaudible to any but the ear of a prisoner who could hear the splash of the drop of water that every hour fell from the roof of his dungeon   198.027351072057
he made a sign for grimaud to bring a glass for d artagnan and grimaud obeyed as usual   86.94944667168645
and this gentleman being disengaged takes to the service willingly   138.41731655996907
once upon a time well go on   107.2934022129632
of the french academy   108.44890754486862
he said it is sad i know well to be forced to yield thus   45.80071807422135
when are you to pay   116.06218861966471
he tore himself from the arms of porthos and aramis and threw himself like a madman on the corpse of his mistress   191.63974784423576
the countess said morcerf was at her toilet when she was informed of the visit she was about to receive   110.44468792647663
cried d artagnan a horrible suspicion crosses my mind   138.82100454004936
but it behooved us to find it   77.20070714954338
so there is said d artagnan and he read we conceal the place where we are dear friends knowing your brotherly affection and that you would come and die with us were we to reveal it   105.32735432456442
at least so my cashier tells me   27.219105193760015
then a low door was opened before him and bending his head to avoid striking his forehead he entered a small room cut out of the rock   83.52749438205724
you see this is a fit of apoplexy and he might be saved if he could but be bled   79.95215196195093
penelon turned to his companions and exchanged a few words with them   79.79316269300841
i speak as i can   147.07981231937345
will the queen deign to follow my advice   206.34898815826492
it was i said a sailor of a frank and manly appearance   81.33811158429141
i must divert my attention   182.85596928300134
he found it firm solid and compact enough to bear any weight   140.32853613812182
tread in my steps   113.34131509197937
that was the general opinion sir said the major and i yes replied the count and you confirmed the report   146.76796892404153
this was to go himself to m   163.67152152782512
certainly you must give the orders for i intend residing at the house   44.062071712247686
the pope the life of a man   170.2744253369457
really yes said the coadjutor i have heard this affair mentioned   104.29493815609679
athos has been arrested   123.15577322743613
that is true but we then only risked our pistoles   68.79045340063
for although the young men made several more turns they did not again see the calash which had turned up one of the neighboring streets   42.34929913025674
it will   111.17744476803999
gondy bit his lips   54.03176364206671
he threw his arms around her neck   125.2082525922572
in italy   75.80428408724823
well this man was making signs to another at my left and turning around i recognized the honest grimaud   127.41916281623774
athos who heard milady s voice came sharply up   63.72764678534777
how is it possible for anyone to do that   15.276221295093919
remember that i write to you now to repeat how much affection for you i still cherish   136.33699716241614
the servant went out but returned almost immediately   72.41973903939505
she had revived but could scarcely move or speak so shaken was her frame by the attack   136.33565145054735
you know that i am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced captain in the service   39.13549458961468
but no   109.95281202408674
i believe and i repeat it to your majesty that the queen conspires against the power of the king but i have not said against his honor   139.8210260506841
if they did not speak of me i am sure they thought about me and i am in despair   122.65843795812464
i had about a million in their hands but warned in time i withdrew it a month ago   110.56708493380033
is it my fault that your father has dishonored himself   78.33990011565932
valentine sends many affectionate remembrances to your dear eugénie   173.6401573442932
has he not all the tricks of a demon at his command   41.751403599986375
come courage   104.27606472223677
for mercy s sake then what would you call robespierre   92.64454584289759
going straight towards him he propounded a variety of questions on different subjects carefully watching the man s countenance as he did so   67.62635661996984
because a fortnight since i was questioned on the same subject   55.384792667227245
and if there is a bottle of wine in the town let mousqueton buy it   148.30982155307396
the general remark is oh it can not be expected that one of so stern a character as m   138.01917900366593
but if it is a woman who writes said aramis and that woman desires not to be seen remember you compromise her d artagnan   122.43077979629278
my friend the cardinal   84.02697953641389
his threat completed the intimidation of the host   97.14811589230689
they waited ten minutes and then his lordship began to fear aramis was not coming to join them   159.95305355595212
be easy monsieur said planchet   75.93373785265796
in gascony tis no dishonor sir nobody is rich   43.65840447406664
that is not for me to say   152.44728318262906
she resists   107.23569524018453
you are adorable madame   106.8644380806611
our recruits from béarn are not generally very rich and i have no reason to think matters have much changed in this respect since i left the province   65.75938821513117
it was evident that his legs refused to support him   124.55315648472644
i will not forget you   190.7687458399485
i think madame danglars again requires your bottle he said   36.08443010134668
in fact m   69.62248281527619
well said monte cristo in an indifferent tone you will do as you please count for you are the master of your own actions and are the person most concerned in the matter but if i were you i would not divulge a word of these adventures   101.434266465485
i don t very well know   173.81541350796888
why is he not here that i may tell him so   75.97473584102258
well it is impossible but that master aramis that keen scented bloodhound and athos that wise and prudent nobleman will discover our retreat   81.40233797398388
that will teach me he said to have my guards provided with better horses   85.54109484594312
valentine said morrel pushing aside a loose plank give me your hand in token of forgiveness of my anger   103.62579216023478
gentlemen said he m   43.713029588368485
as they had long been acquainted with the king they were not much excited   158.48533966860504
as i look at it a millionth part of a railway is worth fully as much as an acre of waste land on the banks of the ohio   81.38708236235254
say i have a poor father sir   140.08746528912778
athos on his part had a valet whom he had trained in his service in a thoroughly peculiar fashion and who was named grimaud   141.3942614777029
at this moment he saw a cab at the top of the faubourg poissonnière   120.64802530212044
i have a fancy and mean to get a housekeeper   106.08823870277483
this new attack made no impression on mordaunt   71.70918666844649
maximilian cast a look of disdain almost of anger on the count   188.7904128048455
in the meantime the cortege returned to the palais royal   120.28408043336306
oh no answered franz i had no such intention   164.70768501368786
he has promised to use his influence to obtain it for me   55.61158202390825
the battle of lens gained   133.4850349066952
i shall see you through the window as you mount your horse   74.34016654041983
it may be easily imagined how great was our joy when in turning over this manuscript our last hope we found at the twentieth page the name of athos at the twenty seventh the name of porthos and at the thirty first the name of aramis   164.34409721464857
chevalier   100.97513411143031
indeed sire i wholly comprehend your disappointment   73.41594055698292
i will not promise said milady for no one has more respect for a promise or an oath than i have   182.47877317310503
thus seven or eight hundred piastres were wanting to them both to make up the sum that albert required   128.70907698865483
really count you do nothing and have nothing like other people   140.52385224907033
it is generally believed he will gain ten millions by that affair   40.78696916582126
i say it is easy enough answered porthos   11.40140539733055
the result was that the innkeeper with whom we were connected seeing that we would no longer come to him was forced to come to us and had established a branch to his inn on the road from bellegarde to beaucaire at the sign of the pont du gard   105.7340498961202
asked the count in a tone in which there was a visible alteration   61.55783516094771
the guards of monsieur the cardinal are forever seeking quarrels with them and for the honor of the corps even the poor young men are obliged to defend themselves   133.5181473890005
your conversation with the cardinal overheard by the four musketeers   124.32589405195898
he would no doubt have believed that he had returned to the times of florian and would have declared on reaching paris that he had met an alpine shepherdess seated at the foot of the sabine hill   102.94077918959002
see how deadly pale he is   85.68188424567201
beauchamp wished to go in alone but albert observed that as this was an unusual circumstance he might be allowed to deviate from the usual etiquette of duels   157.82275881581037
why i think said aramis blushing as usual that his ring not coming from a mistress and consequently not being a love token d artagnan may sell it   124.74504907310693
three of them appeared to be looking for the fugitive while the fourth dragged a brigand prisoner by the neck   109.3577253907256
father and daughter volume five chapter 96   74.37856138596361
consequently he had appeared to believe all that the vainglorious musketeer had told him convinced that no friendship will hold out against a surprised secret   125.21750710372422
he came to renew the thanks of madame danglars which had been already conveyed to the count through the medium of a letter signed baronne danglars née hermine de servieux   218.82458447821904
you will leave france you will return to england   102.80650911853562
they were heard running down the stairs and through the long passages then there was a rush in the court afterwards all was still   99.57105115212092
you must take a carriage and an escort and guard the prisoner with the greatest care   107.28418386554654
he means that the articles contained in this purse are the relics of the angel i spoke of just now   131.14287445833307
on then   61.370055047370975
it was then agreed that they were to go first to monsieur de bouillon as his house came first   108.61247919289153
ah cried valentine suddenly i understand   74.58741899429384
the smile was melancholy   101.0201522021585
and the count s agreeable voice his gentle and persuasive eloquence recurred to his mind at the various towns through which they journeyed and about which he had no longer any one to give him those interesting details which he would have drawn from athos the most amusing and the best informed of guides   94.73820373061861
yet stammered dantès wiping the perspiration from his brow yet i gave you two hundred francs when i left three months ago   102.8553074152772
meanwhile who is in the russian ambassador s box   35.6803757917821
we can wait the more contentedly that it is not absolutely bad here but for one thing at least   30.125144705864116
i have chosen a trade   155.5723526631994
meanwhile he cast his eyes over that unfortunate city which contained so much deep misery and so many heroic virtues and recalling the saying of louis xi   33.884686937513166
said dantès   129.8224880589041
not before me behind me   140.47032977165483
but allow me to tell you monsieur continued the citizen that i am convinced that there is less love than politics in all this   76.52336583065814
on the morrow at break of day they were still three or four leagues from the coast of england   87.12043499255046
he bowed to him then full of gratitude for the past and for the future   71.12749640161289
in april you went to dine at the minister s   136.85962265809863
porthos clapped his hands and the other two came running around   108.83215993980897
how should i know what a horse is   64.98469823036737
tis your fault answered porthos   120.88013567561893
the countess placed herself before monte cristo still holding in her hand a portion of the perfumed grapes   182.02466662531248
and this morning he sent for me to ask me if i had obtained any information   99.9336643490701
and they set out for boulogne where toward evening they arrived their horses flecked with foam and dark with perspiration   109.88994887820922
i would not have our gratitude become indiscreet or importunate   253.9364605112347
then we must fight   142.38401527459678
grief does not stun me   122.14141773134646
i approached him and said in a low voice well since you know the corsicans so well you know that they always keep their word   113.59041869133212
thank god we can keep a secret   117.50390972530022
i expected as much said athos   84.54731218330065
with an excellent master at arms that we have here   133.33881142467854
and you are right said his host   155.6521416909809
now the four friends began to speak loud scarcely waiting till one had finished before another began and each assumed his favorite attitude on or at the table   157.0377677765747
go d artagnan go   117.24048657802783
well let it be then as you have said monsieur d artagnan   14.921468065017649
doubtless these strange grave diggers had heard his cry   103.9973448317012
he almost immediately got up and took his leave   107.16464959879117
athos then made him a sign to take up his basket and to walk on first   182.70772438937843
the queen ran to a little table on which were ink paper and pens   42.12205382346875
but your excellency has not read all   48.3444243779723
chapter 61   92.86537071263605
and madame de villefort to my country house at auteuil   86.44444073790089
a fourth the illustrious coxcomb mazarin refusing to give laporte the young king s valet clean sheets and saving that it was quite enough for the king of france to have clean sheets every three months   26.493346325502216
well then i should say for instance resumed danglars that if after a voyage such as dantès has just made in which he touched at the island of elba someone were to denounce him to the king s procureur as a bonapartist agent i will denounce him   132.76017347295533
sire replied villefort bowing in an hour i shall have quitted paris   115.7240531745652
she had been engaged in arranging the dresses and linen in a closet when the king entered   77.96976242111022
and the cargo   143.60637428291363
now said he i may require to go in one night from paris to tréport   75.8073579326411
cried planchet   151.88807099212923
the two nobles saluted each other politely for if no friendship existed between them there was at least esteem   160.93496169014685
the marriage feast the morning s sun rose clear and resplendent touching the foamy waves into a network of ruby tinted light   37.82304069870456
enough sir muttered the cardinal you have said enough   126.83209924856357
murmured the priest   98.50307112119341
you do not know that name   126.88746273022366
monsieur de mazarin is not a man of genius as i thought he is a man of no origin once a servant of cardinal bentivoglio and he got on by intrigue   92.05901848158042
my friend said d artagnan turning to the servant tell his eminence that in half an hour i shall be at his command   128.5205341924902
i expected him this morning   89.45356686345453
she will escape us and it will be your fault athos   88.21922516329079
if victorious i shall continue the struggle   117.57034180568868
for he has educated me in everything and it is not his fault that his pupil profited so little from his instructions   169.49098082521323
it is he who raised your father s head on the point of a spear   144.6843161124386
de tréville moved to the bottom of his heart by this proof of courage sprang toward him   98.5050282169027
the three companions advanced rather humbly for all were now convinced that they had to do with someone more powerful than themselves leaving athos the post of speaker   110.43703785414674
50141m mercédès had never known misery   91.64142623136017
this woman exercised over him an unaccountable power   90.54421341129785
said porthos there s phoebus ruined   171.1952406028326
witty   79.91766430818205
and the marriage may easily be thwarted methinks and yet dantès need not die   66.98237392081154
quite so   84.79481848067059
she is found said milady   132.56169615745947
my dear count allow me to show you the way   148.64429859747415
but if anyone should come here the young girl shook her head   156.744792007981
the cardinal rose and advanced in haste to receive the queen of england   226.81895475533463
yes i want your chaise   131.7213584032213
he s not a guest like the other one here just now observed mine host to olivain who had rejoined his master to see if he wanted anything and your young master has no appetite   132.6835352198794
milady heard these few words and caught at a shadow of hope   49.46686137312579
yes your majesty he answered trembling   108.50594800094687
interrupted the count smiling   168.60220885084283
but said morrel i thought this mixture of which you now take four spoonfuls was prepared for m   148.64221404887928
yes replied noirtier with an expression of sinister joy   86.60146179493273
peppino chapter 115   92.29154846435297
he may have traveled so fast against the wind as to have brought on a violent catarrh   88.96348069317848
i am the abbé faria and have been imprisoned as you know in this château d if since the year 1811   129.9534658767977
said he after this embarrassing silence   113.66065630454696
sign the treaty then monseigneur said aramis   85.57396349549622
as i have already told you sir he was a very dangerous man   71.82293866086938
but the march of those who remained was not slackened   184.98577998818655
she shall live and with me   118.67891212190807
that evening i had translated an episode of judith and had just communicated my verses to the lady who gave me all sorts of compliments and leaning on my shoulder was reading them a second time with me   138.66124303880753
you should not speak so to an old friend like me caderousse as you said just now   55.219600574693665
athos replied always by gestures that that was well and indicated to grimaud by pointing to a turret that resembled a pepper caster that he was to stand as sentinel   83.9813769896559
he remembered the adventures that albert de morcerf had related when it was intended that he should marry mademoiselle eugénie   150.07631204390634
one only   182.2092916637642
he turned his eyes towards the soup which the jailer had brought rose staggered towards it raised the vessel to his lips and drank off the contents with a feeling of indescribable pleasure   84.3062890266076
he was one of those merchants who come to sell jewellery at the beaucaire fair and who during the month the fair lasts and during which there is so great an influx of merchants and customers from all parts of europe often have dealings to the amount of 100 000 to 150 000 francs   137.12173174329456
at any other time valentine would have seized the silken bell pull and summoned assistance but nothing astonished her in her present situation   1.0822076135406746
but what do you do count with all these horses   43.38263094765085
he was restrained by the threats of the two gentlemen and by the presence of their attendants who doubtless had received their instructions   61.076223259005864
yet perchance tomorrow deception will so act on me that i shall on compulsion consider such a contemptible possession as the utmost happiness   78.57160695361509
they drew near to the sloop   124.11937808253953
you can console and support me by the strength of your own powerful mind   98.21814598379008
chapter 41   137.61228721684495
haydée had three french maids and one who was a greek   48.59102760840385
well i will immediately call on m   99.16781211713116
by day they did nothing but ascend and descend the steps which led to the chapel   142.94548777017036
you were wrong to reply to him as you did continued aramis following with his eyes the young man now vanishing behind the cliffs   39.414104443676095
that is the best plan believe me   137.135919491953
exclaimed a commanding voice   82.45810069932145
at the sight of the diamond which was as large as a hazel nut la carconte s eyes sparkled with cupidity   228.87602640374052
the fact was that none of his servants none of the travelers present could have gained anything by being possessed of this paper   76.30403393607055
i saw then that we were descending a large staircase   46.253375244931306
let me speak to her of the east   148.40832520455623
grimaud obeyed without replying   155.20672355762142
nor did he neglect to launch a few arrows of wit at the excellent monsieur mouston   80.68419323244673
another older and less strong than he had attempted what he had not had sufficient resolution to undertake and had failed only because of an error in calculation   122.58544438693647
hush child   102.80899059917014
you are right said the latter   185.07994736702295
gentlemen said the queen a few years ago i had around me ushers treasures armies   115.26337090069889
it signifies nothing whether you eat much or little whether you have ten dishes or one it is always the same price   125.98678121995916
morrel who did not know his crime as cashier into a spanish bank   118.97866957923253
i invented a preparation that makes linen as smooth and as easy to write on as parchment   147.8393491089216
re enter paris if you will let us my good planchet   100.4970745456632
he lighted it and retired   131.94267191590436
to him who is called the comte de la fere   102.57296388227778
bathed in tears she wandered about the catalan village   211.36668183685248
now s the time   75.57199211736364
what with the baroness   57.97544012191325
they will believe he is arrested and that will give him time   98.91036489372232
this is what i propose to do said athos   134.186478499688
then what   101.97426864130647
my drunkenness is always sad and when i am thoroughly drunk my mania is to relate all the lugubrious stories which my foolish nurse inculcated into my brain   112.11478065189448
and you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses do you   196.62536563264467
as we have said he was lying on the deck   34.66631537650909
you must hope for us both maximilian   161.70714122413247
while africa was positively reported by many persons as her intended course   200.02756100813025
but i give you warning that if in polishing your chapel utensils you forget how to brighten up my sword i will make a great fire of your blessed images and will see that you are roasted on it   173.35428864722337
oh no no cried dantès   94.54491582176186
i am as poor as job and were you to search my pockets and my boxes i don t believe you would find a hundred pistoles   104.80867600324568
the veins of his temples swelled and boiled as though they would burst their narrow boundary and deluge his brain with living fire   182.44017588356016
asked the young man looking fixedly in his turn at the count   85.50500678916328
monte cristo took the glass drank half its contents and then presented it to valentine who smiled and swallowed the rest   141.28900630332657
your soul is darkened and consequently the sky of the future appears stormy and unpromising   11.796530374410509
who then am i   46.68933677624027
you spent it as you pleased   52.20641646180774
come quick quick   111.55753060385533
follow us at a distance of twenty paces as far as the louvre and if anyone watches us slay him   90.73905500253277
oh growl as much as you please cried lord de winter but don t try to bite for i warn you that it would be to your disadvantage   81.41687109492263
d artagnan trembled lest planchet seduced like the crow in the fable should tell his name and that the queen knowing his name would discover that planchet had belonged to him   46.28462337036369
he has revenged himself and has done well   141.5065757155122
and pastrini s account of vampa s having found refuge on board the vessels of smugglers and fishermen reminded franz of the two corsican bandits he had found supping so amicably with the crew of the little yacht which had even deviated from its course and touched at porto vecchio for the sole purpose of landing them   146.75557650212767
but there are no more said she   144.32883698558166
but go a little way from france go either to aleppo or cairo or only to naples or rome and you will see people passing by you in the streets people erect smiling and fresh colored of whom asmodeus if you were holding on by the skirt of his mantle would say that man was poisoned three weeks ago   104.05301308833454
ah my dear sir   203.30331781566792
yes but i have my breviary to repeat answered aramis   99.53626361840074
d artagnan pressing his hand repeated his call   57.664465191264995
listen to monsieur de tréville said the king   122.23736172950294
bertuccio will show me a light   89.02851994169565
that s pretty positive continued d artagnan   182.24888471391571
the rigors which had attacked barrois gradually increased the features of the face became quite altered and the convulsive movement of the muscles appeared to indicate the approach of a most serious nervous disorder   80.4905653708403
it is for that reason you see me so early   115.01437827429034
and if it please god we will make a good use of your presents   107.59488502087132
whereupon grimaud observing the duke s disappointment drew from his pocket a purse filled with gold and handed it to him   71.99151946628193
does anybody know   91.65649438842578
i became uneasy leaped the wall found my way through the garden when voices conversing about the fatal event what voices   135.92033891746337
yes yes repeated villefort as he approached his home yes that woman must live   11.7819815478029
yes replied d artagnan let us still be musketeers and let us retain as our battle standard that famous napkin of the bastion st   111.15855680536862
i should never have taken him for anything more than a mere major   136.10965229764713
the king perceived it and enjoyed it with that cold cruelty which was one of the worst sides of his character   82.3077288446188
you begged me not to leave   158.35205790913042
he hated and adored her at the same time   127.84941336388776
my child cried villefort he carries away the body of my child   127.40964213334483
asked milady warmly   190.80622069512197
i find that i have not been mistaken and i thank you that there is still one man in france of whom may be said without disappointment what i have said of you   145.02489753136103
no no said m   148.44091384676
50165m the young woman hid her face in her hands   157.84481609060052
debray paused a moment before reading as if trying to guess its contents or perhaps while making up his mind how to act whatever it might contain   8.854508847086777
aramis cried athos i am arrested   98.40617236342374
what does he mean   103.99234423603815
good bye count   126.82941325858167
and he will give me perhaps ten or twelve thousand when i marry   27.695684943188198
you were saying madame i came to ask you my friend said the baroness what will be done with this impostor   112.02755254376498
thought d artagnan and it seemed to him that the moment for attack had arrived   132.73552362106375
there will be eleven crowns gained   58.32703235440463
in fact the road was trodden by horses feet visible even in the approaching gloom of evening   70.5223379423964
dantès made no resistance   154.9222155059786
he wanted to kill me   114.88028332034929
he struck thrice   82.97775840276205
is it my affair   104.49476168895418
yes the very one who is lighting us   82.1890672016427
i understand now why they murdered him   193.82625183966076
but they both assured me that it was a jest they were carrying on and perfectly harmless   145.62010832762223
he no doubt thought that prisoners who died in the château d if were interred in an ordinary burial ground and he conveyed the dead man into his own cell took his place in the sack in which they had sewed up the corpse and awaited the moment of interment   162.9227079740694
let us wait   105.04042982449663
his father and mother were catholics i believe   212.5764320666048
they had learned to distinguish the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their dungeons and happily never failed of being prepared for his coming   71.39364893037305
he would not sell his horse   216.5037312116034
milady s son replied athos   146.6139419380817
adieu my dearest boy   70.62100365841593
madame danglars therefore went to bed without a shadow of suspicion and began to muse over the recent events   138.99304059121948
and as on the whole the sight was curious he probably wished to stay to the end   86.00572946134109
do not be lost with me   72.27672050507664
now sir said d artagnan wishing to change the conversation here are fifty pistoles that the count has sent you by the same courier   49.41068925646495
he is accused said the commissary with his inflexible voice of having assassinated the man named caderousse his former companion in prison at the moment he was making his escape from the house of the count of monte cristo   95.34344189011593
he likes good wine   146.55937372278123
besides he could not well appear in public since he has been the dupe of the cavalcanti who it appears presented themselves to him with false letters of credit and cheated him out of 100 000 francs upon the hypothesis of this principality   147.7578911924462
well said albert with a sigh it seems you are determined to marry me   123.75085093822486
now listen albert   81.5829017382316
have you succeeded   102.65123603201268
it was then that he encountered for the first time villefort s look that look peculiar to the magistrate who while seeming to read the thoughts of others betrays nothing of his own   119.39009543172313
but on reflection he hated him more and more being convinced he had some evil motive for his conduct   149.13395931051951
mademoiselle de villefort prepared all the cooling draughts which madame de saint méran took and madame de saint méran is dead   88.1600063684628
said blaisois pointing to the barley bread and pot of beer upon the table   111.49026652042912
what is done to infanticides in this country   200.38840639160807
but now what did i do with that letter   135.08780587739483
i can answer for it they do not   172.15911215052137
with this animal which he called pistache he was often shut up for hours alone superintending as every one supposed its education   182.01953049936668
the dinner it was evident that one sentiment affected all the guests on entering the dining room   212.4534710662489
george villiers duke of buckingham chapter xiii   151.79072278486066
i will bless you i i am dying   115.88495742805185
where have you read in the scriptures i ask you that the english are your neighbors   116.34924836543892
the space was cleared the two lamps placed on cromwell s desk in order that the combatants might have as much light as possible   62.84431522529911
it is not you who have directly made this exposure and brought this sorrow on us but you hypocritically provoked it   113.31983365903167
and she took two or three steps forward   154.17703006490163
i assure you we are or rather we shall be very happy   64.0964743594403
he scarcely knew mademoiselle de villefort   190.82519658870518
ah said the captain we can agree very well if you are reasonable   70.82809753154942
and now i am a frondeur not of broussel s party nor of blancmesnil s nor am i with viole   102.09924701747418
for soon perhaps i shall not hear and i shall die without knowing what she has written to me   17.188874250240488
dessessart who esteemed d artagnan made him offers of help as this change would entail expenses for equipment   139.67039231895572
i go away enchanted   64.85065832235355
who can tell whether mazarin may not take advantage of this rendezvous to seize us   62.49452758790858
the sweat rolled from her brow   84.93451144572563
constancy and discretion   65.13393802122728
i say that love is a lottery in which he who wins wins death   100.0559163782787
he did not even laugh at what would have caused anyone else to do so   99.782115632678
yes sir replied the count   84.08104350475543
he confessed that he had undertaken with his comrade the same who was killed to carry off a young woman who was to leave paris by the barrière de la villette   127.18391202399468
had i been alone i should scarcely have gone to rueil without great caution   94.40476580523186
his friend   139.88430035099836
i can assure you that this hobgoblin of yours is a deuced fine looking fellow admirably dressed   157.9743255430605
well i tell you that i come to you from the cardinal   154.64266145479377
what s your pleasure gentlemen   99.8304666462614
ah believe me edmond as i told you i too have suffered much   198.65693136222885
the mission with which i am charged sir replied the visitor speaking with hesitation is a confidential one on the part of him who fulfils it and him by whom he is employed   116.14587543361165
this last expression of richelieu s conveyed a terrible doubt   212.96340949170371
it was too much for a brain weakened by the ardent dreams of an ecstatic faith   48.410305684395965
there was a mistake   131.4307627301148
pen ink and paper then called fernand loudly   99.66698948746023
gave my father insomuch that i was mad with grief when they told me that the story of pygmalion was nothing but a fable   68.35338194300724
but then he may have stopped at saint germain   86.56308627338231
i faint   77.61641180218089
d artagnan and porthos pointed to their dusty and torn dresses but the cardinal shook his head   138.1496182107527
i think he was your colleague   124.80139207603987
yes yes let them come up immediately   139.71086499672745
they are going to fight   91.71172374720089
then you have received full information concerning my arrival   11.415298262204189
from my earliest recollections i have been beloved by no one so much the worse   161.06566111756385
but i do as he has made me a baron and a field marshal and i shall never forget that for these two titles i am indebted to his happy return to france   154.69386979965674
milady made no reply but turning her beautiful head round upon her pillow she burst into tears and uttered heartbreaking sobs   88.73241729060751
the queen herself does not dare to oppose the terrible minister   50.2753534121174
nor have i lost sight of him for a single instant since   115.8350702614763
i am from gascony it is true   87.83379357710226
i had acted hastily towards him   45.64328116915877
on the contrary we shall meet again said mercédès pointing to heaven with solemnity   46.998452966659016
what ones   96.84110035288006
would you like better to be hanged in your true name milady   113.15374304354508
do not go away   96.50056547648398
three months since it was m   126.47689757199286
and as he has not the honor of being a musketeer he was dressed as a citizen   149.24661078444723
this was the inspector s first visit   120.18068805022286
a cabriolet was in waiting at the gate in which i intended to carry off valentine to my sister s house to marry her and to wait respectfully m   109.30582948390607
franz however did not obey the summons till he had satisfied himself that the two men whose conversation he had overheard were at a sufficient distance to prevent his encountering them in his descent   104.0757077010196
but asked the visitor do you know why he came to france   152.47524963588845
i obeyed my love   116.18072123566267
order a larded hare a fat capon mutton leg dressed with garlic and four bottles of old burgundy   68.16829949914296
this last obstacle having been overcome the troop pursued their course with their accustomed ardor   127.69623957875481
but once satisfied of his safety she also cast a brief but expressive glance on the casket which was not lost upon the count   52.32823384414368
in crete he was supposed to be slain in winter with the decay of vegetation and to revive in the spring   92.92219317777662
and why is it impossible   74.6695759660225
well enough to question him in that language   7.325494345894825
there are twenty five bottles of it left   114.98086614005173
said the young man laughing i confess it and so much more the readily my dear bonacieux as i see there is no concealing anything from you   54.144773921874425
four days would quite suffice to complete the seduction of felton   117.92649983000845
i still assist at executions but no longer strike the blow myself no indeed   13.830357613881588
an illustrious person sends you   105.34307079681352
still further his shirt had stuck to the wound and he had lost only a few drops of blood   80.26401905969132
during the day i had nothing to fear   105.87158373110798
when it arrived there four guards and a police officer who accompanied it mounted into the heavy machine and closed the shutters   122.48952087167704
go grimaud said athos   60.95378255304929
they are the only men who know how to live   68.96702956599165
if the marquise will deign to repeat the words i but imperfectly caught i shall be delighted to answer said m   214.39930387658393
i can see nobody said d artagnan   48.24898887623628
mouston will do   99.81206481346467
but the convent where is that   170.49395733528098
but lord de winter might suspect him   184.7962563678107
take what rest you require and remember that if you are not able to serve me here in paris you may be of the greatest service to me at marseilles   166.57347616093617
courage sir said raoul to the wounded man   145.5443367580023
did i know anything about it when it was all done when i was down there   138.3792069979231
a piece of bread and another glass of the capital rum i tasted for i have not eaten or drunk for a long time   104.67288421295142
oh dear grandmamma are you worse   1.3609515637572684
i do not like to have simple soldiers because they have the advantage of serving in a privileged corps thus to play the great lords   125.7686582524086
edmond rose again but this time his legs did not tremble and his sight was clear   83.10508564096378
adieu your excellency   59.0852837688042
remarked a third   211.4233646822296
i should affirm the culpability   141.50867665131645
said d artagnan i had forgotten that he was only a musketeer for a time   177.92719554791103
prodigiously replied athos in the name of himself and his comrades   76.62464275172431
he traversed a corridor crossed a grand saloon entered a library and found himself in the presence of a man seated at a desk and writing   194.90247618725914
well asked the count in arabic have you been to see the old man   167.62398686559476
stopped terrified at what he was about to say while richelieu stretching out his neck waited uselessly for the word which had died on the lips of the king   58.146577322315665
then said d artagnan letting his arm fall with discouragement it is useless to struggle longer   150.49905270369064
at the end of two hundred years the documents were found and they thought of bringing up the jars   102.40162050820788
at that moment parry turned over several leaves of his bible and read with a loud voice this verse in jeremiah god said hear ye the words of the prophets my servants whom i have sent unto you   56.953817577459354
then said albert you became the property of this man   178.21319440422695
at these words there was a murmur along the benches and a second voice not that of a woman but a man s stout and furious thundered behind d artagnan   90.6490806341712
well as you please i even gain something by it for i no longer see that wicked smile of yours   110.24008488833469
the cries which the police officer repeated twenty times in the king s name were powerless against this formidable multitude seemed on the contrary to exasperate it still more   45.23992543947121
grimaud s agitation his pallor the sweat which covered his face the dust which soiled his clothes all indicated that he was the messenger of some important and terrible news   226.88014675456526
for it was a situation where the ordinary condolences which even the best friends are so eager to offer in great catastrophes were seen to be utterly futile   155.51115793781133
why did you not mention his name at once   21.45013384155402
i say only that fortune has turned against me i had thought to gain heaven and now i have lost it   73.49666456572542
d artagnan began now really to fear that something had happened to mme   131.49677925426218
it would have been so unquestionably had not god given me so large a compensation   144.53485681185182
why i did not expect to see you before tomorrow   23.662805774361843
de montmorency and lafayette   152.76089236319183
ah that gives me more confidence   91.30219903468857
he s not more cunning than de richelieu was   110.5805627197335
the baron drew out his watch   93.85299703452736
there was no longer any deceit or bravado in the manner of the accused   154.3134061117707
alas resistance was far from my thoughts   100.79877530744072
we were present at the scene in which the two captives were confronted with each other   114.88334276815806
you would like very well to be in a good ship dancing upon the waves of that emerald green sea   33.858370500038646
he was a berrichon thirty five or forty years old mild peaceable sleek employing the leisure his master left him in the perusal of pious works providing rigorously for two a dinner of few dishes but excellent   40.66971509009129
i wish to add nothing to the recital of these gentlemen until they perceive themselves that they have perhaps been mistaken   138.71877975340317
d artagnan thought a moment and then went to the wardrobe in which hung his old clothes   53.19334211572898
for a hundred pistoles i have discovered a secret for which richelieu would have paid twenty thousand crowns   71.01978354573555
i was sure of it said morcerf   75.56593613306832
the musketeers are as you know picked soldiers and they require many things useless to the guardsmen or the swiss   116.92217146253542
from the same drawer she took a man s complete costume from the boots to the coat and a provision of linen where there was nothing superfluous but every requisite   92.98157460174795
but when the cowardly insulter spat in the face of the captive monarch athos grasped his dagger   122.71277543242118
oh unfortunate   52.12669211564717
and on what floor does he live   185.39363368430082
they said she had left   77.10107560476696
two hours have i been boring you to death with my company and then you with the greatest politeness ask me if i am going   99.12454318168285
added gondy turning to la meilleraie   182.82652426995008
however i have managed to live thirty years without this protection you will say   179.05800850116424
d artagnan thought of the appointment mme   121.72555090479462
she continued then as if she had not heard his exclamation or as if she thought the moment was not yet come to reply to it   62.073393370455044
a small door close to the lodge of the concierge gave ingress and egress to the servants and masters when they were on foot   40.57019607899393
what is allowed then   31.12322147428307
go up said the host   118.4112652065933
that is convenient   50.75068087862763
further this woman as if not certain of the house she was seeking lifted up her eyes to look around her stopped went backward and then returned again   74.10739621355877
i will not die alone   79.26623935315033
his excellency the count of monte cristo had he said given positive orders that the carriage was to remain at their lordships orders all day and they could therefore dispose of it without fear of indiscretion   58.36869592501766
he went then to the queen and according to custom accosted her with fresh menaces against those who surrounded her   93.62533978612046
heaven forgive me they do not know that we can see them and they are actually embracing   168.00420547794602
well then we ll do our best   98.52245091002044
what do you think of this madame preacher   77.48584947862682
then he descended a smile on his lips and murmuring that last word of human philosophy perhaps   139.4032246051597
what do you mean grimaud   86.0756385038382
i tremble to give my permission   100.41788530638405
asked the queen motioning to raoul to rise   169.68707413862597
that credit sustains him as breath animates the body   76.30767674243317
de schomberg   225.52885141416175
this reproof stung athos to the heart but as the impression produced by seeing d artagnan foremost in a coarse ferocious crowd had been very strong he contented himself with replying i am not calumniating you my friend   56.1428322273433
alas monseigneur we were not in the plot as you will soon see   136.43589088810933
who says this aramis is not a wit   113.43268097007723
said the soldier uneasy at perceiving that all was not over   25.839806216267405
the advice is good monsieur and tomorrow i will set out   110.16201652271096
exclaimed a multitude of voices go and return as quickly as you can   32.522664543920655
i confess it   195.79693048994963
six days ago i landed at portsmouth   79.18069532408835
why do you address me so coldly so distantly   120.08930224135003
and i ask god and you how i can save her   173.98936023672246
and when you are full of money again you can redeem it and take it back cleansed from its ancient stains as it will have passed through the hands of usurers   94.92262696931697
it is the custom in war said d artagnan why should it not be the custom in a duel   170.54801814707585
wilt thou allow the frightful projects of this man to be accomplished   41.206267171717954
the carriage had been twenty minutes behind the time appointed   113.4568458878654
but said the agitated mercer do me the pleasure monsieur to tell me how my own proper affair can become worse by anything my wife does while i am in prison   120.95314370537504
the duchess loudly lamented the announcement of peace   126.48531350357864
he was if i recollect arrested in a tavern in company with a great many others   100.25007342250831
to be sure yes   103.50947699759205
the other room near the library was a bedroom   86.39285958043243
any noise in the ears   46.64514061582726
i explained nothing and it is he who apologized to me   129.39490640362698
the two friends then placed themselves as they had agreed porthos being completely hidden in an angle of the window   111.96825664126416
the two friends did not venture to return the count the breakfast he had given them   211.3443149204264
you said only imagine and then paused   155.91100201635192
he recounted with circumstantial exactitude all the particulars of the supper the hashish the statues the dream and how at his awakening there remained no proof or trace of all these events save the small yacht seen in the distant horizon driving under full sail toward porto vecchio   198.33250489755727
then taking a passport from his drawer he said good it is available for two months longer   178.85491722040587
the next day must clear up every doubt   30.6593517820056
said d artagnan who began to feel all his patience exhausted   111.70981828872097
nevertheless he understood it all but was deaf   193.86280164150568
he hurt my shoulder   98.31348849036227
your swords are in the corner   182.4130650847488
some unknown enemy an invisible foe has done this   116.49911891070187
who has been here   190.96922963501046
magloire   176.85353167940275
and what do you think i did   104.23254602715446
danglars speculates whereas he never does   108.68606412804496
they will come for her tomorrow or the day after with an order from the queen   76.0646215168779
tomorrow by twelve o clock i shall have the order for your exile signed buckingham   139.13166414667285
you are setting up an establishment of course   179.65160097594585
my dear count you have no idea what pleasure it gives me to hear you speak thus said morcerf   159.43233520554034
will you assure me it shall not be signed   171.6016330434488
we will attend upon him with a gendarme   106.56700200349381
it is a wretched bed but that is not my fault and it is you who have chosen it   129.02499795765317
to tell you the truth i consider it lost   132.33625618142236
tell me how can i do otherwise   180.7623261638302
then she carefully rinsed the glass and wiping it with her handkerchief replaced it on the table   100.88166912797713
i yesterday took the place of another   182.19820006790326
it is a chain of recollections an idea which carries you back to other times to other places which very likely have no connection with the present time and place   174.88808753206143
the musketeers advanced bowing d artagnan following closely behind them   134.64203907408466
see said he my dear friend how god punishes the most thoughtless and unfeeling men for their indifference by presenting dreadful scenes to their view   148.9216388797582
mine you have heard and that is to pursue you on earth to the tribunal of men in heaven to the tribunal of god   79.6430177862296
then what did you mean stay he left a letter for me   51.843117533767014
you do not consecrate your days and nights wholly to the king s service   141.54463435708962
the latter rose from the front of the window upon the sill of which he had leaned with his elbow and knitted his brow like a man disquieted   68.51923266088676
besides we must try our own arms   161.38966983693535
then when he thought i had said all he advanced toward me   109.19965400286867
bonacieux fell into a profound reflection   60.10356093450025
nearly thirteen millions of our money   169.39661900804407
he had even given orders to arrest her and would have cut off her head had she not escaped with her waiting maid poor kitty   130.50411992583147
do you understand father   168.99857152978927
then all was dark again   151.44537282665326
whereabouts downstairs   25.798934951115356
but at the first words he uttered the comte roused himself from the kind of lethargy in which he had sunk   123.33230624293468
i am anxious to know the state of your health   83.67277989106633
yes sir answered mousqueton   123.32167156314573
after which the curtain again fell and the spectators poured forth from the theatre into the lobbies and salon   73.45679904624198
i should be turned off and lose my pension   87.60863982106545
and since he has been here i have watched him   82.83506615780993
asked madame danglars with an anxiety easy to be understood   126.71887515332911
i have denied god and he has abandoned me   66.05771718731297
but you sir   191.47285280443148
and you should call it devotion added aramis   114.3060805443884
how should i know what horse furniture is   170.1297810672011
or if you have them why don t you keep them to yourself   116.29893591723808
said aramis our late adventures have disgusted me with military life   102.17442579625424
well they fastened a thirty six pound ball to his feet and threw him into the sea   180.46225725030718
i will question and do you answer me   87.00967884255058
de tréville six days instead of four and introduced into these six days two more nights for they set out on the twenty fourth at five o clock in the evening and as a further kindness m   64.81976006006073
and when i have taught you mathematics physics history and the three or four modern languages with which i am acquainted you will know as much as i do myself   105.69610650153773
they have been stolen replied the duke and it is the cardinal who has dealt this blow   60.08575798766024
the two combatants had been seen in a position which left no doubt of their intentions   107.0484823545283
at last   90.93550822017656
well now then the count   107.09276072542028
or of my sister since she was dead   56.407384404282894
then shaking his head sorrowfully poor haydée said he   99.61542610002309
so far well said aramis   122.17639865814004
there is none said athos   147.0391723297025
de villefort heard of him at marseilles and m   121.0062512684488
porthos consoled himself by filling the antechamber of m   139.22643303204768
faithless court   75.47642521566911
tell me a little about it my dear monsieur de rochefort   84.2581915155343
the cardinal rang a second time   203.33290171195875
this fortnight expired he decided that the inspector would do nothing until his return to paris and that he would not reach there until his circuit was finished he therefore fixed three months   147.39147394012247
that is to say as often as you can with safety   141.99582952764155
the handsome madeleine announced to d artagnan that planchet had returned bringing mousqueton with him who had heroically borne the extraction of the ball and was as well as his state would permit   161.86508456592438
the king half dressed the queen and laporte remained each in the same state and almost in the same place where they were listening and waiting   143.78977871116038
and so sir said the queen you are seriously afraid of a public tumult   45.4875140260543
well cried milady in a sharp voice   75.28966879667969
madame the passage is quite clear and your majesty can continue your road   121.7929664995109
the fresh earth excavated during their present work and which would have entirely blocked up the old passage was thrown by degrees and with the utmost precaution out of the window in either faria s or dantès cell the rubbish being first pulverized so finely that the night wind carried it far away without permitting the smallest trace to remain   110.53483168542071
the clerks surveyed him with great curiosity and he not knowing well what to say to this ascending and descending scale remained tongue tied   87.97472505432566
speak i beg you   70.73784141529188
she exclaimed in so plaintive an accent that it seemed to stifle a sob   146.18389287150603
return by the same road you came and we will say nothing about you unhappy wretch   109.01446556653649
an announcement has been made which implicates the honor of a member of my family   111.59157112992949
comte de la fere   119.1216175482974
he brought it to bear skillfully executed it with the rapidity of lightning and struck the blow with a force which he fancied would prove irresistible   100.16934826189419
and she resumed her narrative   182.2722919757714
for the decision does not come from you your misfortunes are generally imposed upon you and your faults the results of others crimes   202.48014012637236
how does that concern you   147.66643605225462
this way gentlemen this way   54.381081633347655
all five followed by their lackeys leading their horses took their way to the town of béthune whose outskirts they perceived and stopped before the first inn they came to   120.4250567032621
he said in a low voice   96.00297307637945
he would never forgive me for not having preceded you   95.1014077478469
you are in error sir answered the queen   99.46157550476906
yes returned the count i know who he is gentlemen   119.09000311046083
but all four together and without a scratch   195.23053852234872
anne had never at the louvre had so large a court   128.6684948498169
nevertheless i give it to you with great pleasure   55.11810747624362
tis true madame answered he that my father was a girondin but he was not among the number of those who voted for the king s death   140.17395011038795
from which besides we can not retreat without shame   100.92435365734191
milady remained still in bed petrified by surprise   112.3987526112428
athos stepped back and passed his hand across his brow   91.59515283438839
athos indeed saw a second smile on the lips of d artagnan   161.81411898484015
having poured out the soup the turnkey retired   50.56103120556141
he wished to call out to him but could not utter a word   147.51821101730002
i took the precaution to half empty the carafe in order that my suspicions might not be noticed   110.76107866411982
murmured the queen looking uneasily at the cardinal   76.47852084692525
enter the guardroom said the sergeant   85.20850466839346
yes replied albert raising his voice   108.37362735725164
why as to that i think my dear son you must be by this time so accustomed to france as to look upon it almost as a second country   136.62780663607052
this idea completely restored clemency to his heart   218.68966140146517

they promised upon separating to meet at the duke of bracciano s ball to which all rome was invited   114.37599829867473
i resolved to set out and did set out at that very instant carrying with me the beginning of my great work the unity of the italian kingdom   62.77199317817568
whence have you these ideas of death   41.593685851029065
the captain was only waiting for his passengers   65.24107659690404
at this corner is the private staircase communicating with the sleeping apartment   28.631421117055197
and the young girl smiled on her grandfather as if he had been a child   116.86318205681988
we shall be alone and can make up our accounts   50.256380015368514
it was a lovely starlight night they had just reached the top of the hill villejuif from whence paris appears like a sombre sea tossing its millions of phosphoric waves into light waves indeed more noisy more passionate more changeable more furious more greedy than those of the tempestuous ocean waves which never rest as those of the sea sometimes do waves ever dashing ever foaming ever ingulfing what falls within their grasp   98.94396308760967
uncertainty is worse than all   69.98871206977373
i have always been an honest man and as far as lay in my power i have done good   110.49910406654254
when groslow undertakes this kind of thing there s no need to go over the ground a second time   191.54917636041387
well but whatever expenses he may have incurred i am sure he is in a condition to pay them   89.71199536381492
0127m meanwhile what of mercédès   84.63661468959272
laporte went out   142.82913254397715

every day luigi led his flock to graze on the road that leads from palestrina to borgo   183.99545785807368
i have brought her here sir and i have deposited her in charge of charlotte who till better advice comes has bathed the foot in cold well water   185.7430505951417
emmanuel tried to comfort the women but his eloquence faltered   184.1928779955752
exactly so said the host   178.4676086735642
a slight shade passed over the brow of bonacieux but so slight that d artagnan did not perceive it   111.44273494186874
upon issuing forth from his subterranean retreat at the expiration of five minutes he found the abbé seated upon a wooden stool leaning his elbow on a table while margotin whose animosity seemed appeased by the unusual command of the traveller for refreshments had crept up to him and had established himself very comfortably between his knees his long skinny neck resting on his lap while his dim eye was fixed earnestly on the traveller s face   128.0281931834684
you my dear monsieur de rochefort shall have the post of confidence   102.86326067486831
the innkeeper gave orders to a servant to go before franz with a light   88.79998797469865
the palikares who were prostrated at my father s feet now sprang up and fired and the room was filled with fire and smoke   50.168867992563584
but you must demand from her only what it is in her power to grant   63.894531837277626
but the rascal is so cunning he might have guessed our project   27.917808413616257
be tranquil and go wait for me in my chamber   82.01878834257693
the unknown spurred his horse to a gallop   128.50916588028952
in truth said porthos i understand   88.93789117878435
this man in whom milady till that time had only seen a very simple gentleman had become an admirable jailer   76.33568523425379
you were going to visit monsieur de la fere   185.3928131384933
blaisois replied mousqueton remember that bread is the true nourishment of a frenchman who is not always able to get bread ask grimaud   112.00151884549793
how could i pronounce that word   102.4675028308085
but monseigneur knows very well that justice never lets go that which it once lays hold of   111.38627570409828
how pale you look   123.81163500651341
and now said athos it is not our plan to run anywhere and like madmen but we must map up our campaign   62.337937128712944
simply this said the coadjutor   120.38243707328989
after closing the door carefully behind him mordaunt glided into the subterranean passage sheathing on the way his now useless sword and thus reached the neighboring house where he paused to examine himself and to take breath   109.34291731059102
bertuccio who was also gazing with sad astonishment upon the iron bars the bolted doors and the shadow which moved behind the other grating   166.29629984353494
and shrugging his shoulders with unaffected contempt he passed on   122.59465582946632
but you can plead for me you can have me tried and that is all i ask   147.15922560226605
he reeled back with a shudder and the same moment the drops became a crimson cataract   127.40013145952861
they dragged us away by force   102.41186720084002
yes sir replied the young man naively   143.89426870745527
go sir then said the queen   59.086232008386006
weep said athos weep heart full of love youth and life   56.02548117752042
said albert to the count   177.4621661956437
in truth whether we die here or elsewhere matters little since we must die   104.12336418844741
this is not to the purpose said eugénie   113.54905298638499
he arose and stood near mousqueton   160.38682732448171
and i have an idea of our leading a delightful life upon this 3 000 francs   133.82776427380435
i will let you know that directly i have seen m   58.70047606516074
the poison will be changed and the quantity increased   110.17186375139615
i perceive that my story has caused a general emotion and i beg to apologize to you baroness and to mademoiselle danglars   208.65244967777778
the host had the appearance of as honest a man as any on earth   116.77687505338825
hardly had he read the letter when his wife entered   241.65957753646893
on this side i think the cardinal will be well guarded   116.8380452422102
30185m madame replied villefort i can truly say that i have always entertained a high respect for my father because to the natural feeling of relationship was added the consciousness of his moral superiority   87.67392009925398
cried aramis and porthos at the same time   69.54476674559271
the letters were long the four pages were covered with closely written words   61.53113769292053
i shall follow you with my eyes as long as you are in sight   131.49951104179667
but the instant your majesty considers me a prejudiced judge i withdraw   140.26861620215843
it is a beautiful diamond left by poor edmond dantès to be sold and the money divided between his father mercédès his betrothed bride fernand danglars and myself   88.74287721932954
i understand how he would act   114.91073212161078
replied debray   76.74635702257453
as he mistrusted me he determined to guard you himself and sent me in his place to get buckingham to sign the order for your transportation   185.9072276890581
captivity the third day felton had fallen   121.11220874237893
but here are your bonds   135.1714098963833
i say that he has hastily accused your majesty s musketeers toward whom he is unjust and that he has not obtained his information from good sources   108.7411424641776
why have we not a grimaud near every prince   172.73096117743705
yez yez said the swiss   141.63413080351393
can it be otherwise   45.85653010619639
and they went out together   88.12689019149539
athos was the first to leave him in order that he might retire to a little property he had inherited near blois   47.41074273544751
he seized it and attacked the wall   93.01358521430403
and besides he said going out of this chamber isn t all   59.17418910652637
they returned around the house to fetch porthos and aramis   114.60190752974546
this is a fortunate chance one that will delight his eminence   132.78314768004776
each of them when the other was not looking hazarded a sly glance   107.70276019275344
because he left no commentaries replied la ramee with his coarse laugh   127.2366298059027
the third then fell from the clouds i suppose   11.979631800440359
but first of all i must get there   117.97306140078808
but on his way he met athos who during his relief which d artagnan had procured him had recovered his breath and who for fear that d artagnan would kill his enemy wished to resume the fight   188.75014822848817
it is true that since i left him i seem to have lost my senses   136.8531142885289
if as we hope our readers have not wholly forgotten the first part of this work they must have preserved a clear idea of that estimable individual who is wholly unchanged except that he is twenty years older an advance in life that has made him only more silent   65.31094530623929
a thousand pistoles   87.07865096144614
asked albert lighting his cigar   83.90849324384519
but he received for reply that the person in question had got into difficulties and at the present time kept a small inn on the route from bellegarde to beaucaire   177.48614039757052
the two friends walked out on the fortress   73.11838423043982
and he made some steps toward the door   107.55253809206172
the men of my crew who are devoted to me for life and death mount guard around this apartment and watch all the passages that lead to the courtyard   167.14498168948774
de morcerf as you saw   77.617746859683
no no read exclaimed the queen indignantly   103.44121745793184
grimaud looked after him and when the door was closed he drew out of his pocket a pencil and a sheet of paper   117.25729912201643
i have often read and read again the history of mithridates said madame de villefort in a tone of reflection and had always considered it a fable   127.12542489827179
oh beauchamp beauchamp how shall i now approach mine   34.70269003470369
you think so my lord   39.226044315501355
and now resumed bertuccio your excellency may perhaps be able to comprehend that this place which i revisit for the first time this garden the actual scene of my crime must have given rise to reflections of no very agreeable nature and produced that gloom and depression of spirits which excited the notice of your excellency who was pleased to express a desire to know the cause   101.19289779554708
at the door he found the two men and the spare horse which they held   114.75817145994809
and the other   148.14833433596687
his situation was too precarious to allow him even time to reflect on any thought but one   145.52446405470494
d artagnan was really insulted   64.89738043885089
yes continued athos four times only   116.69015164128072
and if you are acquitted well by the faith of a gentleman i will kill you at the corner of some wall as i would a mad dog   116.72336308702215
you must teach me a small part of what you know said dantès if only to prevent your growing weary of me   69.20939142260917
and indeed it would have been so much the more difficult to break their bondage as the guides alone are permitted to visit these monuments with torches in their hands   105.62704242330639
the greatest my dear bonacieux   68.09937575619007
well suppose it is a bull fight you are going to see   55.446065202026304
in an instant dantès plan was formed   97.15342931315216
today then at eleven o clock your father has nearly three hundred thousand francs to pay   85.67769161823476
and even then the precaution seemed superfluous the wall was so high   73.23650184641807
nothing good replied d artagnan shaking his head   68.53017754488178
danglars burst out laughing   165.87426184478988
cried the soldiers and ran for their arms   34.76005775631678
a few seconds afterward d artagnan also went out enveloped in a large cloak which ill concealed the sheath of a long sword   54.503912192908224
a roman scarf tied round his neck   149.82749129673732
there was a profound silence in the room when the duke again addressed them do you not remember that the duc de guise taught all the dogs in paris to jump for mademoiselle de pons whom he styled the fairest of the fair   210.39566218398244
i can not hear such things said as that   106.72413793653128
shall i ring for baptistin   177.28194506874806
i mean to say young man that he who sleeps over a mine the match of which is already lighted may consider himself in safety in comparison with you   42.99263237834775
know that monsieur de bracieux is rich enough to drink a tun of port wine even if obliged to pay a pistole for every drop   101.31812549995222
it is that your majesty will make him come here will interrogate him yourself tête à tête without witnesses and that i shall see your majesty as soon as you have seen the duke   104.68050438721869
the house servants with the carbines   88.57963337088513
you called me didn t you   75.07002997608045
then i admit my patience failed me   140.9503181661115
muttered porthos with a kind of pretense of answering   96.87405585408862
he had allowed himself to be dressed in great astonishment overwhelming laporte with questions who replied only in these words sire it is by the queen s commands   102.99898973249223
she was now connected by bonds of a political nature with the prince de marsillac the eldest son of the old duc de rochefoucauld whom she was trying to inspire with an enmity toward the duc de condé her brother in law whom she now hated mortally   93.7307717934368
you have a longboat   131.6107752751047
speak doctor i am listening said villefort   136.78563356935138
at the door stood two horses fresh strong and fully equipped   97.59095621998993
you are deceived monsieur   67.36549771393908
mousqueton had a magnificent livery and enjoyed the satisfaction of which he had been ambitious all his life that of standing behind a gilded carriage   137.3669731175688
in truth murmured d artagnan to whom m   103.76718806567314
everything fell out as mme   191.7274922028102
he committed a crime it is true   10.60891539132841
but what say you to raoul s fancy   54.46237830980285
he he incur danger of death   151.60979094934976
not badly answered i faith said gondy laughing   120.86337771328176
you will win   145.97503280575458
secondly i learned it from beauchamp s journal   155.62424379967376
it is a frightful trick of the husband of our duchess   152.122514272882
the two soldiers who had brought him in took him each by one arm and led him toward the door whilst the prince turning to marshal de grammont seemed to have already forgotten the order he had given   138.683421074889
monte cristo on the contrary took the right hand   129.78050000908513
then the idea struck me that he had not taken these precautions and had simply thrown it in a corner   132.03027164034472
should the king prove a tyrant for power begets tyranny serve love respect royalty that divine right that celestial spark which makes this dust still powerful and holy so that we gentlemen nevertheless of rank and condition are as nothing in comparison with the cold corpse there extended   148.6126484241963
instead of returning then by the saint honore gate d artagnan who had time before him walked around and re entered by the porte richelieu   134.67459301264935
i was giddy that is all   192.4335662095059
come laporte said the queen   65.67126533039894
you told me so just now   97.21392406468229
one moment said the prisoner in french   54.49043913206844
morcerf had expected he should be the guide   72.573475909574
that thou shalt soon know shouted a chorus of horsemen   78.76557154396482
madame de saint méran heard her   104.0352311607026
shall i bring him alone   52.90879393643595
the sensation experienced by franz was evidently not peculiar to himself   107.14481626866552
then going to albert he touched him on the shoulder saying will your excellency please to awaken   62.80545527834579
at the end of twelve days after having made a splendid dinner he reckoned his accounts and found that he had only 50 000 francs left   177.1843493637341
she had already decided upon seeing him and urging his immediate departure when on the very evening of coming to this decision mme   174.8305518328862
he must have written to him   75.48162517640472
and madame de morcerf of the arrival of the count of monte cristo   196.78267696034334
but here is m   125.06499511238123
but what is the matter with you   107.73807159831296
it was with difficulty that de guiche restrained the intense desire he had of breaking the monk s bones   122.24375107774058
do you think athos will be sorry to see us   126.59015082045967
the executioner made a sign and his two assistants leaped from the scaffold and seized him   20.821336234276473
then recollecting the honor you had done me in admitting me to your friendship i hastened to you   85.7350850873775
at what hour does the examination take place   66.29780198224712
for when you meet me again you will perhaps be alone and there will be daylight   139.48557062133517
but that act of self control effective as it was did not escape the eyes of the young princess   149.99324204700125
cried the duke you are so good   165.58821182808623
as the carriage started off the cries were redoubled and more than ten thousand people thronged the quai and overflowed the pont neuf and adjacent streets   85.07663902910448
by circumstances   83.48563360379868
impossible monsieur   89.34231075482961
the two friends remained alone to speak of the future and to build castles in the air   78.52186141159484
i shall take better care of them myself answered d artagnan   93.63271479853856
i sometimes wonder replied athos smiling at that gayety which recalled the good old days that we could form an association of men who would be after twenty years of separation still so closely bound together   158.8321496017868
should dantès not return mercédès might one day be his   69.95683553250223
the count was dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity   184.52790499708317
to yanina   205.2269528203609
i have seen him also said d artagnan   115.83194674307715
d artagnan led away the swiss in spite of lamentations on the part of the hostess who in reality found her heart inclining toward her former lover though she would not have been sorry to give a lesson to that haughty musketeer who had affronted her by the refusal of her hand   130.2192342309341
a terrible idea however rushed into her mind   148.20662344218835
as for me when i have no candle i can t take two steps without knocking against something   119.74909587938977
how can it be otherwise my dear bonacieux   120.94172030480198
oh count what a service you might render me   140.86787293804545
yes but we will talk of it   110.59488674679106
her countenance with surprising mobility had recovered its gracious expression   111.25534262235632
this was the chief of the band luigi vampa   144.6351969983784
as the stranger asked the question he dragged the table beneath the window   50.273457365982686
at length he interrogates me   108.97594747568222
listening to the relation of those emotions so fresh and pure the fine noble face of athos betrayed indescribable pleasure   136.85059838248222
you see continued he glancing toward the grate where fragments of burnt paper fluttered in the flames the letter is destroyed   79.8081857307262
things go wonderfully   103.833320739518
is it not countess   121.82522216222287
when he came within hearing he exclaimed i am pursued   57.6835427749208
hello here is my watch   122.09596260254864
i always said that this cadet from gascony was a well of wisdom murmured athos   109.71243396410797
yes and to hang me   65.10416254903481
help comrades help   89.0249781927258
danglars served together in spain my father in the army and m   209.94337191922392
i have ten left said the man for here are eleven and i had twenty one five more than last year   59.819275261385
no hermine replied debray   98.27853685811556
then opening his coat and unbuttoning his waistcoat displayed his side pierced with a third wound   3.1005069198836708
the host who was not endowed with great perspicacity did not observe the expression which his words had given to the physiognomy of the stranger   96.31305376718603
she did not know whether the abbess was a royalist or a cardinalist   35.1619549313143
murmured the voice   139.9578844893673
and what did you say to her   142.65154506253768
she returned to louise took up the portmanteau which she had placed for a moment on the ground and they reached the archway under the shadow of the wall   38.195249192769836
she wrote two lines sealed the letter with her private seal and gave it to mme   120.83322300625218
but by what means   123.73326630051989
as we have said he perfectly understood the old man s vocabulary and if he did not use it more often it was only indifference and ennui which prevented him from so doing   123.61040332507943
you are quite upset   178.31328422141797
officers who had deserted from the imperial army and joined forces with condé   74.64258843698954
upon that athos yielded   75.28859838506332
well all that was useless   119.52450384219998
although your majesty can bear witness that i have always taken her part warmly even against you   57.28379719489931
we parted from him four days ago and we have reason to believe that he has reached paris before us   68.49464947305603
a carriage was in readiness at the door   148.06179535953714
henceforth we have nothing to fear   103.2407042217531
i understand cried athos with a gentle blush   165.7035817462132
oh you are an angel   231.44369420307345
wait an instant   67.0495806471634
what new calamity   144.0226954708478
have you confidence in me   260.0781487682877
i will go myself and fetch the lemonade   128.9815250670552
really my lord you are his nightmare   133.31255829761545
he is asleep   106.17216511014352
hereafter being able to ask for me at all hours and consequently to take advantage of all opportunities you will probably obtain that which you desire   94.33896391874387
de villefort promise to call on him and i hope the visit will be returned   161.22184806152526
your breakfast shall be waiting   156.37335543798926
she had forced us to accept a little souvenir a magnificent spanish genet and an andalusian mule which were beautiful to look upon   148.1923513492152
at about what time did we see the two swiss guards walking yesterday   36.718055792817964
he died a more wretched hopeless heart broken prisoner than the felons who pay the penalty of their crimes at the galleys of toulon   126.18640670348064
well then listen   114.51432019543613
the victory was complete   82.45032537124482
our dear count   74.81592735051552
as to his title and fortune as to that madame i have made over to him the estate of bragelonne my inheritance which will give him ten thousand francs a year and the title of vicomte   151.28131439265115
we came straight off a journey and are insurgents too   195.33859047961977
a greek   185.3416289833907
and in my opinion death may be a torture but it is not an expiation   96.17573331699612
but d artagnan was not of a character to allow a man to escape him thus who had the insolence to ridicule him   97.83610787468848
yes monsieur replied the mercer in a tremble feeling that it was at this point affairs were likely to become perplexing   69.89787978661414
but what the devil are you about aramis   121.62227696836256
that will be the most sincere line of conduct said mazarin   150.09967414020426
but you know or rather you do not know your excellency that he who is about to commit an assassination fancies that he hears low cries perpetually ringing in his ears   159.71348195148306
he is entirely devoted to the cardinal   32.145150643113865
her maiden name was de servières and her first husband was colonel the marquis of nargonne   13.994601186678167
in fact at the end of the rue vaugirard the gigantic porthos appeared   148.25223462121718
my master has commanded me to be discreet   78.76378221114759
it is only shown to me to terrify me that s all   152.64708441455218
cried the cavalier whom milady had designated as her brother stooping down to the height of the coach window   98.99290361704384
again   117.6589992341587
and your servants too how very well behaved they are   146.7205356671375
oh you know him well my lord it is count de rochefort   113.53972320833385
he saw but one means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his judgment   104.80121768500015
but they had all been pensioned or had passed on to some other employment   168.4422495271003
besides i was so seriously indisposed that i could not in any case have replied to them   123.34249980525196
he expressed to him the fears he entertained with respect to her majesty   173.21723554809296
the day after or two days after his visit to morrel he had disappeared   51.52554740082426
the price agreed upon between the englishman and the genoese builder was forty thousand francs   110.40460154323718
the valet led felton through a large hall in which waited the deputies from la rochelle headed by the prince de soubise and introduced him into a closet where buckingham just out of the bath was finishing his toilet upon which as at all times he bestowed extraordinary attention   148.08276938783862
well my dear duke replied louis xviii   204.8635033126995
but this is infamous   130.57115562111483
well i had promised madame de villefort the loan of my carriage to drive tomorrow to the bois   78.30996236804525
she is a remarkable woman and i only regret that there does not exist another like her about twenty years younger   144.60157041187452
you know one can not change his nature he said   113.34772364689897
and once again embracing his father with convulsive pressure he said be it so my father   151.9317966171304
oh ours is a theological quarrel replied aramis making a sign to d artagnan to keep secret the cause of their duel   124.05539022960407
but still there are some signals only addressed to you   30.24167500661646
take them   115.25322178952888
i will do everything your majesty commands replied d artagnan   144.7043013592788
she caused the unfortunate duke of buckingham to be stabbed by a man who was ere that honest good and pure   48.81999652056934
as he was finishing this work the sound of horses prancing in the yard and the wheels of a carriage shaking his window attracted his attention   167.60968828111643
hey yes thank god i am pretty well said mousqueton   129.23763303492672
pardieu that s true   122.80285646729392
have you any letters for me   140.1454708828383
what is thy name   96.92671133741733
d avrigny s look implied i told you it would be so   128.04425743242825
athos at the same moment moved by a similar impulse looked back also   105.29111876031456
let me be on my guard   205.94495676794287
yes in italy   97.34134400460059
something bright   61.62513381049062
laporte broke the seal and placed the paper before the eyes of the duke   107.53149138390077
yours if you like   53.99610065291976
he could only be traced by the phosphorescent line in his wake   135.5571279393015
the count alone seemed unmoved nay more a slight color seemed striving to rise in his pale cheeks   181.77264303277371
and now my dear child adieu for the present   136.2543832849259
perhaps your love will make me forget all that i do not wish to remember   76.85914815685463
there is no doubt they went thither to fight themselves   104.43656486890568
the word is rather hard   190.1755894038153
you are not an enemy of our holy faith   6.657927160799375
now it never occurred to me to wish for a nearer inspection of these large insects with their long black claws for i always feared to find under their stone wings some little human genius fagged to death with cabals factions and government intrigues   138.29422267354315
a fine and white stocking a silken robe a lace kerchief a pretty slipper on the foot a tasty ribbon on the head do not make an ugly woman pretty but they make a pretty woman beautiful without reckoning the hands which gain by all this   106.95111941233966
the curate related the incident to the count of san felice who sent for the little shepherd made him read and write before him ordered his attendant to let him eat with the domestics and to give him two piastres a month   98.95668784787263
i should think so   99.702390349745
gaspard caderousse rejoined the priest   118.71604180196812
its odor charms one of my senses that is all i can say when i am asked why i praise it   147.3764127187025
yes answered monte cristo happily yes conscience does remain   64.6188256984756
and yet sir you may make me even happier than i am   65.18160696585242
it was an ambuscade   119.86924595684306
the intelligent creature was received with loud applause   169.22492850965
but what can be the matter   134.67524812406214
planchet began to weep   63.780758954525005
is he a deputy   223.20081894266332
gave me some days before he died   203.6644256452521
mercédès raised her eyes to heaven with an expression it would be impossible to describe and tears which had hitherto been restrained now yielded to her emotion and ran down her cheeks   137.93204629944285
the names have been purposely concealed   1.5215537850303065
the old man made a sign in the affirmative   105.6925886032199
but tell me valentine how has it all been effected   121.02862558339899
what then to do   99.76856548940955
without speaking to anyone but yourself   76.02923067071262
milady saw the trouble   146.5061730875935
all the ladies rose and there was a profound silence   82.71804329662999
take the post chaise which you will find waiting at the porte de gênes as you enter nice   162.04821536281628
would it not be safer and more certain if i should ask him his name and tell him yours   78.58927378120399
we have no time to lose in regaining our camp   152.58129089336836
when i live at auteuil you must come there as you belong to my service   151.35884372449
it was now the coadjutor s turn to fix his piercing eyes on louvieres   177.0530000209688
but to whom then   120.2409008912849
it looked so gloomy i should never have bought it if my steward had not taken the matter into his own hands   55.18208017615631
and taking the horse s bit he led the tilbury where it was certainly impossible for anyone to witness the honor that andrea conferred upon him   98.14339282767179
danglars motioned that he had nothing more to say   190.67971195969622
d artagnan gave him playful buffet on the shoulder and as they had reached the station where they were to breakfast the conversation ended there   131.37777752541933
d artagnan rose took his hat as if it had been his intention to obey then opening quickly the door of a large closet instead of that leading to the staircase he buried himself amid the robes and dressing gowns of milady   62.99051747070544
that is why m   38.3521982931851
he knew all objection would be useless and instantly determined how to act   101.1518637540932
yes noirtier   32.58656301045397
besides you have made an eternal friend of madame de villefort   185.04824171931992
the wine you prefer   120.7049193241373
you will guard him well for me   93.67421141860822
the rendezvous the first words that albert uttered to his friend on the following morning contained a request that franz would accompany him on a visit to the count   146.1277479973756
it is exquisite said athos cutting a slice which he placed on the young man s plate   57.50970366241109
previously to which i had been confined for three years in the fortress of fenestrelle   127.47938021492756
the spectators saw the muskets leveled at them and divided between fear and curiosity remained noisy and excited   121.70191372710615
you are poor and your future prospects are dark and gloomy   83.4454669735301
as soon as they had disappeared behind a green curtain sufficiently thick to conceal them from the sight of any one who might be in pursuit they drew up to hold a council together   63.192994032839074
he entered without knocking or giving any other intimation of his presence as if he had been a friend or the master of the place   89.36444117936594
what have we all done then dear grandpapa   117.70359770466317
well then he is a bandit compared to whom the decesaris and the gasparones were mere children   142.60885287712992
he would fain have gazed upon his gold and yet he had not strength enough   90.16821548120969
i don t need the quarter of such a sum i who am still only in the guards and by selling my saddles i shall procure it   113.51431498700387
does it require much study to learn the art of telegraphing   87.16039841428902
valentine was looking at her grandfather with a smile of intense gratitude and villefort was biting his lips with vexation while madame de villefort could not succeed in repressing an inward feeling of joy which in spite of herself appeared in her whole countenance   75.23559475809155
grimaud signified his assent   85.5207985658529
light the candles in my apartment if you please   116.02796771649658
the count had felt the influence of this happiness from the moment he entered the house and he remained silent and pensive forgetting that he was expected to renew the conversation which had ceased after the first salutations had been exchanged   87.47493539652429
everything in her mind was lost for an instant   89.0291293020949
for wherever you see madame herbault you have only to look within a circle of four yards and you will find m   96.08487548614636
i m surprised you have never so much as asked after him   126.74167132104095
they saw a light glimmering in the midst of some trees   169.19864509303792
i know something of him   55.69402492888706
she makes the young look ever forward not behind   131.25693980938445
arriving at the window parry found an unfinished scaffold over which they were nailing a covering of black serge   130.74337908075697
strike me   94.02386649924206
but buckingham did not even turn his head to see what became of those he had knocked down   194.82413659645164
there were benches here and there   58.13038341374857
young as you both are you were perhaps born under the same star and were destined to meet   126.4103396802638
monte cristo remained on the same spot until maximilian was out of sight   122.62789650902648
danglars shuddered   118.26111914845106
should you know those doors again   50.84906368667339
to the committee the adventure was so extraordinary and curious that the interest they had felt for the count s safety became now quite a secondary matter   190.44129823952414
do not refuse this little service   192.37638174127147
besides the harness of your bucephalus and mine   94.11027547384253
the postscript is explicit   95.63593172970388
i have a son too and i should be very wroth with those who detained him from me after a three months voyage   74.20175014243982
how can she be so   91.90158855889266
in a month you will find on the table at which we shall be then sitting good pistols and a delicious draught   118.05874993201493
continued the giant in his quiet manner   86.19560287811501
i think that with a hundred francs a month well   168.24946689087284
it was evident that he had touched the shore   79.72691756670365
at the house of m   154.74424736044233
someone is talking in the street   154.65894072389176
if you are old i will be your son   96.07162098819036
have you not had enough time for reflection during the eight years which have elapsed since this marriage was first discussed between us   124.22658794427818
what is such or such a prince to us who fixed the diadem upon a great queen s head   78.7291247732611
the banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand   57.80757943126693
cried d artagnan and spur for your dear lives   125.06382005580481
the four friends were reunited   128.83425291117138
said château renaud passing his arms through the young captain s   112.4446718984626
when once more in her own apartment anne fell into a chair and wept   98.69573408900054
so much the better for me sir if you speak to me as you say with frankness for then you will do me the honor to esteem the resemblance of our opinions   123.31073062503397
ah she cried what a frightful dream   138.57374532844284
my first care was to run to the door   140.69995861046644
no it passed into mine   82.9737444007825
monte cristo summoned the greek attendant and bade her inquire whether it would be agreeable to her mistress to receive his visit   133.64922471127628
she stretched out her arms to him but they seized hold of her and one of the three none other than the accursed benedetto exclaimed put her to torture and she ll soon tell us where her money is   92.44421117750788
more pale and menacing than athos d artagnan stood on the threshold   54.22593143877466
then he made an exact inventory of everything and placed it in the most conspicuous part of the table after putting aside the books and papers which had collected there   111.27936777202602
the lamp went out for want of oil but she paid no heed to the darkness and dawn came but she knew not that it was day   103.54170120034259
we shall go out all the same   124.19322788509172
at first i certainly did feel somewhat uneasy as to what fernand might be tempted to do   97.9392879171499
said another guard who might have been thought asleep on a bench but who had lost not a syllable of the conversation do you suppose that men can escape their destiny   77.92616243513724
athos nodded affirmatively then turning and monsieur de bragelonne a young man fifteen years of age attached to the prince de condé has he the honor of being known to you   120.84422759697398
don t you say dear d artagnan that it is the queen who has made choice of the convent for her   168.27935183923063
then why instead of tacking so frequently do you not sail nearer the wind   104.85980573958031
in going up to the target morcerf picked up two or three swallows that had been rash enough to come within the range of the count s pistol   109.46231726580585
have you a letter of audience   100.31776077192504
d artagnan did not budge   62.25221370672516
was a villain   176.02226992108004
he took a hundred and fifty men and attempted to go out by the pont du louvre but there he met rochefort and his fifty horsemen attended by more than five hundred men   135.73999580877427
follow wherever he leads you   118.12568217111892
we burn as they say at the game of pincette   124.18448719066994
nevertheless isolated as he was we must say that the duke of buckingham did not experience an instant of fear   155.30739091471258
she has never been so kind before   49.236307856841684
he bolted them both   99.41677796320009
at each moment in the midst of the crowd the buzzing and the laughter the door keeper s voice was heard announcing some name well known in the financial department respected in the army or illustrious in the literary world and which was acknowledged by a slight movement in the different groups   39.983759673369875
in what am i benefited by accompanying my son so far since i now abandon him and allow him to depart alone to the baneful climate of africa   110.19011494113926
he received the travelers with his candlestick in one hand and his cotton nightcap in the other   107.65694377000992
and i have always observed that the devil most obstinate to be expelled is a secret   196.3535096776859
i would willingly have said two words to mordaunt in this little desert   93.84299596345093
do not look i implore you my king   164.23978742791542
advance and give an account of what you are doing here at this hour   162.72258958570842
make yourself easy we are quite alone said andrea   81.25437162123961
they arrived without accident at the rue des fossoyeurs   85.15507054445763
as long as i have known her always   38.88552546798468
have you anything as good to offer me as the two gentlemen who have left us   34.04549316509734
pray tell me is it sympathy of heart   146.80653481698016
it asks if i am ready   70.96046024768648
but the easy chair of the old man was heard rolling along the floor and he soon made his appearance in the room   68.71793143956982
what business had you then to go into the chamber of monsieur d artagnan your neighbor with whom you had a long conference during the day   160.77290031778577
your eminence does not then know where monsieur de beaufort is   47.09148636362268
well my dear friend win it it is at the point of your sword   54.906217190462
do you think it is time for us to enter the service   142.97223931870056
the count had three windows at the rospoli palace   154.8898545632237
nortier gives notice to these gentlemen replied barrois that he will give orders to be carried to the drawing room   69.73542674377555
then they came and boasted of their fine exploit in the cabaret of the next village where my brother and i were drinking   158.73964216044413
oh command and i will obey   98.38895473850886
there ll be firing   92.55229147672665
however he like cæsar borgia knew the value of time   173.09366067025235
said morrel sadly   101.14857757126184
murmured athos in a broken voice   121.87537060479985
but as i have told you it was too late   126.0428471677851
i will pay you two hundred for them said mazarin   79.2249811881278
the cardinal looked then with great impatience for the news from england which would announce to him that buckingham would not come   51.25132109112716
i swear to you i like no better than yourself to meet that viper in my path   137.01817357877678
in his most simple actions as well as in his most secret thoughts i find a relation to my own   108.92389743926651
but he thought of his oath and he would not break it   44.16524470151512
what name did you pronounce then madame de morcerf   170.27947154160344
oh yes monsieur   106.33051349006774
my love my blood my life   72.53418179274097
but as claudius said to hamlet it is a law of nature   192.32695720553988
i landed here regulated the affairs of the vessel and hastened to visit my affianced bride whom i found more lovely than ever   110.57005767644183
but why need this annoy you   111.43760902446232
oh she would like it but but what   148.64998127076018
here is what each of the parties concerned gained by that treaty monsieur de conti received damvilliers and having made his proofs as general he succeeded in remaining a soldier instead of being made cardinal   121.52866209008164
it was however necessary to affect weakness and pain not a very difficult task for so finished an actress as milady   90.97772212734176
well then sleep in peace and put your trust in the lord   87.08516744006938
monte cristo concealed himself behind a large tomb and awaited the arrival of morrel who by degrees approached the tomb now abandoned by spectators and workmen   116.15079572214397
they rode forward and reached abbeville   146.7289728796612
but still her voice involuntarily murmured softly edmond edmond edmond   127.88943356861488
he is going to turn his house into a badhaus as the germans term it   106.55620274274813
and if he gets out of prison he will come and see me the first thing and what would he think if i did not wait here for him   108.94077050840704
i told her of the scaffold   42.90567886055045
somebody he perceived was in the courtyard moving stealthily   134.29288908872326
the countess paused a moment   239.54757110871483
we thought so too monsieur   142.1661565940223
now we are pigmies in comparison   114.72535026272108
privately   194.801610938948
the result was that to prevent mm   8.706812881234882
listen to me franz said albert   166.42327548759283
god bless his majesty   156.57126993822538
cried the cardinal a venetian glass   58.3717053101956
i regret that i ever crossed swords with you porthos   130.49250517158583
who arrested you   87.04690917700194
dessessart   170.7046452308106
oh man man race of crocodiles cried the count extending his clenched hands towards the crowd how well do i recognize you there and that at all times you are worthy of yourselves   113.22086671704113
he was certainly eating and noisily too like an ill bred man   118.07216622770036
sire replied richelieu rest assured that particelli the man to whom your majesty refers has been hanged   127.87717531003844
oh you don t see straight said danglars   111.06589295094226
it was a clear profit of 15 000 francs   116.63595109316445
and pray what do you call such an action   113.00886968885877
and what did the officers do   123.65496687117542
was my mother   54.082298179084766
said andrea you need not be ashamed even though you did post after me   103.51365385085731
i owe you my real good my present happiness   85.67462362465425
his devotion and the compassion he showed for her misfortunes produced the effect they always produce on noble minds mercédès had always had a sincere regard for fernand and this was now strengthened by gratitude   99.43704120977932
in your service excellency where everything is learned   155.35486462704512
i grasped the railings   103.59293017061371
but as the banker had accompanied andrea madame danglars appeared to take no notice of it   160.27346855672857
yes duke yes i know you are very indulgent toward the queen too indulgent perhaps   148.8041266002334
it is i myself   162.73094344108677
say i am condemned sir if you please   100.62031454843533
steps were heard approaching nearer and nearer   114.13489636773099
pray ask me whatever questions you please   133.27904498785568
we are to meet our friends at the hotel at eleven   128.73931035798557
then suddenly how i should like to see all that cried he   85.25205193568628
his best known work is the three graces now in the louvre   174.1260317378176
my profession condemns me to celibacy   185.93359571757532
it really was i whom your excellency expected at seven o clock this evening   158.60049424405477

there was nothing remarkable in the circumstance of a fragment of granite giving way and falling heavily below   147.84484075462058
while the banker was waiting in the anteroom the door opened and a man dressed as an abbé and doubtless more familiar with the house than he was came in and instead of waiting merely bowed passed on to the farther apartments and disappeared   95.27320550673835
said milady to herself   143.20241109127144
then he knelt down made the sign of the cross and lowering his face to the planks as if he would have kissed them said in a low tone in french comte de la fere are you there   31.252329368128827
but they will run against the bottom of the ladder   136.38323064936688
beppo got in inviting the frenchman to follow him and he did not wait to be asked twice   82.95953229427964
and now whenever he wishes well whenever he wishes   98.15569479604085
it was the plan of alexander vi   52.18467106909687
i myself felt a strange kind of fascination at the sight of all this gold and all these bank notes   131.02135474571182
bonacieux when her husband had shut the street door and she found herself alone   179.03255884683716
you have 200 000 livres a year and you prevent her son from enjoying these 200 000 livres   67.06980269901368
the cardinal knows everything   2.661821909440917
yes we are devoted to them repeated porthos   100.76697364592543
shall i see you again   11.95752215920919
we shall soon be well acquainted almost friends   79.43723426031076
remember chimed in la carconte those two could crush you at a single blow   81.76079004768974
thought d artagnan there are so many things his silence would have told me   85.71914495425449
d artagnan rapidly drew his seat nearer to milady s   78.62081442398303
her two paddle wheels were like two wings with which she skimmed the water like a bird   15.233415287212154
then tis i who am mistaken for you have always been a good chronologist   53.63121527686438
and i also know that we have done all that human means afforded to endeavor to get one   154.01056725464258
mazarin started turned toward the comte de la fere and looking for an instant at that grand and honest countenance took the pen   170.1854493809279
those who were in the chariot opened the doors and presented arms   202.3094386593288
and on her affirmative answer being given he conducted her by a private passage to m   93.76942471234459
at the same moment a violent crash was heard and cries of distress   151.84443185912806
and that the men whom god has put above those office holders ministers and kings by giving them a mission to follow out instead of a post to fill i say that they escape your narrow limited field of observation   105.00465145514917
planchet only touched the tips of the count s fingers   73.66036244538955
asked d artagnan drawing more pistoles from his pocket   121.93863742059241
were you present during the last struggle   69.971110814962
it is not only a right but a duty   137.7346796562155
i see no one and yet the ladder didn t come down of itself   109.96683488922982
well then cried d artagnan pray let grimaud search them and throw them over the walls   70.81491710052217
mademoiselle de villefort my step daughter said madame de villefort to monte cristo leaning back on her sofa and motioning towards valentine with her hand   120.72789812827153
he arrives from the army and has he says a letter to remit to you on the part of the marechal de grammont i think   26.11635977547577
tell me truly maximilian whether in former days when our fathers dwelt at marseilles there was ever any misunderstanding between them   121.69292638833267
madame de villefort had no longer any doubt   147.99470197818394
and where is that letter   110.34878991701461
said d artagnan that s settled already   79.40823641448173
lord winter answers for his regiment or at least very nearly so we will not split straws about words let him place himself at the head of his men we will place ourselves at the side of your majesty and we will mow a swath through cromwell s army and reach scotland   36.86032350730646
why he remarked to gaetano you told me that signor sinbad was going to malaga while it seems he is in the direction of porto vecchio   139.11850881138776
the young woman hastened to meet him   128.81055277179712
he is the curate of bethune sir and was carrying the holy vessels belonging to his church and the treasure of the chapter to a safe place the prince having abandoned our town yesterday   143.13920950971314
without it i should be tried in a court of justice because i did not raise the alarm   141.3204049368682
i will give a faithful account of the sum to your lordship said planchet putting the bag under his arm   144.35550573082702
come come you won t tell me you don t know aramis   68.64743064128778
exclaimed monte cristo shuddering   131.54995985893464
since there are two of them already there let us add a third   153.2698033536693
however for my part i would rather die unshriven than have anything to say to such a confessor   117.41968065443106
all at once he raised his head   128.88970414271162
this evening with you to morrow at stuart s the next day with me   1.1600666505184734
for notwithstanding all my sorrows and my tortures i show you today a face which the happiness of revenge makes young again a face you must often have seen in your dreams since your marriage with mercédès my betrothed   137.4382299929423
hope my friend repeated the count   144.9466367506905
i have worn it in my turn and it has sometimes not been disgraced when the hilt was in my hand and the sheath at my side   76.30075990604033
the reader hushed herself instantly   44.70893788170011
it was not poverty which had broken her spirit   111.24415552146166
and the same love for you eh my dear child   48.82767294906828
said franz continuing his investigation   60.35994436338423
still baron said monte cristo family griefs or indeed any other affliction which would crush a man whose child was his only treasure are endurable to a millionaire   113.10482092554668
yes we will wait replied valentine who revived at these words   183.1180249771611
there is no occasion to tell you my lord that the minister knew for a fact that these ornaments had sailed away with the ambassador who was far away beyond seas   48.31574679828044
if we are not we shall have all the time to talk and nobody will hear us for i guarantee the walls of the bastion have no ears   102.2681997120909
for you   39.785764759359566
the two men turned quickly and saw the sickly countenance of la carconte peering between the baluster rails   164.0526455804948
his interlocutor whose head appeared through the carriage window was a woman of from twenty to two and twenty years   113.63173822025894
and they both went into a low room where there were foils gloves masks breastplates and all the accessories for a fencing match   86.5822847490688
i certainly never will get drunk again d artagnan   94.22718649556853
as to d artagnan being at bottom a prudent youth instead of returning home went and dined with the gascon priest who at the time of the distress of the four friends had given them a breakfast of chocolate   65.30702774149964
every one hoped so so that the minister felt that all around him beneath the homage of the courtiers lay a fund of hatred ill disguised by fear and interest   111.85445892605033
and very soon balls were wanting so many had gone over   121.52361181393768
as soon as the enemy are within musket shot we must fire upon them   47.14403449692013
the first thing necessary to render an act valid is that the notary should be thoroughly convinced that he has faithfully interpreted the will and wishes of the person dictating the act   137.30038534338374
he sleeps indeed   59.09283046170978
that is whether you really love me   136.95411406540867
they rode on in this way for ten minutes   122.41365630620845
tell me why does a steward rob his master   167.25699936393258
by its side on her knees and with her head buried in the cushion of an easy chair was valentine trembling and sobbing her hands extended above her head clasped and stiff   121.38050915580877
all my misfortunes arise from my having said nearly what you have said before a woman whom i thought my friend and who betrayed me   47.42980028096643
i guessed all   91.8422312136025
so then they have paid my ransom   73.84681484520917
is there anything else i can assist you in discovering besides the villany of your friends   173.25990748941706
ah that is a good joke   29.90761475686611
adieu gentlemen   187.9568455066642
it was one of the gascon s artifices to hide his deep cunning occasionally under an appearance of rough loyalty   192.52135911182552
luigi slowly relinquished teresa s arm which he had held beneath his own and teresa accompanied by her elegant cavalier took her appointed place with much agitation in the aristocratic quadrille   85.38514064152302
porthos in order to make a greater display had that evening borrowed planchet   56.11465042129604
the diamond is real   79.93172459821625
at last their hilarity calmed down and faith   117.959132469493
athos followed the road for some time his eyes fixed upon the ground   175.72052628879052
i was near him those were his exact words when he stabbed his foe as he said he would and his adversary fell without saying oh   170.45265321977865
oh no never said planchet i will never leave monsieur d artagnan   128.83628942504222
two held poor assunta who unable to conceive that any harm was intended to her smiled in the face of those who were soon to become her executioners   133.18777331082285
i shall hide myself in your cabin   104.85473482085206
at that moment the door opened   77.40305169416092
yes yes i know how good a son you are so now hasten away to see your father   59.815757850047206
he is a little stiff and pompous in his manner and he is disfigured by his uniform   40.31212062462387
there is no situation however terrible it may be which can authorize a creature of god to inflict death upon himself   138.99270420326903
there remains the valise added porthos   227.0226790434147
whose name is danglars   177.22271185385432
he then inquired how they had fared in their trip   84.69673524388023
he must know it this moment and perhaps it is already too late   111.91386498309217
there now whispered the governor it is just as i told you   71.89837588711387
faria who for so long a time had kept silence as to the treasure now perpetually talked of it   213.7806727339534
if at this moment the sweet voice of renée had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy or the fair mercédès had entered and said in the name of god i conjure you to restore me my affianced husband his cold and trembling hands would have signed his release   117.4773774825105
that of informing you beforehand of my coming   107.48528383418733
said he showing d artagnan a place where it had been pierced through   77.63115020505145
i should have liked to have made you the offer of these horses   125.8163975321745
but instead of either of these he saw nothing but a strange face sunburnt and encircled by a beard with eyes brilliant as carbuncles and a smile upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white teeth pointed and sharp as the wolf s or jackal s   94.07585047082131
then she had pushed him away and directed the coachman to stop at the hotel de luynes   83.69456441842303
you always come back to that   104.5440410271647
you heard a private conversation respecting spanish affairs on the expulsion of don carlos   103.52013911280632
the devil he is   102.36954293039838
d artagnan went up to him and whispered in his ear the fact is we that is monsieur du vallon and i hesitated a little   54.58562593510658
you do not speak affectionately to me benedetto my old friend that is not right take care or i may become troublesome   132.0291101011544
he smiles at them   86.42329786793896
do you know monsieur de tréville their captain   65.56455244940825
why it is after one o clock   79.3913891452071
edward the infant phenomenon who is quite an adept in the art of killing   30.903306086860766
and he is in the fort l evêque   123.99297133756579
he descended or rather seemed to descend several steps inhaling the fresh and balmy air like that which may be supposed to reign around the grotto of circe formed from such perfumes as set the mind a dreaming and such fires as burn the very senses   132.57746875856978
d artagnan was amazed to note by what fragile and unknown threads the destinies of nations and the lives of men are suspended   134.11915410660154
and you are happy   108.61018383405093
yes do said the duchess   109.12166822608964
beauchamp bowed and sitting down sir said he i just now accompanied m   93.37071746813382
between these large dishes were smaller ones containing various dainties   86.97846878736884
but on arriving at the kitchen the first thing he saw was his antagonist talking calmly at the step of a heavy carriage drawn by two large norman horses   108.31149224007893
as to the government of normandy replied the queen i think i can promise   156.67326849517238
said d artagnan whose purposes were in conflict with that order that is not so easy since i am on the point of falling and my horse too through fatigue   146.90252265100094
la carconte then entered her chamber the flooring of which creaked beneath her heavy uncertain tread as she proceeded towards her armchair into which she fell as though exhausted   104.51516134226043
why if today before eleven o clock your father has not found someone who will come to his aid he will be compelled at twelve o clock to declare himself a bankrupt   190.84418773585577
he resumed his listening but unfortunately the toilet was finished   136.83383989756558
why should an exception be made in her favor   155.7545002360964
can you not understand that monsieur d artagnan being my friend might take me into his confidence   124.79840149332541
but nothing betrayed a hostile design on carlini s part   106.81668881462605
they will kill him you may be sure of it   104.86682105572721
he freed his weapon made a lunge and touched his adversary on the shoulder   193.07642000203592
a cloud passed over his brow as he said no monsieur i do not know the writing and yet it is tolerably plain   70.7573826325777
but how inquired i am i to maintain myself and my poor sister   125.75389248935896
milady breathed a sigh and opened her eyes   69.83977793045877
three blows were struck upon the panel of the door   182.10291323163284
nothing but saddles   149.81980417393083
the man whom athos had come so far to seek and whom he had found with so much trouble introduced him into his laboratory where he was engaged in fastening together with iron wire the dry bones of a skeleton   82.32541394331855
a red handkerchief encircled his gray head   95.29624959560587
50071m hush my child said monte cristo again placing his finger upon her lips i did say poison and death   182.39550668469008
once again silence   127.3527930696857
as the gascon had foreseen they easily obtained three hundred pistoles on the ring   174.4635008832802
i hope the carnival will not pass without some amends in one shape or the other   95.84298033197861
besides the physician might declare the ailment feigned   71.28875139378341
ten minutes later they heard the rapid gallop of a troop of horsemen   116.07702466384382
at the extremity of the village planchet turned to the left in obedience to the orders of aramis and stopped underneath the window which had light in it   143.3927124800463

she is perhaps dead   112.47129741692893

de tréville was informed that the king was busy and could not receive him at that moment   145.50898868703916
in that case you must be horribly bored and have my sympathy   60.19114277674742
valentine instantly ran down   79.04628246522395

de tréville of women in general did not inspire him with the least suspicion of his pretty hostess   109.13639546933386
i say i want to know why they should put dantès in prison   1.4422431198271113

no merely his testamentary executor   150.56456933874182
what a fine effect that would have produced on the announcement of her marriage   86.75328478593325

porthos was the first to speak   120.74528676522992
but of what value in the world was the reputation of the little wife of a mercer   77.62882694202659
leave me a small supply of biscuit a gun powder and balls to kill the kids or defend myself at need and a pickaxe that i may build a shelter if you delay in coming back for me   147.80486840976968

the valet threw into the carriage his military cloak in which two swords were wrapped and shutting the door he took his seat by the side of the coachman   76.29522261133732
but when in the evening he made his master s bed the chimeras of planchet faded away   69.70220103625834
the one between the pillars on the first tier it seems to have been fitted up entirely afresh   33.65413903025805
they said it was bad money   113.91506950412504
nay nay my good woman make yourself perfectly easy i beg of you   54.74942172930062
i then swore that this woman who had ruined him who was more than his accomplice since she had urged him to the crime should at least share his punishment   82.16449708214371
and now his eminence confirms it   76.88712279231305

then bending again to raoul he whispered above all things do not divulge your name   116.90965700584509
there is a wise latin proverb that is very much in point   158.1640416116141
morrel advanced with a firm manly tread and poor barrois followed him as he best might   84.67498610199796
it is my will morrel   91.20542615905198
come said andrea with sufficient nerve for his servant not to perceive his agitation what do you want   144.9279774013096
the cardinal could not drive from his mind the fear he entertained of his terrible emissary for he comprehended the strange qualities of this woman sometimes a serpent sometimes a lion   58.98667538329427
they are about to send into our court which monsieur de mazarin crosses on his way to the orangery the two guards who attend him   103.52170481717985

courage my friend but above all prudence and think what you owe to the queen   158.6811844849418
he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding and he could not succeed in doing so   105.55723848390421
these words were uttered in a tone which made morrel shudder   180.3811598417837
and madame de villefort two   112.71957677281947
decidedly you are a brave fellow said athos pressing the young man s hand   58.73710275317209

while on the other a purple rose mingled its glowing colors with the luxuriant masses of her hair of which the blackness was so intense that it was tinged with blue   84.48861959813178
cried the procurator s wife in a transport that surprised even herself   61.70799267729497

stop i want to remember his exact words   78.967992487029
and i some lamb chops said porthos   163.30472774026833
but one fights only with equals   131.18105001442103
doubtless said aramis for we not only require to be well served in order to succeed but moreover not to fail   50.8735935601203

at sight of the mustaches and the naked sword the poor devil perceived he had to deal with a man   114.44582857851096
but the count replied that as he was going to the palli theatre the box at the argentina theatre would be lost if they did not profit by it   111.41946108135473
you see we were quite right to pacify that country   54.56879958441599
politeness you simpleton   86.2995153269896
the first time you are often mistaken as to the value of a stone   103.30896106083537
i spoke of them because porthos talked of them himself because he had paraded all these fine things before me   90.97272362373815
then she continued her singing with inexpressible fervor and feeling   106.18262601899409

he was in a court surrounded by high walls   74.55549828189802
de villefort of the impertinence of his servants   77.16727268004789
it is not just that he should despise me so without any reason   125.13454659041359
but i can assure you that i had nothing to do with any such proceeding   80.16024733118942

eugénie bowed not as a submissive daughter but as an adversary prepared for a discussion   90.75555946373173
as to the astute aramis he did not entertain much dread of him   90.57321265436661
and who afterwards sent the cup to me   69.85002878397168
but a moment ago i heard the rumbling of the omnibuses and the tinkling of the bells of the lemonade sellers and now i feel as if i were suddenly transported to the east   128.66578656169182
i know no one now of that name   56.0683298529199

but he could not yet see under this veil   116.38068121904251
because he had boasted that he would perforate the stranger with whom you left him in dispute   87.70717280942138
but when they had finished their harangues not one of them could say so calm remained her face whether or no she had heard them   99.25212229132741
said porthos it appears there s something fresh here   161.37374138700937
by no means replied the count in the most frigid tones   10.117942405524687
the following morning jacopo set sail for marseilles with directions from dantès to join him at the island of monte cristo   87.30641706026124
the general was ready the president informed him that one of the conditions of his introduction was that he should be eternally ignorant of the place of meeting and that he would allow his eyes to be bandaged swearing that he would not endeavor to take off the bandage   186.46487402319565
the siege of la rochelle the siege of la rochelle was one of the great political events of the reign of louis xiii   130.23153498038295
athos saw the movement   108.92887472463578
go to the devil   84.53735356375203
my credit rises by the fall of that of the comte de wardes   98.99957015185237
dantès struck with the sharp end of his pickaxe which entered someway between the interstices   136.96962293043038
nothing can be said   24.16775897927505
now all that is settled do let me see the performance and tell your friend albert not to come any more this evening   71.48949599018614
but bernajoux cried out that it was nothing and rushing blindly upon him absolutely spitted himself upon d artagnan s sword   47.96517424577826
for in a society such as ours satire inflicts a painful and incurable wound   170.66631917191572
this gentleman who is my friend has just escaped from a serious danger continued aramis with unction pointing to d artagnan with his hand and addressing the two ecclesiastics   106.7167465839591
are you not the captain fernand who betrayed sold and murdered his benefactor ali   157.65967924966188
come tell me his name   99.00882646200209
we are out on the king s service   137.4554629196058
perhaps to madame de longueville   189.52309232850692
well take your hat and gloves returned monte cristo   157.53476639225775
there are a lot of things you can do with project gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to project gutenberg™ electronic works   94.83832494307728
but did you not read that i must be alone   129.89486243197464
porthos uttered a deep groan   92.19159513905916
with what   45.558236688735946
she thought she was condemned to set off that very evening   88.10545541966547
we will wait then said morrel   127.56142697676091
in that case porthos will assist us   123.40876579061614
the west wind bore on its moistened gusts the doleful vibration of the three strokes   106.37348420361339
before closing the door he turned around once more and said not a movement not a word   163.07810683321102
addresses to the duke of orleans and to condé were suggested   93.68686790679244
for instance i say to my friends be on a certain day on a certain hour at the other side of the moat with two horses   148.8676525367263
but with what   53.44705009658548
asked all the four friends   69.37176389006746
a cry of surprise ran through the royal assemblage   101.99687726845535
but the count and the blue domino had also disappeared   97.68199955641586
good said d artagnan to himself   106.43661533325132
go on with your affair monsieur cried planchet   124.55958926680208
the night was rapidly approaching   79.77655900615672
i might have handed him over to roman justice which is somewhat expeditious and which would have been particularly so with him   89.5382018844918
while you have been returning hither he will have escaped and we shall never find him   143.96690045775475
are you still bent on departure athos   69.11137485270754
he was concealed in a thicket   114.61954369839444
a person to whom i can refuse nothing has come to demand you   48.15597666401429
he shall go thither   161.60691523858662
d artagnan held onto this idea which from what he had heard was not wanting in probability   187.7377612044295
it is tiresome to be always acting manfred   86.20468955490468
albert seized it and as franz had no reason to suppose it was meant for him he suffered albert to retain it   138.58968920960558
thank you viscount continued the prince laughing and i appoint you from this moment my interpreter   126.78106699250537
that will do said milady   82.20008003448552
never had a first attempt been crowned with more perfect success   149.54392486453492
but how is it he is not already returned   112.49413083396732
i sign my full name for i should be vain if i could suppose that after five years of absence you would remember my initials   125.14968052459975
how old   50.34868332534383
and why you   106.99759348127162
athos emptied at a single draught the glass he held in his hand   146.95194452552022
the palace was surrounded with water but a kind of staircase had been fixed to the lower walls   74.6544212499869
the friendship which united these four men and the need they felt of seeing another three or four times a day whether for dueling business or pleasure caused them to be continually running after one another like shadows   9.761696204935035
a gardener   106.90807714602576
you promise to become one of the lights of the church   87.41852754609457
and five minutes after a boat appeared rowed by four men   121.42024296749724
true said the abbé with a stifled sigh mercédès it was   54.98121320678395
caderousse set the example and attacked the breakfast with good appetite praising each dish he set before his visitor   115.00683749549957
he put it into his pocket   164.07501942561612
mousqueton groaning slipped from his horse his wound not allowing him to keep the saddle   148.2377957373647
and the musketeer rose grumbling took his sword hat pistols and cloak and followed the officer whilst porthos alone and sole possessor of the bed endeavored to follow the good example of falling asleep which his predecessor had set him   182.09213090645608
oh let us hope said aramis that with the help of god and of bazin we shall find something better than that in the larder of the worthy jesuit fathers   132.2132105181316
yes continued the count it was at first arranged in this way   95.46515843271786
for i assure you his power over our household is almost unlimited   63.96285108897311
that is policy   167.7017575478375
whilst his boots similar in color to the hat and gloves confined feet small as those of a boy twelve years old   50.57364249023547
buckingham   131.30451340123508
parry who accompanied him stood behind him   90.37441401722029
i was not so in my youth i was not so on the night of the betrothal when we were all seated around a table in the rue du cours at marseilles   95.5964920833907
but tell me my dear lucien what it is that constitutes a princess   146.4822480445517
stolen away in his infancy either by an enemy of his noble family or by the gypsies   180.7857217524442
the first named malefactor will be mazzolato the second culprit decapitato   118.83865319491633
de tréville the whole assemblage rushed into the cabinet he not thinking to shut the door against anyone and all crowded round the wounded man   79.94606178557876
beauchamp proceeded to relate to the young man who was overwhelmed with shame and grief the following facts   151.56866487796634
d artagnan began to be tired and so did the curate   163.1268104323927
the case had been provided for if marie michon should be threatened with any danger the queen was to send her a prayer book bound in green velvet   53.45067470015073
sire said d artagnan will your majesty permit me to ask you a question   163.17549329338823
possibly madame   111.97969897747092
how old is she   87.28923397265196
so extreme was the surprise of the sailor that he was unable even to thank edmond whose receding figure he continued to gaze after in speechless astonishment   98.25247201589423
to mademoiselle valentine   63.683825737777624
repeat it to me   175.79059730234488
i held a similar project but as i had not nor ever shall have your fruitful vigorous imagination the idea was suggested to me   168.2865003005962
in fact i have rarely seen such excess of impudence   102.95797089940716
i hope that when he sees me leave you he will come out   31.458833683891626
and he went   147.74105063362822
bonacieux eagerly and looking at d artagnan with disquiet   144.85800401867562
we shall descend by the first window in the gallery   85.09984374127487
whether he kept a watch over himself or whether by accident he did not sound the acrimonious chords that in other circumstances had been touched he was tonight like everybody else   112.0279960859435
and fortunately by his own act disembarrassed the government of the fears it had on his account   122.88770722044141
it is not the same with you and me you can not have made the same resolution i have for i have come to warn you that i bid adieu to your house and and to you   162.91552268017094
for they have this morning hanged a spy who confessed that the rochellais were reduced to the leather of their shoes   151.96020654322626
thank you gentlemen replied albert with a smile of indifference   161.6125973902981
in other parts of the forest the light could scarcely penetrate through the foliage and the stems of two old oak trees the refuge of the squirrel startled by the travelers were in deep shadow   74.4443002553831
i was pursued and took refuge in the house next to this where i have been concealed between two mattresses   179.26277887681584
the sergeant of this company a veteran of the spanish wars had recognized porthos his old companion and very soon all those who served under him were placed in possession of startling facts concerning the honor of the ancient musketeers of tréville   177.1782390547299
where is the man who brought the letter   5.060800823431819
ten or twelve persons had been in the secret since six o clock and howsoever great their prudence might be they could not issue the necessary orders for the departure without suspicion being generated   117.32266498368675
come come dear athos confess that you would not be so philosophical if your raoul were to be involved in this affair   68.89774188328406
you say he loves you maximilian   129.23060944250423
a delicious zephyr played along the coasts of the mediterranean and wafted from shore to shore the sweet perfume of plants mingled with the fresh smell of the sea   64.88538817665449
he was standing near the officer and he directed the point of the poniard in such a manner close to la ramee s heart that there could be no doubt in the mind of that individual as to his determination   91.48251587935738
i thought you were angry with me madame   100.020816793916
the two friends sat down to table   106.48012165788187
one of them took his gun by the barrel and used it as he would a club   72.45582156700976
de morcerf whose portrait by gros i will also show you   151.78647540270427
it seemed as if his feet were rooted to the ground and his eyes on the count of morcerf   63.180263451349134
he took care not to do so monsieur   112.94324522990436
tomorrow flame of my life   76.12114096004763
the queen will revenge me gentlemen   23.098879405006798
that was your business   107.11772964688927
but what was clearest in all this was that the true hatred the profound hatred the inveterate hatred of milady was increased by his not having killed her brother in law   57.756463890837445
and what has procured me so flattering a distinction   122.36290054402475
oh shut up   88.76251667092679
but on the other hand there is abundant question of you   147.32559966004794
how much you have need of me cunning rogue   137.19684132201465
i recollect this because the poor devil s death was accompanied by a singular incident   51.477114893593644
has this woman been relating her crimes to you   62.90434327431368
nevertheless it was necessary to finish   149.59952281053518
said the servitor opening the gate   53.596724734684194
nearly one third of the paper had been consumed by the flame   99.90123371311873
viscount said athos to raoul as he entered you will conduct my lord as far as his hotel and permit no one to approach him   84.18120741243672
that is a matter of course my dear m   91.06584560223459
ah monsieur you infuse genuine balm into my blood   167.4192652915754
villefort for it says that if four successive deaths had happened anywhere else than in the house of the king s attorney he would have interested himself somewhat more about it   121.88891011863775
it is not worth the trouble   218.07532186022826
take the gate on the left   93.97756136427833
cried both the children throwing their arms around their father s neck   64.28848091869698
said porthos slowly raising his head and looking at his friends with an air of astonishment i understand english then   48.723576263861
for that purpose i mean to keep you all to myself   104.81558247653071
it s not polite not to reply to friends who ask news of your health   127.82403365576714
but these forces increase as we go higher so that we have a spiral which in defiance of reason rests upon the apex and not on the base   142.24886255260324
said d artagnan not in the slightest degree embarrassed in the role he was playing   80.28862343447699
why if a parisian were to indulge in a quarter of these marks of flattering attention her reputation would be gone forever   164.46805039055852
they shook hands   62.245845148238395
you have robbed you have assassinated   40.413579088235295
i should release broussel   62.6665372435301
he remained motionless and pensive his eyes fixed on the gloomy aperture that was open at his feet   61.79383520670295
there d artagnan was asleep upon a bench   84.89226841010505
i must leave you at ten o clock   155.0362518628552
her womanly pride and her queenly dignity had both been so cruelly offended that she could not come round at the first advance   129.51501860004436
how can i help that my boy   171.1335169727081
but pardieu if you don t calm yourself i will design a second fleur de lis upon one of those pretty cheeks   139.76468524536847
and for the rest stiff and proud   166.92403219113726
well said franz with a sigh do as you please my dear viscount for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation   101.92922425702952
she remembered that almost unlimited promise which the cardinal had given her if she succeeded in her enterprise   146.63161760093473
at once mme   171.5708499019481
you are wrong morrel   99.13764220298492
d artagnan wished that answer might be prompt and favorable   149.97222190777546
on the 4th a yacht will wait for you in the port of bastia it will be called the eurus   94.90514538109412
the general depended much on it   160.40995699526772
you even pointed it out to me in two drafts on the treasury and you were astonished that so valuable a paper did not dazzle my eyes like lightning   56.257144729884374
caderousse terrified looked at the count   138.28517314929937
he will not advance two leagues into the interior of france without being followed tracked and caught like a wild beast   188.6681328651045
exclaimed albert so overcome he could scarcely speak   54.646645509549536
they quickly went downstairs   6.081666595945066
it was impossible in daylight for the impoverished state of the habitation grudging charity had conceded to an unfortunate queen to pass unnoticed by athos aramis and even the englishman   148.72405572765047
and if it be not within a thousand leagues of london attention will be paid to your wishes   104.63797612773796
see to these horses   53.18005475340926
the baroness was astonished   109.09332688807092
you are mistaken my dear viscount   20.586524753367115
and d artagnan passed to the other side of the room with porthos and aramis   38.5996264135739
and then resuming all his presence of mind which had for a moment staggered under this blow and his strength which had failed at the words of the old man he said oh i have saved you once and i will save you a second time   77.03262292256305
it resulted from these antecedents that everyone entered heartily into the purpose for which they met   101.31824812994114
no monsieur replied the young man   92.92011929206247
de tréville s   110.05049748018483
he found her in a charming humor   21.79134425812508
said caderousse shaking his head   46.74743428701595
that is why my dreadful position makes yours appear enviable   122.05187207867932
but i must write   143.08414230738276
you will in turn enter it my dear d épinay for you will soon be numbered as one of the family   96.84713820643334
and one fine morning in better health than ever before he set out for france   129.09776062466187
i am in the vein   35.10739283271924
antoine   121.42973865346158
let me save the last   33.24271011951785
you perceive then that he is not happy   174.67240489864378
does that alarm you   102.87549581114116
and in the middle of a deathlike silence charles calm lofty and with his head still covered sat down again in his arm chair   52.79856076587547
that night then was somewhat riotous as may be imagined   19.747107603832816
he made a sign which i understood but the king s guards must have noticed it and held themselves on guard   110.249625706388
politics has made you laugh at everything and political men have made you disbelieve everything   52.643978774810996
count said he i thank you for your hospitality which i would gladly have enjoyed longer   110.64902004180765
god   166.59262331460155
for was it not your fatal and sanguinary intention to destroy that son of whom m   91.38480101485808
bertuccio who understands hiring windows so well   178.49508951925193
will you let me be killed   160.58038792778132
30041m i am sorry to see observed monte cristo to morrel that i cause no small disturbance in your house   117.5150584688539
the shutters were only opened to admit a minute s air showing the scared face of a footman and immediately afterwards the window would be closed like a gravestone falling on a sepulchre and the neighbors would say to each other in a low voice will there be another funeral today at the procureur s house   98.9420300971867
he then closed the door of the landing   110.93168914538161
mazarin wiped his forehead and looked around him   104.8385934582075
you rely on the usurper s return   96.61445399773154
doctor d avrigny said barrois staggering as if he would fall   103.72424280175031
oh that is very good indeed it is very good   145.18404476516662
in this frame of mind grateful for the accidental meeting with planchet pleased with himself d artagnan reached notre dame   152.38312676359914
i know not what we shall do yet but four determined men can do much   163.3593651299818
well on my word of honor i answered no   158.18933887584964
come in here said d avrigny and he took him into the chamber where the sick man lay   132.06486215241577
live maximilian and i will be yours   75.93868371459445
dame nanette look for those apricots which madame de longueville sent to us yesterday from noisy and give half a dozen of them to your son with a crust of new bread   103.0429182691761
steps were distinctly heard in the corridor and on the stairs   166.16191630536946
you can turn their suspicions and save my life   124.26967263941305
as for me i will fly only on condition that we all fly together   102.3313505481156
the sellers of moccoletti entered on the scene   83.02560978703042
among my friends of other times   92.11750980627261
money if you have any   75.69919242438536
athos bowed   198.98806707445988
but as for me i accuse nobody   178.51751808771527
gentlemen said andrea commanding silence by his voice and manner   59.09913973353332
which was the real delinquent   145.41131198915878
his bright eyes kindled and his mouth so finely formed assumed a wicked smile   112.7047706124164
and yours monsieur d herblay   90.75779989376025
laporte placed the king dressed as he was in the bed and then covered him as far as the shoulders with the sheet   34.35046198491224

the host again assured them they might rely on him and that their wishes should be attended to   112.65855704992202
you are aware from whom i come   166.7324089742488
the first time he broke my arm   70.04381010656203
excellently athos but what are you looking for   163.00049775814074
my dear fellow don t speak like that of monsieur groslow   69.34280730733241
when albert returned to his mother he found her in the boudoir reclining in a large velvet armchair the whole room so obscure that only the shining spangle fastened here and there to the drapery and the angles of the gilded frames of the pictures showed with some degree of brightness in the gloom   83.31119215528607
in fact it required all the courage which he concealed beneath his elegant form and polished manners to bear him so far   120.15527638193707
he then motioned to his wife to take leave   76.75305558158378
at madame de villefort s proposition he instantly winked his eyes   76.43541411633262
speak speak in heaven s name   131.77185868425548
laporte said the queen suppose you put one of your sons in the king s place   98.4728312388409
your horse seven against eight   104.1578067444935
but do not speak and do not listen   129.62126657396868
a cloud passed over danglars brow   122.6659395833464
he found his carriage at the door and doing his utmost to restrain his anger he went at once to find beauchamp who was in his office   155.68993061543682
from the queen replied the servant   121.96484063352608
i am highly flattered returned beauchamp   137.42240212479848
you knew me once   165.35281952006432
let me conduct your business and my own   79.31852732683086
but since you believe i act for my own account adieu my dear friend get out of the affair as best you may   107.13193045597758
the gascon therefore instead of answering growled out ja   63.90136546077817
let me see this diamond again replied the jeweller   118.14267616728215
but still if albert be not so rich as mademoiselle danglars said the count you must allow that he has a fine name   107.69179420636374
he brought away with him a treasure of pious thoughts to which the mad gayety of the maskers would have been profanation   158.97571742529112
d artagnan who had fixed on his color beforehand had only to select the shade and looked in his chestnut suit exactly like a retired sugar dealer   89.72083276568496
a comfortable habitation although abandoned for a long time without reckoning the furniture which although old is yet valuable now that old things are so much sought after   184.07821691917258
it was the date of that strange adventure interrupted madame de chevreuse   183.1368293609011
suddenly d artagnan touched something warm which moved   125.91527585513114
the latter continued in thought   57.22642438189441
you are a man of the world are you not   159.36003213474447
poor count   181.1020637829273
my letter of recommendation   76.71000146381814
an englishman you say   229.19478555816534
to what do you refer   126.2343025866317
they breakfasted with a good appetite looking now and then at poor raoul who with moist eyes and a full heart scarcely ate at all   82.22536693277284
at that moment the two friends reached the hotel arms of england where they supped with hearty appetite and then at once proceeded to the port   135.78910453814748
many a time nevertheless during the evening she despaired of fate and of herself   120.26066644555384
the counsels of so prudent a man as yourself ought certainly to be available   132.14246837366545
the seventh he let it remain upraised   51.20039518273339
villefort ran upstairs without saying a word   110.13398248527814
and looking attentively around him to see if he had left any of his keys in his closets mazarin went out   46.09198798211749
dentro la testa   77.1875635856149
the woman followed him and lord de winter did not appear   126.51469850535312
albert and beauchamp looked at each other   184.08100168346775
two hours thus glided away   20.071437758901595
he stopped a moment in the anteroom as if hesitating whether to turn to his own apartment or into madame de saint méran s   126.57571604438833
no said danglars no decidedly no   133.54127210837623
i will take him for judge in his own cause monsieur and will believe what he will say   142.2455289124524
have you been long in the orangery   158.23140587433946
inquired caderousse frowningly of danglars who had assumed an air of utter surprise   83.38786389003104
so d artagnan resumed you will not become a partisan of mazarin s   131.43641477810132
i swear that i would give the last drop of my blood and the last fragment of my limbs to preserve the friendship of such a friend as you athos of such a man as you aramis   119.857429058062
de villefort would stifle the affair   63.41677184498941
are the oars in the boat   138.91060207636426
because you are a coward planchet   152.64669079659012
i will manage the master   69.09489319165341
and porthos enchanted at having relieved his mind rejoined mousqueton and they disappeared around an angle of the street   123.71662787833698
an enemy   88.99953248790243
or dreamed he was and awoke mad   113.74922446929915
are you sure albert   71.98807154485127
oh i think you swore eugénie   261.9781862668393
the request was needless   121.65356010027017
the unknown day for which dantès had so eagerly and impatiently waited with open eyes again dawned   63.57236595460863
0065m as danglars approached the disappointed lover he cast on him a look of deep meaning while fernand as he slowly paced behind the happy pair who seemed in their own unmixed content to have entirely forgotten that such a being as himself existed was pale and abstracted   128.0723858116707
had the old man s face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less emotion at this news than was now to be traced there   193.5883786308575
it was very evident that something desperate was passing in the old man s mind for a cry of anger and grief rose in his throat and not being able to find vent in utterance appeared almost to choke him for his face and lips turned quite purple with the struggle   84.10702792829207
but he is mistaken   162.41747056330343
said danglars i ll take your bet   115.96982096008239
danglars is my banker   118.07496264950561
what shall i do with albert   131.08059211449097
i had risked my life and favor to see you but for a second   97.9005488538991
ten years and five as a supernumerary make fifteen   68.25523916851813
bonacieux remained standing mute motionless and pale as a statue   48.95981605249372
did he speak in your hearing   195.63554399342158
he named to guiche the people whom he had seen there   183.49709406966605
i have sent grimaud to dammartin said aramis   104.45320506286862
but the others said the queen who clung to this last hope as a shipwrecked man clings to the hull of his vessel   161.73110737368074
this day he did not leave the house but returned to his office   152.68224271490143
someone must be sent to the duke   163.54325057294383
you come to demand money of me of a musketeer   102.19266803741381
unfortunately he was in a bad vein   91.66105491789813
the day was as gay as the preceding one perhaps even more animated and noisy   85.96143262511565
my sporting dogs consist of two pointers two harriers and two setters   100.39102579116457
you live alone then   215.19881208151804
two persons passed near me allow me to conceal their names for the present   160.22055062362534
the total amount was found to be as m   87.08584008407641
that is a different thing   96.24900455681266
this wound   78.18119541597983
such songs disturb the mind   131.15243927070995
certes if the knife had been left in her power she would now have thought not of killing herself but of killing the baron   163.19882131416767
time passed on and the two young people had agreed to be married when vampa should be twenty and teresa nineteen years of age   170.16486294186308
athos and d artagnan watched their approach from the window   78.41520846584622
i saw a woman knocking at the window of one of my friends   88.76430629973385
thought i that looks like my handiwork   64.033599511022
is that possible my god   98.62271487009981
we ought not therefore i think to act toward a queen so illustrious as your majesty as we should act toward a woman of our lowlier condition   164.45542487954197
he found kitty at the gate and as on the preceding evening went up to her chamber   68.02492494471524
these three yeses had been pronounced by athos each with a sadder intonation   84.80674318279927
then the same steps she had heard approach slowly withdrew as if with regret   121.23072504266288
no no friend replied the doctor you will soon cease to suffer   125.07227396126835
good again   166.0751833879812
franz followed albert with his eyes and saw him mount the first step   104.28505721592764
do you still fence well   112.80061986607913
i say that it was you who desired me to drink it   164.34208437802445
the duke was at windsor hunting with the king   85.12532031176369
explain yourself pray   80.6665441602011
i have but one word to add and that is to propose an example to you not mine for i myself have never appeared at court and have only taken part in religious wars as a volunteer   105.02842616427775
it is an algebraic axiom which makes us proceed from a known to an unknown quantity and not from an unknown to a known   186.66533870092974
you can not for a moment imagine d artagnan that i would commit such an offense toward the unknown giver interrupted d artagnan   121.9071683534056
danglars leaped from his chair and raised his eyes and arms towards heaven   69.65546160821415
my heart told me what your mouth has just confirmed that is to say with what view you have exposed yourself to the dangers of a sea so perilous or at least so troublesome at this moment and i sent my cutter to meet you   142.53365478318747
before she went to bed she had pondered analyzed turned on all sides examined on all points the words the steps the gestures the signs and even the silence of her interlocutors   85.17029434524176
in fact the blood was rushing to the young girl s head already her cheeks were becoming red   128.970091261227
no one commits crimes here   31.496270044313633
and on these two occasions it was to one fatal genius sent doubtlessly by the lord to combat her that she has succumbed   75.32613263860307
why do you like that best   120.29860949033382
that s well said cried the king who had heard all these compliments through the open door   15.055398352299392
ah good morning my dear count said he   86.84119617007244
i mean that they have killed an enemy which is a very different thing returned the captain   143.16816186486753
the prisoners therefore had remained silent as they marched along in company with their conquerors which they could do with the less difficulty since each of them had occupation enough in answering his own thoughts   23.564221220191186
gentlemen interrupted albert i think you did not understand that something very serious had passed between m   136.60092734235317
but she stood in need of a little silence and quiet to give all her ideas as yet confused a distinct form and a regular plan   171.39768461085458
that i can have nothing to say to a man who does not keep his word   179.26972628781897
i heard it from the mouth of the messenger himself   132.5088376510351
it must be with my title deeds   121.10664463471069
as she uttered that bon mot she arose and asked for her carriage   184.23338325950817
president he said in a clear voice but i see you are going to adopt a course of questions through which i can not follow you   78.78744240168879
it is impossible said comminges   50.08572383921042
these two women gave him more uneasiness than the war with spain the quarrel with england or the embarrassment of the finances   120.21093762874268
of having conspired to aid the emperor s return   174.78065629966343
that knife was for you my lad   65.84821858004804
do you wish this frightful secret to remain with us   197.25174478656447
you wish to speak to me alone   191.6465795756278
but it seemed impossible to procure it and here it is   23.869662286388504
gaetano consulted with his companions and after five minutes discussion a manœuvre was executed which caused the vessel to tack about they returned the way they had come and in a few minutes the fire disappeared hidden by an elevation of the land   75.70637215463393
the cardinal as it appears pursues her and persecutes her more than ever   160.25850625591295
morrel has promised him the thing   118.7049402670162
they ordered the driver to take them to no   145.99037313575633
i fully appreciate his delicacy said andrea cramming the notes hastily into his pocket   142.5894865000936
i do not wish to be left alone   151.9606442301129
i know full well that you don t turn your back to yours   111.6950760279906
if it were so with m   56.51084307768332
the lackeys followed   105.81607296889192
how can you doubt it   130.13615966400397
i know so many men already   122.5245885752937
could you have believed such a thing possible   43.36980985460451
a cavalier richly dressed was close to the door   158.8334857064729
said felton looking at those beautiful hands and shaking his head sorrowfully   236.53320923753796
and he went out as he came in whistling the self same air   101.98346508537605
unfortunately said the governor i know beforehand what you are about to say   127.70532946878765
demanded the inspector   169.90749718466856
and this one had his said d artagnan   96.1046943468711
neat remarked d artagnan   151.54614815350672
the sword of the eternal is too heavy for my arm   85.83839058146725
the door opened but before it could be closed the lady exclaimed oh lucien oh my friend   164.08468410670076
are you afraid for your young raoul   73.19092578065064
but as he was searched for after this emeute he disappeared   76.38235639646072
you forget count that i have often told you of the deep interest my mother takes in you   105.34331760008239
cried d artagnan not in the least   150.12178963849365
my dear athos i have reflected on your arguments and i am convinced   198.7238288241602
have you had another fall at the bourse   55.61913991725782
there s not a day sir that we don t expect to hear that you were made marshal either instead of monsieur de gassion or of monsieur de bassompierre   125.39890263942272
they will therein find portraits penciled by the hand of a master   118.45245129500613
eight days after i was back again madame   152.55015937673875
as they believe that i go in consequence of an order from the cardinal no one will believe you anxious to follow me   152.295169559331
debray with the air of a man familiar with the house entered first into the court threw his bridle into the hands of a footman and returned to the door to receive madame danglars to whom he offered his arm to conduct her to her apartments   132.48398182632255
seventeen months captivity to a sailor accustomed to the boundless ocean is a worse punishment than human crime ever merited   68.15325012474518
from the audience   137.14032268075175
but sir once more i beg pardon   142.17563394534096
in that case i am the man you have to do with   37.742882115159475
have you still that devouring thirst which can only be appeased in the grave   68.07768158778534
so far from it madame he was too proud of your prudence and above all of your love   79.36129913577103
the baroness became enraged   52.9498115261473
the remains of poor renée were already deposited there and now after ten years of separation her father and mother were to be reunited with her   154.14570503729607
to make your will   125.03857618546894
the valet de chambre had received orders to usher him in at once   68.6762884254342
certainly said monte cristo slightly shrugging his shoulders   110.09300167362768
to speak seemed like violating the silence of the tomb   227.64717480015815
but meanwhile caderousse who had never taken his eyes off his companion passed his hand behind his back and opened a long spanish knife which he always carried with him to be ready in case of need   125.09340899174589
during the war with spain he was employed in the commissariat of the french army and made a fortune   103.94246393524315
now then go go in the name of heaven   98.13652148324182
does he speak to you of this conspiracy   111.64641435581464
in the evening lord de winter accompanied the supper   138.15385968771295
some madman or fool bent upon ruining himself as fast as he can actually sent his steward to me to purchase them at any cost   149.96994210710395
his father died poor despairing almost doubtful of providence   122.03680273118779
above the room in which debray had been dividing two millions and a half with madame danglars was another inhabited by persons who have played too prominent a part in the incidents we have related for their appearance not to create some interest   112.12077160760411
de chevreuse and consequently the queen   121.67143978096374
it would not be long before i should be training dogs to say that there were greater traitors in france than the cardinal mazarin   148.15846883769387
do you promise me to make what use you can of the report of the fortune m   103.65581227232396
i wish continued mazarin finishing as it were the speech this sudden movement of the queen had cut   86.75821406988895
the sigh woke the king so lightly did he sleep   131.9639961432445
he will want a crown an el dorado and potosí   117.6742183814981
i hate you all but not equally   122.33267132761569
you must pardon him my lord said la ramee for i directed him to come   112.13355162860533
it appears that since the death of the marquis which affected her very deeply she has not completely recovered her reason   120.38155216829982
but he had not been mistaken the appointment was for ten o clock   12.997411833205547
what can we say to mazarin   95.48389629045182
i will candidly explain the reason of both and i trust to your goodness to pardon me   99.23151419366002
but i swear to you by the memory of my brother whom i have loved so much that your accomplice is not saved   65.53606310359712
i must meet him with a heart at ease and that quiet conscience which a man needs when his own arm must save his life   146.43710524585873
do you go and i will stay and take care of the wounded man   61.98608030712162
but at the moment the glass touched her lips her hand remained suspended   70.04556052387238
he ill treated you then   103.44532878272396
you said just now that you had a hundred friends   194.89913336860377
asked morrel while d avrigny looked inquiringly   148.13967652263554
but to every interrogation which they put to him he bowed without response   43.786660088798456
i saw a shadow rise and at the same time a flash of light   126.50693172298186
for the last ten months my ministers have redoubled their vigilance in order to watch the shore of the mediterranean   25.500259069259883
he is a proud soul he is a man by himself   115.32884422692216
asked scarron   49.50619753298945
lying behind the tent of lord leven i raised it and saw all heard all   112.16433946613516
all the ties which attach him to life break in the hand of man particularly the golden ties   109.14291963151565
did you ever suffer from a strain athos   122.13910872957368
i have told you to hope said the count   49.527554705079815
we were able to prove the contrary and that proof we are ready to give to your majesty calling in support of it the august widow weeping in the louvre where your royal munificence has provided for her a home   201.46621014120439
asked the dragoon who had approached during the reading   111.04723774397971
fall voluntarily into my arms hypocritical and dangerous woman said d artagnan likewise to himself after having abused me with such effrontery and afterward i will laugh at you with him whom you wish me to kill   70.08235478916734
interrupted athos   82.54870501308132
athos alone from time to time raised his expansive brow   25.794164189499526
giovanni obeyed   128.02595764330394

i never thought of bringing you bad news   244.96253170558998
said the marquis   126.60425252896098
that is a serious matter and we will not discuss it here   103.87453870906455
gaetano had only seen the vessel from a distance he had not then spoken to anyone   96.2547588430946
at this point i have to accuse myself of a fault madame   57.840137589900564
believe me nothing is more fallacious than to form any estimate of the degree of intimacy you may suppose existing among persons by the familiar terms they seem upon   106.82061423460608
lord de winter died without revealing anything to his brother   94.57229623327267
time was getting on however and franz deemed it advisable to awaken albert   65.47345806825469
there is a crown for the annoyance we have caused you   69.80829276563534
de villefort towards his own relations i ought to have denounced him to the authorities   160.09680788207297
madame de villefort acknowledged the salutation with one of her most gracious smiles   116.35813899465394
suppose the queen should refuse to ratify it   22.679617049724968
valentine summoned every effort and breathed with that regular respiration which announces tranquil sleep   98.37897771672664
she practiced all the evening and then went to bed replied mademoiselle cornélie   189.10005747533762
peppino said the brigand chief give me the torch   129.44313982337775
close to him dressed in entirely new clothes advanced smilingly count andrea cavalcanti the dutiful son whom we also know   82.89823160339196
monte cristo on the contrary preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor aided by a certain degree of simplicity he could assume at pleasure and thus possessed the advantage   121.84009429356072
what a pity it is there were only four like this in the cellar   133.5424913857939
undeceive yourself monsieur replied monte cristo   115.10907695660404
do not let her flee from your embrace   46.65824402016419
he said yes and he put his hand on his sword   119.63781040946832
charles clasped his hands amazed and stupefied to find that these foreigners without other motive than that which their conscience imposed on them thus combated the will of a people and the destiny of a king   186.27491346626786
it is well said he kissing it   115.3769127032916
and then to be here so young   164.49562189861555
as we used to say when we said good bye to each other in the late cardinal s time   100.88329502311066
indeed often since misfortune has left me i have longed for the delights of an eternal sleep   123.66188490403636
noirtier and retired   33.157372265766256
well then family affairs perhaps   131.90188114234078
the guests in the house in the rue du helder where albert had invited the count of monte cristo everything was being prepared on the morning of the 21st of may to do honor to the occasion   101.59718382876275
and thus to accuse yourself is to deserve pardon   85.77976102435164
at the noise they made she in overturning the furniture in her efforts to get at him he in screening himself behind the furniture to keep out of her reach kitty opened the door   123.76615166549739
hereafter perhaps i shall have the right of giving myself   183.94063160449818
over head and ears   56.52045380560748
asked albert astonished   22.106352117172875
yes for time presses   157.27422551613412
and i forgot i had a daughter   117.1141855003137
my friend said gondy you seem to be a clever and a thoughtful man   118.30028138413668
we have only one monthyon prize   102.98194662702625
who told you we were intimate maximilian   154.95824893696866
in fact the evening after this conversation the report was circulated that the prince de condé had arrived   87.8091779008668
i have found a better remedy for my grief than either a bullet or a knife   110.45746714105275
dantès had spoken of mercédès and villefort instantly recognized her   169.4759873102309
that workmanship is divine   74.18149664727198
my darling   96.71700767321647
i am going down by the window in order to be there the sooner cried d artagnan   49.077426746343264
grimaud followed athos   96.09392959537895
madame replied villefort you know that i am no hypocrite or at least that i never deceive without a reason   117.08681660488251
it will break my resolutions   149.9921034805807
pray let me know what it is you have discovered   57.44292985468865
said aramis to athos   131.11233159252976
but whilst they were indulging in extravagant joy at the palais royal to increase the hilarity of the queen mazarin a man of sense and whose fear moreover gave him foresight lost no time in making idle and dangerous jokes   124.68861553114172
oh the devil   72.35144120637844
how did your father receive him albert   172.7084850846968
i should think so but not without difficulty   131.52981508905003
de chatillon opened his arms and fell back on the crupper of his horse   86.76363207478526
my dear said villefort in answer to his wife you know i have never been accustomed to play the patriarch in my family nor have i ever considered that the fate of a universe was to be decided by my nod   78.82316379933289
you suspect me monsieur de rochefort   42.53455848017926
as for mademoiselle eugénie she scarcely vouchsafed to waste the glances of her large black eyes even upon the business of the stage   24.474737234634674
at the sixtieth minute of this hour if the money is not forthcoming he blows out the prisoner s brains with a pistol shot or plants his dagger in his heart and that settles the account   69.93855691627837
he is pursued   148.78609617402478
he went away thoughtful and anxious and returned to his own room where he summoned bernouin and desired him to fetch thither in the morning the special guard he had placed over monsieur de beaufort and to awaken him whenever he should arrive   174.97162986743314
there is porthos s purse too   125.85007267965351
from a distance resounded deadened however by good shutters the songs of the tipplers enjoying themselves in the cabarets scattered along the plain   134.95791083571697
if you yield him dead all will indeed be at an end my lord but quite otherwise than you mean   129.01792323971048
for fear that anyone should be observing her return she walked slowly   171.57178597495718
trial it was a stormy and dark night   147.30519712045128
asked charles   80.44854827396274
the crowd gave place the barricade was opened and the marshal with the remnant of his company retreated preceded by friquet and his bandits some of them making a presence of beating drums and others imitating the sound of the trumpet   124.01665452722497
five minutes later the carriage stopped having reached cours la reine   195.26991689767974
what s the matter now   83.25480691474746
valentine said the count summon up all your courage   111.89398195583799
i wish to say that i am tired of a shepherd s life was vampa s reply   221.26256782286237
in crossing the principal street in derby the four friends perceived blaisois standing in the doorway of a handsome house   126.0636873382017
at this moment the boat came to a landing with a violent shock   101.3748226101585
judge not rashly says the gospel replied the cardinal   66.46163113995115
but remember also that if by your fault any evil happens to d artagnan i will find you wherever you may be for the purpose of ripping up your belly   126.50516245634367
come at dinnertime   161.4846830407759
bonacieux darting to the window can it be he   118.14179441400647
now said aramis you will please to understand gentlemen that bazin alone can carry this letter to tours   177.1115483579996
the days when such distinctions were so nicely weighed and considered no longer exist in france and the first families of the monarchy have intermarried with those of the empire   71.0370962356961
can we count upon you   157.45430784209566
it seems to make one feverish and to raise one s pulse to ninety beats a minute until the deed is done   68.73292001364393
soon said haydée we halted on our march and found ourselves on the borders of a lake   107.29256828112271
and two paces farther is the grave in which he had just buried his child   175.60653058357252
and yet he did not wish to be at paris when the count was there   116.32539653013421
i could only utter inarticulate sounds and irresistible faintness came over me   70.25831627037331
said the dragoon   82.21555408893443
monsieur de comminges he said   140.36260705756735
the shudder of the three musketeers showed to d artagnan that his words began to make some impression on them   145.3378754656021
ideas were but the germ the plan was reality   159.17267778527437
but let us go in and see more clearly what is to be done   156.28250172794984
he was calm   144.39106906466375
no sire but i say that he deceives himself   16.51154743478196
yes very well   75.98880568036307
he stopped at the door   96.32097773072971
de morcerf count said he you have said that the vizier of yanina confided his wife and daughter to your care   83.64550006898736
and now said the duke raising it still six inches higher jump for the king   140.33156066711362
i know the world is a drawing room from which we must retire politely and honestly   125.98065841919171
were you afraid raoul   154.534000604102
he is well educated   177.47025958727244
athos was calm and grave but aramis was furious   116.40311788539064
permit me then my dear athos without inquiring further about our friend to pay my respects to m   138.59143375450654
danglars dined with me   148.02644700420745
still another obstacle murmured mme   89.23422977659646
it is as i have the honor to relate it to your majesty   133.56564038944794
while madame de villefort remained rooted to the spot like a statue of terror and villefort with his head hidden in the bedclothes saw nothing around him d avrigny approached the window that he might the better examine the contents of the glass and dipping the tip of his finger in tasted it   200.77912233862634
but d artagnan seized the moment at which in this movement the sword of bernajoux deviated from the line   140.4295814720246
the executioner of lille the executioner of lille   134.57158192793432
he would have been free and happy with mercédès and his father whereas he was now confined in the château d if that impregnable fortress ignorant of the future destiny of his father and mercédès   127.27822459700053
perfectly well my good friend   75.11396038456525
in a second de guiche had sprung before him and barred his passage   167.75237254500053
it must be seen to be believed   79.94579059261872
if there s any fighting where i m going must i fight   170.56849663147494
the two arms fell with a sudden force   70.92987299944426
and now my good friend said d artagnan to him i must invite you to deprive yourself for my sake of your hat and cloak   75.48697900655941
put the army in battle array and face the enemy   84.73014905792272
the servant entered just as he had finished   176.28202976033663
the more melancholy because those engaged in it knew not for whom they were fighting   76.29213087466292
they did not kill her and that s a comfort   72.90443475984989
there was a very simple means of satisfying himself whither mme   85.23111939375104
let him follow me   169.54093187197657
and you did not know that it was inhabited by a young man   67.87204728954191
and you serve the party of those who maltreat your wife and insult your queen   92.15204448889943
who asked for me   104.31443486426923
stop a moment cried d artagnan   79.77808134350386
mademoiselle said eugénie let the porter get the post chaise from the coach house and fetch some post horses from the hotel   88.19192883544068
but you have never told me that you did not love me   96.50763221340247
directly i have given my card to the count who has promised to pay us a visit at rue meslay no   129.2857509852652
it is growing dark and there may be some mistake   29.79815134159334
arriving before the inn at which his master and himself had made such an enormous repast he approached athos and said showing him the airhole of the cellar sausages   84.55040357007823
has he not a son a young man a relative a nephew of whom comminges spoke to me as being a brave boy and who with monsieur de chatillon brought the standards from lens   74.4964594943306
these verses were not excellent very far from it   128.54120516538887
and he burst into a hoarse laugh   152.00768698321158
i have seen him   53.03411181863269
de villefort had long since had a tomb prepared for the reception of his family   90.37447643389949
in the large room of the hotel a small table was placed for him and a large one for the officers   88.96482454658491
but what would be the use of living eighteen hundred years after lucullus if we can do no better than he could   114.74482840900393
take my advice and set out this evening   133.49997543716677
kitty   144.06797564580026
you save the lives of ladies of high rank and beauty   41.25989022874039
count for yourself   197.01221450542067
but i can not accept the offer of anyone of these gentlemen since my habitation is already prepared   36.78604767397053
the count filled one glass but in the other he only poured a few drops of the ruby colored liquid   79.01314493147369
the traveller alighted ordered a good dinner and inquired the address of the house of thomson french which was immediately given to him as it was one of the most celebrated in rome   139.402785446597
no monsieur it is impossible   122.45366445070651
more worthy than any one in paris my dear friend   77.29325970564241
no part of the programme differed the names of the condemned persons their crimes and mode of punishment all agreed with his previous information   123.99604123019047
he resolved this time to know with whom he had to deal and fell upon the body of his comrade as if he were dead   168.0430053265551
but like the miser in the fable he could not sleep for thinking of his treasure   213.41178927279887
i will undertake to divert him replied the count   28.656163728493937
d artagnan however who had consulted with aramis spoke to the poor wretch   110.30267129384714
on the evening of the day on which valentine had learned of the flight of eugénie and the arrest of benedetto villefort having retired as well as noirtier and d avrigny her thoughts wandered in a confused maze alternately reviewing her own situation and the events she had just heard   93.0546676708237
it is only by comparing the pains of actual being with the joys of the assumed existence that you would desire to live no longer but to dream thus forever   149.09290932573174
you pity me little one   64.8125186387663
as franz had sufficient time and his apartments at rome were not yet available he accepted the proposition   78.84992102993198
i shall not do so   103.34628934572677
the coachman entered and traversed the half circle without slackening his speed and the gates were closed ere the wheels had ceased to sound on the gravel   112.48105060565831
do you hear him valentine   166.64836498823757
the belfry of st   176.89153366574607

but then to be able to instruct her child continued the abbé she must have received an education herself   135.82611936436678
andrea seized the certificate of his father s marriage and his own baptismal register and after having opened them with all the eagerness which might be expected under the circumstances he read them with a facility which proved that he was accustomed to similar documents and with an expression which plainly denoted an unusual interest in the contents   141.40932189675337
the carriage was prepared according to orders and stepping lightly into it the count drove off at his usual rapid pace   190.82693907365058
faria then drew forth from his hiding place three or four rolls of linen laid one over the other like folds of papyrus   180.40779607979704
he obeyed not without some uneasiness which momentarily increasing caused his mind instead of being as unoccupied as it was when he began his journey to fill with ideas which were very likely to keep a traveller awake more especially one in such a situation as danglars   114.00052796628627
and certainly he must have had a most wonderful escape   71.16933827675075
then they departed without knowing whether they would ever see each other again   118.12059778770659
you know not the subject of their conversation   193.08644250534067

but you are no longer our masters   178.23183459868412

the inspector visited one after another the cells and dungeons of several of the prisoners whose good behavior or stupidity recommended them to the clemency of the government   193.05526003313463
in 1807 a month before i was arrested and a fortnight after the death of the count of spada on the 25th of december you will see presently how the date became fixed in my memory i was reading for the thousandth time the papers i was arranging for the palace was sold to a stranger and i was going to leave rome and settle at florence intending to take with me twelve thousand francs i possessed my library and the famous breviary when tired with my constant labor at the same thing and overcome by a heavy dinner i had eaten my head dropped on my hands and i fell asleep about three o clock in the afternoon   143.8917503321949

coquenard turning about in his chair a real feast epulœ epulorum   108.89240015911479
he judged that the match would be so much the less equal if athos and his companions were really plotting   78.57536618917419
there were paintings by diaz who makes his flowers more beautiful than flowers his suns more brilliant than the sun   134.9774111528172
there must be plenty left replied d artagnan   66.8213533116475

i have sworn to tell you all and i will tell you all   159.6114147053791
what would you do tell me if your sister listened to such a proposition   105.45984277933766
the musketeer who knew that his lieutenant was incapable of jesting with regard to the service obeyed without a word although he thought the order strange   109.84972095547874
well here are 8 000 francs on account   80.01961720194589
and have you any recollection of your country   108.50042691388755

she tried to go toward the window for air but she could only stretch forth her arms   174.31939812808756

but my lord said marshal de grammont consider that when we have collected all our forces we shall have hardly thirteen thousand men   108.22455037989081
monsieur monsieur cried mazarin you are breaking your word to me   185.70072513439825
and happily so for instead of the invisible impalpable agent of celestial rewards and punishments i shall find one both palpable and visible on whom i shall revenge myself i assure you for all i have suffered during the last month   219.6600843124825
the man looked at the bank notes felt them counted them turned pale then red then rushed into his room to drink a glass of water but he had no time to reach the water jug and fainted in the midst of his dried herbs   197.7094119177322
it is all one to us to us who do not command to morrow s expedition   162.3519152086769
if he were afterwards to marry mademoiselle danglars you would accuse me of intrigue and would be challenging me besides i may not be there myself   132.68116247245274
but this did not arise from a want of affection   170.84610269478873
the name of the french officer who had been sent to constantinople resounded on all sides amongst our palikares   188.05531630468755
and what did you reply   79.19563855049503
why do you ask me now   110.99714665211519
the abbé busoni   140.1046260554653
for the rest this vengeance was very easy   171.96128386648806
a tigress a panther   135.73589739071392
take a last farewell sir of her sad remains   123.32597705599807
but i say no more madame   135.69237847019022
i don t comprehend   200.46340732784643
then said the two women to emmanuel we are indeed ruined   35.422175226715524
you seemed at dinner to be anxious about something   124.23546438947982
and where are we going may i ask without being too curious   169.44643645061205
but he had no sooner eaten than he felt thirsty   100.07521985637001
the fourth horse had arrived   162.47059856530905
were they alone   65.98685418768622
he had then in order not to disturb his habits accustomed grimaud to obey him upon a simple gesture or upon a simple movement of his lips   107.4181454277582
here comes a young gentleman said one of them who seems as if he were going to join the army   175.18125674317315
i could propose one to your majesty but i dare not   60.79861929213946
the officers who arrested him conducted him straight to the bastille where he passed trembling before a party of soldiers who were loading their muskets   123.83381423629781
the house was of white stone and in a small court before it were two small beds full of beautiful flowers   114.50570664139653
pistache on a signal from his master placed himself on this line raised himself on his hind paws and holding in his front paws a wand with which clothes used to be beaten he began to dance upon the line with as many contortions as a rope dancer   119.78110586492457
he then arose   155.2237971321966
the same evening some friends of mine visited me m   145.27859149896057
we may easily understand how eagerly the particulars were asked for given and received   99.44148700843958
question then my lord   107.25084544720836
at thirty five which was then his age he passed with just title for the handsomest gentleman and the most elegant cavalier of france or england   203.80727135151636
mercédès said the count i do not say it to blame you but you made an unnecessary sacrifice in relinquishing the whole of the fortune amassed by m   102.27128061563597
on a rustic table made by luigi were spread out the pearl necklace and the diamond pins and on a chair at the side was laid the rest of the costume   180.73978903059464
for a moment dantès was speechless   106.32653805250465
because remembering the scene at armentieres i thought i should find four axes for one as i was to meet four executioners   148.23104406820235
it was not i who wished to kill the jew said caderousse   66.1072533119745
and let me give you a piece of advice   104.62256163404038
i wish to know if in demanding my signature you leave me entirely free in my person   116.99564918374874
are you a man for the substantials and is gold your god   126.48388565032636
the banker soon returned   195.69583156584062
have you then power against death   137.46862089591747
i will die here and you will see if a phantom that accuses is not more terrible than a living being that threatens   160.02722429683308
at the end of ten minutes the bandit made them a sign to stop   119.67208090657749
it was quite dark and no one saw them go out   97.78550807597342
he took the cross and kissed it   102.62112385581771
watch watch beauchamp and try to discover the enemy who made this disclosure   184.6294766522546
four and the two bandits make six   228.72094564242724
she saw a woman in a white dressing gown pouring a liquor from a phial into her glass   165.8488216000673
bravo bravo   121.76841060544896
and have i any right to go and peep under their cloaks to see what is not there   138.53065001317347
when we arrived about thirty paces from them the prince turned around to the soldiers comrades he said you are about to suffer a furious discharge   96.29245695148578
they then perceived two men conversing in the obscurity   134.5307472737519
i should be glad however to receive your excellency s commands concerning the dinner   134.19219448921967
it was a coupé of koller s building and with horses and harness for which drake had to the knowledge of all the lions of paris refused on the previous day seven hundred guineas   116.7794044268845
i know it cried d artagnan   146.01120310668242
i never returned to the country where she lived   154.25530689457966
morrel take my word for it   130.72656549047326
andrea had then in a fortnight attained a very fair position   132.96842531016938
the air burned ignited by flaming embers then the frightful lightning disappeared the brands sank one after another into the abyss where they were extinguished and save for a slight vibration in the air after a few minutes had elapsed one would have thought that nothing had happened   53.808093361525536
i perceive what you are intending to propose to me   145.4419461650317
in one of the rooms he crossed the trousseau of the bride elect was on exhibition   24.14523497399739
said d artagnan seizing his own   163.4447006479189
imposing silence grimaud put out the little night lamp then knelt down and poured into the lieutenant s ear a recital melodramatic enough not to require play of feature to give it pith   135.5759108278562
the first will was torn up and a second made in which he left the whole of his fortune to valentine on condition that she should never be separated from him   107.41844922752169
i wished to follow you but my horse was too much fatigued to go at the same pace with yours   165.05495088809107
ah indeed so much the better   107.32280336540583
i assure you it is already yours to a very unusual extent   99.96857358985571
trust me madame   9.63153149882234
resumed the cardinal with a smile which indicated that he knew the story as well as he who wished to relate it   81.36890037933138
if i am astonished at anything remarked porthos sententiously it is that it has not already happened   49.09279808120475
then they lift and sink again and both go under at once   156.67055443107847
here said he to cucumetto here are three hundred piastres   155.41423983206482
d artagnan went to take leave of m   186.53668359951348
but for such a work you must have needed books had you any   124.52802073166484
i who had sacrificed for you the baronne de i know it well   35.270188576328806
charlotte backson comtesse de la fère milady de winter said he your crimes have wearied men on earth and god in heaven   108.31725921995263
tomorrow at midday tréville   97.2829284388795
what then is it   93.31153567359458
instead of preaching about the torments of hell i talk of the joys of paradise   116.68088428516172
but i added to help you it would be sufficient that dantès did not marry her you love   86.50407188591973
what i have done then has been for the queen and not at all for your grace   47.22695729718711
monsieur said the cardinal if milady de winter has committed the crimes you lay to her charge she shall be punished   111.60114210128144
the obscurity augmented the acuteness of his hearing   137.19170015186478
julie suitably dressed and her hair arranged she had accomplished this feat in less than ten minutes received the count on his entrance   239.87396057283996
we will accompany them only to a little village in limousin lying between tulle and angouleme a little village called roche l abeille   124.39812298164476
and besides i think what the comte de la fere said just now is very good   40.26629735909022
but we are not superstitious   70.18424538058622
cried porthos making strong efforts to disembarrass himself of d artagnan who was wriggling about his back   95.59994103581828
rochefort s lackey would precede it as courier   109.3355630791831
a slight oscillation showed dantès that all went well   71.95227063784097
i say the two because cardinal rospigliosi who had not taken any precaution was completely despoiled   74.07574701749562
when the hour of breakfast came therefore i did not hesitate to eat and drink   236.08029824147846
franz went along the corridor and a servant introduced him to the count   228.0930723736705
the count knows everything said the italian bowing   107.99940160545788
immediately without any other signal the carriages moved on flowing on towards the corso down all the streets like torrents pent up for a while which again flow into the parent river   147.2202982910254
there is nothing but a wainscot between my chamber and milady s   68.54345484155067
the anticipated delights of the carnival had so run in his head as to make him leave his pillow long before his usual hour   154.9737877269783
that dark point yonder is the isle of dogs   168.02382895805778
they are binding her   129.7901430383879
may i know the cause which procures me the pleasure of seeing m   123.5745138794801
as a fugitive she could not take care of it but on her return she wished to have it near her   187.0264641635568
you are charged with having tried to thwart the plans of your general   109.47442595756881
colonel fairfax repeated bradshaw   49.972524070277125
i wished no ill to morcerf   93.58832187387048
often he was driven away oftener still had he a dread of being sent away   170.16800121982686
i should injure the queen instead of serving her   122.09230908496242
now then all is agreed   86.09650883578495
on their part the musketeers who had not much to do with the siege were not under very strict orders and led a joyous life   101.62153042094297
be satisfied we shall have this lion   53.02924471636976
but eugénie instead of stooping drew herself up under the blow   178.69506432729492
yes resolutely replied noirtier   88.16188096290286
so that as you confess you are jealous   115.21143108373082
he listened he groped about but he heard and saw nothing the cries had ceased and the tempest continued to rage   51.12245576226965
it has succeeded since you deign to receive me   127.65687984351207
these animals though wild and agile as chamois were too much like domestic goats and franz could not consider them as game   89.34168028195971
noirtier watched with indescribable pleasure this noble and sincere countenance on which every sentiment his tongue uttered was depicted adding by the expression of his fine features all that coloring adds to a sound and faithful drawing   93.41638501490212
a thousand livres   154.95078760771125
and should we meet with one of your patrol we must defend ourselves   181.8570151771721
no other of the bandits would perhaps have done the same   125.54060676564039
i will give you a paper which you must not part with on any account and which you will deliver into the proper hands   113.55564946054274
this day will be a warm one said planchet in a warlike tone   125.4384532235639
but meantime as we are to set off the day after tomorrow you would do much better not to risk this bastille   92.0206376281198
de villefort s house   94.51725096398422
valentine smiled sadly   187.5602420665382
no he murmured none of my enemies would have waited so patiently and laboriously for so long a space of time that they might now come and crush me with this secret   71.79385049265743
he ordered two horses to be saddled and himself went as guide to the young guardsman   76.10510437358955
no monsieur returned monte cristo upon the simple condition that they should respect myself and my friends   123.57859045249404
no you are right and i should say that would bring him ill luck   178.38951556123152
the latter seemed to be maturing in her mind some great stroke a fact which increased the uneasiness of the cardinal who knew the proud princess and dreaded much the determination of anne of austria   220.87294222941034
he cried falling back a step   113.75073076120428
some traveller seems impatient said the host   103.63960961237034
i hope said d artagnan half dead with fright you made no mention of my diamond   92.71997997326099
he has disappeared like a phantom like a shade like a specter   119.97589630818833
i am the viscount de bragelonne and he is called grimaud   85.51370467440687
well my lord said la ramee with his rude laugh you still set yourself against this poor fellow   94.49159213503651
yes everyone in my family is well   14.006951021163573
athos went round the house before he could distinguish the door amid the red color in which the house was painted   28.410240052325392
for i will freely confess that my historical labors have been my greatest solace and relief   53.970799670885896
it seemed to me as if you were yourself preparing for some dangerous undertaking about which i did not dare to question you since you told me nothing   143.09747991770698
and that while the citizen noirtier was a girondin the count noirtier became a senator   143.03573384693885
i come now to the last of the family whose secretary i was the count of spada   82.38849933254428
then replied mme   116.0313102137668
repeated the faithful servant of anne of austria on his knees before the duke s sofa   29.156699630199327
he rose on the waves making signs of distress   119.3954778298262
then it is possible   114.49904052319339
if he is a puritan we will inform him of the capture of the king and in honor of the news he will kill for us his fatted hens   105.68082351120452
he then led the young man into the study and either by chance or manœuvre the door was partially closed after andrea so that from the place where they sat neither the count nor the baroness could see anything   173.04098434114547
yes most satisfactory my dear danglars   111.32449019842565
without that precaution valentine would have died before assistance could have been procured   167.77070286414187
but the secret   82.81927243081756
come come tell me   110.91173855463212
said the same sharp and imperative voice   146.23115208516782
well then in return for your story continued noirtier i will tell you another   88.3103351516595
he left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent but barrois who had heard all that passed had guessed his master s wishes and had already gone to fetch one   129.23661663468638
i ask you what year is it   169.3461001146961
some lackey murmured d artagnan   101.4080289684401
yes said the count   138.45619137808467
do you know sir asked the baroness that you are improving   114.93556196416081
albert turned away his head with a sigh and went to his own apartments   158.52272507527277
nothing is concealed from the cardinal   34.64485949725484
albert who was a great smoker and who had considered it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars of the café de paris approached the table and uttered a cry of joy at perceiving some veritable puros   95.2763833839807
were her fears realized   137.44604156989828
you love me too well to wish me to remain useless and idle with you   82.20320028086786
and be in readiness on the stairs to conduct us to it   185.56273962061283
said danglars more pale from terror than he had been just before from hunger and misery   156.267362373202
keep the lieutenancy my dear keep it   166.02760788923337
did you come to tell us you have procured a carriage   64.38938033441713
the last commission of poor captain leclere   117.07808250339019
the king drew his sword and broke it on his knee   164.49598449746594
athos according to his system neither encouraged nor dissuaded him   82.00142316211216
four devoted resolute men can do much assure yourself madame   99.27212193451044
above this floor was a large atelier which had been increased in size by pulling down the partitions a pandemonium in which the artist and the dandy strove for pre eminence   126.83838009726627
that would compromise the honor of the french army to say nothing of the fact that the continual presence of a captain of spahis in a place where no warlike projects could be supposed to account for it might well create surprise   107.72713731148072
the roll call finished the president ordered them to read the act of accusation   152.96408283430452
she appeared to be in ecstasy and did not pay the least attention to what was going on around her   51.9872987911654
porthos turned aside in order not to show by his honest round face what was passing in his mind   96.27381398439334
40178m i am broken hearted said albert   69.72839824329982
but at that period people did not manage affairs as they do today   74.97540847367324
but at the third watched besides the guard and the doorkeepers the faithful bernouin a cerberus whom no speech could soften no wand even of gold could charm   105.35688276560658
cut the cable then   85.67837009170947
there are certain affinities between the persons we quit and those we meet afterwards   125.1343468066771
do you then still hate those who separated you   117.23067680976277
what joy for my lord and master du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds   93.24765819777738
perceiving her brother in law she uttered a terrible cry   200.4360622583957
i know how clear sighted your dreams are   107.8455084681846
she had allowed herself to be exceeded in generosity   171.5664248567295
approach gentlemen said albert   181.21486412479277
he has taken part against his queen or rather against her minister   71.64184911549516
but it appears that in prison he made the acquaintance of a rich englishman and as in prison he fell sick and dantès took the same care of him as if he had been his brother the englishman when he was set free gave this stone to dantès who less fortunate died and in his turn left it to us and charged the excellent abbé who was here this morning to deliver it   144.08278912265843
that gascon   95.02044701542451
as you please he said   176.903179888677
he was approached to be examined and when it was discovered by his plumed hat and his laced coat that he was an officer of the musketeers he was surrounded with the intention of making him cry down with mazarin   18.910586356196475
i understand answered porthos i understand you perfectly on my honor   128.0106175457858
the young woman in the street replied by a single tap and the shutter was opened a little way   114.81414174193638
no kitty you are mistaken   42.49777150158535
please pay to my order from the fund deposited by me the sum of a million and charge the same to my account   93.40609526499287
the poor woman s head and arms fell   123.39968663826988
there is a dupe somewhere   118.3354507473096
asked the countess as though awakening from a sleep to the realities of life   134.89146899804743
and to meet the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the present month and the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the next month to m   107.22771668404542
that gascon has saved a queen and made monsieur de richelieu confess that in point of talent address and political skill to him he was only a tyro   68.97991934476154
sir said villefort upon my word you overcome me   68.80313340235462
two men seated on the movable plank on which the victim is laid were eating their breakfasts while waiting for the criminal   72.81012486606491
and his scotch guard to louis xi   69.76610492856574
a flurry in stocks some days after this meeting albert de morcerf visited the count of monte cristo at his house in the champs élysées which had already assumed that palace like appearance which the count s princely fortune enabled him to give even to his most temporary residences   149.42288968494825
then approaching noirtier pardon what i am going to say added he but no indication should be neglected in this terrible situation   27.49283972512147
yes my pocket has a hole in it   115.65047047447004
oh how i love you   107.95376969264707
so you may have the diamond for 45 000 francs   185.8032852635829
oh it is not yet fixed   123.11308961555228
this fashion is coming in   121.24165336048193

de villefort by whose hand the ground was dug to receive the corpse of his child   136.2982225005881
the skilful swordsman whom you have conquered   53.34968570919566
monte cristo made a sign with his head to show that he could discern in the darkness the door to which bertuccio alluded   79.56046613214629
then the heavy and collected steps of a multitude of men were heard and the queen herself raised the tapestry hangings and put her finger on her lips   61.75822965732242
by introducing to you a new acquaintance   57.71746694647118
asked aramis and how does he go to work to weed the parliament   89.5335053609414
but that beauty had gradually withered beneath the devastating influence of the slow fever so prevalent among dwellers by the ponds of aiguemortes and the marshes of camargue   182.03739497460845
you were right sir said anne   214.08521562806723
all his sorrows all his sufferings with their train of gloomy spectres fled from his cell when the angel of death seemed about to enter   88.70659033627416
she first extended her arms to prevent me but after a moment s reflection yes go florentin said she and may he come quickly   100.87423636340581
very well sir said monte cristo   123.7897119762871
you will get yourself decapitated my beautiful queen and that would be a pity   80.6956190057469
he received the enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with evident pleasure as though his chilled affections were rekindled and invigorated by his contact with one so warm and ardent   34.8825623541007
the three friends hastened toward d artagnan who instead of being ill ran toward his horse   128.18831149328287
then i must wait   144.64354607974687
asked the young girl in romaic of monte cristo   122.41640284224832
what could i do for you edmond besides pray and weep   94.99913682032664
they sent me the order of charles iii   164.7130794128315
well wait for the miracle i hope to accomplish or or   141.8709911495128
he perceived in the tavern a pert boy between twelve and fifteen years of age whom he fancied he had seen not twenty minutes before under the guise of a chorister   53.534614665413265
don t you see them   182.5873667803873
but am i not your nearest relative   142.10168764026415
well we are going to give a ball to mazarin   97.70100333775459
london is far from paris very far and perhaps the commission with which you charge me is not without dangers   147.22110994100348
she ground her teeth   27.570639538497474
and the count humming an air from lucia went to sit down on a bench while bertuccio followed him collecting his thoughts   62.45416393486297
if there is any left   25.384358052104744
they learned at a later period through mme   111.4590648767889
i know him also but unfortunately he is not in paris   45.78983527435763
eugénie approached softly and saw the old man sleeping soundly in an armchair in his lodge   92.27653155752589
d artagnan made him a sign and his mouth remaining silent gradually closed   37.01046565137551
when sir i tell you all this with tears of heartfelt anguish can you reply that i am wrong can you prevent my putting an end to my miserable existence   130.43101604646728
but he will read a petition countersigned and presented by me   74.02308693801271
nevertheless the calm religious dignity of his countenance abashed mordaunt   68.31483161828626
nothing will give greater pleasure to all your old friends   132.04331610757657
neither was he one of those who think that the necessary silence of the night brings counsel with it   149.50223794831723
yes the third   95.72317073256163
a complicated affair said porthos   93.07539764850348
how many days would it require to make two studs exactly like them   143.1937351441294
it is you bernouin she said   194.69069087824033
i am not an abbé i am not mad   76.64006312652202
at this instant the door opened   65.3069637963647
now said the gascon that is all well i accept for porthos and myself everything thanks and compliments   111.43087871967705
the musketeer could not forget the evil reports which then prevailed and which indeed have survived them of the procurators of the period meanness stinginess fasts   99.6496503128811
and olivain and the host took their way together toward the inn olivain according to the custom of serving men well pleased with their place relating to the tavern keeper all that he could say in favor of the young gentleman   71.61063196008894
in fact there is so much resemblance between us that i sometimes believe he is aramis and i am the coadjutor   115.87593858074713
noble heart   142.61655897133747
admirable sire   53.29562033784251
the other that of franz and his friends   69.86072322911063
this was murder in every sense of the word   91.62440678631053
the history of the scuttled vessels which had appeared improbable during the day seemed very probable at night   83.7063824193024
you must be satan   186.44534153334394
never said the englishman   155.7069731113554
listen hermine   191.75393127513172
the committee decided to hear the letter   86.7084813167547
but by the accent the young man plainly saw that the beautiful englishwoman was in a great rage   94.3074040445648
the chevalier raised his head saw the two young women and without stopping waved his hand in a friendly way to milady   149.68343167282086
she can declare to you for example that your father had no hand whatever in the defeat and death of the vizier   64.25666673302896
we set forth on our journey   156.23738066508892
the day on which d artagnan presented himself the assemblage was imposing particularly for a provincial just arriving from his province   137.33361635288438
i have confidence in the remedy i propose and only ask you to permit me to assure you of its efficacy   47.27367262467945
and the evening came on slowly but finally it came   137.58599049957414
i i fence as well as you did in the old time better still perhaps   113.53050431387041
and so mademoiselle danglars she could not endure the insult offered to us by that wretch so she asked permission to travel   175.39622578614762
long live broussel   88.66907516404538
well replied la carconte do as you like   149.7662044081423
i repeat it is melancholy to pass one s life without having one joy to recall without preserving a single hope   84.10140652487149
there is not one who has not treated me as the master of the house the only title i desire with respect to you   84.99696583396285
when he again joined the two persons who had been discussing the matter it had been decided that they should touch at monte cristo and set out on the following night   150.15294643346297
the goldsmith cast a glance at the elegant manner in which they were set calculated one with another what the diamonds were worth and without hesitation said fifteen hundred pistoles each my lord   186.27433313342198
poor king charles   82.67548299830064
so you were at the races baron   24.09709027001206
the bolts were drawn   99.0591376597052
our house added the englishman with a laugh does not do things in that way   92.42584124678015
that is to say each rested his head on the other s shoulder   87.39551271789296
in four days said morrel   98.85184753008825
she is at the ball as you know since she came to say good bye to you in full dress   39.74757693880427
and henry iv   32.82369057850633
she can give blood in return for blood that is all   110.00877932996016
alas madame   86.71853256329011
the two friends made the prisoners enter the house first whilst they stood at the door desiring mousqueton to take the four horses to the stable   146.29993296648547
the journey chapter 86   81.89812365977045
now you talk my dear   64.77370590802775
exclaimed d artagnan anxiously   116.59121522829525
what have been the results of your quarrel   189.68409103994182
all right said porthos   112.9011806215969
around this opening which had possibly for ages permitted a free entrance to the brilliant moonbeams that now illumined the vast pile grew a quantity of creeping plants whose delicate green branches stood out in bold relief against the clear azure of the firmament while large masses of thick strong fibrous shoots forced their way through the chasm and hung floating to and fro like so many waving strings   68.55468680768217
on their side the mother and daughter retired into the embrasure of a window to read eagerly the following letter dear wife we have now reached the moment of decision   115.50776411506115
quite certain   126.28014036055134
very sure   74.40609131230268
haydée it will be recollected that the new or rather old acquaintances of the count of monte cristo residing in the rue meslay were no other than maximilian julie and emmanuel   181.34312388415788
yes just before you came   60.063162870185394
valentine started   51.69923054581197
patrick brought the object desired which laporte recognized as having belonged to the queen   66.75715958547897
cried caderousse smiling you have not attained that honor yet   120.92098549963998
ah asked the countess who is out in the streets of rome at this hour unless it be to go to a ball   93.37216103548793
still i remember he danced three times with her at madame de morcerf s   86.85337821877626
yes all   106.52115998667317
it was a quarter past midday   165.15481018687024
you no longer seem to understand me   86.51332737474223
but when the cardinal added that not only mme   23.667580251087244
julie hesitated and resolved to take counsel   163.427838621663
carlini fetched two pickaxes   128.4620750078725
the leave of absence monsieur has asked for replied the lackey   61.32446939589161
his mind was torn by doubt grief and despair   142.1571691622538
an admirable subject   138.38436839724648
it vexes me greatly continued athos that you attach so much importance to these animals for i am not yet at the end of my story   132.6775650193479
i won t have him killed i won t   173.87880573006476
is monsieur your cousin   149.5432047558396
what is his birthplace   175.12553106049114
his eminence took the paper and read in a slow voice dwelling upon every syllable dec   110.33663735854769
about forty leagues only   34.90956798789121
the gardens were illuminated with colored lanterns according to the italian custom and as is usual in countries where the luxuries of the table the rarest of all luxuries in their complete form are well understood the supper table was loaded with wax lights and flowers   164.00449477054386
don t go d artagnan   102.41916068836247
you a queen to quarrel like a washerwoman   128.07027647009485
asked his eminence   21.956663829543203
ah i understand   153.46352032474655
i don t think so answered the other   69.28240631336067
what would you have my dear viscount   168.01549066030765
starting up he clasped his hands around his head as though to prevent his very brain from bursting and exclaimed his father   86.79264388221962
he could not yet see that dreadful cross but he felt somehow as if it were coming to meet him   126.64353000128872
to tell you my lord that the moment has now arrived when with a single word you may recompense all these services   83.05898946237865
but not enough   136.272493292196
inquired the young girl trembling with apprehension   140.25905396754223
beg her to do you the favor to take your arm in going downstairs and thank her as you descend   154.71734980645277
how long you are before you tell me what i most wish to know   98.78958540799225
all goes well   76.77279724307931
and i also said morrel thoughtfully have heard something like this from an old sailor named penelon   137.36626161349403
20285m chapter 44   162.0799022928691
ten minutes after he raised his head   111.80461183348328
she ran to the table and seizing the knife which felton had laid down exclaimed and by what right will you prevent me from dying   116.95201336859597
there is a whole history connected with the names fernand and yanina   136.09101933391085
matrimonial projects the day following this scene at the hour debray usually chose to pay a visit to madame danglars on his way to his office his coupé did not appear   109.29252732867896
are there any others   139.80811577700408
besides which the musketeer after having exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with him broached the matter first   119.8448872620395
and even supposing all these perils past then to have to swim for your life a distance of at least three miles ere you could reach the shore were difficulties so startling and formidable that dantès had never even dreamed of such a scheme resigning himself rather to death   123.71555745410389
nay madame i pray you pardon this little traitor   108.99498839858025
his head dropped upon his chest and in this position he paced his study   169.7581527464652
well it is a question of serving the king the gentleman s duty   196.95352144210204
those who are known are not the most dangerous   127.82684778116939
i shall be with mine under the third   114.52614023398056
i can not reconcile myself to this idea it would madden me   20.433402758437722
the poor fellow does not know the purpose for which i am here   117.29250000733799
you hear sir   91.25761072651696
next moment the door opened and the man disappeared   87.55041216585117
de tréville waited for the king   12.338859387942975
a youthful indiscretion i suppose which you were anxious to conceal from the world at large   126.36979763975833
d artagnan tried to recall his remembrances   193.06214140209474
cried porthos oh   48.87928499824818
say no more   215.14137751508093
they began the day he was sold   147.25775161905855
it was the advice of athos to go straight to the minister   97.58588385459568
yes and a sincere friend   120.70631071757857
i will follow your eminence s instructions to the letter   127.38353150408702
and i said porthos shall make him my sole heir   85.99539692719057
then said monte cristo here are 200 000 francs gone after hush do not mention these things said danglars   61.045065663325126
when he is tired he will perhaps tell us that he has had enough of it   166.81046860342988
the abbé shook his head   68.41534630103939
years have elapsed many events have happened alas   95.56270961442664
he passed on to another it also was empty but the third which he tried was from the dull sound it gave out evidently full   113.11869411297376
kitty breathed a second sigh   160.45388514842654
when were you here   91.14035967011596
and he blew out the light   168.25810988569486
his legs trembled and his thoughts flew about madly in his brain like the wheels of a disordered watch   115.4940532153568
we are invited replied d artagnan to pass the night with m   140.09502430539553
wait my dear father said the young man one word more   57.43452624702507
haydée became pale and lifting her transparent hands to heaven exclaimed in a voice stifled with tears then you leave me my lord   114.56736715295821
five days are more than i require   91.51837537516091
when i tell you a thing sir said mordaunt you insult me by doubting it   80.55446198576695
against calumniators said m   59.242750961592016
but at present i must imitate the discretion of the doctor s niece   82.0144772473871
it was true that this order would not be of great use to them while they were in camp at la rochelle   63.202833696611144
but in such a situation a single moment suffices to change the strongest doubt into certainty   64.07617334079833
adieu till then   120.61742128847725
but the jaws were so clenched that the pen could not pass them   150.11884835363165
for the demon of speculation drew a line or in other words projected a street at the farther side of the kitchen garden   176.21111334995805
of these 600 000 francs you took 50 000 crowns   49.16252039782905
danglars looked at him askance as though to ascertain whether he spoke seriously   135.02577755472166
as soon as gaetano had transmitted this answer the sentinel gave an order to one of the men seated round the fire who rose and disappeared among the rocks   164.56254385682436
and pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune   161.22665143356681
your agreeable company will divert me   93.63695653113174
why you have drunk more than a hundred pistoles worth   130.17588074457757
i am now quite at your service gentlemen said he   162.8175952972303
go down athos he mistrusts you less than me and see if he be still at his door   161.66897150229235
you believe me to be a frenchman for i speak french with the same facility and purity as yourself   103.73345287011912
that s it said d artagnan   136.15524218526036
why upon the frontiers of artois and of flanders   143.11381074316162
d artagnan opened it and as the day was beginning to decline he approached the window to read it   75.54135540388609
they believe me her accomplice and will punish me with her   132.57603009923588
when they met they looked desolately at one another as much as to say have you found anything   37.86921517578067
heaven would have given me strength   118.52699596681522
ah true i was writing   54.3557553525029
no one knew how the three former tenants of that house left it   81.15606285672486
a shopkeeper in the rue des lombards who has great influence upon the commerce of his quarter   0.8615746751125641
i fight in the cause of honor   104.51472484492182
your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required whether touching the health of his crew or the value of his freight   132.02027441221065
oh cried eugénie you are a bad physiognomist if you imagine i deplore on my own account the catastrophe of which you warn me   69.57906335474004
albert attributed to franz s absence the extreme kindness of the fair peasant in raising her mask   106.87427153962709
laporte made no further objection and read my lord by that which since i have known you have suffered by you and for you i conjure you if you have any care for my repose to countermand those great armaments which you are preparing against france to put an end to a war of which it is publicly said religion is the ostensible cause and of which it is generally whispered your love for me is the concealed cause   155.9091818420523
returned debray carelessly   82.70074786480659
they had arrived in the champs élysées   147.694809872706
he turned around and mordaunt stood before him   109.39388670818542
here s to our colonel and let him know that we are always at his commands as far as london and farther   158.31521563678916
with grandpapa noirtier   114.60388657937658
silence for monsieur porthos s idea   135.99747776326768
bonacieux who was ignorant that d artagnan had overheard his conversation with the stranger of meung related to his young tenant the persecutions of that monster m   35.99836976911253
but leaping lightly ashore he signified his desire to be quite alone   156.2203104036548
do you remember me   111.52258166071174
long live the queen   189.89331311963383
i prefer that   179.80902734146198
near the bottom of the ladder when he found no more support for his feet he clung with his hands   99.01974628595889
sometimes mere strangers like the count of monte cristo came to visit her   107.17791721841004
rejoined mazarin impatiently it s about an hour since i asked you for that very thing wooden head that you are   110.56594739520136
it is a great honor for a poor distributor of holy water   105.75774273822103
she thinks of me then after five years of separation   209.85627895364232
and what part did he play in this sad drama   52.57267662578223
milady saw at a single glance all the painful feelings she inspired in felton by dwelling on every detail of her recital   114.96089406255216
there was no doubt upon the subject   95.18736089009448
you will find it has been hollowed out for the purpose of containing a small phial you will see there half filled with a red looking fluid   146.45578136320216
came into france i would offer him my house my own house   37.13391674151124
i shall tell you my name in order that you may know where to find me my lord or my prince as it may suit you best to be called said our gascon who did not choose to seem to yield to a threat   100.1551900827353
in a moment sir answered dantès and i m with you   66.49620362233229
but pistache as at first turned round on his legs and stood with his back to the cane   131.84719668645275
asked milady with surprise   90.36622273131448
if you have it use it replied gondy   75.23929994338664
he was as we have already said perfectly well acquainted with the literature of all countries   144.8954574227937
with whom with a child seven years old   121.2577880308737
yes you are right maximilian i will follow you   59.015595934938055
there was something grave and solemn in the approach of the young girl which struck the old man and immediately his bright eye began to interrogate   136.27642892488277
at these words he rose and put off his frock coat and cravat went towards a table on which lay his son s toilet articles lathered his face took a razor and with a firm hand cut off the compromising whiskers   78.18512314499763
she was poisoned on my account   116.69442985946515
but you who are a reasonable being lucien and who knows how little dependence is to be placed on the news since you are at the fountain head surely you ought to prevent it said morcerf with a smile   12.790684580425705
have you really met with some great misfortune   81.74400016898541
the evening was employed in discussing the war   143.71555490959176
i have not seen you nor your friends and i don t think you could gather all that dust that i saw planchet brush off your boots yesterday from the pavement of paris   140.50010091147226
diavolaccio advanced amidst the most profound silence and laid rita at the captain s feet   161.86539120369426
grimaud according to custom obeyed in silence   109.0396538605857
did he take baptistin with him   37.96211461544087
and understanding that was what he wanted again watched his eyes which turned toward an old secretaire which had been neglected for many years and was supposed to contain nothing but useless documents   93.60616635415762
the juncture was favorable   107.04473866313182
and as athos was the least inquisitive of any man on earth d artagnan s confidence stopped there   155.60242864927915
i shall pass by blois   37.8559637276757
nobody knew   125.5705169277912
when the chill of the night had driven away the guests from the gardens and the gates of the villa were closed on them for the festa in doors he took teresa quite away and as he left her at her home he said teresa what were you thinking of as you danced opposite the young countess of san felice   88.92935365668396
with this light was extinguished the last irresolution in the heart of d artagnan   103.66232667994906
it s a month now that you have been thinking of this marriage and you must see that it throws some responsibility on me for it was at my house you met this young cavalcanti whom i do not really know at all   7.382343388175059
monsieur cardinal you have heard me   66.27595044897852
dantès descended the staircase preceded by the magistrate and followed by the soldiers   126.50768268575737
he whispered to porthos as they proceeded   108.76410656492946
danglars more and more delighted with major cavalcanti had offered him a seat in his carriage   116.8033407173109
what is the next   68.88244213692747
with the greatest care   72.8077663261401
exclaimed the gascon surprised   190.27839221587013
in this list there were three conditions which displeased mazarin and he offered the prince ten thousand crowns to renounce them   145.4120990242703
in the meanwhile the king here detached the cross of the legion of honor which he usually wore over his blue coat near the cross of st   164.24060544237767
i don t suppose there is a more contented man at this moment in all the kingdom than yourself   85.20495407585628
i am the only person possessing the right to dispose of my daughter s hand   97.97286473607763
i will run to monsieur de tréville to tell them all this and will meet them there   87.0793088194799
in the meantime my dear lucien here are cigars contraband of course try them and persuade the minister to sell us such instead of poisoning us with cabbage leaves   228.15472400130693
madame de morcerf did not lose sight of monte cristo   115.46821792231401
as he passed them he said they are extremely handsome certainly and you have done well to purchase them although you were somewhat remiss not to have procured them sooner   139.66845899632136
he had been informed at seven o clock in the morning that a rope ladder floated from one of the windows of the castle   50.37661465124552
i broke my word it is true   78.7349359335388
fortunately by our marriage contract the survivor takes everything   168.26471112799882
by you   82.06379636627199
have you any friends   116.04578491222254
yes echoed porthos glancing affectionately at his sword still hanging on the wall   86.99890301046324
oh dear yes   106.77515083810758
get in laporte   143.35083348208065
i think only that i have known you not a whole year   99.13094615598243
that will be useless   50.51022090438333
nothing but intrigues   155.97365550363202
as soon as the escort arrived in a city when they had conducted the king to his quarters the four friends either retired to their own or to some secluded cabaret where they neither drank nor played   81.21536663007727
does your excellency wish for a receipt   85.78191891203828
as they stopped at the door of the cardinal s study d artagnan was about to be announced when rochefort slapped him on his shoulder   123.14189741832372
calm and dignified said he   97.88567823696897
ah added the turnkey there was no occasion for watching him   184.55783828746942
i am at home here and i alone have a right to raise my voice above another s   81.33587098252202
but on gaining the riverside he had mechanically put his hand into his pocket and perceived that he had not wherewithal to pay his passage   129.62508695903992
50123m yes i think i saw him pass   131.69770465391883
bayard   153.15123648155205
it proceeded from a wish like a submissive and devoted daughter a slight smile was observable on the purple lips of the young girl to practice obedience   122.02941171699239
how does it happen that you are in paris   151.47825157926627
said mordaunt whose face was lighted by a savage joy as cromwell spoke this skiff might be of use to you for personal projects   102.88245195858673
to the devil   45.670663681976635
but i knocked down more than twenty with the hilt of balizarde   168.63079343619938
50170m oh pardon me sir   149.9843753903998
bonacieux and that he should find her next day at the louvre   137.94458409002823
i have more than once intended witnessing an execution but i have never been able to make up my mind   93.43986273905838
the first impulse of these three and of those who last entered was to cast an inquiring glance at each other   153.2253545617704
you now know quite enough to enable you to converse with m   141.10033045919462
i scarcely thought you were so curious as that   207.43293857840627
there said the sentinel pointing over his shoulder to a spacious crypt hollowed out of the rock the lights from which shone into the passage through the large arched openings   45.47153431760496
then there is no revenge   103.08045116474833
your true father   148.13802121404945
your father did not hesitate an instant and the sum was sent to the frontier of piedmont with a passport signed for italy   118.16938768587514
i only ate some fruit   149.70269961490442
for heaven s sake don t be obstinate for when others are obstinate i am obstinate likewise and then i become ferocious and headstrong and there s my friend who is even more headstrong and ferocious than myself   49.19704987794079
well yes planchet to be sure said athos what is there so astonishing in that   145.78984489782027
let us leave him to follow the road to the camp protected by his esquire and the two musketeers and return to athos   96.26486083781069
you will long live with us happy loved and honored and we will make you forget never never never said the marchioness   129.91461462453032
olivain we have come into possession of two horses but i have lost my own   124.28514910967186
war between england and france was talked of as near and certain and the jolly sailors were having a carousal   95.8780328350599
after the reward of his devotion that of his love was to come   79.98699227082693
cried porthos as if in pain   141.65284441493
felton had not spoken   91.19152485647132
only let me warn you that i am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements   105.56244398508147
at last after a few moments cromwell raised his head and as if he divined that some one was there turned slowly around   123.55528597953938
i think i should like the other fellow better than this one said mazarin to himself and he threw himself back in his carriage   95.89113372375812
yes yes said caderousse   134.7749903929947
just then a handsome young man with bright eyes black hair and glossy moustache respectfully bowed to madame de villefort   159.56102927180166
my good friend said albert i beg pardon for my intrusion but i was anxious to know from your own mouth if your master was really out or not   204.0033972509955
but as no time was to be lost in gaining the king m   122.75983807431935
de busigny who by the by had given them a magnificent dinner a partner worthy of his company   100.22094982944935
but you will probably learn the reason soon   160.62046306830254
my poor girl in ten years i shall be old and you will be still young   104.6120468497309
it is one that becomes a man accustomed to look his enemies in the face   103.0861479380839
said the fair frail girl to her brunette companion   91.90007363986109
20199m then it is to your excellency that this letter is addressed   103.431967215213
oh by the way you d better take lodging in the rue montorgueil at the chat qui pelote   156.27149342132657
it matters little now to me   152.938807521417
so i took him round the waist and threw him into the boat and then i jumped after him   115.32600476679403
cavalcanti and i get the three millions or even if it is thought i am going to get them my credit will be restored and my fortune which for the last month or two has been swallowed up in gulfs which have been opened in my path by an inconceivable fatality will revive   134.15645220157717
more closely watched than ever the queen felt certain without knowing how to tell which that one of her women had betrayed her   166.12710403468736
go and call out your regiment said he   159.22911684892767
never a mistake or delay a fellow who paid like a prince   178.00862298406742
i shall hear this morning that m   150.19189613394818
a cry of astonishment was heard from all parts of the room   124.60460671797193
what do you think aramis   160.792029717653
asked monte cristo in the same tone that louis xiv   106.48668267837002
in what part of the house   120.63140967567477
it gives you an idea of your value   7.13913954785815
he is moving   68.67708600968615
not only free but in favor   81.9518995762517
however said madame de villefort returning to the one idea which incessantly occupied her mind perhaps it would be better to explain this unlucky affair to m   178.96022256051904
who are those gentlemen   260.3326025024365
the door was scarcely closed when albert bent his steps to his mother s room   114.92717198614562
yes borgia has been here a torch in one hand a sword in the other and within twenty paces at the foot of this rock perhaps two guards kept watch on land and sea while their master descended as i am about to descend dispelling the darkness before his awe inspiring progress   50.01650766220919
his features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he already knew and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them for the first time   68.7237913847216
and the duke smiled with a smile at once sad and charming   147.94389937607028
the ghost of samuel appeared to saul and it is an article of faith that i should be very sorry to see any doubt thrown upon porthos   137.542009319216
and you took pleasure in beholding these dreadful spectacles   163.3803656642751
have you been satisfied with him this voyage   47.26530203893634
cloud sounded half past ten   97.67262294161563
i recovered force and energy enough to free myself from the hands of those who held me while i managed to stammer forth i did not do it   94.61202512117318
you are my uncle   103.5631576823167
benedetto for the murder of his comrade in chains   142.76853244976434
it appears that this club is rather a bore to the police   43.98103681355218
de villefort saw it open before him   73.62295546617165
the agent of thomson french had not been again seen at marseilles   99.71487782413467
my life was in constant danger   134.13894214573267
i wrote to him from boulogne   108.18380699844015
valentine shook the gate with a strength of which she could not have been supposed to be possessed as morrel was going away and passing both her hands through the opening she clasped and wrung them   152.29749542929682
the friends went to bed early but neither of them slept   115.82728284883403
for i know what it is to be in love   95.70545080568385
having obtained the address of the person to whom the house in the allées de meilhan belonged dantès next proceeded thither and under the name of lord wilmore the name and title inscribed on his passport purchased the small dwelling for the sum of twenty five thousand francs at least ten thousand more than it was worth   181.63948998925628
when i have none i go afoot   79.85375417905968
my friend there is the viscount of bragelonne and i am the count de guiche   121.68685982434314
egad i know where he is said d artagnan   2.480260450613301
dressed with the greatest elegance and who wore the order of the holy ghost   144.15500740333368
swear to me replied faria to free me if what i tell you prove true and i will stay here while you go to the spot   179.58823431026974
athos turned red with rage   33.5598852420578
i was for twenty years cardinal spada s secretary   45.160282627249416
madame de villefort expressed a desire to return to paris which madame danglars had not dared to do notwithstanding the uneasiness she experienced   195.69835108366
the queen entered the great hall   136.34969780886172
there is peril of imprisonment risk of life in knowing me   131.78157250332214
don t be uneasy   139.47557397551137
pass the pen to aramis who writes theses in latin   165.0021769490342
to morrow i am on guard   105.0572295761667
steps sounded in the chamber and drew near   141.27024722116283
but he has no sooner destroyed his first will and made a second than for fear he should make a third he is struck down   110.57492649714702
the trumpets sounded   40.95312595084961
de tréville had good reason to mistrust the cardinal and to think that all was not over for scarcely had the captain of the musketeers closed the door after him than his eminence said to the king now that we are at length by ourselves we will if your majesty pleases converse seriously   209.20527945308987
come added the king   121.08903767409134
the dread with which the pale and motionless baroness listened to this was equalled by the calm indifference with which debray had spoken   132.44714871560146
de villefort has secluded himself   116.05273035129358
cried mousqueton his fat cheeks swelling out and his whole frame perspiring with joy   169.81124882124928
dantès continued his search   97.52048062243169
but he stopped at seeing the horrible alteration that had taken place in the countenance of athos who standing before the table his hair rising from his head his eyes fixed in stupor was looking at one of the glasses and appeared a prey to the most horrible doubt   91.02655252691872
then monte cristo slipped aside one of the movable panels which enabled him to see into the adjoining room   75.83725495037649
eighteen leagues is enough for the first stage   123.55407546896967
he rose to return the salutation   172.91627127390637
my father advised me to stoop to nobody but the king the cardinal and yourself whom he considered the first three personages in france   143.71784552526523
you will i hope be grateful for it   120.81856758111745
oh no never mind that said the italian   77.27331997156111
whatever you say   99.75152088063948
i sounded all the walls in the hopes of discovering a door but everywhere the walls returned a full and flat sound   66.64112084421743
i know that i must have been mad senseless to believe that snow would become animated or marble warm   92.87885934306887
before the sleeping king they will be mute gentle and timid as lambs   85.85865828644268
how did you know i was in prison   131.66583885793935
said the duke too much astonished to believe it true   135.22325685882248
you arrive in good time dear d artagnan said aramis and by taking part in our discussion may assist us with your intelligence   139.89607210000608
just so muttered comminges looking after mazarin   108.59651869371244
he then left for madrid and was no more heard of   47.31388257499991
and thus he proceeded onwards till he arrived at the end of the rue de noailles from whence a full view of the allées de meilhan was obtained   107.15810429516978
that s more time than we want   161.44691713866345
and with his eyes fixed upon the glass which athos held in his hand he ground the paper well between his teeth and then swallowed it   104.21386867301395
would anything retain you particularly in paris   178.72659448956654
the gentleman appeared to be enumerating all his qualities to his auditors   130.7867986377253
besides his majesty takes no pains to conceal how little affection he has for me   107.79921282698184
you said you were but three but it appears to me we are four   75.41299071046883
the galley slaves breathed the fresh air of heaven and saw each other   94.3782548422619
d artagnan called the sergeant   74.09997705880801
the officer who commanded the post of the red cross was sent for and by successive inquiries they learned that athos was then lodged in fort l evêque   164.29906087449652
so be it responded bertuccio all i ask of heaven is that i may never see him again   177.10914524498008
but whether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little attention to him whether the explanation of the count of monte cristo with regard to duelling had satisfied him or whether the events which franz knew of had had their effect on him alone he remarked that his companion did not pay the least regard to them but on the contrary ate like a man who for the last four or five months had been condemned to partake of italian cookery that is the worst in the world   159.5156542139111
not one   79.17949619673296
the decanter and the glass were completely empty   100.99640330326314
during the twenty years i served i often wished to do so but i had not the time   99.72372246845003
but not with men   91.47051910054199
a police agent entered   150.28733070967638
a woman of such inferior condition   118.16382034795882
said madame de villefort   51.931059849913666
you have a daughter then madame   158.5871961108677
yes but those five millions and a half are not mine and are only a proof of the great confidence placed in me   118.52346926660574
andrea bit his lips   127.65873753278636
and if i deceive you bring me here again i ask no more   73.82463751151579
answered d artagnan   140.6494528318826
thus the genoese subtle as he was was duped by edmond in whose favor his mild demeanor his nautical skill and his admirable dissimulation pleaded   118.73781832530337
ah a window   149.43788546191308
cried porthos are we all going away then   69.85771641109457
motionless against the dark tapestry with her hair in disorder she appeared like a horrid image of terror   109.21746970540006
i was speaking of your father s past history   14.949737870729408
i am yet living   108.63357044906148
the poor girl ventured a glance at d artagnan which said see how i suffer on your account   119.73717978058617
great undertakings come poorly off with paltry means   151.16365246933177
dantès looked in fear and wonder at the livid countenance of faria whose eyes already dull and sunken were surrounded by purple circles while his lips were white as those of a corpse and his very hair seemed to stand on end   141.3880476795495
there is nothing so convincing as a firm conviction   36.90090644689023
they waited upwards of ten minutes   121.79843970450322
only three or four days ago the impertinent jackanapes gave me his bill and i was forced to turn both him and his bill out of the door   146.49478064302133
he was less stiff than formerly   75.01101883271517
five hundred leagues are not to be accomplished without some trouble and especially in france where it seems it is forbidden to beat the postilions   116.13123225171982
he longed to be alone and free to ponder over all that had occurred   121.74349205303395
oh how he will thank you   95.34144505138326
oh how our hearts palpitated   110.74360986560713
the ceremony of reception over the four friends were soon in one another s arms   47.06829937071291
if you succeed with him i pronounce you the demon himself   101.02268224257165
a loud laugh followed these words pronounced with that boldness which women draw from their own weakness a weakness which removes them beyond the power of vengeance   43.78034273776528
i only brought you here to ask you returned mazarin smiling if you have taken any particular notice of our lieutenant of musketeers   125.93625142669777
and her looks fixed on the future beheld nothing but the high fortunes reserved for her by the cardinal whom she had so successfully served without his name being in any way mixed up with the sanguinary affair   117.77978793255417
oh my father must your past career always interfere with my successes   41.55401802171049
said busoni disdainfully   127.92563810860152
i swear i will not   71.2023801213559
parry resumed his reading   128.43044419686322
now said morrel do you wish me to retire   137.18603869874192
remove from me the remains of doubt which if it change not to conviction must become remorse   172.60444385988623
but this was not the time for recrimination so he assumed his most agreeable manner and said with a gracious smile excuse me sir but are they not going to give me any dinner   85.09199230814531
that was something   54.67784671700562
are there any more slaves to be had who bear this beautiful name   168.08394033967306
farewell till we meet again said aramis as they took leave of planchet   160.12273502698565
i wish that this event which on the day it is known will completely change the aspect of affairs should be accomplished without the knowledge of any others but yourself myself and a third person   101.26591316021955
your home is a paradise porthos   142.4644031470163
the two friends looked to the right to the left   87.23630691343814
come cheer up   74.81323708111032
do you see madame he recognizes you and bows   107.1168201493693
struck in the breast and extending his arms the spaniard fell back on the crupper and the terrified horse turning around carried him off   69.27482658752427
for i have such a delightful note on the pastor quum traheret wait and i will listen to you afterwards   173.4777890001266
five minutes later he was in the rue des fossoyeurs   131.69034904277888
denis a strategic maneuver which having been executed with equal punctuality was crowned with the most fortunate results   120.31204360969765
three soldiers fell dead and one of the pioneers was wounded   137.28239945430175
we are so good and gentle to your eminence   137.5871377542971
i am sorry too monsieur   111.31823910109273
de tréville who had a tincture of literature and monsieur de benserade was quoting it to me the other day   118.81104902019791
he struck his pocket and said we shall see what monsieur de tréville will think of this insult offered to his protégé   44.97744750011675
frankly and loyally repeated milady with an unspeakable expression of duplicity   120.09200767854438
behind this wall   79.97640326231952
you are late   125.66072181771243
but said albert emitting a volume of smoke and balancing his chair on its hind legs only madmen or blockheads like us ever do travel   181.08522312137475
whatever may happen valentine do not be alarmed   178.46311372082428
you may guess finding the luck turned that i again staked the diamond   100.15101433284113
i have my answer ready   59.895375003017655
monsieur de belliere said he to one of them do me the favor to take the reins from the hands of this worthy man mount upon the box and drive to the door of the private stair and wait for me there   114.02964131179047
as you execute you will understand   142.7813633109742
but from whom is that letter   53.33782572085628
then demanded athos   86.81712201105844
the cardinal has a tenacious memory and a long arm   168.61980318475082
i forgot said athos laughing   159.6704151844101
oh sire   48.34415582052529
the king feared an outbreak   132.4426147906711
what do you want you strumpet   131.67938707706966
five hundred pistoles   148.2870903405042
listen madame and recall your remembrances   111.61750265998384
the only thing is to understand it   99.16009745813813
in that case adieu   100.71786633981996
was it from london you brought that beautiful diamond that glitters on your finger   163.33559430984062
decidedly   118.31949595866205
he shall receive them on returning from the mayor s20   57.87467890846343
and still further it is very probable i should not have done anything of this if it had not been to make myself agreeable to someone who is my lady as the queen is yours   129.15540957953826
replied planchet astonished   70.0734059509852
you see in me such as i am a person sentenced to be hung   161.1849113140962
madame said the president you have engaged to furnish the committee with some important particulars respecting the affair at yanina and you have stated that you were an eyewitness of the event   191.47830483298986
their legs began to tremble and the foam they shed whitened the doublets of their masters   137.20018868389604
i wished to explain this plan to you on the day you received my first invitation   94.00948649906401
the weather was dull and stormy a cold wind shook the few remaining yellow leaves from the boughs of the trees and scattered them among the crowd which filled the boulevards   184.89405375523097
they were playing together as usual when seven o clock sounded   82.78029719345943
he then formed a resolution   138.91833518241427
mademoiselle said he you have a sacred duty to fulfil in your deceased grandmother s room will you allow me the honor of a few minutes conversation with m   114.12238524851834
danglars conceals at least half of his fortune   107.6501689983204
but he well knew that it was not in a piece of furniture that the queen would place the important letter she had written that day   85.9596466703033
17 the genoese conspirator   130.25166863115237
turned returned and arranged them so as to enable me to express my thoughts through their medium   58.01525329232417
really sir d artagnan said to him i am pleased to find one with whom to talk in my own poor tongue   74.11526215523986
the notary here descended and valentine was informed that her grandmother was alone   148.85102902469873
to wait   173.1594768594954
dantès though almost sure as to what course the vessel would take had yet watched it anxiously until it tacked and stood towards him   37.828118901480224
i shall have nothing to do but to fold my arms   115.06193516407183
where are your passports   80.1199272571084
you can indeed when the arrow lights point downward on somebody s head   95.97555156128311
this voice the sound of which reached d artagnan reawakened in his heart a thousand sentiments a thousand recollections that he had forgotten   11.177785503859141
from shoulder to elbow it was moulded after the arms of germain pillon s graces 23 but the fore arm seemed to be slightly distorted by convulsion and the hand so delicately formed was resting with stiff outstretched fingers on the framework of the bed   101.08733447596049
and previously where were you   168.00639177356408
and if at the expiration of ten minutes you do not see me come out return to my hôtel for it will be useless for you to wait for me longer   148.94226671125256
d artagnan said that in the attack of last night eight or ten frenchmen were killed and as many rochellais   94.234350759203
the comtesse de morcerf who is aristocracy and refinement itself does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with one of ignoble birth   70.23391954164951
your fine chateau is worthy of affording its princely hospitality to his eminence   142.57520754223233
we shall not be safe till we have seen mazarin and then the devil   132.1381816020047
at nine o clock lord de winter made his customary visit examined the window and the bars sounded the floor and the walls looked to the chimney and the doors without during this long and minute examination he or milady pronouncing a single word   90.89615172305123
then disguised in the clothes of the marquis d o he had left the hotel stumbling over the bodies of an officer and two guards who had been killed whilst defending the street door   101.58735848164208
on the contrary my boy on the contrary i am pleased with your zeal   125.95682825436158
he saluted and made a movement to depart   81.92313122327998
my air is excellent   126.61688604475577
then he added to himself these english revolutionists are all beggars and ill bred   79.58735886231838
nevertheless it is necessary that my will should be respected in my family and that the folly of an old man and the caprice of a child should not be allowed to overturn a project which i have entertained for so many years   127.31756196252918
the eyes of noirtier glistened and d avrigny approached   96.0748553745242
on hearing the password germain bowed   165.97406498369963
it is you accordingly that i have pitched upon to conduct the king and the queen to saint germain   105.73295723998055
mazarin read and construed that smile   146.5791060447915
milady that woman so courageous and firm shivered in spite of herself   116.95392587350862
he entered the marshal s apartment while i was there   182.74412414596537
perceiving that he was alone he rose and making a little circuit passed close to the cavalier who was speaking to the sentinel   95.32190203221091
i am well furnished with such playthings   97.515226202695
i will not allow the prefect of police to interfere with my private affairs   108.9958367797348
i thought that my entreaties what right have you any more than the rest to ask for an exception   38.70369747649923
if i am happy in an error do not have the cruelty to lift me from it   48.7966859159218
be content   115.92594033706894
when valentine pale with emotion had wiped away a tear   56.66636463291805
he examined the bullets with which monte cristo performed this dexterous feat and saw that they were no larger than buckshot   56.900323662311344
it seems to me said d artagnan with a thousand livres each i do not speak as a spartan but as a procurator this word procurator roused porthos   117.76331072354586
really how very amusing   169.32463859596314
still confidence was not restored to all minds and the general opinion was that the complete ruin of the unfortunate shipowner had been postponed only until the end of the month   99.22486433541224
wrapped in this sweet idea d artagnan waited half an hour without the least impatience his eyes fixed upon that charming little abode of which he could perceive a part of the ceiling with its gilded moldings attesting the elegance of the rest of the apartment   160.17647208938493
noirtier s breathing came thick and short   67.67180402197313
in that m   56.03856743200702
and unlike cromwell who disposes of both houses mazarin has had the queen to support him in his struggle with the parliament   131.3491055312178
my dear albert said he let me introduce to you m   182.93089122202394
but i shall remain firm in my determination and the world shall see which party has reason on his side   103.61721185622113
oh see maximilian see the power you have over me you almost make me believe you   73.79592310982335
the boat went on but the prisoner thought only of mercédès   170.9526064727731
the four gentlemen stopped near them   130.620545819466
a bed of dried grass covered with goat skins was placed in one corner   101.40826863570777
yes tis too true said comminges tis almost a prison   179.37556712658883
why you strike like a blind or a deaf man   88.62462711838413
that an unfaithful tutor bought over by the enemies of your family by the corsinari   96.52497119255523
and if i gave them their way they would assassinate hang and make away with me in the same manner although they have nothing to complain of except a tax or two now and then   136.80182617352725
a letter from charles the first   120.37164612130013
oh no self love beauchamp   200.52521739534086
he could say no more   91.52158811060865
two hundred louis each of us would be making a pretty thing of it   43.75108881982109
the banker accompanied him to the door   131.6967014896058
he saw d artagnan s movement heard the sound of the click and stopped at once   127.36943342437833
chapter 92   189.5324424930037
the musketeer advanced two steps and pushed d artagnan aside with his hand   79.11742432762071
all three then sat down with their heads together and their ears on the alert   93.43376170622429
coquenard had ascended   128.67822138638067
yes the enemy   106.59790969474187
these different sciences that you have made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of them and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced them this is my treasure my beloved friend and with this you have made me rich and happy   153.7953942547662
at the end of two hours as porthos did not come not any news of him they resumed their journey   128.81955612992286
on the sixth day the smugglers returned   108.40434038115758
no my lord and i will set out at once   86.40793907677353
therefore while repeating to himself that his death was inevitable he did not make up his mind to die quietly as one less courageous and less restrained might have done in his place   71.6282149419828
i can see nothing but his back resumed grimaud   144.31103803686005
what an injustice my dear invalid   136.32486145112185
now my fault is repaired   112.52666341619042
gervais followed by grimaud who carried the basket ignorant of where he was going but in the passive obedience which athos had taught him not even thinking of asking   138.38379597060504
if you do not come across one return for me   127.07971517395177
yes you saw only the torrent that threatened to overturn everything and you gave no attention to the still water   110.29189687844683
my only regret is not having seen d artagnan   158.79702649329258
oh you are so kind and i am so grateful   230.15982722220724
heyday   154.32021447413695
and bazin three hundred livres for going and three hundred livres for returning that will reduce the sum to five thousand livres   125.29015803494552
the count bowed and contented himself with seeing villefort to the door of his cabinet the procureur being escorted to his carriage by two footmen who on a signal from their master followed him with every mark of attention   145.03175173163308
monsieur porthos gave us a note for his duchess ordering us to put it in the post   72.97915543676179
take my advice renounce this woman   93.04612365418768
moreover in defending ourselves we shall cover ourselves with glory   138.0536118796158
morrel had passed many an anxious hour   122.66054221311758
every day our desks are loaded with most circumstantial denunciations coming from hosts of people who hope for some return for services which they seek to render but can not   133.85443877096122
pistache my friend jump for the illustrious coxcomb mazarin de piscina   182.78721197013573
you descend to the garden by the same staircase by which he descended   206.2097387763822
four shallops came off with very little noise alongside the lugger which no doubt in acknowledgement of the compliment lowered her own shallop into the sea and the five boats worked so well that by two o clock in the morning all the cargo was out of la jeune amélie and on terra firma   126.31667720047514
take it to rothschild s or lafitte s and they will take it off your hands at once   128.5523693931255
believe me there are only the two plans i have proposed to you   180.02730876725929
and god grant that this woman who has scarcely entered into your life may not leave a terrible trace in it   160.9361318737821
marry forsooth people don t die of hunger here   62.70224843590246
he aspires to the hand of the proud eugénie   96.14857459366436
morrel good worthy man said caderousse   73.76722352125486
athos entered without the least mistrust and took out two pistoles to pay the bill   128.1905581350781
to one in edmond s position the diamond certainly was of great value   176.81596436421188
the king looked at the three gentlemen   101.57435634129267
it is in fact magnificent said andrea   20.932615975293047
copyright law   104.44461471442514
you evidently know her   116.78625411243168
as for me replied porthos i am falling asleep which is strange considering we have not had any fighting   203.19378397483513
i will profit by the advice   91.35499089266867
he did not look like an executioner   115.65869304778705
even beauchamp accorded twenty lines in his journal to the relation of the count s courage and gallantry thereby celebrating him as the greatest hero of the day in the eyes of all the feminine members of the aristocracy   124.05169272238143
how curious   149.57205325409785
che cosa   130.69221381284032
ah said monte cristo 1815 is not yesterday   140.56811391062706
then what toil and fatigue has it not been to remove huge stones i should once have deemed impossible to loosen   149.58612948844214
because my lord said haydée eagerly my miseries recall to me the remembrance of your goodness   53.51428551796724
did you feel nothing of it yesterday or the day before   91.42189734714248
he arose and quietly opening the door of the drawing room saw haydée who had fallen on a chair with her arms hanging down and her beautiful head thrown back   207.16508117074773
i confess i began to be very uneasy on your account   99.1493470936084
the woman whom you and your masters commanded me to kill milady   107.99601927679657
let us dispense with useless words   87.71605387948583
everything will come to us when wanted   57.972573457210885
i did not say that i feared it   84.90788610965669
are you going to drown me   170.70559240673956
as for me i am quite sure that after turning out all my pockets and emptying my drawers i shall not find ten louis at home   205.61516522675817
de baradas by the comte de cramail and by the chevalier de souveray   137.70588200972486
he has insulted you and he shall die   130.2262424494097
my friend who was seigneur of the country might have seduced her or taken her by force at his will for he was master   113.70522972973733
you are displeased at the silence i have preserved on the subject   187.03232070798566
yes there were some people on the way who delayed me   166.11754602700657
dear maximilian believe me when i assure you that if i do not attempt to resist my father s commands it is more on your account than my own   123.32607036306945
as he alighted comminges approached him   81.21948932171696
milady knew that lord de winter lied and she was the more alarmed   223.35385004397386
faria saw this   153.84343318923925
his first and most indelible recollections were there   113.69572183810963
and if besides the pleasure of being in garrison here we must hear such things as these no mortal can hold out   106.82643934089829
it has been long enough to inflict on me a great and undeserved misfortune   143.6633760730318
don t let us talk politics my lord   109.3744230885185
villefort rang   219.2956484104172
however continued faria seeing that the inspector was about to depart it is not absolutely necessary for us to be alone   93.85190745598182
ah count he esteems you so highly tell him that he has spoken amiss   107.04410517353718
we thought he must have made a mistake in counting his money but he persisted in the accuracy of his statement   145.98333297778325
must this last formality take place in your presence sir   70.97873744208194
replied albert clasping in his convulsed grasp the glove which monte cristo did not lose sight of   169.72997886829455
well said milady i have not seen our gascon this evening   108.98344861362767
almost instantly a female head was put out at the window with two fingers placed upon her mouth either to enjoin silence or to send him a kiss   124.94181510224792
listen it is impossible   112.07343074806751
because in truth albert you hesitate   114.42743328319538
i bear that of your brother   87.70405350651157
asked aramis half hidden by the window curtain   118.7061634112594
now said he will you come   140.9833676873826
morrel horrified supported his head with one hand and with the other pressed his heart lest its beatings should be heard   147.0893874147318
yes madame here i have a right to do so for it concerns monsieur d artagnan d artagnan he repeated in such a manner as to bow the regal brow with recollections of the weak and erring woman   112.5762415235446
the persons whose names were thus pronounced looked at the stranger with astonishment   101.28346327831164
let us lose no time   181.05506366598678
now my dear count he said let us on with all the speed we may   168.1720988939229
i go at once   127.30959752862421
the cardinal had little notes thrown over in which he represented to the rochellais how unjust selfish and barbarous was the conduct of their leaders   152.04658865213548
noirtier possessed this peculiarity he never projected any utopian schemes which could never be realized but strove for possibilities and he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of the mountain theories that never shrank from any means that were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result   65.00386861646882
porthos impatient at his continued losses kept up a vigorous play with his knee   168.19917132891075
he hesitated a moment he was so very desirous to complete the poor devil s punishment   66.26208705994578
inquired the steward   59.3454192141694
meanwhile lord de winter the deputies the leaders of the expedition the officers of buckingham s household had all made their way into the chamber   150.16053916174576
with these words he held out to the queen the two studs the cardinal had given him   140.4983366012375
bonacieux made no reply   98.07446038815688
he said at last   142.73873364666142
bertuccio alone turned pale whenever benedetto s name was mentioned in his presence but there was no reason why anyone should notice his doing so   119.34086383830089
well you must allow it is the best thing for the stomach   138.47351954997214
are we not going   51.82256046862976
asked emmanuel   73.77233566240955
let me see it said milady   99.33072191906187
and as soon as the siege of la rochelle is terminated i promise you on my part good cried athos good   104.92873033718237
but it was too far off and there was not light enough to enable selim where he was standing to distinguish and recognize the object presented to his view   56.27662552290966
you can not condemn me   89.60798207673405
on the other hand he was about to land without any other escort than these men on an island which had indeed a very religious name but which did not seem to franz likely to afford him much hospitality thanks to the smugglers and bandits   49.12827792172595
there will be extenuating circumstances he replied   109.35064331572588
perfectly just cried the other two guardsmen the judgment of king solomon   136.14945894438182
well in the first place here is my chisel   88.45908379946735
and you say this treasure amounts to two millions of roman crowns   93.54591400975201
but this crowd represented chiefly the second class of nobility while the prince de conti the duc de beaufort and the coadjutor assembled around them the first nobility of france   118.08304765711634
i am the son of him who served in the religious wars under the great king henry the father of his gracious majesty   117.08600911066225
nor hang me   143.68765213016874
it is this i swear by my honor not to reveal to anyone what i have seen and heard on the 5th of february 1815 between nine and ten o clock in the evening   122.27442511690712
but can they will they receive an unhappy king who will bring such a sad story into a country already agitated by civil discord   116.8981563866751
and as he said this the eye severe of the magistrate had lost nothing of its habitual arrogance   33.09846258906576
what was the subject of my thoughts from the time consciousness returned to me   144.4921013449793
he can he says only swim in rivers   42.65199034237702
he hastily seized the coverlet of his bed and wrapped it round him   74.08626286187925
but in the midst of all this carelessness it was evident that they mutually observed each other   95.26554158899597
besides be assured my dear edmond the dungeon i am about to leave will not long remain empty   84.6931074109628
not nearly indeed   123.11293825601842
then we are once more reunited   108.04430010175098
why did you not come down to breakfast   132.1204547736781
don t speak of marseilles i beg of you maximilian   132.92289632304443
the four friends followed ten paces behind him   48.76441231514854
to no one   0.7725014012425788
be it so replied the cardinal   74.91073676888705
inquired the unknown   116.55827788631824
there was so much firmness in the look which gave this answer no one could at any rate doubt his will if they did his power   128.74743427569808
pardon madame he said i am not a lawyer i am a mere soldier and probably therefore i do not quite comprehend the value of certain words   160.16600527375445
d artagnan inquired for the confidential valet of the duke who having accompanied him in all his voyages spoke french perfectly well   142.74678345872098
nay i will go still further and say that i had previously made up my mind to ask a great favor at your hands   115.27346748757438
if i tell you one thing you will be so amiable as to set aside all impediments   173.1028046257996
a few men the least impressed of all by the scene pronounced a discourse some deploring this premature death others expatiating on the grief of the father and one very ingenious person quoting the fact that valentine had solicited pardon of her father for criminals on whom the arm of justice was ready to fall until at length they exhausted their stores of metaphor and mournful speeches elaborate variations on the stanzas of malherbe to du périer   63.05669926345946
bravo porthos   87.91864555399383
the duke was in full strength and beat la ramee completely   91.5655046801009
milady listened with the greatest attention and yet it was easily to be perceived whatever effort she made to conceal her impressions that this recital was not agreeable to her   106.24452764369856
to doubt any longer was impossible   223.32952421177853
on the morrow at three o clock in the afternoon they arrived at surgères   143.32403265110693
you understand it signifies nothing to me so long as you pay for your lessons out of your own cash box   107.06561058555718
and that valor would shrink from no undertaking according to what i see   189.13857435103557
at this moment the light of the torch was reflected on the wall   129.1937812249613
i hope you will be satisfied with its contents   66.07873602652386
50229m as he repassed the catalans the count turned around and burying his head in his cloak murmured the name of a woman   91.98472417525721
asked caderousse in a choking voice   107.32540965125528
i do indeed   82.0922107237706
what is his bearing   133.39433689432468
i have full and perfect confidence in him   64.4560908680393
pâtés made by the successor of father marteau are described   116.86556580938762
where the devil will constancy niche itself next   168.57419382653416
no he merely drew a pocketbook from his pocket and took from it a paper folded in four and after having examined it in a manner almost reverential he said good   114.50238638961967
allow me then to avoid dishonor by death   4.185831039330068
what are the wishes of his eminence   131.6982379363252
but why do you ask   113.08646877558105
it was a strange thing that no one ever appeared to advance a step in that man s favor   56.314092514855794
well then i will tell you what we must do   138.99285215354644
the old man signified that he recollected him   90.2963719388363
on the floor above were similar rooms with the addition of a third formed out of the antechamber   48.12260297413442
he had scarcely finished when d artagnan made such a furious lunge at him that if he had not sprung nimbly backward it is probable he would have jested for the last time   150.28463249968394
if you are young i will be your comrade   112.9186618859752
well said the cardinal then it will be time to claim the order which you just now required   138.46093469611614
50205m these words had scarcely escaped him when the carriage was on its way and the feet of the horses struck a shower of sparks from the pavement   44.05903906985232
he had recognized by certain unmistakable signs that his fair incognita belonged to the aristocracy   134.14560020280626
suddenly the tumult ceased as if by magic and the doors of the church opened   91.69566084285512
the duc de beaufort drew his sword   142.44456884954417
then too my father is not a person whose orders may be infringed with impunity   157.54218301432604
really said monte cristo lowering his voice you do not appear to me to be very enthusiastic on the subject of this marriage   176.59780052795864
monsieur de cavois   118.47457732287756
but where and how shall i see you again   93.74613668270524
you know sir that before receiving the order one must submit proofs   60.52843239088044
then d artagnan as the reader from whom we have not concealed the state of his fortune very well knows d artagnan was not a millionaire   75.17731099173683
my selfishness will blind me replied morrel whose low voice and clenched hands announced his growing desperation   149.38638734010328
but under what circumstances   96.17218528913045
the clerk continued to write for the next five minutes   82.37759257695659
but yet i do live   193.97671165876744
yes returned d artagnan who had overheard him to night gentlemen we rescue the king   137.56699418614846
this fabulous event formed but a link in a long chain of marvels   117.85705652017934
it was a human storm made up of a thunder of cries and a hail of sweetmeats flowers eggs oranges and nosegays   196.29008365400728
and where do you come from   133.3920326379142
they were speaking in an undertone and yet i was so interested in what they said that i did not lose a single word   135.0012954474244
and instead of expecting him it is he who is awaiting us   78.86554226771028
rise said the count your life is safe   112.94844711486405
mazarin went to the right hand and aramis could see the prisoner disappear at the turning of the avenue   85.84432941364817
and instead of immediately directing her steps towards the gate she seated herself on a bench and carefully casting her eyes around to convince herself that she was not watched she presently arose and proceeded quickly to join maximilian   98.50540382602085
what is there astonishing in that   92.19515033527378
joy takes a strange effect at times it seems to oppress us almost the same as sorrow   135.5164064982491
then embarrassed how to continue such a conversation he opened cromwell s letter   72.74563379132192
aramis is one of my best friends   177.18428512968705
my brother s carriage will be here first   208.158561712112
at the name of lord de winter who was known to be one of his grace s most intimate friends the officer of the post gave orders to let felton pass who besides wore the uniform of a naval officer   61.50106185379989
gaetano reminded him that he had come for the purpose of shooting goats which he had utterly forgotten   137.49251691106608
said all at once a voice full of sweetness and pity   63.30102575041973
and if you grant it me i will bless you in this world and in the next   87.18230944985456
that was the question the three musketeers put to one another   60.37905729521828
i am credited on you for six millions   122.20155169021402
oh save me   129.09499979786733
he was the same man or rather the development of the same man whom we have heretofore seen as assistant attorney at marseilles   130.69082610386127
oh you need not avow this religious indifference my lord   114.12057232597104
30043m a quarter of an hour was the reply   145.63168979413945
what s that   147.7048839580233
he married a woman who keeps a confectioner s shop in the rue des lombards for he s a lad who was always fond of sweetmeats   128.23054607732047
go on to your cousin then   131.1017575273395
i see that i have made a trifling mistake as you say   104.62123592096482
when he raised his head he saw disappearing down the passage nothing but a shadow before which the bandits bowed   20.887073325876116
aha said groslow   99.62299345593306
maximilian shuddered   85.0080931957382
we shall continue our conversation to the end of the village   118.72431879679212
only imagine my dear friend   31.527222960889702
me also   162.79958905505848
de wardes our presumptuous hero gave but little heed to that although the marquis was young handsome rich and high in the cardinal s favor   100.47118260164945
40160m oh reverend sir   135.00312536799765
well asked the abbé as he returned to the apartment below what have you made up your mind to do   196.16483506263398
that s all plain enough   127.51774175589422
see here it is   187.1118445239885
what s your business here you hussy   152.67472557156736
monsieur de beaufort escaped   179.17918384495533
i am bored amuse me   130.03584726548036
what telegraph do you intend visiting   154.1097871592874
her second glance was at the dying man   149.40959780652398
they then left the hotel athos carrying a saw porthos a vise aramis an axe and d artagnan a hammer and some nails   129.15226805542284
monsieur d arminges was already mounted   58.44315048506257
noirtier playing with revolutions m   79.99008930038025
shall i take any arms   175.86966336323744
that there shall be five hundred crowns for you and five hundred crowns for me   110.35914132488675
the vessel was quite ready to sail and the captain was waiting on the wharf   162.8298056147084
do not alarm yourself monsieur we will duly respect your conscience   94.81850021305047
i expected thee said the bandit to rita s father   135.19439090471718
i receive him among the number of my friends   40.83302085679625
edmond thought he was in a dream he wavered between incredulity and joy   98.97952414342039
replied the baron negligently   105.60146064492676
grimaud made the sign yes   139.86107896628778
he watched them pass through the crowd for some time but at length he lost sight of them in the via macello   92.37206338760129
everyone on board remained motionless for half an hour when the same luminous track was again observed and the swimmer was soon on board   52.745403529702074
the law we have seen how quietly mademoiselle danglars and mademoiselle d armilly accomplished their transformation and flight   97.58995303953469
but who told you i was inactive   183.87574013807202
one by the post madame danglars footman left the other   138.5561256927035
that ought to satisfy you   123.69453213431709
the officer seemed a statue   125.82410076055787
then he threw himself dressed as he was upon a sofa less to sleep than to rest his limbs cramped with cold and study   160.57512542990736
when i speak of the pure parliament resumed the host i mean the one which colonel bridge has weeded   130.80881988319467
that s all very well replied d artagnan   198.78415449471535
my first impressions were favorable to the minister   108.89395387954355
the queen untied from around her throat a small golden key which hung there and presented it to the cardinal   177.6958089202746
what are you going to do this evening   143.2356818155043
they had reached the ladder which led to the boat   85.96459372030867
and the notary   79.33100365478802
the same night such a man of regularity was the patron of la jeune amélie the profits were divided and each man had a hundred tuscan livres or about eighty francs   123.04893831866639
he did not know a word of english   125.14059185063688
d artagnan thought it was now time for him to join in the conversation   67.83590644161762
how long i had been in this unconscious state i know not when i was suddenly aroused by the report of a pistol followed by a fearful cry   157.43244206722548
on shore in the grottos or on board in your cloak   143.2563987711347
that glance was so sharp that it penetrated the heart of mazarin who reading in it a declaration of war seized d artagnan by the arm and said if occasion requires monsieur you will remember that man who has just gone out will you not   111.9010665596568
the figures were defined like black shadows on the red tinted horizon   111.87750688333877
d épinay and that your father was resolved upon completing the match and that from his will there was no appeal as m   101.9834832095096
yes returned dantès holding out his hand i thank you again   50.192726227210635
but have you no request to make for yourself mercédès   182.36677803160615
then it is because you do not know your friends my dear monsieur louvieres said the coadjutor raising his hat   103.39356025857371
they will have nothing to do then at this end   107.24022918673649
he came to demand five millions at once which i paid him with checks on the bank   86.64941849110063
i am an old soldier of rocroy my lord   59.72460229397787
it is olivain who leaves me   52.785648815917604
his carelessness and indifference touch me to the heart said julie   87.89840601310948
he admired the strong hands the broad shoulders and the steady eye of porthos   130.11626819511258
it is that the king should deign to stand godfather to the son of madame de longueville   172.50664419242705
the french fight well   44.75683893068167
he s my friend and this morning offered to share his money with me as i shared mine with him   154.5816753201953
quite   109.14430395573528
and our masters   98.52840316380421
excellency said pastrini i am delighted to have your approbation but it was not for that i came   194.05459156097865
look added he   112.52842332596738
a summer and winter palace   99.78889495957232
then said aramis i take upon myself to obtain intelligence of her   95.90727827598094
at five o clock anne went to the cardinal s room   102.70650193679441
a gentleman of high birth possessor of an ample fortune you have consented to gain your promotion as an obscure soldier step by step this is uncommon   198.21715848262014
sometimes grimaud who feared his master as he did fire while entertaining a strong attachment to his person and a great veneration for his talents believed he perfectly understood what he wanted flew to execute the order received and did precisely the contrary   166.75801463770506
this time my determination is irrevocably taken   154.98470872262942
nothing very difficult   91.00586084075451
all the details of his coming into and going out of the palace on the night when he introduced himself in the character of an italian fortune teller you will tell him that he may not doubt the correctness of my information   35.47259236332104
de saint méran and noirtier had never been on strict terms of friendship   68.73825259227502
cried the citizen   113.4530347123117
wait said monte cristo i wish to take one final glance around this room   79.37043224324566
he had not the less decided upon setting out that same evening   207.61475925296213
tell me should you have the misfortune to turn your head while your right hand correspondent was telegraphing i should not see him   96.62760258770003
and a threatening glance darted from her eyes   103.59798160011091
i will try and gain a little sleep for you are saved   117.70809327886565
go to work labor young man struggle ardently and courageously   158.64279753188364
at this moment planchet brought out athos s horse   118.28644665059716
valentine rose quickly and was hastening joyfully towards the door when m   73.02287978766263
ah said andrea who knows   127.5521677450882
as the night before d artagnan did not return home till five o clock in the morning   134.35239909490303
in the meanwhile the hours passed if not rapidly at least tolerably   72.12864784219869
no wounded his horse only   181.94248383452884
the will   128.307660120354
or he will forget us added d artagnan   79.62933118565776
not without my defending it said groslow   108.25642788916628
cried aramis almost in a state of delirium   152.17986321369915
presently it sounded one o clock   91.88005723616084
but doubtless the spot they chose did not suit the smuggler who filled the post of sentinel for he cried out not that way if you please   110.54111994114758
and where is this house that i purchase   110.93345940397228
exclaimed aramis that is the nephew the monk and the son of milady as he says himself   162.5002682259311
they were listened to with great politeness by the duke who held out hopes of easier measures promised to speak in their behalf to the queen and dismissed them with the ordinary expression of royalty we will see what we can do   79.33851022856507
the certificate of your marriage with oliva corsinari and the register of your child s birth   157.4836913321106
undoubtedly said porthos drawing himself up at athos s compliment   103.87127575434985
he thus addressed d artagnan your resistance is useless   230.14856496903752
this would have been a favorable occasion to secure his dinner   60.27054810917774
villefort whispered some words in his ear to which the officer replied by a motion of his head   128.35875194276554
if i want money i can send for some to any of my chateaux   45.43467077392407
well the french did not avenge themselves on the traitor the spaniards did not shoot the traitor ali in his tomb left the traitor unpunished   122.77417925285253
this was the room appropriated to the sailors   224.52678170717388
d artagnan went successively into all the cabarets in which there was a light but could not find planchet in any of them   67.0290619521731
holloa there some bread   67.38988869174574
but for you in the words of the gospel seek and you shall find   164.1860691343885
how did they act with regard to the maréchale d ancre   36.401286112430796
at length she heard the grating of the hinges of the opening gates   45.38123024200411
and he had hastened to saint germain to warn the queen of that disappearance   177.2711165089758
he is a glutton   165.13227731356938
yes yes father tell me where it is and he opened two or three cupboards   178.03603863448006
yesterday afternoon i received a letter from m   157.390292456594
poor devil   3.1374775399167305
the ghost of former greatness   106.22344058938198
to quote some latin verses i have forgotten or rather never knew well the thunderbolt never falls on the valleys and i am a valley dear rochefort one of the lowliest of the low   111.64025009225344
bonacieux retired   104.04891007164568
but does he not approach the walls while playing   52.30589830168019
but his confidence in grimaud whose petty persecutions he now perceived were only a blind increased and he conceived the highest opinion of his intellect and resolved to trust entirely to his guidance   29.411721461322045
you are charged with having corresponded with the enemies of the kingdom   75.80793098712081
you do not sanction our project   191.12501842868556
well your eternal city is a nice sort of place   148.4712187975094
but what is this that i hear from her majesty the queen of england   162.22824468257613
well while taking my walk i will call on him and we will talk   143.98519823340695
they locked the mercer in the same dungeon where he had passed the night and left him to himself during the day   137.0113929279999
but as you were not guilty of any crime as you were not guilty of any intrigue as you in short knew nothing that could compromise yourself or anybody else i attached no more importance to that event than it merited   143.33661260651476
continued the notary addressing the old man   127.80700879333884
chapter 105   119.27634721785007
how long a start have they   137.34839464526317
he reached it before the carriage arrived   100.92297492882912
who said valentine was dead   55.56418260928324
the prince followed him with his eyes and continued looking at the door   197.4537744719217
and the travelers continued their route   139.5783604808917
but enough of money matters   81.73090529487465
chapter 67   126.00092190594648
i spoke to benedetto alone and proposed to him to accompany me endeavoring to tempt him by all the promises most likely to dazzle the imagination of a child of twelve   40.21338317867175
no one in truth   100.74084746062995
there on a table surrounded at some distance by a large and luxurious divan every species of tobacco known from the yellow tobacco of petersburg to the black of sinai and so on along the scale from maryland and porto rico to latakia was exposed in pots of crackled earthenware of which the dutch are so fond   120.51225116163535
said d artagnan half rising and bowing   171.75010952599823
it was you who sent for me   87.04125319741868
it was indeed planchet and grimaud   81.63710865102664
you run no risks with me   171.27703074483946
dantès closely and eagerly examined it   127.15709475716234
milady uttered a stifled groan   204.96450030801668
that poor planchet   74.47556048693332
all this savors of his eminence a league off   171.41940807421958
but not a word or look implied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the person with whom he was then conversing   111.24984432433783
you really wish to see her   77.54176715732959
i want faithful servants   142.45918285660852
and sir where does he reside pray   94.46110968140934
of course it is of no consequence he added with a withering smile   119.6635907902361
nor i said athos   66.82500724043999
monte cristo heard and saw nothing or rather he only saw morrel whose calmness had a frightful effect on those who knew what was passing in his heart   107.98703657386355
i faith i don t know   66.64402128944721
i shall either return for them myself or shall send a courier directing you to bring them to me   130.61695787108326
all the same resumed he after having clicked his tongue against his palate they are brave fellows   63.87554898570282
i cried bitterly and tried to raise my mother from the earth but she was dead   44.1411262764711
one of them hat in hand said to him would you believe it monsieur   145.47692195281317
it only remains for me to know whether i also suit you   107.65253924504182
i come in the name of our master ali tepelini   88.83952094308101
andrea shrugged his shoulders   125.0184106297751
have you sir asked he a letter accrediting you to me   138.664007933201
i quote a fact that is all   107.42553534532367
this suits me the better said rochefort as i wish to continue my journey   132.02921981028723
but with regard to yours   56.81710216666975
everything else might be guessed but not that   173.59320634182805
monsieur porthos said she i can assure you that you have severely punished me   62.21614624930769
the very circumstances which inflict on you as a principal in the tragic scene enacted here such painful emotions are to me on the contrary a source of something like contentment and serve but to enhance the value of this dwelling in my estimation   128.15343822253155
these details will guide her on her part and on your return i shall perhaps have some good news to tell you   125.22299826675264
and even if i had felt a wish to witness the spectacle i might have done so from monte pincio   49.59972940410008
well that is not impossible   128.67753968213864
she called the maid and questioned her   181.57999460780638
you confess it   103.17838711133739
but would you ruin me   148.176906043595
the eye of noirtier beamed with triumph   130.0878081825693
while on the extreme verge of the horizon might be seen the fishermen s boats white and graceful as the sea gull or the merchant vessels bound for corsica or spain   185.76695154395284
and the cardinal was at that period what we now call a man of progress   134.5719057925009
would you not trust the cavalcanti   187.62400633972754
then she retired as silently as she had come merely saying to laporte try my dear laporte to make the king more courteous to monsieur le cardinal to whom both he and i are under such important obligations   78.3394701657391
you have deceived me   125.75744432996504
the rest that had been thus afforded to men and horses enabled them to continue their journey at a good round pace   51.26647671588208
then the letter that villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind and every line gleamed forth in fiery letters on the wall like the mene mene tekel upharsin of belshazzar   33.46428334143948
laurels however were not meat and drink and the people had for some time been in a state of discontent   64.71799494208756
charles had heard and understood it all   139.2550387372682
i have torn up two of my shirts and as many handkerchiefs as i was master of to complete the precious pages   158.25025550764977
where you please my dear child   123.90150550728953
the signature was indeed fixed to take place at nine o clock but perhaps valentine will not wait for that   70.35042161398923
no excellency i do not recollect telling you that   53.05292256375702
and now replied d artagnan behold the sad spectacle that awaits us   63.16051400743215
read the examination and saw that the name of noirtier was not mentioned in it   140.38966953428343
you must depart instantly monsieur   152.38183872461877
you saw the child pass through the rue richelieu last year who amused himself with killing his brothers and sisters by sticking pins in their ears while they slept   89.31242652798424
you laugh   74.37563433866066
remain parry   106.48015822262532
let him have it let him have it she said   128.88050929730628
a most edifying representative i shall make of all the domestic virtues don t you think so   95.01641810572842
besides the king i am certain awaits your majesty s reply before risking anything   130.82355003272056
pardon gentlemen par murmured the voice which could now only be heard in inarticulate sounds   83.3970867033718
asked d artagnan in that rallying tone which may indicate either compassion or mockery   151.10700767308475
he therefore drew near to the table and took the second glass   96.93547105845597
the marquis will give you some papers which will certify this fact and authorize you to appear under that name in the parisian world   191.7904868106388
he has already proved himself full of resources   117.85270660015657
there was only a change of bridegrooms   105.89343566130289
but however profound was this darkness my eyes began to accustom themselves to it   142.45883672552137
that grimaud shall wait on us at table   66.08680211124903
danglars was out but the count was asked to go and see the baroness and he accepted the invitation   163.0396848518214
in an instant we were on the alert but it was too late   111.99402236805861
how do you do my dear son   152.37477613818442
indeed answered maximilian   87.42321420982046
mazarin leaned out of the window   85.70583233893814
i recognize monsieur de flamarens   186.08142417638868
you know such news much better than we do   78.79662419131022
excellencies said he the coach is ready   85.28707216283902
athos crossed his arms and bowed his noble head   144.65161957470553
edmond started   106.99022975158921
it is true that the habit of a novice which the young woman wore was not very advantageous in a contest of this kind   160.87652854250769
i understand now why aramis advised me to strangle that horrible mordaunt   90.34663903840826
aw   130.07487590131996
was his verdict   57.79573957363491
but i am sure of one thing that those who laugh at him in his presence will never laugh a second time   111.56479215633384
when i presented myself before you for the first time in london it was to ask you what had become of my fortune   5.337219066244401
grimaud waited till he heard the bolt grind in the lock and when he was satisfied that he was alone he slowly rose from his recumbent posture   81.86646229185081
the comte de la fere and the chevalier d herblay said aramis   45.22131817696547
who will support them   77.9753147148262
20207m ground arms exclaimed the chief with an imperative sign of the hand while with the other he took off his hat respectfully   119.97831584788874
the silence of earth and heaven is alone broken by the noise made by the crackling branches of hedges planted around the monuments   161.65432986275826
it is necessary to inspire confidence in that poor little madame bonacieux   145.00678626124287
he is black and can not speak returned monte cristo   54.95174052726164
oh yes they will   160.00160810194834
oh you knew that well enough before speaking to me said andrea becoming more and more excited   213.69415078837267
two of the men from jacopo s boat came on board the yacht to assist in navigating it and he gave orders that she should be steered direct to marseilles   155.75897269971122
the whole city seemed peopled with fantastic beings   85.00314056263772
planchet said d artagnan cocking his pistols i will take charge of the one at the top   154.67301215526828
was it not by chance the count of monte cristo bought that house   57.3353063915156
interrupted valentine   69.12911155367985
then noirtier raised his eyes to heaven as though to remind his son of a forgotten oath   163.27618122449516
the guests looked at each other   78.83582096598946
there would be a very simple means very natural tell me what   169.72967607139836
he wanted to inspire not a sudden repugnance but a good sound steady hatred   197.29717582895194
a gentleman laughed in my face   130.83561821704154
except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1   31.303876714091047
you know well enough what it is to be unfortunate   89.2429644144787
for a hundred paces he maintained the speed at which he started   65.73211736505975
an opportunity presented itself to him in which there would be at the same time glory to be acquired and money to be gained   120.1797120211399
i have happily only myself in the world to care for   159.02188508965503
and he began his story   144.576474721202
whilst he thus hesitated the host re entered the room followed not only by a surgeon but by many other persons whom curiosity had attracted to the spot   106.55558321722121
you can understand dear friend with what hope i was inspired by that last letter   98.11183691211824
milady plainly perceived that it was now her turn to take part in the scene   162.42229134584323
chapter 81   62.45191301709956
in the meantime the host who entertained no doubt that it was the presence of the young man that drove the stranger from his hostelry re ascended to his wife s chamber and found d artagnan just recovering his senses   78.47090918186203
scarron and raoul laughed   245.12414999303775
and the poor horse resumed the desperate gallop it had kept up since leaving the barrier and arrived steaming at louvres   85.60401995455727
no one knows what has become of it but doubtless it has struck on a rock and foundered   135.76455581953698
then by degrees a cold light crept through the venetian blinds until at length it revealed the objects in the room   75.28474688373296
the pike eels and carp eat greedily always as everybody knows well they feast on the vulture   95.44671823041065
he followed m   92.16244392090177
a large wound extending from the temple to the mouth was bleeding profusely   158.17426337645776
i should make the first a nobleman like athos   53.78520568579127
tis d artagnan s sword he said   54.14139878883717
he listened attentively and fancied that he discovered through three or four rather frivolous adventures that the count like himself had a secret to hide in the depths of his heart   100.27842639395963
think again do you not recollect me   162.46262089953842
coquenard smiled and upon a sign from her everyone eagerly took his seat   24.050476780189967
presently   207.08310097326864
now you must permit me to take my leave of you   92.36214694204743
first m   89.72000954779264
well then and so he is in paris   178.38843270978
then ten years of age went in state under pretext of returning thanks for his recovery from the small pox to notre dame   94.87718195259404
the court itself did not seek to restrain the feelings of the audience   85.1205144127407
because you met him at my house just after his introduction into the world as they told me   93.15932385983582
given at constantinople by authority of his highness in the year 1247 of the hegira   89.91039964098474
but he was present at the deathbed of a man who knew him   109.09554947338395
this evening especially aramis was melancholy and thoughtful   21.95206331469643
it is a charming place well supplied with spring water and fine trees   24.467554444839735
i never saw a man with a nobler air than his   45.56620666099222
but what can i do with you   121.59186258060072
my intimacy with the pasha and his unlimited confidence had gained me an introduction to them and i had seen them above twenty times   103.88220625097512
de villefort felt no effects   149.21296610956676
he had arranged everything for her escape   110.92523918433976
will the petition go soon   119.94639654403635
that s not fair said the seaman who had saved dantès   89.81397531473785
but in this world a man does not thrive the better for being honest   114.72467970782316
monte cristo started   148.00575618812957
it was an impossibility   76.99061284851376
in the first place it had been made by a man quite drunk to one who was half drunk   83.53556236070284
exclaimed the baroness without expressing the ideas which the exclamation betrayed   106.31391471905043
aramis reflected for a minute and then said coloring will it be really rendering you a service d artagnan   96.08839198627236
barrois muttered a few unintelligible words   142.7711765342083
in the king s service   17.23726730413999
porthos is in picardy   88.66970820647576
i have this instant left him replied mordaunt alighting in order to give his horse to a soldier to hold   83.57690343197262
i had previously inquired of dantès what was his opinion of you and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post for somehow i have perceived a sort of coolness between you   95.73436320636708
and how did this misfortune occur   122.93488512291334
for athos had the solemn voice and the powerful gesture of a judge sent by the lord himself   154.00239728466727
and i said m   111.30155890301033
but the horse and its rider of whom he did not lose sight were evidently sinking   124.55906556552354
she fancies too that she saw a phantom enter her chamber and even heard the noise it made on touching her glass   150.27337590625604
i can see nothing inconvenient in that said the cardinal   162.45667545387806
have you any objection to meet any persons who may be with madame or do you desire to preserve a strict incognito   97.12242450205883
by this time his haggard eyes had the appearance of being ready to start from their sockets   154.10039866964746
you impose upon justice   91.84329203803844
then paused with hand in mid air   69.29452395033863
cried monsieur de bouillon evidently ill at ease   169.32008859380517
so much so that the baroness very rarely comes to the house and my mother has not i think visited madame danglars twice in her whole life   86.59101165464389
the woman whom the count had seen leave the ship with so much regret entered this house   103.74772351492025
it was day   183.35452339447625
out of the hundred and sixty three members designated there were only seventy three present for the rest fearful of taking part in such an act had remained away   162.553342179505
well my dear friend   151.79117638621847
in strafford s company said mordaunt tauntingly   118.66381183322437
replied athos uncovering his breast if your honor requires my death   19.460704937027757
oh nothing worth speaking of said morrel   59.62526854938656
while thus speaking athos regarded with attention the sapphire set with diamonds which had taken on d artagnan s finger the place of the queen s ring carefully kept in a casket   121.07155439945619
the carriage stopped the officer descended approached the guardhouse a dozen soldiers came out and formed themselves in order   112.73961523088259
villefort stood watching breathless until his father had disappeared at the rue bussy   97.10408732186805
here s to porthos and aramis   135.4814895425173
i obey i obey sir   99.78911985551304
and his father s immense riches buried in the quarries of saravezza were a constant theme   186.03002421364442
oh count   126.97710072923859
i have two things to postpone   37.53353598881009
will you not embrace me sir   175.42519581843112
you bought it back then from monsieur des essarts   72.92010435894699
but how will you pass through the barrier without exciting suspicion   65.40170122972418
you say excuse me and you believe that is sufficient   192.09177922824182
by your reckoning i must be forty three at least   128.05204912550602
at three o clock the sound of fireworks let off on the piazza del popolo and the piazza di venezia heard with difficulty amid the din and confusion announced that the races were about to begin   118.47307949084288
but as he said you would make an excellent steward i concluded you had stolen that was all   138.0892779873154
meantime monsieur who knew that from one day to the other he might expect to be removed from his command by the duc d angoulême by bassompierre or by schomberg who were all eager for his post did but little lost his days in wavering and did not dare to attempt any great enterprise to drive the english from the isle of ré where they still besieged the citadel st   79.59126619323277
to the tender eye of a father or a lover the first glance would have sufficed to reveal valentine s condition   91.74229261609992
treat her as one of your sisters   153.68104074681057
tis true answered porthos rising on his saddle in order that he might appraise the immense crowd there are a lot of them   104.7806062544289
on the contrary my dear friend this diamond became our only resource   110.03813091539237
but this vengeance must be grand and striking and worthy in every way of a man who held in his hand as his weapon for combat the forces of a kingdom   77.00935954687812
and at the end of three days when you would be cured well sir it would still do me a great honor to be your man   148.91850540038098
give these happy tidings to your sister my dear cousin   148.2606592976792
well i am sure it is quite transformed since last week   113.52906175946585
where he comes from i am ignorant   103.22329791339487
each register had its number each file of papers its place   90.01803757470623
all this negotiation must be carried on openly   100.68512909211528
you shall have it   162.00030226637318
you will of course dispose of it in some way or other   134.01391418609376
good said the brigadier   108.15261562740237
oh my friend cried dantès on the contrary it seems as if i were reading a most interesting narrative   107.65016321950071
my friendship for him is as strange and unaccountable as his for me   151.34313797194005
for some temperaments work is a remedy for all afflictions   94.66926309457398
what is there more astonishing in all that i have said to you than in what you have told me   146.21360766920634
gentlemen i know i am in the hands of an avenging god   144.59169891062228
ah but you are joking my worthy man   50.26731708170079
do you know what consoled him   205.26038081950534
for shame   145.81591375666602
fernand s paleness appeared to have communicated itself to danglars   93.81277679133972
was this woman english   117.80644683256382
it appears that messieurs the musketeers keep guard said he   223.49986466245707
what is there more   174.03262971982076
there was no response   121.35412926871842
he murmured and slowly returned with one hand wiping his forehead and with the other supporting himself against the wall   99.7770203385214
sir he said are you disposed to confer a great obligation on an unhappy father who has just lost his daughter   121.9071416210108
the black musketeers my lord   75.30302314271367
i sincerely pity you said d artagnan with an air of profound compassion   169.65357518842586
the coachman turning around gave friquet a slash with his whip which made him scream with pain   72.69445270154785
by the way said athos take some pains with your toilet raoul   18.813862255095614
this jewel he bestowed on dantès upon himself quitting the prison as a mark of his gratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which dantès had nursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement   110.52447928902873
with black eyes black hair black eyebrows   150.46598667616203
for when the gentleman was about to set out we perceived that his lackey was saddling monsieur porthos s horse as well as his master s   147.73059120956776
come here fellow   95.50397712316685
let your excellencies only leave the matter to me returned signor pastrini in a tone indicative of unbounded self confidence   154.01995252053086
to the right of the drawing room a library and a study   85.81174257458645
it was warm work   123.59538782761695
did you send this wine aramis   140.95652686184
what do you want m   186.82175976981347
in the proper time and place i will remember everything   125.09297734343721
oh i have done well   132.09619447812406
enough edmond   144.5907441010273
the whole   163.42859305359417
go on my child said the count in the romaic language   67.87326214123172
and this bed with red hangings a bed visited by the goddess lucina   108.50553828977438
he looked from one to the other and after mordaunt he recognized groslow   79.21939173383069
about half an hour ago while you were at monsieur de tréville s   135.2906371057529
wounded   46.949144159121474
believe me the eye of the eagle is closed forever   105.1290761642685
blaisois was in a state of great excitement   99.99970605141843
very well sir find this man and when you have found him bring him to me   90.8525195836177
then followed barrois the old servant of m   88.39514317302861
at the sixth he began to reflect that the search was rather dubious   89.41258832775841
it has been so ordained that he may have none to weep his fate   114.18462140754238
go sir said the king   82.96414840036302
come then said the minister   179.48512177749592
making a sign to la houdinière and cahusac to stop he alighted from his horse and went toward these suspected merry companions hoping by means of the sand which deadened the sound of his steps and of the hedge which concealed his approach to catch some words of this conversation which appeared so interesting   145.60106507147424
his three companions joined him   33.74068699764608
you wish to tell me you have hunted the lion   25.976376483062225
from whom can come so many disgraces heaped upon her head if not from him   122.27326730521527
he adored her   161.67769656225178
the time had at length arrived   175.32602053091543
her large animated intelligent eyes so often opened by intrigue so often closed by the blindness of love   40.1871576761384
allow me only to compliment m   130.33029428234198
porthos maintained a majestic silence   126.54651784320743
30151m does mademoiselle danglars object to this marriage with m   124.91927115327704
in the surrounding plain which more resembled a dusty lake than solid ground were scattered a few miserable stalks of wheat the effect no doubt of a curious desire on the part of the agriculturists of the country to see whether such a thing as the raising of grain in those parched regions was practicable   161.684558739743
how much were your animals worth porthos   144.99114125533356
captivity the second day milady dreamed that she at length had d artagnan in her power that she was present at his execution   164.25614255377855
and that he was on account of this estate engaged in a lawsuit with the bishop of noyon   55.701340673079805
villefort fully understood his father s meaning and answered by a slight shrug of his shoulders   121.19581692501062
he approached the duke took his hand held it for an instant in his own and letting it fall all is useless said he he is dead   139.93643724174274
i would reform her   23.905845479284167
he knows that we overheard his conversation yesterday and he wants to get us away from paris   134.6058140913907
he was passing the chinese baths and appeared to have come from the direction of the porte saint martin and to be going towards the madeleine   26.909834305965248
and he presented a little leather bag plump and giving out a golden jingle   48.37152775176065
i will engage to say that before a week is past the door will be closed against me   143.8666108452361
madame de villefort would not believe it and valentine was thunderstruck   171.22508805138358
d artagnan was worn out with fatigue   55.614468137511956
this word was pronounced in a manner impossible to describe   165.5158287631299
i was not aware of it replied albert but i can readily believe it   103.12624572220118
now said mordaunt are you not afraid that they will recognize you   85.80266520317988
we divided then this diamond into ten parts of a hundred pistoles each   132.74201576169054
in an hour hence i shall be with the comte de la fere and to morrow your majesty shall have a definite reply   87.38588672313429
a cloud settled on his brow evincing decided anxiety and uneasiness instead of the expression of offended pride which had lately reigned there   100.56587787981769
planchet had just done the same when an unexpected weight fell upon the back of the horse which sank down   31.36769525913924
because though i am not a baron by birth my real name is at least danglars   95.25487154339308
cried de chatillon   169.52908825292246
you are right duchess   203.31782897032414
the water passed over his head and the sky turned gray   130.84199324728488
whilst these projects were being formed by the duc de beaufort and grimaud the comte de la fere and the vicomte de bragelonne were entering paris by the rue du faubourg saint marcel   79.25599736971317
a poor musketeer a beggar an unknown who hates slavery and finds himself ill placed in the world   109.00764200704455
oh that s of no consequence just now said mme   129.12391338289888
certainly dear maximilian for if it is good i will follow it   25.877751060645778
the ribbons which held them have been cut with scissors   57.84087236480001
guémené was reading aloud and everybody was listening to her with attention with the exception of the queen who had on the contrary desired this reading in order that she might be able while feigning to listen to pursue the thread of her own thoughts   139.93088210214444
do you doubt my word   106.80473497121423
but what are you going to fight about athos   133.7663424505301
he must live   79.31021081673724
de morcerf was so proud   159.90120624814904
oh lackadaisy   154.88601210120723
the two men were left alone   108.1069105581256
he has faith in himself   128.60825099140146
albert had fastened the faded bunch of violets to his button hole   103.68290242864985
let us call i love him   72.17104001245988
sir said albert at first with a tremulous voice but which gradually became firmer i reproached you with exposing the conduct of m   84.14496938763007
we will see after the worthy mercer later   109.91711957885738
i stumbled by chance upon the memoirs of m   77.61499832601712
your family name is monte cristo   55.44796219459709
the prison register the day after that in which the scene we have just described had taken place on the road between bellegarde and beaucaire a man of about thirty or two and thirty dressed in a bright blue frock coat nankeen trousers and a white waistcoat having the appearance and accent of an englishman presented himself before the mayor of marseilles   130.6867313640728
would you like to know how matters have progressed   193.18440269289903
finally that the queen wants a brave intelligent devoted man to make a journey to london for her   157.41406929275774
buckingham took the casket and fell a second time on his knees   137.79798074613075
and he wondered how it was that there should be in the world people who succeed in every wish some in ambition others in love whilst others either from chance or from ill luck or from some natural defect or impediment remain half way upon the road toward fulfilment of their hopes and expectations   170.66750341615014
has got off without any accident   105.36634302731119
thank you my good friend   127.39357346271699
the abbé made him smell the contents of the phial and he again opened his eyes   118.79698526642095
i fancied that i recognized mazarin himself   94.07887417941643
the boy the hostess and all the house had the same regard for d artagnan that one would have for hercules should he return to earth to repeat his twelve labors   136.8954405526724
i call to witness the god who hears us that on the contrary i am a fervent catholic   159.48008806187312
in the first carriage with m   67.1614872859692
in the clover fields beyond the chestnut trees a lark was mounting up to heaven while pouring out her clear morning song   117.26308971983127
you have nothing to occupy yourself with but being happy   106.23407590734442
well but can t you speak   78.06263970803914
the slave respectfully signalized that he had   163.2741250345516
i must reach compiègne tonight or i shall cause deep anxiety to my family   170.80603824478217
meanwhile as the little troop drew nearer to lens the noise of the cannon sounded louder   135.05456857153843
he exists as certainly as that you may see his small yacht with all her sails spread   88.22339594041458
replied athos in his calm vibrating voice   143.78065224204664
have the french attendants been summoned to await her coming   151.3826697946093
monte cristo had pronounced the name of fernand with such an expression of hatred that mercédès felt a thrill of horror run through every vein   93.68372289228812
her will be done like that of god in all things   172.59780563675997
de villefort may prove the moral and political physician of this province   83.34127909583532
well these twelve thousand livres are his civil list and are as essential to him as the twelve millions of a king   186.9109542249161
while the three gentlemen walked along the piazza di spagna and the via frattina which led directly between the fiano and rospoli palaces franz s attention was directed towards the windows of that last palace for he had not forgotten the signal agreed upon between the man in the mantle and the transtevere peasant   109.66981724255453
i feel cramps over my whole body   95.81003234546131
the king was invited to come and see the hanging   29.842085235694483
the second he wounded me in the breast   85.91240890221556
there is but one way left you that is safe said she   128.34907167073635
it is the password   119.90198479289171
i do not know whether i love you or love you not   147.7338510262147
i did replied the count   149.7894005851919
charles also had recognized the four frenchmen   124.84030754044893
what says monsieur the abbé   129.83077224535725
and very soon they left the inn   14.456402066644856
d avrigny said villefort be so kind i beseech you as to accompany this gentleman   79.13808562051975
and then i also wish to see a notary that i may be assured that all our property returns to valentine   89.55800387294349
he did not give it up   105.1200304029907
oh no no count cried maximilian seizing the count s hands pray laugh   108.05781779932627
what have you done with her then if you have her no longer   239.829205343438
said the duchess pensively   102.13158911978535
a pretty silence truly   49.14392563048365
give me some water and ether   71.22551486824116
cavalcanti dressed in black like one of goethe s heroes with varnished shoes and white silk open worked stockings passed a white and tolerably nice looking hand through his light hair and so displayed a sparkling diamond that in spite of monte cristo s advice the vain young man had been unable to resist putting on his little finger   189.48743334063016
to the scaffold with the poisoner to the scaffold   155.30053796036665
by my faith it is very fortunate that the letter was not in it   152.34667887517872
and the secret of that very pallor is what we want to find out   66.68262334911674
soon after she heard lighter steps than those of the sentinel which came from the end of the corridor and stopped before her door   64.48463531754052
when he had pointed out to her in exchange for the precarious and contested royalty of paris the viceroyalty of font de l arche in other words of all normandy   77.09180170829185
the table had disappeared only i had still the knife in my hand   110.64208113631817
i did not venture to ask sir   135.47457724188018
if that s the case said mousqueton with a learned air take some nourishment   154.02057669086759
the crime was depicted in the most vivid colors   107.96511729343952
all that he was allowed to say in case of emergencies was the proverbial der teufel   84.35286103111025
the thunder growled in the air like the passion and anger in her thoughts   202.9025038247213
at this moment they heard the rolling of the carriage which at the approach of the musketeers set off at a gallop   62.376167534242555
how acts the judge   50.32242538008209
porthos and aramis looked at each other   76.29015108797017
the surprised groom retired   43.273425713574795
and though he considered the treasure as by no means chimerical he yet believed it was no longer there   168.69957884344035
i am for those who save the state said bonacieux emphatically   74.53385199244855
so young it is impossible said mercédès replying at the same time to what albert said as well as to her own private reflection   127.45096217141948
but whether he did not understand him or whether he had received no orders respecting the nourishment of danglars the giant without answering went on with his dinner   73.45817866998989
she there found rochefort s lackey and gave him his instructions   71.9687149400109
d artagnan put the gold in his hat and in going back to the chateau settled the reckoning with porthos each of them had cleared two hundred and fifteen louis   94.59846849004839
i mean that at this hour the headsman has been got out of the way by force or persuasion   147.78432148953607
so i yesterday addressed another epistle to her still more pressing than the first   126.66344548473364
they are carved from granite   173.20295497758497
my dear athos   138.3807178655964
do you hear that delightful cavatina   139.0946345265564
the guardsmen imagining this to be caused by some unexpected attack either of the besieged or the english sprang to their swords   182.8885788937177
gentlemen said d artagnan it is half past four and we have scarcely time to be on the road of chaillot by six   53.14169529674292
anybody may see by our bearing that we are people of condition   147.06313667226868
so we shall get from him one uniform and a sword   100.20396229317633
among these two hundred levees that of tréville was one of the most sought   87.40405682179207
i suffered that is all   134.0263091081886
cried olivain in his turn   125.96923200302015
in that case his last hope would have been destroyed   177.15435468138338
the baron walked triumphantly through the crowd who for the sake of gain styled him your excellency   121.46329932309494
well monsieur said planchet who had observed his master grow red and pale successively did i not guess truly   98.70681548561937
is he some minister out of office   180.05727861077392
ali bowed in token of strict obedience   105.2478408479881
oh doctor cried barrois the fit is coming on again   144.6170976537584
i have told you my wish or rather my determination   112.18605208220538
it seemed as though my soul were already hovering over my body my eyes which i tried to open closed against my will and what will appear impossible above all to you sir i saw with my eyes shut in the spot where you are now standing issuing from that corner where there is a door leading into madame villefort s dressing room i saw i tell you silently enter a white figure   102.13914373596396
and turning towards the young man said well catalan can t you make up your mind   121.349403612381
like his mates he is ready to obey our orders knowing nothing of our plan   68.05588913687919
d artagnan owned nothing   109.86726637915656
how are you to get away from here   120.40111957151946
he was engaged in an adventure so singular that he wished for counsel   115.97943354842542
i remember well that diamond which belonged to the queen   68.28049837457608
asked caderousse fixing his dying eyes on the count   84.07060997908488
the host replied that he had no other worthy of their excellencies   65.36651435960304
besides we feel always a sort of mental superiority over those whose lives we know better than they suppose   125.84785521099064
and what is that proof   149.8101174267978
oh monsieur i thank you with all my heart   85.9842512560971
well said aramis what do you say to that   118.25121125768185
the stranger met julie on the stairs   149.82989343785576
for he added with a sigh we two are equal perhaps to eight others   101.60414049362704
and do you not think me handsomer so   141.92109806665064
then i launched out into the path that was opened to me   74.83708510373256
all these evolutions are executed with an inconceivable address and marvellous rapidity without the police interfering in the matter   149.9023751756676
i am brave   186.3093967236362
athos colored a little and answered should i go i shall be delighted to see you there   62.9693075369731
she is my sister in law   95.14316615163497

toward six o clock m   105.416678809882
in addition to this he perceived that the top of a wardrobe and the marble of a commode were covered with empty bottles   101.27651854920576
the chancellor who on his part trembled with an emotion easily to be conceived took the letter bowed to the ground and retired   119.71218885438479
at this moment the door of the minister s box opened and madame danglars accompanied by her daughter entered escorted by lucien debray who assiduously conducted them to their seats   77.6659694072401
this wound my dear d artagnan has been a warning to me from heaven   106.33481435880887
chapter lxxi   103.73545706278001
said athos in a loud voice and i confess i think it incomparable   102.95404005960474
my good nanette be quiet i beseech you said broussel   100.4376409482725
when god sees one of his creatures persecuted unjustly placed between suicide and dishonor believe me sir replied milady in a tone of deep conviction god pardons suicide for then suicide becomes martyrdom   87.71817977051019
next to the merit of infallibility which you appear to possess i rank that of candidly acknowledging a fault   148.56842577452824
the name of your ship   122.006076483647
he has the right to notice nothing   133.4843160177344
chapter xxxv   130.4394871038341
the address to monsieur the baron danglars banker rue de la chaussée d antin   89.60532096155669
no no you do yourselves injustice   71.20814103103869
demanded buckingham   192.68726494511725
a pleasant manner upon my soul of arriving at your end when that end is vengeance   110.92724511231185
and yet said porthos neither of them had any advantage over us   85.33704141143153
and she began the same religious chant which had so strongly excited felton the evening before   98.54396743902674
have you heard how fate is persecuting the poor villeforts   96.88787624385353
it often happens continued she that a first fault destroys the prospects of a whole life   152.14932097836638
almost   63.82845174918596
monsieur we must not confound prudence with cowardice   126.86106072140737
upon my word the drum draws near said d artagnan   152.15720349096753
but to make good ones increases fame witness monsieur de rotrou   99.31062114475816
ah yes said the factitious abbé who began to understand   129.71596735691418
and when i was removed to the château d if i managed to bring the ravellings with me so that i have been able to finish my work here   164.05963070094907
did you ever hear he replied of the old man of the mountain who attempted to assassinate philippe auguste   213.5575632676785
d artagnan ran after her   125.5080812928128
will you go away from here   83.65080717872009
in an hour it will be at the door   60.33765724448903
i tell you what m   120.45624191847035
shall i speak to him   79.24438784793318
i turned around i looked at the trees i tried to recall the details which had struck me at the time   92.93436415490069
yes your eminence said athos while the two musketeers who had remained behind advanced hat in hand   27.27921561538767
at the moment of his arrival a small yacht was under trial in the bay   81.11140805066816
it was forty eight hours since i had taken any nourishment   116.09674644539307
well in the champs élysées there resides a very rich gentleman   67.8667180260617

the queen then gave her orders spoke of a banquet which the marquis de villequier was to give to her on the day after the morrow indicated the persons she would admit to the honor of partaking of it announced another visit on the following day to val de grace where she intended to pay her devotions and gave her commands to her senior valet to accompany her   232.15857828136396
you have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend   95.87727312486467
chapter xxviii   104.82383042990466
on my honor i have no idea   168.4734588781805
full of hope edmond swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water and thanks to the vigor of his constitution found himself well nigh recovered   159.6369585771655
of roman crowns in the most distant a   131.48420215302087
he has even a name taken from the book since he calls himself sinbad the sailor and has a cave filled with gold   118.4296929176684
how many magnificent projects of vengeance she conceives by the light of the flashes which her tempestuous passion casts over her mind against mme   96.59453522022905
fortunately however he had not been taken   2.9931204632911204
why one of them is a rich lord from touraine and the other a knight of malta of noble family   156.59004049205643
you are a very complacent husband my dear monsieur bonacieux said the cardinal   67.71570135270893
your monsieur bonacieux is very tiresome   151.92340737157522
and what misfortune could happen to me   107.60577131474543
grimaud immediately obeyed   114.60215524891383
look at her still beautiful witty more charming than ever   120.89644909223318
does it happen to be jacopo manfredi   141.6729338439541
what i mean to say is this sir that during the last fortnight unforeseen circumstances have occurred excuse me said morcerf but is it a play we are acting   127.94813156078881
remember the execution is fixed for the day after tomorrow and that you have but one day to work in   106.27962322582873
benedetto   81.7908885536715
but in our situation we must not say all we know particularly as we have been warned that our ears should answer for our tongues   34.57600513752999
god be praised   46.73729111166895
we must inform the queen   115.97880971308496
tis that exactly   14.603033579881057
if guilty why it is no use involving ourselves in a conspiracy   82.33360546298388
he had doubtless seen all   101.66199497804321
they are yours   188.23903818354336
on the contrary it is of her   216.8851151429642
but really on referring for the moment to what he said do you truly believe that mithridates used these precautions and that these precautions were efficacious   164.14033457539827
and i said athos taking some small change from his pocket i you   131.28480875753462
sir said the young man do you not come from paris if you please   131.05190541415666
explain yourself i beg   111.50306935571194
valentine therefore reached her hand towards the glass but as soon as her trembling arm left the bed the apparition advanced more quickly towards her and approached the young girl so closely that she fancied she heard his breath and felt the pressure of his hand   30.232594448736023
yes yes repeated the major yes there is a postscript   66.68528321503479
it was five o clock in the afternoon   111.69998248297887
on the contrary said athos smiling he has never been so much a musketeer as since he became an abbé and you will find him a veritable soldier   83.75095323224357
and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the doors and the blinds   24.31717562897782
by a lucky chance the pen was tolerably good and raoul began to write   28.947169861336064
so be it said d artagnan   38.57444697960389
take care you are going to immure a traveller sinbad the sailor a man who comes to see paris   207.15259125973367
exclaimed emmanuel while two large tears rolled down julie s cheeks never behold you again   124.36160302817972
lucien said madame danglars through the door you are always complaining that eugénie will not address a word to you   125.22212051702668
the lord of the estate on which the chapel of the curacy was situated saw this pretend sister and became enamoured of her amorous to such a degree that he proposed to marry her   118.55209188039207
he had left the key in it taking the simple precaution of turning it twice in the lock   51.745613473633085
asked the fruiteress   139.5010870851838
the other night she left   112.17934535335705
first i was a forger answered andrea as calmly as possible   156.17449904219154
the reflections of the mercer were already made   129.71672552826234
then let us draw on the spot   162.52022035050538
because a mistress is one of the cardinal s favorite means   88.80843562138193
i say that when a thing completely surpasses my comprehension i am accustomed not to dwell on that thing but to pass to another   34.931064961001155
said the baron suspiciously   132.45182854116882
3 was engaged by a young man who was travelling with his sister   21.524852501220877
give it to me later   114.90894152690582
do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him   149.04200530981413
i have made a bargain   121.15688448401912
while we are forgetting them they are falling into their appointed order   84.24682127016099
after reading the letter villefort covered his face with his hands   151.77169554222004
for a scene half tragedy and half comedy had been performed by him with mousqueton and blaisois who frightened by the noise of the sea by the whistling of the wind by the sight of that dark water yawning like a gulf beneath them shrank back instead of going forward   171.84598040985247
lucien debray is an old friend of ours and private secretary to the minister of the interior   61.901781724553835
he knew so well that from that moment he shut himself in his house and never went out unattended seeking me high and low   164.5723982931269
no count replied monte cristo taking the hand held out to him by the general   111.3368313138505
something whatever it was the cask contained fell silently into the tankard   97.8927518170349
on the contrary sire set the example   90.96942013596816
i have extricated you from misery felton   125.65084601264513
what with d artagnan grimaud and mousqueton we can manage to dispatch eight of them   98.21295023432317
no it is bazin   56.559267235808505
yes that is he   60.429992188599215
how would you set about it   179.021350870655
and every time that it touched me i trembled from head to foot   188.15826509789787
a little before they came to fromelles the storm burst   79.39312341481094
sir said she the language which i speak with my grandfather may be easily learnt and i can teach you in a few minutes to understand it almost as well as i can myself   165.5802889324676
it was for this she summoned you this morning and that she told you to return at five o clock   100.92287383425162
you have been to sea   149.3506384576087
you have told me the truth my gentlemen said he addressing the musketeers and it will not be my fault if our encounter this evening be not advantageous to you   116.99950975092048
cried a voice from the landing   162.14766618690356
a door hidden in the tapestry opened noiselessly and a man in black silently advanced and stood behind the chair on which mazarin sat   182.53297586379796
he dreaded the enervating effect of all that he saw   162.90545315929688
a nice acquaintance my friend   88.07678231644276
i should like to know what you would say if i were to relate to you a real tale of love   226.93199530610048
yes but they have found a corpse   80.90479015709352
what they should write to the clever person at tours   144.73640706049844
a truce to compliments said aramis   93.62077432061848
now said valentine you can neither go out by the front door nor by the garden   132.20083246326146
unfortunately edmond is dead and has not pardoned me   118.49211725263557
one may see that you love your family madame coquenard said the procurator with a smile that was almost tragic   194.38144830537618
you can say you were needlessly alarmed   62.294657314950435
a left handed man is very troublesome to people who are not prepared for it   147.82505748240771
pooh pooh   40.57836206127527
and i clung to life partly on my sister s account and partly from that feeling of pride inborn in our hearts of desiring to come off untouched and victorious in the execution of our vengeance   92.76392844053191
and i plead guilty of death should i ever violate this oath   147.14872738319664
noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion more than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and shattered frame   98.5142471232646
the soldier went out to obey the orders of his officer   24.89671439147834
it was ali my nubian slave who rendered this service to madame de villefort   48.72942017948683
we bet upon one hour and we have stayed an hour and a half   104.21507510825595
is it as hopeless as he thinks   143.3705307413318
listen returned d artagnan when our embassy is finished well   60.56601509581356
asked dantès   119.19599738427817
but what has become of the poor wretches whom these scoundrels were murdering   82.89379936999875
no i have never seen him   141.14435963628483
the man was at least two hundred paces in advance of him and there was not a chance of overtaking him   142.2146605067259
why this is a victory   76.51099407466467
men in their senses do not quit their hotel in the rue du helder their walk on the boulevard de gand and the café de paris   170.82718421725886
come gentlemen let us all propose some place   147.37663913222545
but i have always given it up   117.24728346286716
the cardinal took the letter and read it with the greatest attention   81.71211133536775
athos went toward the house while the mendicant who had received his reward left as fast as his legs could carry him   97.20575187804327
i have business in italy   205.53410554572196
my mother in law expended gold caresses dignities on concini who ruined her   118.1854199782262
and without turning aside so clear was the road left for him he passed from the baroness to eugénie whom he complimented in such rapid and measured terms that the proud artist was quite struck   66.73562503697569
he continued his walk but he had scarcely gone a hundred paces when a furious fellow leaning between two soldiers spat in the king s face as once an infamous and accursed jew spit in the face of jesus of nazareth   104.27253498898264
de tréville stopping him   96.01971817034101
decidedly my dear duke   141.08567529191635
come sir he said lend me twenty francs   16.988612519672202
you can not control circumstances my dear sir   90.1574151902296
the count was thoughtful and silent   81.49662860601703
anyone can see he s a gentleman   68.73926457403621
cromwell asked   87.03505769167407
lower   75.13107773247737
delirium do you say   100.61482188127513
yes doctor   152.2443237486344
de morcerf will not raise his voice against us   128.22653626819164
the sight is hideous   98.20544057635743
planchet who was still a little concerned for his safety after his recent escapade declared that he would follow d artagnan even to the end of the world either by the road to the right or by that to the left   121.88626570491347
the fair indian approached scarron   95.27126592785659
she particularly has them by dozens   139.01995509638775
dantès raised his eyes to heaven and clasped his hands beneath the coverlet   149.92408788783254
but unfortunately for the prisoners the abbé faria had an attack of catalepsy and died   124.4867093179106
then i feel as if i could adore madame de villefort   70.89378457873421
the queen became thoughtful and smiled like a woman to whom duplicity is no stranger   70.07885281857614
the names of all including carlini were placed in a hat and the youngest of the band drew forth a ticket   137.8778371977691
luigi was not mistaken   117.94579598189273
exclaimed andrea   147.66801125717402
help help he murmured   83.65390960223414
oh not the least in the world madame   109.2943195767188
and though franz had been unable to distinguish his features from his being either wrapped in his mantle or obscured by the shadow the tones of his voice had made too powerful an impression on him the first time he had heard them for him ever again to forget them hear them when or where he might   92.21880019316211
the duke followed him with his eyes with involuntary terror   195.001847688169
from fifty to sixty musketeers who appeared to replace one another in order always to present an imposing number paraded constantly armed to the teeth and ready for anything   146.25021638731255
so you are here   93.60713031765532
what is your opinion gentlemen and does not m   150.13926992910578
i sank exhausted with fatigue and terror into an armchair   74.06554181255731
her happiness cost her very dear   106.0915463127415
she has been dead these ten years   14.106225944581055
but a woman who wanders in the streets at this hour only ventures out to meet her lover   136.28512545892534
de tréville scolded his musketeers in public and congratulated them in private   186.49548381188464
you laugh aramis   127.38453901118581
this means sire replied the cardinal that i was desirous of presenting her majesty with these two studs and that not daring to offer them myself i adopted this means of inducing her to accept them   31.094818289393857
and now   183.39343548537664
14   60.75837538933195
oh all this is a family history as château renaud told you the other day observed maximilian   49.873853678366686
a recollection of athos came into her mind   139.04992457922316
oh yes replied andrea laughing   179.91965194976368
while on the contrary teresa shuddering in every limb dared not approach the slain ruffian but by degrees and threw a hesitating glance at the dead body over the shoulder of her lover   31.198513750192006
i took a week to go another to return four days of quarantine and forty eight hours to stay there   66.75337956028909
ay there s no fear in the daytime   135.5799466580944
and you are going to portsmouth   119.17567393963199
if it be so we trust your eminence will deign to explain yourself and we should then at least be acquainted with our real position   147.38440749949632
d artagnan related to porthos the substance of his interview with the cardinal and said taking the commission from his pocket here my friend write your name upon it and become my chief   27.257057734594284
this lady was the daughter of nicholas de camus who arrived in paris with twenty francs in his pocket became secretary of state and accumulated wealth enough to divide nine millions of francs among his children and to keep an income of forty thousand for himself   93.24823191403202
five days after your departure he came back and in a very bad condition too   128.6232621801575
it was necessary to be as good a horseman as he was to risk such a scheme for no sooner had the animal felt the burning tinder than he uttered a cry of pain and reared and jumped as if he had been mad   110.9026027420628
as we no longer wear the sword of the gentleman we may as well have the head of the puritan   100.51317318626315
but the count did not answer   153.00332871854863
no on the contrary i am not inclined to laugh said athos suppressing a sigh   72.79205037031127
and you think this cousin pays her attentions   118.51092773895257
i know them because the men of whom i speak were at that time my enemies   63.63875981986379
at the end of an hour the stone was extricated from the wall leaving a cavity a foot and a half in diameter   133.72287904947564
for the present he had no anxiety   105.25090100401515
and will you go   90.44310443710404
the door was scarcely closed upon him when the queen sank half fainting into the arms of her women   78.99310127974766
not at all not at all said mazarin   118.08529699774886
are you sure that we are not its objects   97.71213469848816
the queen can not you make allowances for the pettishness of a queen and a princess   136.6108809265851
well sir said d arminges it is the common lot   208.9804859891427
this man was cromwell   108.93339627167632
she lives   151.4306055235344

the baroness took advantage of her husband s absence to push open the door of her daughter s study and m   130.3772503124603
this was the name which he gave him in former days in their moments of tender intimacy   130.2459919733784
d artagnan immediately made a step backward and raised his sword   57.77047445144168
two of her companions were dressed the one as a woman of nettuno and the other as a woman of la riccia   170.86225168961147
he sprang into his saddle   71.74665582066247
well well cried d artagnan this reconciliation is truly touching   0.8440920056916923
you are not afraid of ghosts with me i hope   144.90972092167732
the snow deadened the noise of his fall   136.40880747373365
oh lord   86.64543194105886
when at three paces distant from each other albert and the count stopped   123.02556354155027
as he had said it had been a long time since any one had needed him   92.53523135627998
prepare yourself maximilian he said with a smile   111.20047834481436
40202m the blush of mingled pride and modesty which suddenly suffused the cheeks of the young woman the brilliancy of her eye and her highly important communication produced an indescribable effect on the assembly   106.20028007554501
my dear porthos   57.49012724847031
that is but fair replied monte cristo   130.80667289652487
if you loved me oh if you loved me that would be too great happiness and i should run mad   56.14796703107091
i ought to have consulted you on the point and have had some dishes prepared expressly   137.06998311537694
they could not long delay bringing her a repast   108.75383309845586
now while admiring as others doubtless will admire the details we have to relate our main preoccupation concerned a matter to which no one before ourselves had given a thought   98.58451299868655
you wear the uniform of the new french conquerors monsieur said he   77.20075457998269
to hold for five minutes the gates they will be torn down twisted into iron wire ground to powder   156.80880506947352
the cannon will warn everyone to refuse shelter to a man wandering about naked and famished   88.79641462275467
it appears said the baron seating himself in the armchair opposite that occupied by milady and stretching out his legs carelessly upon the hearth it appears we have made a little apostasy   141.64621448682317
then turning to the singular personage who had caused this scene he said your pardon your excellency but i was so far from expecting the honor of a visit that i did not really recognize you   154.4643353656365
the girl shuddered to the heart but did not reply   214.12858363543296
the curtain at length fell on the performances to the infinite satisfaction of the viscount of morcerf who seized his hat rapidly passed his fingers through his hair arranged his cravat and wristbands and signified to franz that he was waiting for him to lead the way   192.2762417161682
you don t mention those who aided and abetted the deed said caderousse   108.59983039523397
a short time ago while making researches in the royal library for my history of louis xiv   110.13309422678125
but on the contrary sad as death   117.92857221775297
although i might easily have accepted it for it was i who put into his hands the first silver he ever earned   171.75832778931553
but also said mazarin you must understand that if i ask this service from you it is with the intention of being grateful   150.48075974456427
ten young descendants of marius and the gracchi barefooted and out at elbows with one hand resting on the hip and the other gracefully curved above the head stared at the traveller the post chaise and the horses   132.64310657663628
suddenly a squadron of cavalry galloped up to encounter the royal troops who were entering pele mele the intrenchments with the fugitives   120.8077073576068
while he was endeavoring to calm his fears and instead of dwelling upon the political future that had so often been the subject of his ambitious dreams was imagining a future limited to the enjoyments of home in fear of awakening the enemy that had so long slept the noise of a carriage sounded in the yard then he heard the steps of an aged person ascending the stairs followed by tears and lamentations such as servants always give vent to when they wish to appear interested in their master s grief   51.35580843682784
if one s lot is cast among fools it is necessary to study folly   199.1467824452388
why replied athos carelessly she is probably going to write to the cardinal that a damned musketeer named athos has taken her safe conduct from her by force   95.64871581559223
but she has most likely returned to the louvre   91.20252656838281
at the end of a year dantès was a new man   124.50270712824941
but i hope you will not carry your antipathy so far as to deprive me of the pleasure of your company sir said monte cristo   85.23539008150352
i shall perhaps find myself one day called out by some harebrained scamp who has no more real cause of quarrel with me than you have with beauchamp   90.44492389461476
ho there boy   118.40089935114173
and with a king as full of foresight as your majesty scarcity is not a thing to be feared   116.82525891511855
besides it came into the young man s mind that by remaining in the environs of the spot on which this sad event had passed he would perhaps have some light thrown upon the mysterious affair   107.28159335563649
he called for me at seven o clock and before anyone had arrived asked one of the door keepers to place me in a box   233.39689376526587
write to me at paris to m   111.95352971703494
this something was enveloped in a cloak and d artagnan at first believed it was a man   116.47083976963148
the best swordsman in the kingdom my lord said d artagnan   128.1673962827038
morrel now emerged from his hiding place where he had remained quite unperceived so great had been the general confusion   58.67429468923198
a deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of caderousse who turned away and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head   116.76298813482725
it is true that on coming to himself he found that he was still within four walls   115.53767726949785
shall i complain of him   164.109762660203
in the shadow was a carriage with two horses and some saddlehorses   24.680176182244054
one seized me by the hair that is why i now wear it so short for no one knows what may happen the other swung a yataghan and i already felt the cold steel on my neck when this gentleman whom you see here charged them shot the one who held me by the hair and cleft the skull of the other with his sabre   211.47051168616633
ah sire   85.91714104943215
excuse my talking of family matters but as i shall have the honor of introducing you to the count i tell you this to prevent you making any allusions to this picture   139.12320584765513
duchâtel or from m   90.22360745496574
why then doesn t he attend to it himself as at chantilly   110.34198742399487
i am hardly nineteen   141.41383662774683
no ceremony will be neglected in my house   109.89971790825095
then with the intention quite patent of not drawing back a foot from the accomplishment of the commission with which he was charged and as the attendant of an executioner might have done in the chamber of torture he approached anne of austria from whose eyes at the same instant sprang tears of rage   67.00952839929505
i do and i will tell you why   107.46380054055632
upon my honor this man fancies the world belongs to him   76.81340911578697
but having sinned myself it may be more deeply than others i never rest till i have torn the disguises from my fellow creatures and found out their weaknesses   133.4303562131953
he was very much inclined to do so the contemptible fellow   53.35378906274367
oh whatever may be m   15.431246908053382
you were constantly employed in the task you set yourself and when weary with toil you had your hopes to refresh and encourage you   39.34203398746337
how misfortune humbles a man   100.97045393175672
the wind blew strongly the boat made six or seven knots an hour and they were rapidly reaching the end of their voyage   126.65190088520741
what is there in them   87.0801109282417
i have but ten days and this evening two of them will be gone   113.4576475497635
but since the time milady stabbed herself however short the wound had closed   132.51942386808702
now i think no more   68.25516194789797
drink a glass of pure water it will restore you   100.74090322525186
cried the abbé   191.75920758238243
noirtier s apartment   116.58170114831412
de villefort made and returned very few visits   94.32627281715365
the damps of the dew bathed the head of villefort and refreshed his memory   140.76950572637773
what matters this punishment as long as he is avenged   169.66770650403754
for everybody must be aware that a cadet from gascony does not find such stones in his mother s jewel case   89.48291227583066
montrose beaten at philiphaugh was obliged to disperse the remains of his army and to fly disguised as a servant   84.08347691929806
the queen as he went on looked at him with increasing astonishment   197.64431084494103
it was only on the following day at about ten o clock in the morning as he was starting to call on m   116.54708198535867
well write to your correspondent in yanina and ask him what part was played by a frenchman named fernand mondego in the catastrophe of ali tepelini   100.23712323266855
but it seemed as though he was constrained to tell the truth   152.25391175408058
oh continued milady do your wounds still make you suffer   85.68075490614942
said she thou knowest in what holy cause i suffer   133.71491461024186
send me the keeper of the seals séguier   133.10551548761194
and in short since the young people of the present day will not fight it remains for us to do so   125.47447922028643
i will obey you at all points   98.33138050237295
but the wine was good and he was convinced   60.87714611969974
grief had made her blind to all but one object that was edmond   133.9682666068438
why he would be annoyed if i did not play with him   104.64482012603452
madame replied monte cristo you must not ask of us the manufacturers of fine porcelain such a question   109.67381121105045
d artagnan had with his sword cut in two the poor wretch who had laughed   106.1198554593902
my friend you impose a painful task on me   127.75848630378138
there is in london i hope some establishment like that of the magdalens or of the repentant daughters   140.7637760451247
go to sleep soon louis said the queen for you must be awakened very early   184.6809771771026
what matter   64.95623839617383
madame these conferences will bring us peace   170.77472676942017
have you not thought so   117.41764821080683
sir said mazarin to porthos what would you do if the crowd fell upon us   75.34307584298088
no bartolomeo his father   81.71026144974117
but still no prisoner fell down as they expected   184.85272318191744
said he to the baron   95.6502407347572
she insists upon it that i can tell her his birth education and parentage where he came from and whither he is going   71.09932192296145
as for me i can never forget the pale complexion and black eyes of the young soldier and whenever the angel of death summons me to another world i am quite sure i shall recognize selim   152.91458250529854
i do not ask you to write to his majesty but ask m   83.55029140487098
no but look replied the hostess pointing to the wounded man   131.34115211853378
how he had found grace in the eyes of the minister he did not know   163.18368143966094
then the noble and severe countenance of athos crossed his mind   127.68461359878823
render her all the gratitude you fancy that you owe to me   114.91353531445803
coachman gallop on   206.22960559245604
she should have wanted nothing   161.06592601884947
oh i know what that is   124.75941829584097
valentine as her only apology for not having met him pointed to the corpse under the sheet and began to sob again   68.09438345515706
the fifth of october it was about six o clock in the evening   63.473666183108875
he would have pardoned me he would certainly have pardoned me if i had not said anything to him about that cursed baldric in ambiguous words it is true but rather drolly ambiguous   66.36469477415217
porthos followed him by the same road but with more difficulty and less diligence   139.5383355758219
the insult chapter 89   112.07862492710245
he looked at aramis and made a special sign to him with his head   171.14875413327388
i am aware he is a furious royalist   165.7581525156826
but at pont neuf he found louvieres and his bourgeois   38.62282703524133
la ramee continued my lord has done me the honor to invite me to a supper to morrow en tete a tete   98.36080208050448
said a hollow voice   142.0125775671679
only might not these betraying marks have attracted other eyes than those for whom they were made   109.88135424080387
said he is the hotel on fire   123.07082131829493
what did you answer him   133.86336791876457
a king said d artagnan   96.87693338966191
said d artagnan with a smile you sell your productions at their weight in gold   138.23209180941487
farewell   49.88313836565083
they looked hesitatingly around them and appeared to doubt the thickness of the partition between them and the office of m   149.95797801233266
and do you know whither he went   92.24454632008684
morrel had long thought of danglars but had kept away from some instinctive motive and had delayed as long as possible availing himself of this last resource   85.84336123296472
he awoke   173.99532439656605
it is almost needless to say that the flirtation between albert and the fair peasant continued all day   146.26243565615388
not for a time but forever   140.89599159814065
you mean that this demands explanation do you not   68.3833216778707
he understood that he was completely at the mercy of these four men   163.92821669870074
yes said d artagnan you did not really wish to kill   168.44551425149535
aramis who was constantly at work at his poem shut himself up in athos s closet and begged not to be disturbed before the moment of drawing swords   128.29284426156713
this disagreement is the only one that has ever taken place between the count and countess who are still as much united although married more than twenty years as on the first day of their wedding   90.81880038827839
the vendomois road he replied   36.743458678543405
d avrigny answered by a melancholy smile   117.04494688340746
oh it amuses me   145.7886900086616
all three then cried all s over   118.71217010569656
but noirtier looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she exclaimed oh grandpapa i see now that it is only your fortune of which you deprive me   63.87126737893122
your majesty will not forget that i have done everything in my power to prevent a rupture   124.39966098280365
said bonacieux astonished   24.24893524914728
demanded the host pale and trembling from the discovery he had just made   59.91016487976314
with gratitude   103.91874847656015
a shorter clerk came behind the first a taller clerk behind the second a stripling of a dozen years rising behind the third   163.5187190247213
and the more madame said monte cristo as the orientals do not confine themselves as did mithridates to make a cuirass of his poisons but they also made them a dagger   122.4271125384616
that is my conclusion   74.23343673307562
the two prisoners were at this point of their conversation when comminges entered preceded by a sergeant and two men who brought supper in a basket with two handles filled with basins and plates   110.8720669452927
bring me a carafe of water said the abbé   102.4113452965607
i took one of them by the throat and three quarters throttled him   89.1800600876445
whom must i announce to my lord duke   131.69073868106042
danglars disappearance   70.80473897813943
but look me in the face   179.39255261063488
what would you have my dear fellow   151.5989614158899
but this mission was to prepare men s minds for a return it is the man who says this sire a return which will soon occur   53.42575739896236
why should my father fly   142.3878071140415
and you have seen him   134.58515664739852
why i ll wager i can go up into the belfry of the accoules and without staggering too   18.38025849431365
martin he would call for him on his way   105.40580567127085
cried the former musketeer   115.829080506753
d artagnan saluted went out and hastened to repeat to his friend mazarin s flattering promises which gave porthos an indescribable happiness   110.01949379669482
nothing then was altered in the plan and orders were given to get under weigh next night and wind and weather permitting to make the neutral island by the following day   75.87831293886404
it is very ingenious said the count   108.60526293119932
i have perhaps offended you in your creed   142.54732054218556
de villefort will yourself see that no one deviates from them   85.68839658612718
do you give it to me   59.89270683165558
at the end of ten minutes of reading and ten seconds of examination the cardinal was satisfied   113.58079645892396
the prisoner got into the carriage without seeming to recognize the musketeer   173.93147216313517
i swear to you by him who died for us that naught shall induce me to breathe one syllable to my jailers   204.08982976497677
he was resolved to unravel the mystery   24.504894842393824
the proofs were certainly not convincing since they rested upon a few words written by an escaped galley slave on his death bed and who might have been actuated by hatred or revenge in accusing his companion   96.89358753043194
it looks more like bankruptcy   113.44921515952065
we are sufficiently well bred to excuse you and to listen to your history fabulous as it promises to be   115.78763535448724
athos who was very expert in all bodily exercises passed with d artagnan to the opposite side and challenged them   145.19088132435155
the globe of fire which lighted the room reascended and disappeared   163.97105717900692
on the fifth day he dragged himself to the door of the cell   70.01637582929342
alas it is not the death of the body i regret   177.71025412178795
we shall find it all ready and can sign it today   79.14036512746239
they are not dead for the death of d artagnan would make a sensation   74.77827820514919
this must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose heads he has thrust pins to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red and to the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out   157.89987814203965
you see it is yourself who have first named her you her father   89.52998319652097
he will spoil the feast   100.84506579210742
i say that the diamond is real and that this gentleman one of the first jewellers of paris will give us 50 000 francs for it   199.5253941314238
we are tottering always but we never fall and i begin to believe that we shall pass into a state of immobility and then the affairs of the peninsula will completely consolidate us   152.2339780875032
the burning marseilles sun which shot into the room through the open door covered them with a flood of light   89.69065846864791
here indeed are true believers   148.1878582039936
dantès led the owner of the yacht to the dwelling of a jew   97.14188269069179

for as all the talk was in the roman dialect he had not perfectly understood it   102.49763259061861
the cause which the young man espoused was one so sacred that beauchamp had only to comply with all his wishes   108.31857917727974
d artagnan monsieur   117.49113570717631
that is to say without a sou in his pocket but with a fund of audacity shrewdness and intelligence which makes the poorest gascon gentleman often derive more in his hope from the paternal inheritance than the richest perigordian or berrichan gentleman derives in reality from his   169.38054027870183
who then urged you to write   77.53119417838559
franz adjusted his telescope and directed it towards the yacht   75.54674198782527
but never mind let us hear your plan for dinner porthos   104.45873104870111
do you know this house monsieur   105.00245653350612
in the court he found penelon who with a rouleau of a hundred francs in either hand seemed unable to make up his mind to retain them   75.62864235192168
after going on for a few seconds more he heard a crackling and it seemed to him as though the atmosphere again changed and became balmy and perfumed   63.79397029503727
the count had moreover charged him to offer the two friends the key of his box at the argentina   130.40438349709834
ali is the supper ready   150.94379300197113
and if there had not been a postscript probably i should not have understood it   100.22921566775116
hush said andrea   77.35821475214928
maillard began the curate this gentleman and i have come to talk with you a little   70.96381087888034
after being the instrument of human justice i aspired to be that of the justice of god   115.17095253919909
he was spoken of as the most adroit the strongest and the most courageous contadino for ten leagues around   138.11871088032942
continued the president   119.67281122476321
it is a man i don t know although he seems to be coming here   27.71120038654462
i could not have killed her by the same blow i should have fled from my country   104.44648308636536
there for some time he enjoyed the fresh breeze which played on his brow and listened to the dash of the waves on the beach that left against the rocks a lace of foam as white as silver   85.73621174752078
without doubt the chancellor séguier looked about at that moment for the rope of the famous bell   12.231205993442288
at what o clock please your majesty   47.669438414112065
well done carlini   187.1110049338834
all the rest were broken by my fall   153.419407977682
it is not of bread and meat of which he makes the greatest consumption   104.12370460697059
besides in accepting it she added in a voice full of emotion you render me a much greater service than you imagine   82.64844251614178
sir said she that need not make you uneasy however difficult it may at first sight appear to be   61.391944192018784
the comte de la fère in person who comes expressly from the other world to have the pleasure of paying you a visit   216.3945187772291
you know it is not my fault said morrel   139.69213876817903
yes if it is not any serious affair otherwise i can not answer as to what i may do myself   43.5828302559251
these two men thus opposed in age and interests resembled two parts of a triangle presenting the extremes of separation yet nevertheless possessing their point of union   136.45075711162465
come let us see them   74.44995457016596
i suppose not   158.61644870033
the count had watched the approach of death   102.11034086805039
where the devil shall i say that he is so that he can not try to rejoin him   181.64776425303583
leave your hold then i beg of you and let me go where my business calls me   110.07313458422949
morrel s daughter and had remained with him in spite of the efforts of his friends to induce him to withdraw   139.71761059858423
de guiche and raoul glanced at each other smiling   148.8779831951304
well said the other if this last resource fail you   158.09012361914756
i have no design upon your count and you shall have him all to yourself   113.77406637505689
even if you gained the yard there would still be three iron gates for you to pass   48.37748623643597
well i am desired by him to give you his compliments and to say that he is in good health   137.02960781932205
you have seen my dear albert i ask the question as a mother you have seen m   148.22093282298016
because these horses are not to be sold was the reply   82.7656351306817
confess monsieur mordaunt that you are anxious to kill some of us   99.44100471897033
alas sir i never had any opinions   10.388293546948077
it was not you in fact who bailed me for one or two millions when the fatal discovery of my little secret took place   101.63029421553553
and this operation ended he took his place beside milady and shut the door   194.34992724055894
i shall not go to the chamber but i have something better to offer my readers than a speech of m   160.03541787649772
never was there an apartment at the same time more warlike and more elegant   149.15560319120556
but that menace terrifies me   135.21579227015266
yes i have heard it said replied the coadjutor   96.07650430380279
and i said aramis imagined that i had given almost my last sou to the church of montdidier and the jesuits of amiens with whom i had made engagements which i ought to have kept   139.96270038714982
while he was speaking albert had heard the report of two or three pistol shots   56.969053679463784
ah if you had tasted my life you would not desire any other and would never return to the world unless you had some great project to accomplish there   124.29343192662056
that s the whole story   139.59527699158835
but whence have you obtained them   141.8599181398995
the old man read so much truth and so much grief in the face of the young man that he made him a sign to listen and repeated in a low voice it was scarcely nine o clock when i heard a noise in the street and was wondering what it could be when on coming to my door i found that somebody was endeavoring to open it   190.82465323849326
men were giants in those times said athos   170.98971114733178
is someone dead in his house   168.5378187284299
the young man might easily guess that with so weak a man as m   190.3139055569626
bazin was then at the height of joy   141.77103882497713
your pistols are beside your desk said monte cristo pointing with his finger to the pistols on the table   145.71658263131206
our vessel was surrounded and amongst the custom house officers i observed several gendarmes and as terrified at the sight of their uniforms as i was brave at the sight of any other i sprang into the hold opened a port and dropped into the river dived and only rose at intervals to breathe until i reached a ditch that had recently been made from the rhône to the canal that runs from beaucaire to aigues mortes   73.09717700963752
cried d artagnan rising from the table the story of the present day making him forget that of the preceding one   123.44182143581918
he laid claim to that honor as captain of the royal guards   64.95416432207567
but in this circumstance i am but the instrument which the king employs   120.4697769716463
live then and be happy beloved children of my heart and never forget that until the day when god shall deign to reveal the future to man all human wisdom is summed up in these two words wait and hope   113.79053778571264
come mousqueton   81.49235280725544
on the watch what   90.31411483118485
ah said he involuntarily following noirtier s eyes which were fixed on madame de villefort who repeated this poor child would be better in bed   50.90195406959299
when this operation was complete he invited her to descend by offering her his hand   117.71570974335162
replied the young girl   92.73694026142905
just as he was passing the count s box the door opened and monte cristo came forth   63.423773821596576
yes i dare say   205.19257658987715
never mind dearest mother said a young and lovely girl with a profusion of light brown hair and eyes that seemed to float in liquid crystal tis all my fault for seizing upon m   171.10627689425314
then dantès rose more agile and light than the kid among the myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks took his gun in one hand his pickaxe in the other and hastened towards the rock on which the marks he had noted terminated   138.26159918069214
milady being well prepared for the reception of felton was able to erect her batteries for the next day   159.8049676330335
there could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged   101.322436087835
madame de villefort listened with avidity to these appalling maxims and horrible paradoxes delivered by the count with that ironical simplicity which was peculiar to him   94.96504739863107
well on the day when your appointment as an officer of the legion of honor was announced in the papers we were all sitting with my grandfather m   66.5829513319789
now in spite of the nobility of his countenance the command of which like a finished actor he had carefully studied before the glass it was by no means easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity   116.47727274460235
give three to your wife and you will still have four   91.38615310288519
good day to you   156.0139343972764
that is to say when i am dull and i sit on one of those marble seats have my gun brought to me my favorite dog and i shoot rabbits   90.4618019560091
exclaimed the man with gray hair who also touched bottom   124.16034128265065
the thing is clear as day said he   67.25314273459296
athos alone smiled with a self possessed disdainful smile   128.11333817938072
now sir pray do not be offended at the question i am about to put to you as it comes in the way of my duty as your patron   158.87452124824512
it was to this effect tears entreaties prayers have availed me nothing   157.21319347919214
my first impulse on coming to myself was to feel under my pillow for the knife i had not been able to reach   165.34665538414166
six days had already passed out of the ten he had asked from mordaunt   111.75249228302391
i think i can assist your researches said maximilian   93.10239950508492
i have been so overwhelmed by the many storms that have broken over my head that i am become passive in the hands of the almighty like a sparrow in the talons of an eagle   164.64377645690243
d artagnan took leave of milady and left the saloon the happiest of men   98.60241093554342
will this be permitted me   90.69789769651166
put a good supply of rum and biscuit in it for the seamen   123.05455794684629
cavalcanti has a fine tenor voice said he and mademoiselle eugénie a splendid soprano and then she plays the piano like thalberg   179.81393725946958
you kill me   119.28999873672407
all day they coasted and in the evening saw fires lighted on land   90.07120131560569
why have you caused me thus to fail in my word towards a gentleman like the count who has all our lives in his hands   112.81476087391943
oh how happy you make us   73.79350521939082
he said or i shall leave my carcass here and those of all my men   118.94856841821357
athos followed him before the felucca rose again on the waves   54.9362310706145
then he laid it down seized his pen and wrote a few words   100.46320336816194
come come said andrea sheathe your sword my fine fellow   146.18255154450173
because in the first place they transfer from the vessel to their own boat whatever they think worth taking then they bind the crew hand and foot they attach to everyone s neck a four and twenty pound ball a large hole is chopped in the vessel s bottom and then they leave her   107.71118373512881
yes sir she replied every confidence   176.59873325057532
pardieu said i my good gentleman i have a horse to sell too   122.38269767369553
we will go and see said the doctor   183.46815033130025
he had now to seek the second   132.31277424279648
said vampa with a smile   41.671448478474574
the yacht moved rapidly on though there did not appear to be sufficient wind to ruffle the curls on the head of a young girl   136.24738690564106
i will make you all captains with good pensions   98.90996778730967
will you tell me that they did not lay siege to the hôtel of the duc de la trémouille and that they did not endeavor to burn it   87.05954603460859
she then took two or three steps towards her husband as though to tear the secret from him of which he was ignorant or which he withheld from some odious calculation odious as all his calculations were   133.33978162483265
then remarking the strange expression of milady s countenance she said pardon me madame   75.22247243765241
said the president stupefied and without noticing the agitation which spread over the face of m   113.0279135265612
porthos will see to the provisions and aramis to the troops of the garrison   52.27702272744118
by mordaunt   154.47763195551505
if you do not believe that it is my father say so immediately   173.820526958547
and he bowed in order to retire and as if he considered the future in his own hands   189.8021131728592
a second scream more piercing than the first now sounded   167.20845526759828
but he read nothing but envy in a countenance already rendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness   116.6871881667819
and i can even add that i have only just left his company   184.7057946511355
barrois cried valentine barrois   92.9409045917399
but ere he entered his travelling carriage albert fearing that his expected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into placed in the care of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the count of monte cristo on which beneath the name of viscount albert de morcerf he had written in pencil 27 rue du helder on the 21 st may half past ten a   156.6136195421749
it is i who tell you so   175.05690810146112
only instead of following the road he went across the fields urging his horse to the utmost and stopping occasionally to listen   122.94138050844917
we can go to brussels liège aix la chapelle   115.73531739829468
more dead than alive he looked around him   83.41032422381764
the builder cheerfully undertook the commission and promised to have these secret places completed by the next day dantès furnishing the dimensions and plan in accordance with which they were to be constructed   174.66434941557534
meanwhile by a cleft between two walls of rock following a path worn by a torrent and which in all human probability human foot had never before trod dantès approached the spot where he supposed the grottos must have existed   129.11464388388498
you will be riddled   66.76415997596624
ay but you are mistaken   109.25098909597494
and if i am taken i will swallow it   114.52046324114188
said d artagnan we don t now make war as we did formerly   89.0292756587099
then at length invested with the entire confidence of the cardinal a confidence which he had so well earned he received the singular commission for the execution of which he presented himself in the queen s apartments   123.67693296506525
they continued their inquiries and at last met with a light dragoon who had formed one of the guard which had escorted d artagnan to rueil   136.22058902539627
i will ask the cardinal   173.76903512744272
tell it athos tell it   123.59611157680294
this is all i can say sir   98.6152374055448
give me paper a quill and some ink then said the cardinal   23.48829453536014
this was not enough he must now learn to write   22.05082518726664
you pledge yourself to that marshal   113.2126655877829
it might be a vengeance of milady   130.21550799146675
for although one may not choose to proclaim oneself one insists on respect suitable to one s rank   91.1529421679597
well said the queen when the chancellor had finished speaking   136.79719197966648
yes i heard   127.2960051394373
whether she goes there or not my opinion is still the same returned albert   24.099429710458637
well did there not happen an event which saved austria   122.50986812557723
i think your majesty will have no need to apply to the police to know where my friends are but that if you will deign to interrogate the cardinal he can reply without any further inquiry than into his own recollections   115.17014989026663
what jealousy   190.1983627478973
he felt that some great and unforeseen misfortune hung over his head   94.13983119663658
the next day about nine o clock in the morning he landed at st   108.93606387582179
it is owing to him that we are free   79.49171170835825
bazin was stationed in the corridor and barred his passage with the more intrepidity that after many years of trial bazin found himself near a result of which he had ever been ambitious   152.9505131403301
he received him on his sword and three times the general drew back on finding himself too closely engaged and then returned to the charge   164.06825859560092
there listen   126.5375528660902
that devil porthos is a man of prodigious strength   118.00305280438043
for it is not so well filled as that of monsieur d emery   126.0561372618069
but the man in the dark could not find the right key   113.78261092514444
six years sufficed to achieve this object   180.4920913007734
she reopened her eyes cast a quick glance upon the man who had terrified her so and at once perceiving it was d artagnan she uttered a cry of joy oh it is you it is you   74.46479264515159
the mayor had hanged the mutineers   68.77930589522461
we will say no more about it then   96.41836675876134
very well you will force it said porthos   62.399967564095355
you have made up your mind at last my lord   134.29284432904896
you should have allowed me to sleep   106.28055311649445
you do not know mercédès   116.14586032828991
as he ceased speaking the count felt the hand of mercédès tremble   141.1524067924171
a friend a friend   108.86422399837645
it seems to me said the host that this is not the first time i have had the honor of seeing monsieur   221.82741069943955
the law would seize it and put you in prison   138.93309640419676
in a word i was as i told you at my marriage feast   27.299077649602964
be silent dear du vallon and resign yourself   94.33131765066965
i am the queen   113.66206118923029
said the major endeavoring as much as possible to assume an air of the greatest majesty   62.47890176496399
when i informed him that your lordship was the protégé of monsieur de tréville and that you even had a letter for that illustrious gentleman he appeared to be very much disturbed and asked me where that letter was and immediately came down into the kitchen where he knew your doublet was   113.64495875147291
i will avenge you and cruelly   109.36942986277484
planchet is a frondeur answered d artagnan   98.38961851428465
so i took what little money i had and the best of my things and i got away   50.25562889694536
monte cristo chose this moment for re entering the drawing room   159.46096218927724
gladly availing himself of this opportunity the coachman leaped from his box   89.03173164186327
not that even in her days of fortune she had ever dressed with the magnificent display which makes us no longer able to recognize a woman when she appears in a plain and simple attire   119.27016554719097
immediately several men appeared who unharnessed the smoking horses and put the carriage into a coach house   127.76884744816732
one of the cavaliers then hastened to invite teresa without whom it was impossible for the quadrille to be formed but the young girl had disappeared   119.90274395060221
but now that we have come to so clear an understanding and that all distrust and suspicion are laid at rest we may as well fix a sum as the probable expenditure of the first year suppose we say six millions to six millions   68.6192022979051
milady possessed that great art so much studied by women of looking through her long eyelashes without appearing to open the lids   135.04160037586257
mercédès begged for six months more in which to await and mourn for edmond   47.7197905783767
but what is the use of harnesses without horses   90.12845789286469
morrel answered danglars   132.09876005568586
yet they will forget me here and i shall die in my dungeon like faria   163.60886281249878
it was however evident that the cardinal was recognized by both comminges and the other officers on horseback   159.6563768371572
perhaps mazarin wishes to make a speculation in beer as we did in straw said porthos   60.771609980669844
as to the horse ride him a little every day and that will accustom you to his maneuvers   31.824097313257866
men would have said that the king had escaped human justice and been overtaken by god s   123.29271571006538
his love which he believed to be extinct but which was only asleep awoke again in his heart   118.82370657190283
i swear by don t waste time in swearing said d artagnan   145.41190274337418
yes monsieur we are cousins said porthos without being disconcerted as he had never reckoned upon being received enthusiastically by the husband   162.93899385934634
it s a good omen master groslow look out for the king   98.7311187634518
the young officer entered   104.2955347291325
arriving there the young woman seemed to hesitate as she had before done in the rue vaugirard   74.64855968341925
what cried i do you a magistrate speak thus to me   179.47364474132004
in the midst of this chamber were four stones which had formerly served as an altar as was evident from the cross which still surmounted them   156.6896654002862
my dear monsieur de rochefort how much you must have learned during your intimacy with the late cardinal   88.13484779683388
it would have the success of one of monsieur patru s pleadings   163.78060069019756
on the contrary it was he who under the count s guidance followed a course of archæology mineralogy and natural history   78.6299068920031
the french opera everywhere except in paris   102.02266845075393
at that moment he thought of the trees upon whose leaves the light still shone   201.1602144718852
dandré announced by the chamberlain in waiting entered   164.95830909848843
no i shall go as i am   132.19826556174857
for milady doubtless to conceal her blushes from her lover had ordered kitty to extinguish all the lights in the apartment and even in the little chamber itself   148.22663435744508
i love your devotedness said milady   84.14196020197858
and you responded to his bidding you imprudent man   132.98100470769882
cried athos with an accent like that of a man who perceives he is about to tread upon an adder   127.2319760683166
and as continued he the duchess whom you saw at the church has estates near to those of my family we mean to make the journey together   88.80027529769079
say not a word about being late replied the stranger in purest tuscan   52.95802420454788
monsieur what i say to you about the matter said aramis is not for the sake of seeking a quarrel   88.29501779446596
in the whole house said friquet   87.5977618397494
i thought i had been deceived had mistaken the spot   217.0406894990646
were you a priest i should not dare tell you that but you are a man and you know mankind   138.2421801775443
you offer me your services   137.25237861083673
embrace me my son   127.92012381700548
d artagnan and porthos armed with their swords and athos and aramis each carrying a concealed poniard approached the house which for the time being was charles stuart s prison   77.68069163205142
i defended the king   74.0488322541913
nobody knows better than yourself that the bandits of corsica are not rogues or thieves but purely and simply fugitives driven by some sinister motive from their native town or village and that their fellowship involves no disgrace or stigma   109.69866781647471
and what was his reply   188.05781102383506
the jailer feared he was dangerously ill   44.72709709222673
the duke   103.28755396872039
and who completed it as it now is   108.75703210761445
and one for me the best for last   113.5642876358202
they set out on vulcan and bayard followed by mousqueton on phoebus and arrived at the palais royal at about a quarter to seven   77.6977134342637
behind me was an artificial rockery intended to serve as a resting place for persons walking in the garden   57.030022444073694
tell me where you are conducting me and i promise you on my honor i will submit to my fate   133.75839160357694
said d artagnan as he drew the letter from his pocket   122.93693558430681
we have both blood in our veins which we wish to shed that is our mutual guaranty   217.88089706034177
felton in his rapid walk reviewed in his mind all the accusations against the favorite of james i   37.670984458901515
clear sky swift flitting boats and brilliant sunshine disappeared   33.12379784026092
every pulse beat with violence and it seemed as though a bell were ringing in his ears   180.76531278587004
you are the friend of the cardinal for he sends you hither and yet and yet i speak ill of him replied milady finishing the thought of the superior   90.4802878691037
sir said the notary how do you intend disposing of your fortune in case mademoiselle de villefort still determines on marrying m   46.73895378861248
then let us be as we used to be   182.8420641656698
but vampa raised his head proudly   122.54880721241756
as to franz a strange transformation had taken place in him   59.7204341534725
you mean the colosseum   159.56536528137298
and i see you playing with the pommel of your sword as if you had a great inclination to break the holy father s head   28.414716530475715
he is one of the most well bred young men i know   82.20127330426577
i have nothing more to do with them nor they with me   39.52240335753946
he looked merely as if he had stayed out very late that was all   189.88096767001701
will you come   123.74081544911533
he said turning to d artagnan   17.795906076511912
de tréville in a somewhat softened tone   154.1288331244263
then my dear monsieur bonacieux has not suspected me a single instant   120.10874987941047
0045m you mistake fernand   94.14055164694778
but where is he   131.1871682733895
upon my word that is a most delicate attention on your part signor pastrini cried franz   126.07306282210713
what art thou about   120.13107310724072
to lose you my friendship if he were conquered and see that friendship changed into hate if you were victor   139.43892172150228
these were villefort valentine and the old servant of whom we have already spoken   51.43246474712517
this was a good omen for morrel for he knew that nothing but happiness could have the power of thus overcoming valentine   181.52125860229881
but the man who was under him   43.93833885205014
at least delay the trial till the next assizes   108.76198402384468
then you forget me so much the better   176.4330578281939
pray tell me how   126.75907469113267
here it is replied aramis   141.55309552794324
i agree with you monsieur said the young man turning pale and in spite of himself trembling beneath the scrutinizing look of his companion such consequences would be extremely unpleasant   193.53098949958974
and those steeples pointed and sculptured that we catch a glimpse of yonder are similar to those that i have heard described at chambord   43.91045999627278
he cried directing his course toward the gate that had been pointed out   69.78509776963344
and whilst these great personages were imprisoned insulted and threatened they said nothing   107.86564595988494
de la trémouille commanded a little reflection   110.79079657390626
then in case of my refusal this valor should a struggle occur will even go the length of carrying me off in the midst of my court to deliver me into the hands of the fronde as you propose to deliver my minister   144.65748898242236
and what is your excellency s project   105.358924550083
if my society would not be disagreeable   125.02660301239642
and then said eugénie while turning over the leaves of madame de villefort s album add that you have taken a great fancy to the young man   65.46986887222596
according to the arrangements the carriage was waiting at the door   77.63809837027448
having staggered as far as the rue dauphine he perceived his carriage awoke his sleeping coachman by opening the door himself threw himself on the cushions and pointed towards the faubourg saint honoré   88.03724117103951
then the curate forbade me to quit my uniform and the jesuit entreated me to get him made a musketeer   258.3090504043965
everywhere the last requests of a dying man are sacred   154.48672784772998
if at the end of three or four months you are set at liberty the ring will be lost or a false stone worth three francs will be given you instead of a diamond worth 50 000 or perhaps 55 000 francs   186.36220053848635
zounds monsieur   72.33091169464706
the woman is an agent of the cardinal   107.05997828388473
the queen at that time liked me and called me the most honest man in the kingdom   87.0381339331037
the young girl is lovely and her tears only embellish her   154.69324416105025
i drunk   142.41230684041062
0085m nay madame   116.4565159031972
there he stopped breathless and panting   131.09497707463666
well said franz anything new   96.14203204948488
much obliged my dear kitty   106.24537072866919
who said so   141.23179352960145
at once dantès resolved to follow the brave example of his energetic companion and to remember that what has once been done may be done again   58.247063890042746
i know well that the proposition is tempting but at present it is impossible to accept it   84.01394041005025
misfortune refreshes the memory   122.85564351521117
it may be remembered that he had the saddle which came from buckingham   136.02123497643237
he felt that influenced by her ambitions and coquettish disposition teresa might escape him   197.38281774761344
as d artagnan took some precautions to conceal himself porthos believed he had not been seen   119.92477775276184
you are right my dear rochefort it couldn t be for that   88.26301282744791
because one of them with whom i had most to do gave me a pretty sword thrust now about seven years ago the third that i received from the same hand   58.3751053126781
yes replied the count going to the door and returning   124.95041345415427
go and bring me back the cardinal as soon as possible   140.91096767468815
exclaimed the abbé   48.4455166165278
and yet they say orphans are to be pitied said danglars wishing to prolong the jest   115.95173188962717
i will make him speak   81.91455759552841
cried caderousse drawing from his waistcoat an open knife and striking the count in the breast you shall disclose nothing reverend sir   147.8062511683066
for two reasons   124.48743815923302
fine vengeance that on my faith   133.4705623045581
bonacieux who was charged with going to fetch the duke and conducting him to the louvre was abducted   196.78492837697837
and without ascending the stairs the guide conducted him by a subterraneous passage to another entrance   157.04274328182746
i have sworn   119.36626217016237
she gave me none   164.25508350932685
for the story   126.22539198623396
monsieur i said my brother was assassinated yesterday in the streets of nîmes i know not by whom but it is your duty to find out   86.22698391329811
i was then obliged to come back again   76.89940955941648
pray relate it to me   75.5370556276243
ing invited to dine by his holiness alexander vi   58.757490033272084
we are alone   44.03611282253772
baptistin re entered with glasses wine and biscuits   144.22200734804375
perhaps that famous barony will have something to do with our interview this evening   118.64107106144348
so be it said the englishman   64.40386914175565
it was seven o clock in the morning and daylight began to appear   216.30418778145594
he fainted   136.8633683569959
early this morning the telegraph was employed and at this very minute sir said the valet de chambre entering the room a dragoon has brought this despatch from the minister of the interior   103.73250238952994
another motive had influenced albert s selection of his seat who knew but that thus advantageously placed he might not in truth attract the notice of some fair roman and an introduction might ensue that would procure him the offer of a seat in a carriage or a place in a princely balcony from which he might behold the gayeties of the carnival   111.83578389100171
he first advanced towards the baroness who was chatting with madame de villefort who had come alone valentine being still an invalid   107.24648161760221
i feared it maximilian said she   74.48302433840476
a woman s caprice you understand   135.2261805055898
the next morning at the same hour the jailer came again   84.82677801850997
he seemed to be entering that vague delirium preceding death   142.9344827055513
and your regiment your captain   79.73730680323351
through this window shone a mild light which silvered the foliage of two or three linden trees which formed a group outside the park   78.17908468931572
when i supplicate thee to pour upon this man the chastisement which is his due thou knowest it is not my own vengeance i pursue but the deliverance of a whole nation that i implore   200.0408683858202
the italian to the gallows   93.28556683723828
good my son   94.45479238559838
so he s called mouston thought d artagnan   203.0277011569376
the guards looked on it with indifference   110.60442257305586
the king looked towards him   174.21278897115604
he should have waited for me here with a cabriolet till half past eleven   187.49724686138788
let us see buckingham dead or grievously wounded   155.9543412429262
felton abandon me   29.344000985346852
40260m i will remember it said the young man as selfish children recollect their parents when they want their aid   60.38455300464884
about my height   120.46824346228898
you are at home said he   136.26139313485967
he was in a small room which franz had not yet seen and which was surrounded with divans   136.94270769826085
cried d artagnan in a faltering voice and almost staggering from agitation   51.8017233276559
and at the very moment when the wheels of that coach crossed the gateway a report was heard and a thick smoke escaped through one of the panes of the window which was broken by the explosion   201.1753792158225
oh i would advance ten millions on his signature   103.47212710272781
i will give it to none but the king monsieur said anne   12.696219920044229
d artagnan looked with stupefaction at a man who thus employed the unlimited power with which he was clothed by the confidence of a king in the prosecution of his intrigues   42.26105393196717
at the end of the jetty his clothes richly laced with gold glittering as was customary with him with diamonds and precious stones his hat ornamented with a white feather which drooped upon his shoulder buckingham was seen surrounded by a staff almost as brilliant as himself   85.30999076734412
if richelieu made the king by comparison seem small he made royalty great   115.7283929285111
then all at once it ceased   77.37710659463039
i wish every respect to be shown the count although he is the prisoner of her majesty the queen   140.5419427863007
the prisoner happened to remark among the guards one man with a very good countenance   146.5994427314283
at that instant the countess perceived franz and graciously waved her hand to him to which he replied by a respectful inclination of the head   86.42922243970332
it would be impossible   128.75307697060975
if you have seen all madame you know that the son of fernand has publicly insulted me said monte cristo with awful calmness   147.17063882563923
as we have before said the post chaise was waiting   95.17548261228326
but we are in france and not in arabia and in france eternal friendships are as rare as the custom of dividing bread and salt with one another   143.38304405703096
draw if you please and instantly not so if you please my good friend not here at least   149.3477242824852
said he to the sailors   140.4542082179527
ah lips that say one thing while the heart thinks another murmured edmond   88.231259906788
oh signora if i could but speak greek your conversation added to the fairy scene which surrounds me would furnish an evening of such delight as it would be impossible for me ever to forget   176.72028335584565
i hope said aramis there are no women at your dinner   109.67740820049171
why this fellow must be the devil in person   126.79862380236194
cried the executioner all   38.35744677871233
he who had just abandoned 5 000 000 endeavored to save the 50 000 francs he had left and sooner than give them up he resolved to enter again upon a life of privation he was deluded by the hopefulness that is a premonition of madness   128.2714244193818
none of this had escaped the count and even by this mere contact of individuals the scene had already acquired considerable interest for an observer   63.36704657557277
as to that said athos i beg you to believe that i care very little about it   43.908073737352765
then will she die too   147.83883683931953
said dantès turning pale and looking alternately at the hollow cheeks of the old man and the empty cupboards   108.93082084699522
aramis blushed   148.1548112890417
charles accompanied these words with a look designed to penetrate the mask of the unknown headsman   119.83719071841644
the delay demanded by beauchamp had nearly expired   115.74672217962478
he had seen in his province that land in which heads become so easily heated a few of the preliminaries of duels   101.09013395698715
danglars felt the irony and compressed his lips   86.07958680402596
these devote their blood those their nightly labors to the same cause   69.38748677130529
no but somebody has gone in   226.8744855316756
in a moment he was on the ground   60.9245907809617
the table was splendidly covered and once convinced of this important point he cast his eyes around him   157.85156574454922
there was some surprise however that as he was with his face to the enemy he should have received a ball between his shoulders   179.471272632234
she then had one of those sudden inspirations which only people of genius receive in great crises in supreme moments which are to decide their fortunes or their lives   37.2461458220544
athos was more delighted than can be told   150.36048016419213
the night is gloomy and the tiber is very near the via macello   75.21972795550305
monsieur de tréville must think us dead   194.20221324714987
it seems that he came to himself and that he will continue to be an annoyance   117.00379379296531
all you do will be well done   101.92690228437769
this is what i would say had she only killed two persons but she has seen three deaths has contemplated three murdered persons has knelt by three corpses   103.8237303894046
this evening sir he replied all will be ready   58.65052324350603
and i am truly pleased to meet you   91.55586342150183
the flickering light of the two candles showed fitful phantom shadows in the lofty room   140.39239298534972
and if you will seek your enemy i will assist you and i will engage to find him my honor being almost as deeply interested as yours   99.05393248960897
she then replaced the bonnet and saw with pleasure in a little pocket mirror that her white complexion and brilliant eyes were alone visible   132.3466680110519
then the postscript is as favorably received by you as the rest of the letter   58.06892773129157
she entered the apartment and seeing near her stepmother the stranger of whom she had already heard so much saluted him without any girlish awkwardness or even lowering her eyes and with an elegance that redoubled the count s attention   175.12281866208696
and what do you know about the state you talk of   46.496415354165165
now said albert that you have seen all my treasures allow me to offer them to you unworthy as they are   124.31499096211887
you could see the wind coming like the dust at montredon   108.96569306527456
my dear friend cried aramis   126.00271056609645
the cornices were gilt the mouldings were gilt the legs and arms of the chairs were gilt   188.32413936274003
0301m dantès dug away the earth carefully and detected or fancied he detected the ingenious artifice   175.17570092003052
raving mad   171.66823968345375
that then is why i hear two men called every evening and see them walking sometimes for half an hour under my window   135.2898863470888
here i shall remain till the hour of my deliverance arrives and that in all human probability will be the hour of my death   155.3416666308037
do not be alarmed m   196.11393043857396
the division being made by the light of bazin s taper the two friends continued their road and a quarter of an hour later they had joined de winter at the porte saint denis   140.09930404281656
it is you who surrendered the castle of yanina   134.90900897505625
the baron has just related a frightful story to me   85.17350080783987
pray continue   128.45399013672872
there she made a fresh sign of silence and opened a second door concealed by tapestry   160.9752486184941
she expected every moment that she should see morrel appear pale and trembling to forbid the signing of the contract like the laird of ravenswood in the bride of lammermoor   61.51655228719803
or in the neighborhood   200.3250510070593
this voice was heard by the two friends who set off full gallop   93.2140060175189
Average_Perplexity:    112.61
