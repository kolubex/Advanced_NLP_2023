from whom is this   34.931536588962814
you have spoken truly maximilian   152.8746833239996
then a singular thing occurred   107.05244607865754
serves for me the fate of cardinals caprara   131.75712535834722
oh yes i know what sort of vengeance   107.94609683654919
your arrest is known that of your friends will soon be known   132.15695433355984
villefort pronounced these words with an accent which would have made the count shudder had he heard him   180.75492154357
and to think that i couldn t find that out said porthos scratching his head   98.04069535541946
i questioned her but in vain   179.1026168485711
asked beauchamp   67.18799357060561
well we are going to give a ball to mazarin   150.23154325827642
project gutenberg is a registered trademark   210.21412438081177
it matters little now to me   139.1134234145324
he hoped that the weight of earth would not be so great that he could not overcome it   30.05563871992787
oh i wish it you with all my heart   163.56771780775594
it is not their fault that they are bandits but that of the authorities   13.161094985890458
why this is the way of it said the minister with the gravest air in the world napoleon lately had a review and as two or three of his old veterans expressed a desire to return to france he gave them their dismissal and exhorted them to serve the good king   122.82769172216581
cried the executioner all   141.75636142544693
if what you say be true replied the count smiling perhaps you will be kind enough to give me some account of yourself and your family   147.88791591319819
at length they heard the cannon so near that it was evident they were within a league of the field of battle and at a turn of the road they perceived the little village of aunay   208.50005268649312
cried the countess extending her hand to him with all the warmth and cordiality of an old acquaintance   118.94454568527051
he cried no boat   114.49680898528767
then he raised to his lips the repast that like a voluntary tantalus he refused himself   221.4050645898099
meantime mazarin redoubled his surveillance over the duke   59.548105861231
the cardinal rang a second time   130.40113314378377
the two serving men waited without   63.38966089495221
well if so why do you object to my doing so   156.20696035932187
she has been dead these ten years   123.73974178122994
if it were one of your friends you would hesitate then   24.418560698893955
he is quite a child   111.12527001355176
disinterestedness is the brightest ray in which a noble sword can shine   96.23550852657232
i will give you 45 000 said he but not a sou more   47.91056880096316
ah i understand   11.018848643066619
cried d artagnan   188.5306727915803
mousqueton at the head of them wiped his eyes   220.77827348514026
before this day closes if m   145.29087325834757
the yard was empty   119.11729963810971
you hear d artagnan   102.39321607074801
if from hatred watch your enemies   139.0228064495955
how long a start have they   197.62021115941604
this permission we feel bound to say was graciously granted   130.4972040852394
it might be a vengeance of milady   152.8499555342415
monsieur laporte said d artagnan go and announce to the people through the grating that they are going to be satisfied and that in five minutes they shall not only see the king but they shall see him in bed   79.8787282451069
it is magnificent   140.04970586871545
f   178.8746698960902
the same noise of a door opening and shutting was repeated the instant afterward   142.6189797736729
at length one by one all the noises in the neighborhood ceased   49.36975255501244
you will do as much when the opportunity occurs will you raoul   24.01636433095385
the servant understood them   4.660196513926408
that this chief inhabits a cavern to which the pitti palace is nothing   4.686595142178106
i shall be fined   76.81267269197551
well now listen   103.48422769204281
decidedly athos you were born to be a general and the cardinal who fancies himself a great soldier is nothing beside you   60.52584839649446
ah   89.4567974434502
well perhaps you are right said athos   140.90315429425627
this indeed is praiseworthy nay more it is sublime   211.01904340064533
well then my lord they must be found   88.55546737973033
people do not go out from it by the door but by the window   133.52710280136387
no there is nothing in the world to resemble you in worth and goodness   23.170211935578365
said athos   101.33103851896924
you said you had an idea said athos   37.6398075564302
i should have thought on the contrary that it ought to have inspired you with confidence   91.55021223334508
valentine will you permit me to make a confidant of a friend and reveal to him the love i bear you   159.72289706873687
any noise in the ears   153.844070339331
murmured the count of morcerf   77.85121057398239
bernajoux was not a man to have such a compliment paid to him twice   138.3735120141628
they found the door ajar   201.909955965292
exactly your man   91.31019909747249
but you were ill and illness renders the head weak therefore you may be excused   75.42995860496447
in ten minutes said the count to his companion we shall be there   72.16417681824288
if that young man should be appointed to a regiment what would his guardian say   54.89764091389637
our gascon knew by the first glance of his eye that his billet had been delivered and that this billet had had its effect   163.46279630703432
their joy was great   156.83688756326504
ah said he between his teeth is there truth in the proverb that fortune comes while one sleeps   24.41246324623674
well then we will live and die together   143.53894415293237

on two of my shirts   60.95569008586631
asked aramis smiling   166.53896656828832
well said the queen it has been refused   117.05975154356668
that is quite my desire   11.540358531031401
they expected to hear some mention made of d artagnan or of porthos but every one was engrossed by articles and reforms   72.81910439587266
having dined with his usual tranquillity and moderation the count making a signal to ali to follow him went out by the side gate and on reaching the bois de boulogne turned apparently without design towards paris and at twilight   35.51982220805024
not so bad said beauchamp   86.89125950981168
these bodies serve us   66.07918007280622
sheathe then if you please and follow us   89.6347334907672
returned penelon   205.56968035763754
but let your profits end here   119.7769034647814
i have but ten days and this evening two of them will be gone   105.96285998917436
you see he has a truly royal escort   192.0672789557205
like myself he laid an emphasis on these words an ancient musketeer of the company of tréville   145.68950877789396
he was about to remove the pistols from the saddle he had quit to the one he was about to fill but he found the holsters furnished with similar pistols   110.97949578036177
that will make me at least partly happy   109.8451055519979
you rely on the usurper s return   111.40875040717772
and i have the same sincerity to show you if you wish monsieur d herblay   32.71718869973964
fatality   190.79686942805807
tell him also what you have just told me that mazarin has placed me in the pavilion of the orangery in order to make me a visit and assure him that i shall take advantage of this honor he proposes to accord to me to obtain from him some amelioration of our captivity   52.05669304301101
de tréville   37.25384835826338
leave your hold then i beg of you and let me go where my business calls me   147.17991018762442
not yet i think   61.1186639392278
oh pray do for heaven s sake tell us all about is he a vampire or a resuscitated corpse or what   44.69777048243543
you do not like dantès   41.17701316415808
he was a man of forty to forty five years but he seemed at least fifty and his black moustache and eyebrows contrasted strangely with his almost white hair which was cut short in the military fashion   99.52332208210208
coquenard repaired trembling to the cloister of st   118.12547542089766
it appeared impossible to the baroness that a man of such delightfully pleasing manners should entertain evil designs against her   109.40631311264974
for my misfortune   170.85854145308443
their fasts make them pale the blows of the discipline make them hypocrites and their eyes become inflamed through weeping for the good things of this life we common folk enjoy but they have lost   96.50003530238871
they set out   102.01781153850389
one thing alone however threw a shade over the pallid brow of felton   134.63385770772584
that contemptible mazarin has stopped poor scarron s pension   127.74518872388607
the figure advanced towards the bed and appeared to listen with profound attention   180.3721610526794
should he who had so often for mere amusement s sake plunged to the bottom of the sea to fetch up the bright coral branch hesitate to entertain the same project   118.03713259714556
yes yes replied mazarin   118.2964509485757
and i ask god and you how i can save her   96.2408821997071
oh yes   116.91154273752784
yes said d artagnan you did not really wish to kill   99.80515431446807
50235m the carriage entered by the porta del popolo turned to the left and stopped at the hôtel d espagne   148.54397836361588
it was grimaud on his way to paris   154.86522283903264
the light no longer burns in yonder window   163.8280294660601
the valet led felton through a large hall in which waited the deputies from la rochelle headed by the prince de soubise and introduced him into a closet where buckingham just out of the bath was finishing his toilet upon which as at all times he bestowed extraordinary attention   172.09926440768317
never mind i ll fix that all right   119.85713236856661
and is he aware of the danger he has been in   185.08543148042236
let us take ourselves out of the way and leave things for the present to take their course   115.91896348991528
then it is not justice which is pursuing me   106.47197881932493
the night monte cristo waited according to his usual custom until duprez had sung his famous suivez moi   59.13686641455752
i believe so   164.50788936816605
my commands are ordinarily short clear and precise   100.81396822077991
never   124.62272153129004
yes replied andrea with an embarrassed air i was in the south of france   93.37213131165447
the count had three windows at the rospoli palace   76.81247513009205
well now that would be a real fortune to us my friend   36.43344450828734
said the cardinal sternly   68.31405639672835
from my earliest recollections i have been beloved by no one so much the worse   39.97781005021058
well asked he of the count what has then happened   10.461011571757481
asked the indefatigable questioner   154.56541155633155
then fitting it into its place he said you removed this stone very carelessly   49.436735470849385
i am not a priest   212.23876916277993
and i a plain chicken said aramis   167.465507349002
i do not know you said the executioner   29.440497181312224
said haydée kissing the count s hand and i am very fortunate in belonging to such a master   263.4208853020101
tis not too warm to walk resumed d artagnan   222.73662366839648
and it immediately occurred to us that they were but pseudonyms under which d artagnan had disguised names perhaps illustrious or else that the bearers of these borrowed names had themselves chosen them on the day in which from caprice discontent or want of fortune they had donned the simple musketeer s uniform   77.55429930740574
mademoiselle s lady s maid says sir that mademoiselle is finishing her toilette and will be here shortly   120.05032375906109
this is why i wish to set out again as soon as possible   183.3171383487287
not one hour of peaceful calm was mine   188.85544667045434
before we left villeroy i settled the accounts of the regiment   73.39581552183327
if on the contrary it is a prisoner the noise i make will alarm him he will cease and not begin again until he thinks everyone is asleep   48.76278509347986
we are supposed not to know each other   111.29527012820827
athos and aramis followed him   106.34725613944313
i feel if this continues said mme   113.3340055967534
cried milady   47.831262780505284
so that now   136.09090090406647
the old man winked violently   99.56202291846613
cried the officer in the tone of ill humor habitual to him   241.71018707216996
what is his name   67.88111359184254
upon my honor and by the holy cross   174.7887199295385
asked eugénie   128.79121385782045
do you hear   135.1772345887139
well   169.11016730902855
ah   77.1083036929108
monsieur bazin the beadle   114.6310501565079
he will inform against you   91.76423646933132
because fernand and danglars being both parvenus both having become noble both rich are about equal in worth excepting that there have been certain things mentioned of him that were never said of me   25.321801489373158
i was hidden behind that door he said which leads into the next house which i have rented   110.63965092459999
that is indispensable   110.07470085919333
i don t at all understand you but i believe all you say to be true   20.489835181410385
add monsieur d artagnan my lord   5.661150834506799
give me a draft for 4 998 louis on these gentlemen and our banker shall take it   129.0175250245349
well that is precisely the feeling which i experienced when i first saw that extraordinary man   229.7694112676546
if a second traveller had passed he would have seen a strange thing a shepherdess watching her flock clad in a cashmere grown with ear rings and necklace of pearls diamond pins and buttons of sapphires emeralds and rubies   149.65365794014315
what did he say to me   177.6167679714749
but whence did these impediments arise   195.3871526248305
your mother has no longer either throne or husband   145.91525286042156
you should always strive to see clearly around you   41.969991810044164
do you then love me   119.67631488551072
the first four furloughs granted as may be imagined were to our four friends   36.92414151850522
he ascended into grottos paved with emeralds with panels of rubies and the roof glowing with diamond stalactites   169.79047469784786
to do justice to them who had condemned me they kept their word   48.30782175860695
therefore sir if you will agree henceforward we are friends until death   45.561970073315365
no my lord   84.78216984497004
the man he addressed recoiled with terror and only answered the few words of the musketeer by pointing   158.12409084323576
had you then that sum   112.14392151758652
but this mattered little to him now rita had been his   219.13782736200622
and do you think asked groslow that stuart will ever escape while i am on guard   115.30174787997588
d artagnan determined upon his course   197.49987097631174
well then off to the nearest goldsmith s and sell that diamond for the highest price you can get from him   191.90921986738346
she is called the fair indian   113.02275778252924
i am nearly thirty seven   134.110198937233
maximilian said the count the friends that we have lost do not repose in the bosom of the earth but are buried deep in our hearts and it has been thus ordained that we may always be accompanied by them   101.56443317105074
valentine also knew the truth but she did not answer   151.11965310582735
oh yes yes   206.57693287818853
for an apprentice musketeer the young woman was almost an ideal of love   245.94634332966956
when he had gained the angle of the street he turned   196.50426319931222
you leave me then   195.50152084475963
they descended the great staircase taking with them all the guards they found on their road and crying out to arms   179.724815286401
monsieur de beaufort placed it horizontally at the height of one foot   144.65775538714882
each register had its number each file of papers its place   105.8576843208833
mercédès shrieked and sprang towards monte cristo but suddenly stopping edmond said she there is a god above us since you live and since i have seen you again   179.48615137115218
i can not see   104.26438783019601
horse   171.28005281468535
he was still comparatively young he was surrounded by the loving care of a devoted family but he had convinced himself by a course of reasoning illogical perhaps yet certainly plausible that he must separate himself from all he held dear in the world even life itself   167.72586407546783
a few convulsions of rage which she could not suppress paid her debt of feminine weakness to nature   121.7406231819784
a benefit reproached is an offense committed   158.80119318299242
milady had told the truth her head was confused for her ill arranged plans clashed one another like chaos   151.9047536141583
and what shall i do in scotland   164.59924248992007
cried athos   91.75633617822835
faith my lord it is very necessary for me to make my fortune your eminence has so long forgotten me   119.00322088163277
he had formed an acquaintance with all the smugglers on the coast and learned all the masonic signs by which these half pirates recognize each other   189.57309558823505
to the cardinal   180.83874180000194
that is a serious thing   136.46731435200462
the contract was to have been signed three days since   109.29296206021266
the cardinal made a sign to his attendant who drew near   140.4698314980269
d artagnan picked up two or three old sails hung on the walls and meeting nothing to suspect regained by the hatchway the deck of the vessel   193.2737843441753
what are the wishes of his eminence   145.17997633595184
does my lord seriously wish me to name any one who was mixed up in the cabals of that day   174.63437472366508
d artagnan rose and taking a letter from his writing desk presented it to raoul   56.54194788905057
exclaimed de guiche you must understand that this is one of those wandering brothers who go begging on the high road until some day a benefice falls down from heaven on them   91.1734438377749
old men are always so selfish in their affection said madame de villefort   146.59559025418645
in a quarter of an hour let every one be in bed and snoring   114.92188010715412
i follow you   142.48194602607842
they had the misfortune to be devoted to that very queen for whom just now you were seeking servants   119.43406606208059
d artagnan   99.04712216034213
bonacieux   68.53049106778485
the man whom he had seen seated on a fence had got down and was still pacing the street   81.85302414485675
a large cloak was spread at the stern   79.70924409091822
she is going to leave her house said the steward   171.8203329373355
why what is the matter   147.75339842521709
is it possible   29.324132120376575
and did monsieur d artagnan come off the conqueror   246.75851197821623
aim at this command the mountain of populace thinned so suddenly that d artagnan could not repress a burst of homeric laughter   73.32035656785577
giving the sailor a piece of money in return for his civility dantès proceeded onwards   163.24138834185624
in arithmetic   95.68737806529288
and therefore when all paris was rejoicing in the expected return of the king appointed for the next day gondy alone in the midst of the general happiness was dissatisfied   111.81458449260488
ah   103.01242716653626
then steer for monte cristo   184.27425913177262
said the patron   72.14804421232381
and i really don t know what prevents me from exterminating you all   187.1002989276542
no doubt now we shall hear that our friend is released   31.144075387699203
he rose dignified and calm restraining by the severity of his look the wild glance of the young man   71.26949194448957
interrupted d artagnan   55.29619711787986
yet he did not return home   128.57808083733255
but your majesty may be assured that it is not those i do not speak of monsieur de tréville whom your majesty sees at all hours of the day that are most devoted to you   108.74413855934395
athos imparted to him his greatness of soul porthos his enthusiasm aramis his elegance   108.12144639048152
aramis porthos and d artagnan drew their chairs near him   152.88626489018304
d artagnan released the hands of athos which he still held clasped in both his own and hastened to her   164.0257393567446
why so   73.83785480401417
no no   123.41068805777226
whilst the two friends were with the cardinal the queen sent for him   86.05436376471468
the door had itself opened noiselessly   150.81924660307325
oh no   155.6052891920366
so that said the abbé with a bitter smile that makes eighteen months in all   73.5569176728215
creating the works from print editions not protected by u   40.525123428426596
two poniards a knotted rope and a poire d angoisse   141.0041355802066
caderousse and his wife again interchanged a meaning look   91.15216072392838
what   59.570931181233654
good evening m   59.28097570055185
oh mercy mercy monsieur   84.29618717041802
chapter xxxiii   84.50494012688173
holloa patrick   61.34261993568867
may i not go and see my friends   84.65331938061257
in these prompt arrangements we recognize the order of a well disciplined soldier   107.5414450418749
the count was in his study and was reading with an angry look something which bertuccio had brought in haste   133.3135022530226
there is a horse while on the contrary the hundred pistoles feed their master   77.5704046906406
master friquet the owner of a pistol and of a sword which louvieres had given him had organized a company of rogues like himself and was making a tremendous racket   45.42793506185501
i love you so tenderly that i can not help being jealous even of the past   99.89751592448113
i have always found them   67.49662338267832
cried dantès letting his chisel fall to the floor   119.6689088667631
i can see neither heaven nor earth said the jeweller who was outside the door   136.4921734145561
asked the captain   88.3362367353026
repeated by the shrill voices of a thousand vendors two or three stars began to burn among the crowd   80.93629699022325
you can not go wrong the road is bordered by trees on both sides   159.71583349672068
mazarin gave however no order of the kind but on the contrary began to be insinuating   121.71055874228037
you said only imagine and then paused   146.2731923086671
young people stop there   167.40860642495602
athos allowed the cardinal to finish his sentence completely and bowed in sign of assent   146.75132946406094
that he was leaving at the same time as his letter   218.02230396911423
no my dear fellow   85.71361921405628
you must advise me what to do   114.92821112944587
it resulted from these antecedents that everyone entered heartily into the purpose for which they met   71.26370569349046
m   190.9678537875368
callest thou thyself eloa or astarte   83.52962751466163
then aloud the friend of that wretch is capable of everything   159.1544923210163
even his breathing seemed to be arrested   136.96465779339047
you believe me to be a frenchman for i speak french with the same facility and purity as yourself   164.23732988145602
and since it is my function to give them to others i am rather averse to receiving them myself   104.21339028863395
i should have cried i should   132.50073443670536
in the first place light me a torch   111.58885859629333
de villefort s garden   106.86425757869694
in this frame of mind grateful for the accidental meeting with planchet pleased with himself d artagnan reached notre dame   152.1935057270072
chapter xxxiv   145.25188322348964
because you will look into yourself and you will do justice to the lady   106.48970092195934
well continued the cardinal in an indifferent tone the only thing to be sought for at this moment is some woman handsome young and clever who has cause of quarrel with the duke   106.69921643133988
i know the world is a drawing room from which we must retire politely and honestly   154.5157112887402
then said mordaunt your honor gives me my liberty for to night   99.91991898854408
it was at the traitor s cross that his journey and his destiny were about to end   70.04579631854807
that same night the general was to go over to the english   61.46376173484891
much monsieur mordaunt would care   134.66806062839288
answer in your turn or you may repent of your disobedience   79.15371038038377
albert would not do us the honor to be jealous   91.28340655039763
milady was all attention   154.72250724809817
it is indeed the same said he   80.40694352086092
at dinnertime we will rouse you   122.2307155471822
then these 1 000 francs said mercédès shuddering   22.254986308745686
the rest of the dinner was to come   111.37277765095513
come dear ones said morrel rising from his seat let us go and see and heaven have pity upon us if it be false intelligence   69.94570696912088
maximilian leaped at one bound into his crop of lucern which he began to pull up in the most ruthless way under the pretext of being occupied in weeding it   151.08577352175777
besides do you know what is our situation and whether mazarin s arrest wouldn t be rather an encumbrance than an advantage   175.97554381563936
you see i give you a wide range   47.05850559284188
d artagnan grew pale with rage   134.05583820303232
the duchess smiled half tenderly half ironically   142.7595281439174
how can you know that   107.02163569819987
she stopped in the doorway listened for a moment to the flickering of the lamp the only sound in that deserted room and then advanced to the table to see if valentine s glass were empty   104.73509987190198
then the bandit thrice imitated the cry of a crow   42.43140832448316
he had seen the two mortal enemies of the musketeers had seen mordaunt adjust the fuse   91.59866057583999
albert had often heard not from his father for he never spoke on the subject but from strangers the description of the last moments of the vizier of yanina   103.14275007136783
and then resuming all his presence of mind which had for a moment staggered under this blow and his strength which had failed at the words of the old man he said oh i have saved you once and i will save you a second time   150.85828696485294
really madame he said did i alarm you much   135.1816330646959
but pray call emmanuel   177.3848654697134
if not why there would be no promotion   35.88577803850646
you were not of the party m   38.450914024130526
ah maximilian i may have much to suffer but i feel as if my grandfather s look at that moment would more than compensate for all   146.87547447377838
monsieur d artagnan he resumed do you wish to become a captain   204.75958243534885
morrel was announced   139.20685446627743
oh sir i beg your pardon   28.378891662850236
cried he as soon as he perceived the horsemen   64.02670400947787
what do you say of that young man   26.397611574339976
oh very easily   161.1813277075363
exclaimed athos here it is as clear as day   76.83288206233132
yes   165.5772585488566
ah said morrel   142.13697278918326
so a pretty little lass my faith is that soubrette   98.54865491268566
should i ever get out of prison and find in all italy a printer courageous enough to publish what i have composed my literary reputation is forever secured   3.540056003197435
de villefort would stifle the affair   157.25249453540053
the marshal bit his fingers   112.53356910059
but why should it   92.16485957046449
and my hasty departure the cause of which they were unable to guess having aroused their suspicions i was arrested at the very moment i was leaving piombino   112.74978404520465
i have often read and read again the history of mithridates said madame de villefort in a tone of reflection and had always considered it a fable   112.02325525791069
because as porthos was talking louder than the rest of us he took him for the chief said d artagnan   181.31091111922103
it is a thing of the highest interest and upon which our future fortune perhaps depends   42.01700004725818
i do not think it i am certain of it   197.95599666407003
she was an orphan born at valmontone and was named teresa   89.96804210185316
you morcerf   124.04298242079709
cried monte cristo it was m   130.28728437496358
it was proposed for the museum   43.568704987654556
at the moment caderousse quitted his sentry like watch before the door the road on which he so eagerly strained his sight was void and lonely as a desert at midday   208.3294778152686
you will be lost   58.80642680452773
i wished to inquire why you stopped at the island of elba   117.66696706955388
i would place each of these heroes on his right pedestal that of robespierre on his scaffold in the place louis quinze   69.21147381473716
asked raoul naively i thought it was derogatory   61.84193189345497
philosophy can not be taught   187.6747549080647
de villefort talking to m   93.52429505540948
one would have thought the king was going to bed and not to his coffin   209.88325489201983
they laugh best who laugh last   46.250768380111424
the remains of luxury prevented him from sinking into his actual position   85.82249713683402
the host armed himself with a spit and rushed into the chamber occupied by the two friends   191.3868415008323
but such as is my hermitage it is at your disposal   55.24172129497089
i will show the gentlemen the door   68.48885749471853
this man might after all be a greater scoundrel than you have thought possible   173.86337770953952
said the latter closing the door and bolting it that they might not be disturbed   33.23316791216777
what do i see down there by the wall in the direction of the catalans   57.90818156819649
no returned monte cristo i only guessed   179.660774672661
oh it concerns you very closely my uncle i am sure and you will soon be of my opinion added he with a smile which sent a shudder through the veins of him he thus addressed   57.27651173033237
porthos rose always ready for this kind of adventure   214.56389800770538
the genius for laudation characteristic of the race was in that phrase   90.90554966752845
and where i pray you   182.2478051945946
said she   207.82938214646498
morrel had to pay within half an hour 287 500 francs   177.8710439566558
stop a moment   159.13298089943066
oh yes   176.6711366179662
very well   309.8000505127075
how would you like to have it   129.6915124403414
certainly   123.04703655533429
and you will have nothing to fear on your return   143.64557277500202
but he added in this war prisoners stand a chance of being hung   177.8691784971039
he shall be so well spared that he will return quietly with his two friends while i and you   92.1771822732689
here madame danglars instead of being calmed by the soft picture uttered a groan and fainted   15.193529017157587
and he took his friend along the alley where a number of tracks like those which had trampled down the flowerbeds were visible   108.90134394754435
let us go immediately   85.35429187590552
and the members of the group whether rebels or not as if they knew with what sort of a man they had to deal at once gave place to the patrol   114.98834376567639
oh yes replied andrea laughing   178.4051979472909
everyone spoke harangued and vociferated swearing cursing and consigning the cardinal and his guards to all the devils   241.30317513813813
directly   145.7907722316516
repeated he within himself   120.65088496780024
this timidity which might proceed from the astonishment of innocence as well as the shame of guilt conciliated some in his favor   104.9747900706702
for from this moment we are at feud with the cardinal   167.6747808043509
but before it was out of the scabbard porthos with the hilt of his had struck him such a terrible blow on the head that he fell like an ox beneath the butcher s knife   230.65652982986944
it is eleven o clock in the morning and the pious sisters have just finished saying mass for the success of the armies of king charles i   134.2388791483441
he had us in his power and he let us go   65.19391130816564
i will answer for the success of a project which will reflect so much honor on m   97.93624719583661
de tréville s office   145.57541700637236
then sire may i present him   136.10438018770964
the captain obeyed   158.90012683715952
say on   139.64376744748577
but on the following day the family from whom all these particulars had been asked received a handsome present consisting of an entirely new fishing boat with two seines and a tender   34.70890402610661
sulpice   217.74996265235848
he then drew the pin from his cravat and placed it on the paper   122.37433707392351
he thought that there had been no less thick a veil before the eyes of those to whom faria offered the treasures   207.03594182342317
an order to conduct you to a room and to leave you there to talk to me   89.90121118895308
then the duke put to pistache this difficult question who was the greatest thief in the world   115.30605629186135
a love as tender as that of a lover for his mistress dwells undoubtedly in some paternal hearts toward a son   97.22220475112519
yes if i die   131.7190062105429
his smile is so sweet when he addresses me that i forget it ever can be bitter to others   116.01340476949274
milady looked at him for some time with an expression which the young man took for doubt but which however was nothing but observation or rather the wish to fascinate   113.94694666059888
said porthos looking around   61.27731494286957
this very instant   221.97751970984785
from my mother who inherited it from her mother   115.15840289694411
she then replaced the bonnet and saw with pleasure in a little pocket mirror that her white complexion and brilliant eyes were alone visible   31.194903692696997
the two friends walked out on the fortress   170.70562155465217
insolent   128.05853048009124
your eminence said the august visitor it was my first intention to speak of the matters that have brought me here to the queen my sister but i have reflected that political affairs are more especially the concern of men   231.91542183294206
he is advancing as rapidly as his own eagles   167.79768605998456
i go into the garden i plant i prune i trim i kill the insects all day long   117.88465573831282
if you plunge a dagger into your flesh if you insinuate a bullet into your brain which the least shock disorders then certainly you will suffer pain and you will repent quitting a life for a repose you have bought at so dear a price   136.09015972619673
50167m no no no i tell you   32.28377174280628
how many rounds do they make a night   152.12044228000852
count he said i swear to you my soul is no longer my own   158.79848888955206
it seems their horses too are breaking down as well as ours   168.42455807682435
as to you that is not my concern and i shall sup either with or without your permission   15.842730136314046
it was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber for without it he would have been unable perhaps to reach the vessel certainly to return to shore should he be unsuccessful in attracting attention   209.17965779357417
said monte cristo   158.07234636514985
all it can do is to avenge the wrong done   156.72812419037263
what has she written to me   80.72776090174669
but at least we shall not have to reproach ourselves with anything   169.12730953755602
god will punish you   133.3717861475134
i forget how but i know he used to amuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it after his return from italy   199.7067175107971
we will escape and if we can not escape we will talk   155.21598291149533
and why do you rush in here as if you were about to penetrate a crowded market place   12.871955529540145
de saint méran   64.01201468588107
athos laughed   107.20601878198391
one window was lighted   112.09620404725061
dantès had spoken of mercédès and villefort instantly recognized her   144.31787064127099
and what part did he play in this sad drama   88.861438825101
what is his name   65.75489512413789
who among the persons here assembled answers to the name of edmond dantès   135.316545981943
but when they were alone he said you have done that which you ought to have done d artagnan   90.914777903794
cried dantès joyfully   56.81810117459884
i am willing if anyone should suspect this that my silence on the subject should be imputed to my ignorance   134.34180152950165
he reeled back with a shudder and the same moment the drops became a crimson cataract   164.1073215022559
we are rich   97.28123945589078
shall we go forward   167.3455335141573
yes signified the old man   116.32958440718902
and he threw himself weeping on his knees by the side of the bed   164.8803721484925
he felt ill at ease and at a loss what to do   139.32850830921754
he who just now presented himself to the abbess as a messenger from the cardinal   124.49500572740922
this evening sir he replied all will be ready   216.9729893777776
this frequently happened   44.35941161363644
yes   204.73518279682588
only remember on the 5th of october morrel i shall expect you at the island of monte cristo   165.90334678644393
monsieur d artagnan said the cardinal on perceiving him i have not forgotten with what zeal you have served me   97.32357187048206
let us load the guns   178.51809358249076
we are first said morrel looking out of the window   111.3754388079254
or tomorrow   189.97617037068156
eugénie looked at danglars much surprised that one flower of her crown of pride with which she had so superbly decked herself should be disputed   32.30059618602614
the enemy was marching upon lens with the intention doubtless of securing possession of that town and separating from france the army of france   108.09484984248478
it was on the thirteenth of july that ventrebleu   150.32367326922858
the four countenances expressed four different feelings that of porthos tranquillity   52.681500306500524
germain   53.09491035378923
he bowed humbly and retired   169.79764650621073
bonacieux   10.63164411854639
you are madame s brother i learn be it so   129.90758864270921
you mean george villiers   148.06946453236122
to kill yourself   83.25818536124964
50215m enough said mercédès   253.531085611043

at the same time he pointed to a window through the shutters of which a faint light streamed   214.82056233304226
in two words d artagnan informed him where mme   101.60407499750022

in five minutes three were slightly wounded one on the hand another on the ear by the defender of the stair who himself remained intact a piece of skill which was worth to him according to the rules agreed upon three turns of favor   105.02504643171851
d artagnan alone had discovered nothing he ordinarily the most inventive of the four   146.51157561660662
morrel smiled sadly   191.11487168842305
if you had me taken to a private room only to tell me this you might have saved yourself the trouble   112.4804226055605

baptistin give me the refusal of him   180.95722047993303
yes that is he   160.5819147571092
but observe cried d artagnan that there is a woman in the affair a woman carried off a woman who is doubtless threatened tortured perhaps and all because she is faithful to her mistress   138.70144068942923
well my lord before i became a confectioner i myself was three years sergeant in the piedmontese regiment and before i became sergeant i was for eighteen months the servant of monsieur d artagnan   60.42139725761096
he wished once again to press the count s hand but his own was immovable   194.19921268358004
he wanted to kill me   115.65821291497349
the boy the hostess and all the house had the same regard for d artagnan that one would have for hercules should he return to earth to repeat his twelve labors   182.8677130257318
there is one thing the queen has not signed her assent to the treaty   13.526253631577333

but should you find the means of retaining them remember my lord that i shall esteem you as having rendered the greatest service that a gentleman can render to a queen   99.52864691687992
at the end of a hundred paces the ground began to decline and he could only see the mast of the sloop   65.79176685794783
but all three reflected upon the youth of d artagnan and dreaded his inexperience   103.86812585910496
and signor pastrini himself ran to him excusing himself for having made his excellency wait scolding the waiters taking the candlestick from the porter who was ready to pounce on the traveller and was about to lead him to albert when morcerf himself appeared   269.9730558455749

yanina   109.28842338899376
cried d artagnan to the man with the scythe taking one of the pistols up by the muzzle and preparing to strike with the handle   69.86152306241014
then his dungeon seemed less sombre his prospects less desperate   150.41844343987444
great personages may have had a hand in what you have seen and if talked about the evil would only recoil upon us   67.23003607589617

where then are you going   139.06512101206107
as a punishment for having spoken without permission my friend you will please to eat this piece of paper   178.68541434403056

charles s heart melted within him at the sight of those two children whom he had not seen for two years and whom he now met at the moment of death   190.93843302106708
asked mercédès   77.00226089788981

has he not a son a young man a relative a nephew of whom comminges spoke to me as being a brave boy and who with monsieur de chatillon brought the standards from lens   103.00619492735113
cried d artagnan you will get me turned off   263.57572937854206
yet speaking of reports baron what have you learned with regard to the affair in the rue saint jacques   106.37241158430305
said d artagnan to himself i believe he has become more gascon than i am   167.75251961179038
and as everyone who had been personally acquainted with prince andrea cavalcanti experienced a lively curiosity in his fate they all determined to spare no trouble in endeavoring to witness the trial of m   124.07516740650188
yes if you really wish it said d artagnan and even with great pleasure i confess   91.7709920185601
danglars have their limits   183.2269508519646
then of what other scourge are you afraid my dear blacas   129.69310734786376
franz and the count in their turn then advanced along the same path which at the distance of a hundred paces led them over a declivity to the bottom of a small valley   54.671891476534704
i could not find them   98.82904932826287
athos began to laugh for this juvenile escapade of his appeared to be as amusing as if some one had related it of another person   176.47702168828718
well said athos when aramis and he were in the boat again are you beginning to be convinced that we should have done a bad turn to all these people in arresting mazarin   99.16022879644618
unhappy father said monte cristo   71.87116606078519
and unless his near neighbor and would be friend the count of monte cristo possessed the ring of gyges and by its power was able to render himself invisible it was very certain he could not escape this time   126.79058814255669
but as we have said it was at least a league from the château d if to this island   109.60675813349692
he therefore went down the rue des petits augustins and came up to the quay in order to take the new bridge   160.93931488641678
an hour after sunset   101.66682594476453
they parted laughing she turning back to gaze at the poor paralytic man with interest he looking after her with eyes of love   5.825931870591901
besides i have promised him your patronage   125.72991925554372
milady however smiled in observing that she excelled the young woman by far in her high air and aristocratic bearing   8.31564541023053
then running downstairs she left the hotel walked to the rue de provence called a cab and drove to m   102.74122675654104
his eyes were fixed upon those of the queen and a smile of terrible joy passed over his lips   141.21932947085057
monsieur de beaufort was at supper but he rose quickly on hearing the two friends announced   101.18982021287152
ten minutes afterward planchet joined him at the stables of the hôtel des gardes   236.85695627096555
wild eyes the iris of which contracts or dilates at pleasure said debray   146.09782706370888
i know she was loaded with cotton and that she took in her freight at alexandria from pastret s warehouse and at smyrna from pascal s   147.9400450008987
i will not promise said milady for no one has more respect for a promise or an oath than i have   109.45862741680719
how   182.6340244063647
the marquis of saint méran   60.33712319737638
aramis burst into a fit of laughter   186.97995057776282
the first thing he perceived through the damp gray mist was honest planchet who with the two horses in hand awaited him at the door of a little blind cabaret before which d artagnan had passed without even a suspicion of its existence   63.138034326993235
or rather at what he said   148.17697636935034
what do you mean   187.92305152591678
from haydée   140.21713261381257
if the king was still irritated against them they would depart without being seen   49.56286757619016
monsieur   158.06913713486443
de villefort   115.93213014372246
the sergeant with the air of importance which such people assume when they are clad with military dignity said who are you gentlemen   164.01650205538738
bazin   98.58378529643957
cried the stupefied musketeer   202.86089347945986
the curtain at length fell on the performances to the infinite satisfaction of the viscount of morcerf who seized his hat rapidly passed his fingers through his hair arranged his cravat and wristbands and signified to franz that he was waiting for him to lead the way   184.96972054357803
mercédès said the count i do not say it to blame you but you made an unnecessary sacrifice in relinquishing the whole of the fortune amassed by m   186.85503310903613
the whole accompanied by cries that were never heard in any other part of the world   157.2173492390996
villefort complied and they passed on to the dining room   119.53104645661024
there was something so strange in these three words that everybody except the king shuddered   203.64885827034644
but before he had finished m   159.3428772929159
what is the matter   144.3766450010429
then said the abbé we may hope to put our design into execution   53.63033929226869
albert shook his head and looked thoughtful   124.63690836336238
in going up to the target morcerf picked up two or three swallows that had been rash enough to come within the range of the count s pistol   88.2042687197308
there were also less agreeable visits for two or three times reports were spread that the cardinal had nearly been assassinated   55.764914918513014
i searched ransacked counted calculated a thousand and a thousand times the income and expenditure of the family for three hundred years   144.1979971087352
20291m and asked the count did you ever know the name of this woman   93.98342184636287
for la rochelle   179.49399408267624
arrived at this last hue it changed no more   164.4819388108087
emmanuel would tear the weapon from my hand and alarm the house with his cries   151.539371559108
that workmanship is divine   151.43869731205982
come magistrate said m   163.49899315504902

you have been spoken of in a promising quarter and you will soon i hope have news that will be agreeable to you   105.59893741659447
i possess a share of wit and a certain relative sensibility which enables me to draw from life in general for the support of mine all i meet with that is good like the monkey who cracks the nut to get at its contents   45.01940287974843
because nothing can save you   162.46677132739964
continued caderousse half rising and with his fist on the table hallo edmond   111.82499218663743

it was noirtier the lemonade was intended for it is noirtier logically speaking who drank it   117.32072954212407
ah if you speak in that way said athos you will break my heart and the tears will flow from my eyes as the wine flowed from the cask   171.62349838226027

but it seemed that morrel expected something something had occasioned the noise and something must follow   25.956533175843376
ah that is really original said beauchamp   156.00471881114055
but why should i have done otherwise   41.14693827379514
do you know modern greek asked he   110.62192247583558
we shall find it all ready and can sign it today   106.58952565809889
it is i myself   58.363383156282
for my own part i demand it said aramis   45.56979766285292
the lower rooms were entirely filled with kourchid s troops   83.27597315426499
and now i think entirely as he does   99.25112721879813
at the sound of that carriage i shuddered   186.61779938485114
exclaimed edmond that will not be   121.23835724597012
and when i am gone you can open to him   190.73910776281224
asked morrel   53.442544969548806
in half an hour   94.74153494501468
ah my dear doctor said the procureur heaven declares itself against my house   117.1207800091532
chapter lxxvi   158.37399276904222
monte cristo uttered the last words with so much meaning that morrel starting up cried out you know of whom i speak count do you not   82.25064176764798
there is no doubt they went thither to fight themselves   82.04275085801157
then you believe the papers   191.97049965244452
58   119.10266319746458
let us choose a place of rendezvous continued athos and in a last interview arrange our mutual position and the conduct we are to maintain toward each other   141.87724597926336
it s true though said porthos   170.18475811398767
well and it is that my opinion is that all these old podestàs these ancient condottieri for the cavalcanti have commanded armies and governed provinces my opinion i say is that they have buried their millions in corners the secret of which they have transmitted only to their eldest sons who have done the same from generation to generation   180.89206170384617
the anjou wine chapter xliii   67.17471356650395
in truth in a few minutes he heard steps approaching and low whispers   68.69848479085374
where is the hay dealer s   106.30216224983172
for my part i always thought his poetry detestable and i think i know something about poetry   37.365749472840164
then in my turn i also say very well   198.7943014807223
replied the king betraying some uneasiness   105.11985312447077
then the postscript well   102.63191622563346
but surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you are expecting to receive   68.66411665135527
you m   186.7894582982953
it was just in time for valentine s head swam and she staggered   118.16430735102327
the name of d artagnan was not altogether new to mazarin who although he did not arrive in france before the year 1634 or 1635 that is to say about eight or nine years after the events which we have related in a preceding narrative fancied he had heard it pronounced as that of one who was said to be a model of courage address and loyalty   160.49711256533598
i will swear to you by my soul s salvation my faith as a christian i have told everything to you as it occurred and as the recording angel will tell it to the ear of god at the day of the last judgment   139.77927679645734
you think so   103.64661969238244
a quarter of an hour later he was at greenwich   72.7286603384836
we at least must keep close to monseigneur   42.40178690641211
ma foi said monte cristo   164.6376477096739
the spaniard sprang forward and seized the gun by its muzzle in order to strike raoul on the head with the butt   134.90810641298404
and yet they say orphans are to be pitied said danglars wishing to prolong the jest   91.67635477660566
noirtier de villefort one of the most fiery jacobins of the french revolution   241.1850067682231
who made the lemonade   193.5056230909152
deschamps place beauveau faubourg saint honoré and you have my authority to inspect those deeds   151.6776592654327
well be assured added he with the familiarity of a gascon you shall not wait long   207.8199677637449
and in that codicil he acknowledges me   26.198116207332546
d artagnan that man of iron who seemed to be made of nerve and muscle only had struck him with admiration   134.11705252838115
so many times in order to follow valentine in thought at every hour in the day had he made her describe the whole house that without having seen it he knew it all   67.12904524108782
to resist at once the ascendancy of grief and beauty it was too much for a visionary   118.08511346830655
parliament can never have passed such an act as that   87.02814224687602
our word included everything   82.6805070629927
take my advice then and let no one into our confidence   83.64981688518822
what will come out of those three elements when i am no longer present to combine them   111.94644632396005
i will compensate thee for the loss of thy place   132.28218188497746
but that is all   37.11237244281965
exclaimed planchet here s land in good condition   112.62696292089679
exclaimed morrel   81.75554106966032
had he it before he was imprisoned   8.927777436148773
no thank you   87.05160127844368
the bandits looked on with astonishment at this singular conduct until they heard footsteps   199.3329274842141
i understand the nature of your alarms madame said the count carefully examining the child but i assure you there is not the slightest occasion for uneasiness   235.99918944152859
you are his confidant   170.68994458698376
he scarcely knew mademoiselle de villefort   153.2348340068059
from pontoise another express was sent to the next stage and in six hours all the horses stationed on the road were ready   106.28046823296745
planchet by way of dessert would have liked to hear the conversation   149.58296898658386
you must be blessed indeed to possess the knowledge you have   112.89124599588325
i faint   52.63737627174724
bertuccio you are going to stay in the carriage then   230.1496819913139
de tréville   75.62934490264348
she would see him the next day and if she could not make him fail in his duties as a magistrate she would at least obtain all the indulgence he could allow   144.86082134325432
laporte broke the seal and placed the paper before the eyes of the duke   125.61547022536705
you were saying sir said fernand awaiting with great anxiety the end of this interrupted remark   79.9942677832371
my faith it appears so   211.275257753957
no thank you   55.52415384319226
i thank you sir   129.67118456490874
he asked   201.3988041484525
ah murmured caderousse what a strange priest you are   87.00410545705441
dantès first impulse was to escape but fortunately he did not attempt it   129.6907053097702
we lost five men and the rochellais eight or ten   243.3021904360915
we have plenty of time to spare   108.66259428031725
well there sir is another proof that good people are never rewarded on this earth and that none but the wicked prosper   171.84251680987964
i have heard of these things every day during the last eight years and i can not understand them yet   100.71083436748907
gramercy   131.28700385928911
asked planchet   97.08858777314548
lean upon me and let us return to the camp   165.91772819099333
and what is your reason for advising me to go alone   97.05156582953117
he then heard a noise of something falling and all was silent   163.93327130463027
bernouin went out and soon returned with comminges who was on guard   6.942836387871537
does his island produce him such a revenue   48.13265783674177
robert duly challenged the prince of granada   102.87670200420263
then only when he had heard the step of the horse going away he fell back on a chair saying my god i thank thee that he knows me only   205.6996245965526
no madame replied d artagnan   77.96209219154346
will that satisfy you   17.9439445051959
he turned towards noirtier   148.39452838055809
said athos emptying and refilling his glass   89.6624397208374
de tréville that will be unjust to the guardsmen   86.68430595877169
we have him   136.80332916730742
de tréville they obtained from him special permission to be absent after the closing of the camp   164.47331119728878
and i sign my orders said mazarin taking a piece of paper and writing some lines   92.33670818443535
the priest had a writing teacher at rome make three alphabets one large one middling and one small   118.15567032808984
50065m woman siren that you are do you persist in fixing on me that fascinating eye which reminds me that i ought to blush   142.06694144535842
but to crown all these advantages albert de morcerf commanded an income of 50 000 livres a more than sufficient sum to render him a personage of considerable importance in paris   66.06222630570544
you are really ill and just now were so pale as you came into the room was i pale albert   24.41215604162005
i have seen that mother   206.53799102272393
athos nodded affirmatively then turning and monsieur de bragelonne a young man fifteen years of age attached to the prince de condé has he the honor of being known to you   101.12209598453342
listen to him   61.97345271929842
quite the contrary   65.53183259316127
i have always observed that they bandage people s eyes who penetrate enchanted palaces for instance those of raoul in the huguenots and really i have nothing to complain of for what i see makes me think of the wonders of the arabian nights   123.89621040037797
am i not right m   81.10868872125286
to the wall   26.31993929108195
is not his name monte cristo   140.17433191963067
we would have replaced the parents it has lost have called it benedetto and then in consequence of this good action god would have blessed us   69.55902682098596
a few minutes after twelve o clock bernouin knocked at the queen s bedroom door having come by the cardinal s secret corridor   18.007884844384634
this was the abbé scarron always laughing joking complimenting yet suffering and toying nervously with a small switch   132.44560725126445
then three or four shots were fired   114.5058454077236
is it not   141.62095906606487
you alarm me cried franz   151.79511270305096
for us also   99.95835835482761
oh well i don t know   84.3898973612741
now listen to me and try to recall every circumstance attending your arrest   104.49986085655004
the patron shook his head   146.80102075176984
then the demigod vanished   287.3749866816971
well i m sure said morcerf this is indeed news   120.30174208085717
i say that you do not recognize before you and around you any but those office holders whose commissions have been signed by a minister or king   252.7676365991964
my end will be achieved before i grow old   122.35537991543809
as she uttered the last he hid his mutilated hand hastily in his bosom and fell back on his seat overwhelmed by wretchedness and despair   78.00619611838007
there   10.935105682755278
groslow whom d artagnan s praises had greatly pleased welcomed him with a gracious smile   65.48660901648353
if he send me his poniard it will signify that the emperor s intentions are not favorable and i am to set fire to the powder   101.37127685855135
bravery is always respected even in an enemy   151.9702991065777
well mercédès was married proceeded caderousse   117.58535625525518
for the rest the storm which raged within her doubled her strength and she would have burst the walls of her prison if her body had been able to take for a single instant the proportions of her mind   250.93851610920655
they re entered the drawing room which valentine and madame de villefort had just quitted   52.02529988213627
d artagnan   152.6524352587203
i   269.6160591138656
he answers only by signs   132.61909065631093
as he gazed at him mazarin shook his head slightly as much as to say this is a man who does not appear to me fit for much   189.118378468311
but do you think we ought to accept these 3 000 francs   126.01589653598022
i thought your excellence considered the death of charles i   27.47141814872181
he was a man of small stature with hair blanched rather by suffering and sorrow than by age   28.962174522517287
did you see her after her return from brussels after the king s death   98.45137397932358
your guest is charming but you leave the best company to go into the worst sometimes   220.95299089328404
never more to be separated   184.13709627701053
you were rich noble held in great esteem had all that could render a man happy   138.51568649555637
demanded monte cristo   113.35230740141692
we shall soon see how to dispose he continued of the parliament   97.98805411238081
where are you   288.6907856239821
but how   88.22679206561243
but that is not all   60.08290067654342
this time i did not content myself with looking but i took my knife out of my pocket felt that the point was sharp and sprang over the wall   147.96995288693492
no indeed replied monte cristo with a smile i do not arrogate to myself the right of so doing   188.2170021166163
franz untied it and in the midst of the most profound silence read 40038m extract of the report of a meeting of the bonapartist club in the rue saint jacques held february 5th 1815   107.4201286928374
return then at five o clock and bring that worthy monsieur du vallon with you   120.97192737592847
and yet as you come from dax or pau from tarbes said d artagnan   48.41735821840881
and the two footmen behind were dressed up as green monkeys with spring masks with which they made grimaces at everyone who passed   158.911355600544
if you had been ten years engaged in war as grimaud and i have been my dear blaisois you would know the difference there is between the goods of others and the goods of enemies   96.45552878484992
i was determined to eat only such things as could not possibly have anything soporific introduced into them   63.19769244234281
that we only write to him to entreat that as soon as milady arrives in london he will put it out of her power to injure us   138.5890743675623
it is indispensable my lord   135.2805876128011
said the president   170.24377013118465
said he on perceiving aramis   135.88216115368598
any other person would perhaps have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise   143.82600773989554
the surgeon approached the dying man who seemed to have fainted   113.36307445312524
in the first place because i had spoken much of you to him as you may believe   143.70207472218513
milady became as pale as the sheets in which she was lying and mistress as she was of herself could not help uttering a cry seizing the hand of the novice and devouring her with looks   189.54399844311916
the lovely genoese florentines and neapolitans were all faithful if not to their husbands at least to their lovers and thought not of changing even for the splendid appearance of albert de morcerf   102.28274669239217
one of them carried a roll of paper on which were written these words they are following us   165.6946638574786
oh let us speak of it   59.93416271245244
aramis by a movement of his lips endorsed athos   145.8942228034012
in one second athos joined him   131.68287378731105
noirtier wishes to see you tonight he said in an undertone   155.81563687601104
i will go this instant and consult the queen and we will refer the affair at once to parliament   135.58762186526283
inquired the astonished merchant   100.9171881145135
indeed sir said he to albert if you are come to quarrel with this gentleman because i have preferred him to you i shall resign the case to the king s attorney   35.73375242173769
but tell me i pray what has become of poor edmond   181.3479120541329
no one could suspect that those two hands had been engaged with others in drawing out from the social edifice the keystone of royalty   77.9786578031298
suddenly another idea took possession of his mind so used to misfortune that it was scarcely capable of hope the idea that the noise was made by workmen the governor had ordered to repair the neighboring dungeon   43.64537551473093
said athos   86.05533125282291
but how handsome thou art how fat   84.17778266328173
a being was commissioned to arrest the fatal hand of death about to descend on him   110.80874186824859
he recalled to his mind the details of the first night and with a beating heart and a brain on fire he re entered the hôtel and flew toward kitty s chamber   116.76215772426988
but this time a fresh inmate was left with dantès hope   141.5918816635088
shall i give these papers to m   175.8854042817455
if they continue to advance we must fire again   8.34268400367803
noirtier is desirous of making his will   175.84512956005216
if on the contrary he appeared his noble countenance his brilliant eyes his amiability his polite attention even towards madame danglars soon dispelled every impression of fear   93.15671808970438
in that case said he i should lose her and by my own fault   133.03183862467617
he drew kitty to him   86.62832509544603
i am twenty one years old or rather i shall be in a few days as i was born the night of the 27th of september 1817   103.69351261966158
and now absolve me for i am dying   36.28255772901544
the three lieutenants of the generalissimo   110.04010546379658
oh i don t doubt that   103.94136224740001
respect to fallen majesty   71.5177454295219
the queen will never banish me and even were i obliged to yield to the populace she would yield with me   67.18519275452557
i knight you monsieur le comte   50.823682361480905
old dantès was dying with anxiety to know what had become of edmond   82.6202874728771
but you must do the like for me   145.3176162031784
now let us try to take our revenge   156.04333619844323
at five o clock the next morning she again proceeded and in three hours after entered béthune   23.183357590720007
it is an affair of importance on the service of the king   168.9262511603489
d artagnan ran after her   88.53117741642413
28   180.84411108048084
the body forgets sometimes   107.68911300756636
the notary looked at the count with astonishment   12.561578295789431
but on the contrary and it is i who say it see enemies in all directions   135.02807708654217
the horses seemed to become more lively with each successive step   91.97776306861245
d artagnan himself was frightened by the change in her countenance   106.25988869363037
in brief how much remains   167.6607340131457
villefort s impatience during this scene made the perspiration roll from his forehead and franz was stupefied   77.87199537472745
replied mazarin the people there are very sedate and their habits since the revolution simple   112.49402908730302
a hundred crowns yes sir   97.75361274946636
said porthos to mordaunt i think we have you now my hero   58.85653411499351
asked porthos   184.2476316839121
milady knew the rest   156.5164702579251
i shall always love you   202.40741569605515
valentine he answered during my long watch over you all i have observed has been what people visited you what nourishment was prepared and what beverage was served   177.74065053082867
in stock   68.46958147535676
this mournful appeal pierced the darkness   144.4296492075533
the fingers resumed the jesuit st   144.16511948542302
besides the words of villefort who seemed to interest himself so much resounded still in his ears like a promise of freedom   88.45997763358385
now sir pray do not be offended at the question i am about to put to you as it comes in the way of my duty as your patron   54.44263219035929
replied debray   34.57238915684786
stop a moment said monte cristo   148.5888587490072

cried the lieutenant   95.6580810722182
they say joy never hurts and so i came to you without any warning   109.44713519982994

i do not think you understand me replied caderousse calmly   114.44237439557594
replied the young officer   111.00677969952008
and you will please to accept the word of monsieur d artagnan that he will go straight to la rochelle   136.47610436368262
whilst this scene was going on d artagnan remained with open mouth and a confused gaze   100.96048219093228
done for twenty replied groslow   49.32423109188274
villefort seized the letter and hastily broke the seal   177.6100543189358
everything said the abbé   40.24261067090363
d artagnan but that till that hour he had been at m   130.16107421698413

he placed it on the ground passed his hand over his brow and remounted the stairs alleging to himself as an excuse a desire to be assured that no one was watching him but in reality because he felt that he was about to faint   111.29676090641888
cried the queen that dreadful mischief maker   112.8308277730259
well what matters all that to us   126.09745038300564
the days when such distinctions were so nicely weighed and considered no longer exist in france and the first families of the monarchy have intermarried with those of the empire   50.972188069250606
he had not chatted ten minutes with the people of the tavern before he learned that a woman had come there alone about eleven o clock the night before had engaged a chamber had sent for the master of the hôtel and told him she desired to remain some time in the neighborhood   238.5940149142707
but did you see the queen   112.54223472359065
so great was the contrast between the sombre aspect of m   143.55171958099413
the sergeant made a sign as much as to say he did not understand french and d artagnan tried to make him comprehend by signs and gestures   104.10231660604106
athos with his superior understanding wisely deemed that the supper table would be the most complete and satisfactory point of reunion and at the moment when his friends in deference to his deportment and sobriety dared scarcely speak of some of their former good dinners he was the first to propose that they should all assemble around some well spread table and abandon themselves unreservedly to their own natural character and manners a freedom which had formerly contributed so much to that good understanding between them which gave them the name of the inseparables   131.42700709399142
come do you know of what the count of monte cristo is capable   148.79776149742656
sparks were emitted from the swords like water spouting forth   99.87093120981781
to tell the truth count if i knew less of you i should think that you were less brave than you are   45.4419884140393
she said that the cardinal de richelieu had drawn the duke of buckingham to paris to ruin him and to ruin the queen   47.19223612367604
said porthos   72.67218607710257
and what do you reckon your outfit will cost   153.48097347853925
suddenly he rallied made a violent effort to restrain himself and then a smile gradually widened the features of his disturbed countenance   8.804961769752865
what for five years he had been wanting a faithful servant a friend a helping hand seemed to have fallen from heaven just when he expected it the least   76.47476333219947

i was there too and i never shall forget the old man s smile at this prescription   194.1112744896183
felton s orders were for the rest executed with a silent rapidity that gave a good idea of the way in which he maintained discipline   119.54151664215125
i do not believe there is a god howled caderousse   115.06105080004268
it was not i who killed him said athos in a soft low tone twas destiny   127.65518121622787

now how could a sailor find room in his pocket for a portfolio large enough to contain an official letter   236.93440570346425
the former sign was repeated   53.85920624269127
that which we can not obtain   172.11194461775193
said d artagnan you know you will not be my prisoner very long   136.42124489726575
it must be a very irksome office to be the father of a grown up daughter   169.72705392599073
very well   79.77595267417385
i   176.71459841684458
we appointed to meet at la chevrette   104.79477935347862
come mousqueton   187.45354848174554
but that ought to be visible   137.00334272290246

the old patron who was obliged to sail in the morning in order to land his cargo on the frontiers of piedmont and france between nice and fréjus urged dantès to try and rise   135.99657174492248
monte cristo left alone took three or four steps onwards and murmured here beneath this plane tree must have been where the infant s grave was dug   173.5522332627227
with that sum you can extricate yourself from your present difficulties   150.88879461909082

these horses evidently belonged to the three men who were dressed as cavaliers   113.44905900518181

my lord said d artagnan your eminence sees that we wish to act with all formality and due respect   186.3229543686873
and do you know what has become of him   164.62005777239
said d artagnan getting into his saddle   74.83696054379081
tell me truly whether you are in earnest or if this project of visiting paris is merely one of the chimerical and uncertain air castles of which we make so many in the course of our lives but which like a house built on the sand is liable to be blown over by the first puff of wind   91.52291808485796
they are all entirely black with the exception of a star upon the forehead   117.17810441033538
at length about the hour the governor had appointed footsteps were heard on the stairs   235.5146209143249
i admit even that in my darkest moments i find consolation in that remembrance   99.549653962641
come you are growing discontented you are no longer happy   58.34754909086583
my friend   120.22610822593093
cried villefort   42.56507726378473
the carriage started at a measured pace without betraying by the slightest sign that it contained people in a hurry   115.73928786395807
oh oh   153.6162785411814
he can not make me forget what i shall have lost   230.24012926900753
on what shall i reflect   101.84533023804867
said villefort   67.71843206686819
lucien looked at her for a moment in silence   138.7144959712105
confused sights and sounds seemed to float before me and gradually i fell into a deep heavy slumber   89.11772188595194
it was very natural he being the only person in the whole assemblage except the king the queen and the duke of orleans who slept gratuitously   118.86089695482083
monte cristo for some time kept his eyes fixed on the young girl who gradually fell asleep yielding to the effects of the narcotic the count had given her   171.43884558066497
i have seen you and invited you without any ceremony when you instantly answered that it would be impossible for you to accept as you were going to tréport   28.107780729163906
they arrived at the drinking room of the parpaillot   70.98375358887574
if i bore my proper title i should be a lord   62.43617382027114
but aramis and athos were the only ones to obey this command and the king s example   227.06587345109267
for your majesty can not be ignorant that the musketeers who belong to the king and nobody but the king are the natural enemies of the guardsmen who belong to the cardinal   128.78330293286163
de tréville s note in the other   47.29255418034282
while she seemed to experience an almost childlike delight in watching it her eager animated looks contrasting strongly with the utter indifference of her companion who during the whole time the piece lasted never even moved not even when the furious crashing din produced by the trumpets cymbals and chinese bells sounded their loudest from the orchestra   106.83498369679481
the same evening some friends of mine visited me m   126.31628360880477
eh who knows   100.66456726818248
poor king   207.7242052068808
bertuccio left   147.04854191317997
yes   116.61395340623108
but at that instant a treble voice proceeding from a kind of entresol was heard screeching murder   129.3295950440986
he clung to one idea that of his happiness destroyed without apparent cause by an unheard of fatality   50.72890352775492
then the door of the closet in which d artagnan was was opened and mme   59.3356552203479
very well what did i say to you   194.0658875317417
that i am forbidden to tell   184.87701837431376
mazarin has been listening to discover whether i betrayed him   140.19810783702695
for its arrival will again procure me the credit which the numerous accidents of which i have been the victim have deprived me   6.286788203962331
will your excellency give your name or remain incognito   181.06949557384132
well sir you ought to know that we no longer have a police since we are no longer at paris   174.7224031387277
or of my sister since she was dead   67.2139988763218
yes indicated noirtier with an expression the more terrible from all his faculties being centred in his glance   67.8836898975295
now for the wager   192.46136605456914
so much so that the baroness very rarely comes to the house and my mother has not i think visited madame danglars twice in her whole life   99.60511045479998
they will then fancy it is an ambuscade they will deliberate   151.1438862256935
these rochellais are bungling fellows said athos   173.35795795588055
and when we hesitated to publish the accusatory article he told us it should be inserted in some other paper   129.68305357926855
the woman followed him and lord de winter did not appear   172.12140046758913
goose grease is kood with basdry   102.9430098790843
ah said d artagnan i did not see that   113.02388934800167
upon my honor said the prince   241.01015738666297
what do you want of me   89.27790446184203
the queen had at first positively refused   169.4953304443212
while the struggle between day and night lasted dantès still doubted   167.11315620807054
but he had been so often warned to mistrust first impulses that he applied the maxim to the impression forgetting the difference between the two words   137.55274595623837
from fifty to sixty musketeers who appeared to replace one another in order always to present an imposing number paraded constantly armed to the teeth and ready for anything   72.04848202981438
and you shall have it   80.75621078637938
halloo planchet   208.9924794371372
what is proposed to me would be in fact almost an abdication and an abdication requires reflection   158.9475221644012
you will not have long to wait said the landlord   90.52256113843008
beware of what you do   143.17869424346318
help   31.824628145856607
so saying he stretched out his hand but the other pretended not to see it and he let it drop again slowly by his side   174.20129541969993
ah i can understand how the sight of him struck you replied lord de winter   86.31779766186833
at that moment d avrigny s glance met noirtier s eye   30.681822937806558
close to him dressed in entirely new clothes advanced smilingly count andrea cavalcanti the dutiful son whom we also know   155.880591160428
danglars bent his head which he meant to imply very well   47.621387552662966
what say you to that monsieur du vallon   146.40718555946214
what is he doing   213.31317466938916
oh no monsieur he is very young   210.28505807754317
the sight of marks renewed edmond fondest hopes   116.99331173470061
but alas this attempt to attract notice wholly failed   25.866456405729352
yes athos you may laugh but as long as we were within gunshot of the pier or of the vessels lying by it i was looking for a frightful discharge of musketry which would crush us   91.57450431834818
the haste which the young woman was in to convey to the queen the excellent news of the happy return of her messenger prevented the two lovers from exchanging more than a few words   208.74933768228325
barrois said valentine shut the door and let no one come in   90.54812053691205
then they gained the private staircase and d artagnan was ushered into the oratory   93.77823545733867
yes   103.50732835686424
most palpable proofs said he as you may perceive   105.11446857403796
said aramis   96.18329398626685
noirtier gave valentine such a look of tenderness and gratitude that it was comprehended even by the notary himself   196.75890909111524
act then as you think proper   175.78135873112632
some of the apartments were closed within and without   83.21223973652795
i only wish to say two or three words to your master who gave me a commission to execute about a fortnight ago   52.65498770388599
alicante if you please   144.43571360269544
there may be spies about   44.87326147791198
that s a daring rascal whispered the count   15.708908289185857
but he trusts you will excuse him as very important business calls him to malaga   55.469212582136095
horror   108.39624404086395
where are you   130.32950401371693

ah true   90.29693255352544

hold your tongue you fool   100.73123163164361
why you have just said a man of high distinction   106.32213676908113
nothing sir   126.34785238642013
it is theology in verse   143.31632275189594
i have an idea about them   54.356460984835344
the old man closed his eyes eagerly thereby intimating that such was his wish   194.20498343706623
it will be a work of time but those who have begun by crying out down with mazarin   150.98666181770838
listen you know if i may be relied on   120.04636293509076
d artagnan and planchet spurred their steeds and took the road to paris   25.322959577492

the same evening the grocer or grocers druggist or druggists come and say it was i who sold the arsenic to the gentleman   86.27886097176147
said athos and he threw two pistoles majestically on the table   185.35917165119668

milady during this time continued to strike at him with horrible fury screaming in a formidable way   93.89551885089081
but know you who he was   226.29214736630075
athos remained a musketeer under the command of d artagnan till the year 1633 at which period after a journey he made to touraine he also quit the service under the pretext of having inherited a small property in roussillon   31.205851874844285
as soon as his engagement with the patron of la jeune amélie ended he would hire a small vessel on his own account for in his several voyages he had amassed a hundred piastres and under some pretext land at the island of monte cristo   72.8770800757123

alas madame said the procureur with his imperturbable calmness of manner i consider those alone misfortunes which are irreparable   24.562723947363196

then i must go to the rue st   141.3800691253512
no for i think he never liked me since the day when i was silly enough after a little quarrel we had to propose to him to stop for ten minutes at the island of monte cristo to settle the dispute a proposition which i was wrong to suggest and he quite right to refuse   163.24809323790527
said albert horror stricken   137.36606265083861
really it is only in france these things are done   101.4982729232299
in the evening lord de winter accompanied the supper   183.29598606302392
but as he had but one eye and that eye had become somewhat dim in the course of nine years cocles did not recognize the count   57.825910735908856
porthos pretended to be confused   97.35330474943456
they heard the hissing of the scimitar and the cry of the victim then a truncated mass sank beneath the blow   82.13178011904098
as to the servant he had as we have said been with his master for five and twenty years therefore he knew all his habits and it was seldom that noirtier found it necessary to ask for anything so prompt was he in administering to all the necessities of the invalid   157.61163251391514
all the crowd gave way before morrel   106.54543035588615

shouted mordaunt as his horse plunged and darted off at full gallop   180.8750766480821

when he was only eleven he chose his companions from among the young men of eighteen or twenty the worst characters in bastia or indeed in corsica and they had already for some mischievous pranks been several times threatened with a prosecution   79.51331194715135
besides continued the young man if there did appear some defect in education or offence against the established forms of etiquette i suppose it would be excused in consideration of the misfortunes which accompanied my birth and followed me through my youth   99.4098002917566
the proofs the proofs   173.02916785465416

returned albert i compliment you on it   24.646551754180308
you are wrong to speak thus said the abbé   156.81923887891423
as he had prophesied would be the case he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left leg and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself   164.37987147011555
i see you no longer i am dying help me   19.353086986538287

beppo has taken in plenty of others   94.28636787606938
monte cristo stepped into it with his two friends   153.0102946582489
he went afterward to the innkeeper and bought from him two hundred trusses at the same price   127.15096985021329
the universal response was that the fare was detestable and that they wanted to be set free   89.45139605270691
we shall see said athos for we shall go to the sittings i presume   221.48127425998655

while the three gentlemen walked along the piazza di spagna and the via frattina which led directly between the fiano and rospoli palaces franz s attention was directed towards the windows of that last palace for he had not forgotten the signal agreed upon between the man in the mantle and the transtevere peasant   174.82087392751032
from france   211.95584746669908
answer   132.1674037846118

the court made songs on the parisians and the parisians on the court   81.11786658016402
but you will leave the city on your right   134.29028755946723
a simple question from a friend would have irritated him   261.96308390764614
no indeed i am calm said morrel giving his hand to the count   147.2793277675534
well you said porthos what then   99.65155205598025
the little troop without looking behind them or exchanging a word fled at a rapid gallop fording a little stream of which none of them knew the name and leaving on their left a town which athos declared to be durham   59.642285139312776
cried the stranger   194.1010636523846
the splendor was within   67.93710233361715
ta ta ta ti ta ti ta ta   157.51992359220935
the count left the carriage and mingled in the crowd who followed on foot   181.18783064878266
he inquired   105.64086618925057
but i do as he has made me a baron and a field marshal and i shall never forget that for these two titles i am indebted to his happy return to france   109.2450965462989
and so saying mazarin extended his hand to the officer who sighed as he recognized the ring so gracefully given to him by the queen on the night of the ball at the hotel de ville and which she had repurchased from monsieur des essarts   109.2738670382594
your highness will approach the walls and call out to a man who works in the moat to send them back again   192.1367951216193
there are at this day roman families perishing of hunger though possessed of nearly a million in diamonds and jewels handed down by entail and which they can not touch   103.49712629612362
a tailor said the host   71.02021442915563
he must sell them at whatever price   162.14725942412932
he had frequently called for capital punishment on criminals and owing to his irresistible eloquence they had been condemned and yet the slightest shadow of remorse had never clouded villefort s brow because they were guilty   139.93678475975855
on wheels dear friend   180.13113258796355
when he had fixed his piercing look on this modern babylon which equally engages the contemplation of the religious enthusiast the materialist and the scoffer great city murmured he inclining his head and joining his hands as if in prayer less than six months have elapsed since first i entered thy gates   151.70429130016387
yes said albert but this has nothing to do with the existence of the count of monte cristo   197.57085640347583
eh dear friend said caderousse are wills ever made without codicils   122.8591119526788

yes let us go to the library please   155.3448439074878
he felt as if each stroke of the hammer fell upon his heart   31.89211986387872
let us drink   105.10571090221876
he arose bowed went out returned by the same way he came re entered the hôtel and went to his apartment   125.04044385187284
chapter lx   99.05929673519367
as for our two prisoners you can imagine that they are but little in the vein for conversation   121.06181825211071
the crowd opened and closed again undulating like a stormy sea and the king imagined that he saw shining in the midst of this living wave the bright eyes of athos   123.28044014715262
but i swear to you that this crime shall be her last   125.0640891087406
ma foi   91.85222273126314
pardieu   232.9059893128313
in the space of five minutes the monk turned around to ascertain whether he was followed or not   168.06370076903298
you recollect that sad night when you were half expiring on that bed in the red damask room while i scarcely less agitated than you awaited your delivery   218.2282957060729
hereafter perhaps i shall have the right of giving myself   108.28806259340232
count replied maximilian with an air of gravity those are our most precious family treasures   139.8922486574907
but beyond this he was ignorant   46.23428791805112
this day will be a warm one said planchet in a warlike tone   41.22217565468398
and she rushed out of the room   140.09591039826796
what then said vampa raising his hand with a gesture of disdain while teresa no longer able to restrain her alarm clung closely to him do wolves rend each other   161.01521910908264
they had only halberds before now they have muskets   154.94322989607758

la renaudot warms his sheets   216.28996391782832
ah my dear friend said madame danglars with the same simplicity we before noticed it is a fact   47.31418120006467
she wept abundantly   173.31306346119746
nobody knows you   137.2108895009733
he stationed himself in a room commanding a view of the street pacing the chamber with restless steps stopping merely to listen from time to time for the sound of approaching wheels then to cast an anxious glance on ali   65.79371089944492
he knew what were the rights of the great land owners   186.92199922381013
you are right said d artagnan   195.5734507445458
yes madame replied the astonished king   108.40239210562896
would it not be safer and more certain if i should ask him his name and tell him yours   171.409720236317
are we mistaken and is dantès triumphant in spite of all we have believed   105.78039404329382
and do you like him   137.44111877088434
be quiet porthos said d artagnan we are observed   148.23575211200864
thus armed the count held the lives of five men in his hands   152.6724444098368
no replied dantès   10.201932912875023

never had the struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now and if it was not a sublime it was at least a curious spectacle   161.46145132312003
oliver cromwell has annexed his income resources   115.4278778407657
i want nothing now that i have you said the old man   205.33716375602793
i left five hundred with assunta my sister in law and with the other five hundred i set off for nîmes   174.00943168715926
he murmured in a low voice as he concluded his sentence   252.11352902970975
queens are the weakest of their sex when it comes to such things as these   171.99924400197602
hold madame said porthos let us say no more upon the subject i beg of you   198.6487803637709
no hermine replied debray   27.148620992443597
pay no attention to it   130.7018285431098
certainly   72.2738182169871
the other that of franz and his friends   67.0013951364341
the outlook was sad   179.64693068439388
besides we can but blow out his brains if he proves false said the gascon   231.48218038797992
i was just then looking at them myself   183.4676221738824
it appears that our journey was a remounting journey then   65.52257682623527
yes you look for the signature and you say to yourself all is not lost for that order is not signed   52.719649619940355
nothing more moral   82.48891496515354
to fontainebleau replied eugénie with an almost masculine voice   33.57816311222338
the englishmen were all men of rank   110.09329660636595
eagerly asked madame de chevreuse   89.54969136849508
he went before i came down   97.69888571261276
yes said aramis impart it to us my dear friend unless the honor of any lady be hazarded by this confidence   26.285830384465967
he stood watch day and night with a lance provided with a lighted slowmatch in his hand and he had orders to blow up everything kiosk guards women gold and ali tepelini himself at the first signal given by my father   13.072442963255426
and who was the winner   113.9226581466465
four large vessels recently built had just been launched   140.4464113795782
when four men are so much attached to one another it is only fair that they should serve in the same company   165.38707649008887
to london gentlemen said d artagnan   106.01027865155162
there was certainly enough in all this to turn a head only twenty three years old and mme   236.15184863875496
bertuccio will show me a light   189.8504115005772
then tell the men to be in readiness don t tell them why now   86.02142940046525
can t you guess my dear athos   207.00137342508356
through this the king was to escape the next night and hidden by the black covering of the scaffold was to change his dress for that of a workman slip out with his deliverers pass the sentinels who would suspect nothing and so reach the skiff that was waiting for him at greenwich   145.6229142397529
raoul angry and at the same time uneasy ran after him and seized him by the arm   55.03664665178917
said she   94.77894550598387
what does this mean   146.5271413381905
it is done monsieur she said with a rattling noise which seemed to tear her throat   186.06678921436674
and she fell back weeping into her daughter s arms   183.20391653967744
but d artagnan will discover one   153.39421845998913
i was going to say there s no longer a queen   137.89014827402713
but then you know paleness is always looked upon as a strong proof of aristocratic descent and distinguished breeding   142.96851400713447
men who bear my robe have no age replied the monk dryly   60.75416316675486
an officer as he spoke entered the apartment   103.02035790656635
then turning to d artagnan she said sir you have given me this evening the best advice i have ever received   127.22254293462231
she will soon pass   106.73113374448997
on   166.61755159816244
i hope so with all my heart said the gascon and i confess my weakness   98.03366798886097
d artagnan went successively into all the cabarets in which there was a light but could not find planchet in any of them   60.65491053449936
but in return for a slow profound eternal torture i would give back the same were it possible   23.480057153118793
at the expiration of a minute or two it appeared to d artagnan that m   198.98654825924598
it was upon the cardinal that all the responsibility fell for one is not a despotic minister without responsibility   187.97471491306592
i alone can save you and i will   158.71077598127962
0133m sire i listen said de blacas biting his nails with impatience   25.355743254624713
he whose game is the eagle takes no heed of the sparrow   152.61468409443034
barrois looked at the old man   23.605396848743936
a little farther a little farther said the other   162.3406256164832
a lofty room on the ground floor containing all the ingenious instruments the english eminent in piscatory pursuits since they are patient and sluggish have invented for fishing   40.27854512199475
what have you come for then   75.16500405840502
but so it is   58.01040064323841
and who has abandoned you is that it   105.12117228615669
notwithstanding the judges were so few the trial was to continue   142.01343285170591
and he retired into his room without even asking the cause of so much noise   64.16291481164617
cried porthos clapping his hands and nodding his head   105.12216478770668
at this moment the door opened and in walked the coadjutor   82.7584695044923
she has lost a tooth next to the eyetooth on the left   130.3319221667587
and imperceptibly d artagnan always in the camp always on horseback always in garrison became i know not how in the present age one would express it a typical trooper   192.72817933412966
madame bonacieux is not at liberty this evening replied the husband seriously   138.4044653153163
surrounded by the scotch whom he distrusts although he be himself a scotchman   118.85276166816523
doubtless said aramis for we not only require to be well served in order to succeed but moreover not to fail   53.54737259660642
and he darted out of the room shut the door and waited in the corridor the soldier s half pike in his hand and as if he had mounted guard in his place   147.42082285007945
it seems to me said danglars in his coarse tone ill concealed by a forced smile that you have already got horses enough   236.0302271683317
and he gave her a kiss at which the poor girl became as red as a cherry   130.86750110546717
and young as i was i quite understood that some imminent danger was hanging over our heads   162.1163179301381
i understand and foreseeing that such might be the case i took in spite of my ignorance of affairs certain precautions   19.361983040012333
said mazarin what is the matter   114.01523220284187
but her heart beat with joy and secret hope shone in her eyes   37.445631695941
i then wrote to the cardinal   112.04916500305019
50047m and saying this andrea who had now put on his boots and cravat stole gently to the window and a second time lifted up the muslin curtain   59.82553372299085
ah said the count that is a most conjugal reservation   60.01035889266811
for this time i swear to you we shall act like powerful men who know their enemies   106.71038383868967
the same as ever my friend   135.83469071296503
said all at once a voice full of sweetness and pity   165.21757120824353
on this conviction i allow her to speculate she having her bank and her stockbroker   107.19846781853792
de villefort who sat half bowed over in his chair offering him consolation encouragement and protestations of zeal and sympathy   157.37408995654803
do you hear that   143.08636389232637
two or three hundred roman crowns   42.79279033490289
and when next day taking a fowling piece powder and shot dantès declared his intention to go and kill some of the wild goats that were seen springing from rock to rock his wish was construed into a love of sport or a desire for solitude   73.64767809566028
besides to do all this time is necessary months years   187.13200039820023
as he approached he seemed to recognize the features of this individual   100.11073036795165
madame he said to the duchess i have had the boldness to present myself at your hotel without being known to you   185.05595334438698
cried the novice with enthusiasm   42.53106910412765
milady smiled to herself at the idea which had occurred to her that this might be her old chambermaid   74.41438451353267
or on sardinia   65.41110704070104
ah then you wish to ask advice of me   75.11285504361622
when this terrible chain of ideas presented itself valentine was nearly persuaded to ring the bell and call for help   173.62191747930456
yes we do   139.77144416019559
athos insults us   91.14626228202889
one evening as i was looking over the wall i saw a young and handsome woman who was walking alone in that garden which was not overlooked by any windows and i guessed that she was awaiting m   56.370590834508356
and if anything can be done well we will make it our business   157.4186684525331

busoni turned around and perceiving the excitement depicted on the magistrate s face the savage lustre of his eyes he understood that the revelation had been made at the assizes   176.06895289474676
you wish to leave before everybody and at what hour   8.95187713169247
he certainly did not prevent others from speaking of them before him although it was easy to perceive that this kind of conversation in which he only mingled by bitter words and misanthropic remarks was very disagreeable to him   92.78439225100159
at least there can be no harm in myself and party being in readiness in case your excellency should fail   27.330473373430692
of course he could not inquire from d artagnan himself who he was and what had been his career   59.4846213332229
the king was a few steps behind me when suddenly i saw something rise up in front of me like a huge shadow   33.61181995936067
0303m but what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his secret   201.60566402595023
a third sigh from porthos   197.78556248929044
our bark flew before the wind   169.5189881023896
is it against you or against myself   8.079556579040386
they descended to the first floor   136.84430456945677
but devil take him   43.96304851928707
will you now have the kindness to explain the nature of the statement which has displeased you   91.33358945112377
two remained with the men in black who rummaged every place and took all the papers   23.218040344346605
i attach myself to it   74.85593385262811
leave the room and send me a woman   152.27794701930625
the musketeer who knew that his lieutenant was incapable of jesting with regard to the service obeyed without a word although he thought the order strange   135.39569406947237
you here rochefort   102.67408290877884
i have hung up my sword and cast myself into politics   153.7689080544182
another thing not less essential was to warn charles stuart of the attempt to be made so that he might assist his rescuers as much as possible or at least do nothing to thwart their efforts   116.23855536178
ah i forgot said louis smiling in a manner which proved that all these questions were not made without a motive   105.64598120271974
it was like those mysterious subterraneous noises that precede an earthquake   49.05710251610003
impossible   180.477862194441
but these two words would bring about my condemnation divorce exile   95.75174298730724
listen to me my dear girl said the gascon who sought for an excuse in his own eyes for breaking the promise he had made athos   116.19243758157621
alas sir said monte cristo this spectacle is neither strange to my eye nor my thought   53.53381332407001
but what has become of m   145.59214663796536
consequently morrel having left the rue meslay at half past eight by his timepiece entered the clover field while the clock of saint philippe du roule was striking eight   151.61193929512717
porthos was the first who came to himself   181.56303456594057
albert looked around him   208.61538827338944
you know the proverb all roads lead to rome   139.11113893289317
go and fetch it   145.85628431670006
perhaps my heart was weaker than the hearts of most men and i suffered more than they would have done in my place   125.01703208667678
my dear franz m   171.60570265234628
it was thus and by mere accident may god pardon me if i blaspheme that he heard the confession of the executioner of bethune   195.65484299088976
i have made an agreement with the navy that the access to my island shall be free of all charge   39.53402257700981
but a certain briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it probable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of time   169.6176598317871
it was aramis who broke the silence   137.8299450692117
if you are determined said athos do so   222.45532554708245
everywhere   115.33912095802111
frequenting the café de paris the boulevard de gand and the bois de boulogne during his brief career of splendor the false cavalcanti had formed a host of acquaintances   193.78107631910743
still situated as we are yes do you know how we are situated   4.256663535631162
cried the king all radiant a complete victory   96.51293520641161
you will excite your blood and that would produce an appetite it would require a million a day to satisfy   163.2017765704186
of aramis yes since he has become an abbé   66.53980849552696
i go i depart   122.98486582654425
my faith   79.82276841164037
not at all   38.30937803294795
he was concealed in a thicket   180.62655379595995
ah ah   197.5188138816527
you say he loves you maximilian   109.8212600178831
the rue richelieu and the rue villedot were then owing to their vicinity to the ramparts less frequented than any others in that direction for the town was thinly inhabited thereabout   131.79193681198979
on the sunday following i did return to him   48.687117876253296
here is monsieur d artagnan   122.84012025324012
oh growl as much as you please cried lord de winter but don t try to bite for i warn you that it would be to your disadvantage   139.17807607584268
morrel rose tremblingly supporting himself by the arm of the chair   195.692588378531
and don t forget said d artagnan to bring up four bottles of the same sort for the two english gentlemen   97.06404127181565
then he took off cavalcanti s hat which he placed upon his own head and finally he assumed the careless attitude of a servant whose master drives himself   188.1522292943476
will you enter this carriage and that without offering the least resistance without making the least noise   81.21241030533724
it is too late   177.47374071052928
his manner became more and more lofty every instant   174.1728214674435
his face was furrowed with wrinkles   138.3116287479885
the count placed himself between caderousse and the window thus cutting off from the thief his only chance of retreat   1.520785377544101
certainly   103.93084721659719
speak gentlemen said the prince saluting them   142.91552787188874
not to my knowledge   24.545780138486265
de boville feared to lose   169.67802477555648
the litter borne by two servants now entered the house   142.98614491747153
he must be a great criminal from what the telegraph says   128.93963936723716
and if they follow us we shall be certain they will tell nobody   124.04756411428252
our host has a well furnished cellar the key of which never leaves him   98.4277916081111
hardly however had he taken ten steps before he returned   37.44416588158923
asked porthos   40.79594431921734
did anybody order you to prevent that woman from singing   140.4165642276183
he said i fancied this castle belonged to the ancient branch of orleans   122.59029527183243
dantès noticed that the captain of la jeune amélie had as he neared the land mounted two small culverins which without making much noise can throw a four ounce ball a thousand paces or so   121.21275927554547
you know said the abbé that i was the secretary and intimate friend of cardinal spada the last of the princes of that name   149.91495904118233
in that case you would do better to keep it to yourself   132.29864231004274
said porthos that is what you meant to say   103.15578236514327
asked rochefort eagerly   111.50120948505119
better for him in future that he should be supposed never to have seen me   140.5924759516248
said d artagnan whose purposes were in conflict with that order that is not so easy since i am on the point of falling and my horse too through fatigue   31.784322097760196
they shook their heads   69.48643617778052
go into my cell as quickly as you can   105.3312108494102
he stopped at the end of the corridor and said i can count upon you gentlemen can i not   70.68103885982492
just now d artagnan continued you were disguised i mean to say attired as a murderer and now and now i look very much like a man who is going to be murdered   81.21744579462933
9   174.4162738546188
and you see he added carelessly he has given me the preference by leaving a balance of 100 000 francs   114.83156971879512
and who told you this fine story sire   96.23745788502993
but i am used to him and besides he wouldn t be willing to let me go without him he loves me so much   158.54804699398073
in a moment the door was opened and madame de morcerf alighted leaning on her son s arm   116.1236165640985
and i think that by taking all these precautions we can be quite undisturbed   151.40157931588598
have they then offered a large one   202.03161133379382
the scotch my brothers   70.7904040024392
but at least tell me where he is that i may know whether he is alive or dead said she   40.186258070248584
has he assassinated anyone then   65.33511951178463
pooh   130.50570801361812
i entreat of you not to go near him at least tonight   115.4693199145623
is there nobody from whose house monsieur laporte can come and fetch you   154.5239418284965
with more of mildness than severity   165.15054351674553
the carriages could not move about   106.06223031919515
meanwhile the sailors had collected dried sticks and branches with which they made a fire   161.50334110137965
because replied franz you seem to me like a man who persecuted by society has a fearful account to settle with it   65.43861186642854
now said the king give the word and let us start   143.03897006530693
there it is then said monte cristo as he stepped out of the carriage   69.62611622284939
i have just killed a man whose face is not unknown to me   141.43310442123814
in that case you may be quite at ease   40.35597774815736
the count wished to speak but a gush of blood stifled him   92.3684051576587
truly said monte cristo with your post horses going at the rate of two leagues an hour and that absurd law that one traveller shall not pass another without permission so that an invalid or ill tempered traveller may detain those who are well and active it is impossible to move   65.76436956506146
bread and salt chapter 72   67.32867820129485
during the evening monte cristo quitted paris for auteuil accompanied by ali   105.31893568168783
the major looked at the count with his large staring eyes and then took a survey of the apartment but his gaze almost immediately reverted to the proprietor of the room   157.03086065384792
here it is replied aramis   123.31844742027296
a mere masque borrowed from our own festivities   172.5976596751281
enough blood has flowed enough misery has humbled a town deprived of its king and of justice   93.89284145287527
cried athos   172.5990973534677
the villa of san felice took fire in the rooms adjoining the very apartment of the lovely carmela   78.01095705046025
two feet below you   132.89991720165642
what   109.20195971458159
40302m it is just as i tell you i assure you and you must not be angry with me for you have sought this disclosure   84.92150363152246
what was it then   138.31800230385463
colonel bridge replied the spaniard is a retired wagoner a man of much sense who made one valuable observation whilst driving his team namely that where there happened to be a stone on the road it was much easier to remove the stone than try and make the wheel pass over it   25.668335057538584
then in spite of my cries in spite of my resistance for i began to comprehend that there was a question of something worse than death the executioner seized me threw me on the floor fastened me with his bonds and suffocated by sobs almost without sense invoking god who did not listen to me i uttered all at once a frightful cry of pain and shame   73.00959634052069
cried mazarin with well acted surprise   115.30424703272578
ah   159.66340242333183
the two gentlemen turned away their heads in silence   208.74859497627753
do you promise me to make what use you can of the report of the fortune m   36.674005592687266
d artagnan and planchet followed the gentleman at a distance of five hundred paces   108.83157289710967
and i am like you i want capital   164.7999905985008
for he had risen from his seat and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong upon his rival when mercédès smiling and graceful lifted up her lovely head and looked at them with her clear and bright eyes   104.70678792149117
but you who have taken no such oath why are you here and what cause do you represent   89.46964064491273
but we can not swim to the shore   110.9214465108429
he seems to have a mania for diamonds said morcerf smiling and i verily believe that like potemkin he keeps his pockets filled for the sake of strewing them along the road as tom thumb did his flint stones   117.6560747120896
but he is dead   68.06027186819526
and blaisois looking reproachfully at the cerberus drew the letter from his pocket and presented it to aramis   114.5640478643387
i am a faithful subject of the king madame and all that his majesty commands i shall do   125.7116452521084
that night brought together all those comrades of the guards of m   175.5622762626919
a corridor   66.04735304441596
asked the gascon   42.29219177902176
a moment said athos   202.4518525138501
chapter 87   181.88704764287564
well i went to a horse dealer s where i saw this magnificent horse which i have named médéah   192.05492681705675
monte cristo leaned against a tree and with that scrutinizing glance which was so rarely deceived looked up and down the avenue examined the passers by and carefully looked down the neighboring streets to see that no one was concealed   118.97660997290228
from which you must allow that one runs considerable risk in purchasing   100.14635974790437
we expect him every moment   48.78978947418932
i will look at it again   126.05097521443231
no said morrel   229.4675922630206
by this means the end of the month was passed but his resources were now exhausted   4.146472580640534
ah   71.27061016201988
but i am eager to see our young vicomte   154.089632560857
said julie remembering valentine but whom with a delicacy natural to women she did not name before her brother   116.28000675708998
and he went right to the prisoner   210.86279364495178
this too was the opinion of comminges who withdrew somewhat reassured   199.29711129083984
let us pass on to private and personal stipulations   77.75152639335164
whew   92.25450958765106
ho   38.585982512869066
his teeth were clenched and his speech had a short dry accent which indicated that something dark was at work within him   42.14170166025191
and where are we going   151.69110306120737
so much the better   240.3320488036074
with such a heart as yours and such a sword one passes through the valley of the shadow of death a dozen times unscathed and unalarmed   66.96123498687513
and who is the judas who has concluded this infamous bargain   117.7879097987696
besides we are in a situation to overlook ceremony   125.39268002012673
it need not be said that if in the depths of the heart there is a sentiment more tender it reaches then quite naturally the highest exaltation of which it is capable   207.26512620709377
asked the abbé   198.157200528172
i reflected for a long time and with the hope of averting some impending misfortune i resolved that benedetto should accompany me   129.73479232468023
i was really afraid that you were going to force that villain particelli upon me   32.29189692048324
interrupted monte cristo   40.44645294491647
thus i shall rejoice when mademoiselle eugénie perceives i am but a pitiful atom with scarcely as many hundred thousand francs as she has millions   145.364604347621
ay but said aramis that young fellow is decidedly a spy   98.99597535722552
his dogs whose caresses he loved welcomed him in the antechamber   44.13246244813928
he said   58.568244772749225
laurels however were not meat and drink and the people had for some time been in a state of discontent   141.38921622437482
we shall take to ourselves the poniards and the rope replied the duke   175.13867569007084
as little sensitive as was the heart of d artagnan he was touched by this mute sorrow   113.6615216991253
we are not at sartène or at corte   92.42734866255665
d artagnan returned to the rue tiquetonne with porthos still possessed by the wish to find out who the man was that he had killed   144.74379307394776
not a thought was given to a life which you once mercédès had the power to render blissful   95.70688679392347
behind the head of the bed and concealed by a stone fitting in so closely as to defy all suspicion was a hollow space and in this space a ladder of cords between twenty five and thirty feet in length   112.027691315515
the carriage proceeded rapidly towards paris   66.1845192795815
let us go to the parpaillot then for here the walls are like sheets of paper   61.07702504976274
you will make some desirable acquaintances   134.12034745374586
with a man like you i fear nothing   195.72881002766997
the ball chapter 71   105.29137275473686
franz d épinay said he   173.12364218948858
you are my friend today   177.0716420582918
i am no longer astonished that you knew me not   29.653036324441246
tell me till you are weary that i have restored you to happiness   161.39793713259843
that is why i have uttered the words for which you blame me   120.15947285974221
that would be too grand   124.32850654567964
bravo   149.288527737536
it is by his courage please observe by his courage alone that a gentleman can make his way nowadays   98.5224753412667
his right name was noirtier de villefort   135.99196102047668
that comforts me a little   120.32728848511314
he only satisfied himself by milady s pulse that the case was not serious   46.049555326738286
only reflect how much the two descriptions resemble each other   81.52397815413119
his presentiments were realized as we shall see and his uneasy forebodings had goaded him pale and trembling to the gate under the chestnut trees   71.3165030309031
a resemblance between the boy and the man explained the mystery of this regenerated existence   167.76033907840036
he saw then that he was with a poet   58.97785316798356
albert gathered up his papers hastily rang the bell to pay the thirty francs he owed to the landlord and offering his arm to his mother they descended the stairs   101.30671307053174
he   107.72816558342952
you must have received a false report or you have gone mad   215.12020160014305
the child stuck out his lips and turned away his head in a disdainful manner saying he s too ugly   171.134892864802
totally disregarding the business of the stage he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the beauty of each pretty woman aided by a powerful opera glass   132.22687413553535
felton was sent away   71.01317183965938
cried she   54.46474754097748
you know how much he loves me my mother   22.223022798070602
then he opened the door bowed and went out before the young man stupefied by his letter had ventured to address a word to him   121.0853851789053
me   122.53932946404852
he called porthos to look at it   63.737308553321895
i depend on you to accompany me to the opera   166.40357327650136
i am fatigued with reading and all this latin confuses me   157.91724716530902
they are two qualities out of the four   55.91968662886427
at five o clock precisely the count arrived before the house at auteuil followed by ali   146.66223417531856
what do you wish me to do   125.77697691149753
an instant after the boat rowed by two men advanced rapidly towards him   140.05521128057825
eh then what are the sentinels about   112.72505907436896
valentine shook her head   122.43804489974126
he said turning to d artagnan   92.12418642325792

villefort sprang into the passage exclaiming the emetic   210.46900583727566

said the count in a tone which showed how gladly he would have been admitted to the secret   170.46505638814915

the jailer went out and returned in an instant with a corporal and four soldiers   115.30383452004409
he will have fallen asleep waiting for me or else he will have returned home where he will have learned that a woman had been there   46.055651277757875
just so   133.5886222693839

friends he said we must leave this craft at once or we are dead men   178.40395910534554
well he is a man of bad taste and is still more enchanted with another   35.02117504258172
it may be supposed that dantès did not now think of his dinner but he insisted that his comrades who had not his reasons for fasting should have their meal   161.75012841267397
strength and sagacity   146.39523377153998

your very devoted husband baron danglars   108.78354341729285

mazarin   140.19682046693373

alas do you love nothing else in me   123.45935689911684
a slight movement of surprise escaped dantès   115.3451878902544
cried edmond blushing deeply   87.71551001212559

twenty five pistoles said d artagnan   175.3371860313277

they rode forward and reached abbeville   126.35126110520069
among these thousands moved in bands numbering from one hundred to two hundred pale and haggard men clothed in rags who bore a sort of standard on which was inscribed these words behold the misery of the people   214.6356797646821

cried a young voice that made athos start   97.01374489754386
then at the other extremity he heard the footsteps of those who were pursuing him   204.02375087992135
porthos smiled   154.99397874702214
all was over   153.7067046720915
and he favored this man the more as grimaud became the more and more odious to him   75.94553640846985
the king turned upon his heel without reply and almost at the same instant the captain of the guards m   159.16488427839607

he again struck it and with greater force   75.50434525859357
d artagnan dismissed planchet and requested his visitor to be seated   98.60495451912615

pray do so i delight in stories cried the cardinal   118.97828829182102

a cloud passed over danglars brow   122.74875296105833
men of loyalty are scarce   73.77986723536014
you approach that famous point of free will which is a mortal rock   93.87783402891554
yes continued his eminence   88.65379788541856
sir said villefort after the first salutations were over you were sent for by m   134.89528536625983
replied the count with increased anxiety   129.6584723928999
that is sufficient my lord   204.86814420319416
no it passed into mine   16.69629008267961
on the next day mathieu molé the chief president whose courage at this crisis says the cardinal de retz was equal to that of the duc de beaufort and the prince de condé in other words of the two men who were considered the bravest in france had been attacked in his turn   95.389914894498
now gentlemen said d artagnan go up to your room again   131.78835601480517
fine sport by jove   52.09785301880983
it appeared to d artagnan that he had embraced a statue   116.83305538196079
i know it   176.58295613561592
i feel myself drawn toward you i who have never loved anyone but my benefactor i who have met with nothing but traitors and impious men   247.22129933404256
julie threw herself into the arms of the count   74.34175402464037
the young girl trembled very much at hearing the stories   153.12854514868837
in case i am killed the captain s name is roger and the skiff is called the lightning   58.18369683162199
de tréville in allusion to the gifts he pretended that d artagnan had received from the duke of buckingham   174.9299364329643
this crisis past i endeavored to catch your eye but could not   108.6857552140436
cried monte cristo   66.80136361476033
for a whim   221.49556211772807
and then the past will no longer exist   216.20056995788366

why he said does he enter without first asking for an audience   105.48002288085326

oh my god   69.72651144799802
no replied d artagnan if i recollect well what you said it was nothing out of the common way   174.07722050125878
said mazarin   124.59653913656528
is it mazarin s proximity that makes you so prudent   207.73182915498904
adieu then till we meet again said valentine tearing herself away   137.99058904891538
yes i understand now to find one woman you court another   68.43473474216108
he hastened to the rendezvous found the lackeys at their posts placed them as sentinels at all the outlets of the hôtel and came to find athos who had just received this information when his friends returned   119.58586603921893
however slowly the stranger had walked he was gone on his way or perhaps had entered some house   152.39551173227176
i am too good natured   172.5016111555059
but instead of growing easier dantès pains appeared to increase in violence   100.87026036591824
you grow a little too warm in my opinion about the fate of madame bonacieux   17.878145758689314
no   184.01912214363486
what can they have said   114.20434322882447
through the crevices in the granite he had seen the two young peasants talking with the carbineers and guessed the subject of their parley   168.10314558440948
asked albert lighting his cigar   93.93152618446368
and as i had known since morning the reason of my abduction with the help of the sheets i let myself down from the window   12.971014275118904
the young woman drew back filled with surprise and terror   33.77254858304926
coachman gallop on   138.5096397360955
and you say in his leisure moments the worthy man was a poacher   227.56924743355356
the driver was paid as the door opened and stepping lightly up the stairs madame danglars soon reached the salle des pas perdus   162.39725887651736
that would occasion a loss of precious time   68.67952948415675
i will perform your commission word for word my lord   208.6363510746228
listen then to the supplication of a despairing woman   55.39804732643743
that s well   198.77071029895265
mazarin came within three steps of d artagnan and pushed a spring in the wall   108.47736081713938
if it but lasts most capital responded porthos   138.60929242750296
why   66.48390305922099
this oath was no longer a vain menace   133.52777757615885
we are leaving paris and when our journey is paid we shall have 5 000 francs left   157.22568792515847
it was arranged for the evening and no other time will serve   163.2398768261873
and hostilities with la rochelle had commenced two or three days before about a fort which the duc d angoulême had caused to be constructed near the city   131.07508063089594
they all asked   118.8986063809278

yes your excellency   53.509579018842246
and the valet placed the cup on the table nearest to the sofa which was like all the rest covered with papers   144.44069395091245
very well replied m   121.22089260999927
what is offered from a generous heart should be accepted generously   212.32906892842678
i quite understand why you ask sir said eugénie making a sign that her father might be seated and in fact your two questions suggest fully the theme of our conversation   97.21698827009966

i shrink before nothing but impossibilities   89.26638801295778
you know that i am not alluding to you   208.31385188633422
oh you need not avow this religious indifference my lord   114.01718263275241
ah that is true said athos   187.06788100744572
morrel still alive   47.007240356965866
you could do no such thing fernand   131.65911535711018
and the two carriages passed on towards their different destinations   112.46046540500075
a third the illustrious mazarin stealing the portfolio of prime minister from monsieur de chavigny who had expected to have it   177.38955923859132

cried d artagnan   90.58183955096598
bonacieux saw her go without being able to follow her   131.0004206690172
a horse   111.0023640256884
repeated mousqueton   65.85838063640857

athos a prisoner   124.66062434163315
send me the keeper of the seals séguier   118.19189900180747

in two hours time said he these persons will depart richer by fifty piastres each to go and risk their lives again by endeavoring to gain fifty more   158.39617219559602
his vigilant eye watches over and penetrates to the bottom of the heart   58.4047603026302

we left england ignorant of the state of politics here having left paris before the departure of the king   51.23125723978262
so much the worse for them   84.40753404320091
25 the spahis are french cavalry reserved for service in africa   76.70707068190387
said the cardinal in a low voice   167.96485549520142
besides he feared that by resisting longer he should appear selfish in the eyes of athos   20.383137916616462
said athos who are going to be killed in order that monsieur de bouillon may have his estate at sedan restored to him that the reversion of the admiralty may be given to the duc de beaufort and that the coadjutor may be made a cardinal   43.79020775190874
in a few days you will be away from this place   81.09559421110139
athos uttered a cry of joy and admiration ran to a closet and drew forth workmen s clothes which the four friends immediately put on   137.15251960118653
can the end which i proposed be a mistaken end   268.67407118201095

porthos put his back into the sheath   163.22454454691083
the lackeys followed   105.61295236882802
what would be the use of carrying so much more weight   163.80597356935323
i make no account of the harm mordaunt can do   117.4115420851809
you must be mad my friend said the baroness   217.2351938250305

and dame nanette sprang to the window threw it open and in such a piercing voice that it might have been heard in the square of notre dame help   103.04490596670325
not such as he is now represented broken down like an old man suffering like a martyr his body bent his voice failing buried in a large armchair as in an anticipated tomb   154.1270955949974
we have a queen blinded by a belated passion   132.14186340030582
but only to take a little rosewood casket with her cipher upon it and went out again immediately   142.05754508625125
i can not comprehend what induced you to buy three   138.92064085094665
then with an inexpressibly sorrowful inclination of the head he quitted the count and bent his steps to the east of the city   81.98194185314654
i a protestant   223.03720558370554
the sight of this creature who had nothing of the woman about her recalled awful remembrances   165.85049709202684
athos had dropped some words which proved that the conversation she had with the cardinal had fallen into outside ears   40.623949586386274
well do you understand monsieur   235.65864291240888
now understand me said the count no direct questions my dear morcerf   33.45269450969499
i do not thus betray my enjoyments to the vulgar   111.40382838204513
then offer him double that sum   123.69451857965892
thought the gascon here s a young blade who has already his love affair who doesn t at all agree with athos in his hatred to the fair sex   99.44133109771875
speak not of crowns   154.51025223533716
yes monsieur we are cousins said porthos without being disconcerted as he had never reckoned upon being received enthusiastically by the husband   53.84038311497429
it was rita s father who brought his daughter s ransom in person   15.717134710253774
who said so   104.15515071870313
the major s eyes sparkled brilliantly   121.79703939209595
you are born to good fortune said franz as he returned the letter   209.11011882802933
yes your excellency and it is true   147.44010289366864
coquenard   35.530344575458585
replied d artagnan bursting into a laugh   24.730835295463294
who are you then   8.898527498122675
valentine had approached or rather had placed her lips so near the fence that they nearly touched those of morrel which were pressed against the other side of the cold and inexorable barrier   61.54946753122302
why   149.5115437543744
i faith i don t know   58.44485562927691
mercédès and albert were in that room   74.71525568101528
never never   199.05523983935893
come added the king   154.34375125516274
oh hear me to the end   174.0248284506149
thank you i have just returned from sea   102.1508977592137
pardon me my friend if i disturb you said the man with the red handkerchief but i want to speak to you   118.27900704397909
it was madame de villefort who came to witness the effects of the drink she had prepared   127.38760144019781
but it is beginning again i say   10.378847841889936
pardon you monseigneur   118.11992642588234
section 1   37.49164839869414
you may easily imagine with what eagerness i welcomed him and how minutely i related the whole of what i had seen and heard   144.7528168915128
courage   230.4722994593032
the smallpox   146.88798990082466
just as the brain retains on waking in the morning the dim and misty outline of a dream   107.33284206397083
such feats sir are done once and never repeated   14.70474579195205
what do you propose to me d avrigny   210.44498230229553
contact the foundation as set forth in section 3 below   193.68053348256433
he looked around and saw the objects of his search upon the chimney piece   205.03405052426018
but observed the honest notary the count is i think mistaken   81.70962350407487
come in cried athos   258.5887730812547
the duke ran to the rampart and perceived on the other side of the ditch three cavaliers with two riding horses   65.5931400255393
while today we have a splendid lawn bordered by trees which appear to be a hundred years old   113.7018486324117
we immediately drew and at the first pass i laid him stark dead   80.62708857162797
athos went to pay a visit to madame de vendome left his name at madame de chevreuse s and wrote the following letter to d artagnan dear friend i am about to set off with aramis on important business   117.44042769814305
then winter took his place at the head of the first squadron and the king with athos on his right and aramis on his left at the head of the second   157.4332589786455
but he is perfectly unknown to me   150.14748803874784
my lord said the young officer summoning to his mild countenance all the hatred he could find in his heart my lord i swear all shall be done as you desire   78.42953245592211
mala ducis avi domum continued louis xviii   107.78802895299108
so i took what little money i had and the best of my things and i got away   214.12473564755305
the other was an instrument that was all   219.18396865905555
the abbot ch   104.03635920517843
so i should suppose by her dress   161.27148933586975
yes sire   52.32817320952141
ten minutes afterward she was at home   40.376268550052885
asked the enraptured villefort   160.94076141612055
beauchamp had not been seen since the day he visited albert and those of whom the latter inquired always told him he was out on a journey which would detain him some days   68.33323895012526
in that case said athos planchet must receive seven hundred livres for going and seven hundred livres for coming back   54.850060929341495
mordaunt one of my secretaries will remit this letter of introduction to his eminence the cardinal mazarin in paris   150.66706061553447
meanwhile they gave up to mazarin the handsomest room in the chateau   89.47239182168504
as for fernand himself he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the damned   91.58869334026946
well   156.444021802817
i will take the five scraps of paper that i now hold as bonds with your signature alone and here is a receipt in full for the six millions between us   132.68318698860833
and when they had arrived at a distance of a hundred steps from it monsieur d arminges took his usual precautions and sent on in advance the count s two grooms   5.2747200477104315
at the first glance d artagnan judged that the mind of the king was stormy   234.70264035908204
de monte cristo appears to exert a mysterious and almost uncontrollable influence over all the members of our family   135.3678450058825
certainly   7.85943178721574
do you really think so   82.9454426639605
he kept on his way at the same rate heedless about upsetting those whom he met on the road   114.92006404911115
raoul resolved not to quit the room without having spoken to the beautiful girl with the soft eyes who by a strange fancy although she bore no resemblance reminded him of his poor little louise whom he had left in the chateau de la valliere and whom in the midst of all the party he had never for one moment quite forgotten   111.33251968982131
let us see   204.90563289072162
and as his orders were always clear distinct and easy of execution his comrades obeyed him with celerity and pleasure   155.3672259796672
said porthos   34.28862940320536
windows   146.79064818120224
repeated a voice behind the count and why   114.66078771351506
athos made two visits in paris   153.5182444032823
asked aramis   164.55862141490996
have you never experienced for anyone that sudden and irresistible sympathy which made you feel as if the object of it had been your old and familiar friend though in reality it was the first time you had ever met   212.8746956198254
d artagnan seized the hands of athos with an anguish difficult to be described   28.312036616203258
in short said porthos when all my expenses are paid i shall have at most thirty crowns left   132.53820472450647
still franz and the count were compelled to advance in a stooping posture and were scarcely able to proceed abreast of one another   83.96312832785594
others filling the coach houses where the equipages encased and numbered appeared to have been installed for the last fifty years   144.61812951854074
yes replied d artagnan let us still be musketeers and let us retain as our battle standard that famous napkin of the bastion st   50.62378042294131
it was time   100.29202941284632
well come   111.85028455026514
the breakfast consisted of a piece of bread   141.32974721370013
i shall be about again in a few days   58.90516828445925
thieves might strip the house it would annoy me less than to be disobeyed   112.01820502053545
for that amounts to the same thing as if i asked you for something   118.36993829077831
very good said the major i do not demand more you understand your visit here today is not of your own suggestion is it   95.77439745047535
i should think we would see him   104.23438128049656
it would have required the penetration of œdipus or the sphinx to have divined the irony the count concealed beneath these words apparently uttered with the greatest politeness   160.7121441813441
is an order for me to confine myself to a sort of prison from which he will release me by one of his satellites   77.92021633988313
no   185.0418828947307
but milady felt herself denounced even by his terror   208.05851114116433
i left with mingled feelings of sorrow and delight   17.77793719053004
as d artagnan pursued his investigations a more abundant and more icy sweat rolled in large drops from his forehead   88.39755964638557
can it be possible   148.55105917681067
there is neither happiness nor misery in the world   23.30256277192477
without the loss of an instant the carriage was placed on board and the two travellers embarked without delay   105.71064688311493
a good journey gentlemen   203.77924027135037
said the queen   26.365953324972978
meanwhile said felton convey me to the little bay of   97.44713136686697
asked athos   161.3654158112368
he lost it the day before yesterday   93.29085615429497
and if i lose   136.48267552694804
we engaged our word   10.320683687684763
aramis   78.69918225130286
but d artagnan was still in a desponding mood   182.96807877402125
he entered third and aramis who shut the gate after him last   104.4150242430461
whether porthos understood him or did not understand him giving way to his anger monsieur said he you stand a chance of getting chastised if you rub musketeers in this fashion   33.90923747957727
i am commissioned to seize your person sir said comminges in the same tone and with the same politeness   157.87067243748749
he recognized the influence of mercédès and saw why her noble heart had not opposed the sacrifice she knew beforehand would be useless   82.14739638905894
i undertook it because it was what my captain had bade me do   149.2096224754011
he answered the appeal of his friend by an affirmative nod of the head   140.8096742632585
oh unfortunate   177.86663103620774
by your brilliant and almost sublime conversation you have elevated me above the ordinary level   158.91618924687083
i know of none which cavalcanti possesses excepting his palace in lucca   111.99052568431878
le comte de soissons by the grand prior by the duc de longueville by the duc d eubœuf by the comte d harcourt by the comte de la roche guyon by m   14.81384299117326
but this smile soon disappeared and returning to the adventure of meung tell me continued he had not this gentlemen a slight scar on his cheek   193.23346344486558
the dinner can not have had time to get cold   213.96419936619057
a peculiar smile passed over dantès lips   133.4473489857094
shouted the duke   145.9514652372047
said the musketeer   203.5627366653562
and yet he had not let fall a single word indicating any previous acquaintance between them   10.847931476897102
cried athos be men   163.0530456357659
slight stains of blood which came from the wound inflicted upon the man who accompanied the carriage as a courier or from one of the horses dotted the road   90.77266872000745
and when i have signed he said what is to be my guarantee   116.36932386468575
asked he   60.185540103274164
within this mansion you are absolute mistress of your actions and may go abroad or remain in your apartments as may seem most agreeable to you   136.87967501442438
the battle of lens gained   93.30785400858677
to take the hundred pistoles d artagnan   60.30793419614909
take it to rothschild s or lafitte s and they will take it off your hands at once   145.60006269907802
well said porthos in the first place make a bargain with the mercer and a good bargain   32.523527049154794
chapter 62   15.412529369810585
indeed your excellency i had very considerable difficulty in obtaining them and as it is they have cost an enormous price   145.50202376039303
yes it is very annoying said vampa   209.09386916547427
he had not been more than ten minutes in the drawing room before he drew danglars aside into the recess of a bow window and after an ingenious preamble related to him all his anxieties and cares since his noble father s departure   98.0306068816926
i should like to understand said porthos   110.36953460525405
about what   121.42516479035487
when d artagnan arrived in sight of the bare spot of ground which extended along the foot of the monastery athos had been waiting about five minutes and twelve o clock was striking   35.989633028882494
it is all a matter of imagination   96.55072956357206
he was dressed in plain clothes and wore at his button hole the ribbons of the different orders to which he belonged   157.5819255789388
the guards asked permission of la ramee who gave it to them but not till the evening however   150.22719551424657
pen ink and paper are my tools and without my tools i am fit for nothing   174.72643638610646
but i deny that it is so in the part of it inhabited by monsieur d artagnan for i can affirm sire if i can believe what he says that there does not exist a more devoted servant of your majesty or a more profound admirer of monsieur the cardinal   75.375840038539
as we have said he perfectly understood the old man s vocabulary and if he did not use it more often it was only indifference and ennui which prevented him from so doing   260.69811482508277
her temper was uncertain but she came at last to accustom herself to my little ways and understand my little wishes   101.78404826651395
i inured my body to the most violent exercises my soul to the bitterest trials   7.525234043347766
d artagnan bent low and following the cardinal up the secret staircase soon found himself in the study whence they had first set out   60.38623795439911
good my child   208.99241518772754
from this point everything was a blank to dantès he knew nothing more not even the length of time he had been imprisoned   65.50708443231498
nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states   44.103238900612425
sir   127.32936610038784
the young girl had freshness and beauty which many duchesses would have purchased with their coronets   159.73646264063706
very inconvenient upon my word   37.241204049859206
valentine and villefort were dumb   210.7070783188093
stop sir look yonder he whispered   49.307454175508084
monsieur d artagnan   104.94730025032473
it was now the coadjutor s turn to fix his piercing eyes on louvieres   41.224066205186276
did you feel nothing of it yesterday or the day before   194.98924274452958
jussac one of the first swordsmen in the kingdom   166.47609111628975
and one fine morning in better health than ever before he set out for france   86.43927264012898
tell it athos tell it   134.5634374430099
well continued valentine the reason of my proposing it was that i might escape this hateful marriage which drives me to despair   53.3584508628017
your death   223.96841212279594
i left it where i found it monsieur   94.14078393522176
nobody ever came into milady s apartment before nine o clock and it would require three hours to go from the castle to london   70.25787259658432
i mean mercédès that you are thus harsh and cruel with me because you are expecting someone who is thus attired   28.11042573385197
then cried planchet joyously i see well that it is the same comte de la fere whom we seek   133.16059404586727
50093m you are mistaken sir exclaimed morrel raising himself on one knee his heart pierced by a more acute pang than any he had yet felt you are mistaken   245.2887909654585
d artagnan was conqueror without much effort it must be confessed for only one of the officers was armed and even he defended himself for form s sake   176.6590832375942
bah replied monte cristo impossible   85.87119088713021
it was however necessary to affect weakness and pain not a very difficult task for so finished an actress as milady   81.08702297447695
i never ceased to search and to inquire   154.49503985138273
the baroness who had signed returned the pen to the notary   159.5180874553423
be easy my dear boy   136.33932821418
and knows lansquenet   168.51991282511653
four   86.44842409788924
and continued he significantly with a hand on his breast and shaking his head that is more than everyone can say nowadays   77.8349266812987
40276m listen said the baroness smiling   62.86590601511504
oh gentlemen you see it is all useless and that my father s mind is really impaired said villefort   202.56784612146274
my lord i saw him run off from the top of the terrace   53.42635884471598
franz d épinay   57.08384165476835
the king was invited to come and see the hanging   157.80148335628775
ah maximilian i had hoped you set a higher value on the title of friend   74.96028146445816
he had been struck to the heart by a frightful recollection the conversation he had heard between the doctor and villefort the night of madame de saint méran s death recurred to him   148.0587732434856
wait sir wait said louis xviii   131.74140687514105
la ramee went up to him and looked over his shoulder to see what sort of a book it was that had so singular an influence over the prisoner as to make him put off taking his dinner   153.44380926230377
raoul turned toward athos who showed him by a secret sign that he did not wish him to go   177.69305395127574
the water passed over his head and the sky turned gray   165.66799516177713
i charge him also with my blessing for my children and with the sentiments of my soul for yourself my dearest sweetheart   99.55155124163619
for france   150.61495042256405
yes they appear to be searching a wounded or dead man   82.50427768217494
edmond said mercédès i have but one word more to say to you   176.13431327937505
but his quickness was not of much use to him   28.48985413557594
yes sir   62.51964819194524
porthos my friend said d artagnan don t distrust providence   74.1869554521943
softly gentlemen   125.12234013311316
the countess g who knew lord ruthven declared that the count was a vampire   71.26381704896966
impossible monsieur   127.57145877139668
still more must be done   137.89601704440574
there was such dead silence that friends and enemies could have heard these words   189.87315038264126
thanks my god said he at least thou strikest but me alone   68.28936346374475
the other leaned against a tree supported there by the two valets and was praying fervently with clasped hands and eyes raised to heaven   111.63582920323954
then put down three hundred livres said the procurator s wife with a sigh   101.5821263683702
they may if they like but we will not   69.44139307322904
monsieur de beaufort made the experiment a third time but by this time pistache s patience was exhausted   166.4203106171727
they will be much less likely to   112.34039402896197
d artagnan took the paper hesitatingly and cast his eyes over it   140.1702941084016
you suspect me monsieur de rochefort   90.42909286865668
caderousse sighed deeply and fell back with a groan   149.26407916954912
on the contrary i shall feel much pleasure   95.01824541003917
don t you understand porthos   157.07868360366905

cried he what are we going there for   19.17567533433821
i feel some need of it   86.91945724293673
in french en avant   155.0397206331872
sign the treaty then monseigneur said aramis   59.09200319265679
you can borrow at least a thousand crowns on it   140.02783840189065
no said she you will avenge me   165.1455745218522
i am older than your eminence although i possess not your wisdom   74.10604477517603
the affair was described to the messenger with all the effervescence of enthusiasm   77.43657447305827
madame de villefort could not drop the curtain which she held like a funeral pall over the head of valentine   198.89290723543786
in every respect   194.04643604324883
de villefort towards his own relations i ought to have denounced him to the authorities   89.8238180114692
do you see that island   134.73907209780202
and on what occasion   185.64337275538804
you scoundrel   111.64604567657507
while affecting to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder the mind of dantès was in fact busily occupied by the idea that a person so intelligent ingenious and clear sighted as the abbé might probably be able to solve the dark mystery of his own misfortunes where he himself could see nothing   145.76138509991478
this arrangement pleased every one   112.80662666194146
not one of us has failed the others at this rendezvous   73.9502310212286
i thought you said you were the chief   44.168453853654526
all i can do for you is to make you one of the agents of that providence   63.03100275332435
athos hastened upstairs to conceal his emotion and regained with hurried steps the porch where olivain was waiting with the horses   168.82542120629955
what end would that answer   73.49101003548596
but jest as he might he gained nothing   133.14378463077728
at this moment a shriek was heard that seemed to come from the river   151.89678005908831
your name   88.4942992837973
said the procurator s wife slowly and sadly   92.42625065810415
said athos   76.50757189951554
on paper   217.08357852428574
porthos boasted of the strength of mousqueton who was big enough to thrash four men of ordinary size   134.57959867007742
i shall not leave so near the queen that source of discord with which the deceased cardinal so often caused the anger of the king to rage above the boiling point   71.0500898393446
in half an hour la ramee returned full of glee like most men who have eaten and more especially drank to their heart s content   166.64496297694959
they seemed awaiting orders   190.27734324697164
ah said morcerf there goes a happy man   107.35218165584912
yes replied maximilian an englishman who represented himself as the confidential clerk of the house of thomson french at rome   94.62626085482734
d artagnan and athos laughed aloud   146.87704119114323
let us go and see your beggar sir and if he is such as you describe him you are right it will be you who have discovered the true treasure   102.75901143667824
we have observed that young cavaliers received presents from their king without shame   113.79130681086039
devil take the vain fellow said d artagnan   209.99352815016906
both the heart and the ground absorb that beneficent moisture falling on them and nothing is outwardly apparent   139.01861009215511
i said a million replied danglars with the confidence of ignorance   85.38727282701626
thousands of men it is true will have to pay for my happiness with their lives   4.770884808143975
well then monsieur bernajoux said d artagnan tranquilly i will wait for you at the door   20.088331058151027
said gaetano with a smile   153.41242083574483
at sight of this man d artagnan started and half drawing his sword sprang toward the door   115.67443163541012
he knew nothing   162.8139119814978
there you see exclaimed danglars   135.14398234376554
is the spot far from here   93.4318027180375
i can believe that it is the dignity of your rank alone which makes you cruel to me   153.26678675550048
i go sir said mordaunt advancing a few steps to the door by which he had entered   132.8705689925517
ah   119.61198200019777
they did not even acquaint me with their intentions and i only discovered them by chance that is why i have been so reserved with you dear grandpapa   31.891084805148836
hush   239.3204326747779
that door is guarded d artagnan   58.9728343422702
yez yez said the swiss   56.68688805462804
nothing i should like better   79.11804920295182
it closed an old account   189.50890039105929
so that our hostelry is daily going to ruin   40.277411200015734
pâtés made by the successor of father marteau are described   83.24260409989381
and i also believe that he has not a very warm affection for his sister in law   167.68924313393507
the movement was executed in silence and with precision   206.41099447470066
oh no   175.6839847101186
revolving all this in her mind she cast her eyes around her and arranged the topography of the garden in her head   189.69934473422518
is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express himself so favorably of me   192.08220166808735
now when evening came dantès put his plate on the ground near the door   185.5143716493917
we will grow old together and talk of our companions   156.49126546523908
what   176.9764930076779
nearly so   104.62974529982043
said the general shrugging his shoulders   81.70162122397085
you are examining the luxury i enjoy said the queen glancing sadly around her   119.24281573244365
franz congratulated albert who received his congratulations with the air of a man conscious that they are merited   104.39786827615791
besides we can be on our guard   152.1788747575684
but i know a great number of her most intimate friends   47.49351513457778
directly afterwards the distant sound of a heavy weight falling on the ground was heard but no one paid any attention to it   46.12109789912013
and he gazed half stupefied upon the three persons before him   49.96988930515701
she scarcely resisted   82.70762720930497
sir said broussel i am in bad health and can not give myself up a prisoner in this state   34.117396735744066
and he emptied his pockets on the table the contents consisting of a dozen gold pieces five or six five franc pieces and some smaller coin   23.827234340942354
i am come to fetch you monsieur d artagnan   28.773612712130273
alas   156.5236462619164
mistrust athos therefore who will not prosecute the affairs of any one even his own   74.83057558324214
i have plenty of time and it will be more correct   99.518675795767
if you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase project gutenberg associated with or appearing on the work you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1   111.36409759631337
1   86.27848320338653
if they find us here we are lost   215.5178257047866
ere long the door opened and the marechal entered followed by the coadjutor   139.6214341667246
said dantès   48.48981591063628
you appear as unhappy as i am the reverse   5.505713829747364
exclaimed porthos mutton again   149.96104883380156
the king looked at the cardinal as if to interrogate him   161.43332782604307
why i should say that we had too much trouble in taking him to let him off so easily   144.3683773140309
the two guards who had remained in the lane mounted to the aid of comminges   80.9862956416406
really   16.539396311101385
and my faith the governor of the province one of the gentlemen i expected today seemed to have such a wish for him that i gave him to him   97.6687947259729
albert retained his calm and indifferent manner   125.4805975778702
return at five o clock and i will tell you   165.98855138896704
all hope of flight was gone   33.24362134712335
is it possible you were so kind   281.83626405359365
d artagnan lifted up his head   199.2320481301719
but for some time the imperial police who at this period quite contrary to what napoleon desired so soon as he had a son born to him wished for a partition of provinces had their eyes on me   45.83121940603277
you told him that   173.09452982696163
at last however we succeeded and worked up to arles   65.04718149836089
athos though now cool and collected put his hand to his belt where his loaded pistols yet remained   109.17144329315224
faith i would give a good deal if she is young and pretty   54.77347060579007
to the rescue   100.65135520382537
ali has many faults mixed with most excellent qualities   133.9596635590139
i come to congratulate you   172.3026912351712
in the meantime d artagnan who had plunged into a bypath continued his route and reached st   74.21000167117182
then he dragged himself cautiously to the top of a rock from which he had a full view of the sea and thence he saw the tartan complete her preparations for sailing weigh anchor and balancing herself as gracefully as a water fowl ere it takes to the wing set sail   151.43320411483657
he is a hero sir   21.271189815879126
i have engaged the three lower windows at the café rospoli   122.1830261471236
to doubt any longer was impossible   132.60267724836862
d artagnan was not the man ever to cry for quarter   137.0878482236173
we are friends are we not   158.94912435435856
you must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of project gutenberg™ works   80.3052786474728
it was warm work   153.3569572574829
the comte de la fere himself   192.3863006881327
and we must trust to the vigilance of m   277.4052786286817
maximilian cast a look of disdain almost of anger on the count   204.6287485655989

maximilian emmanuel if we do but discover him he must believe in the gratitude of the heart   96.24794590925092
then you have thought that barrois was poisoned   180.25084737588958
no   102.39098713116519
go and call upon him in order that he may give evidence of your having been with him at half past nine   81.27401658438436
said debray advancing towards the back staircase   107.10663044654014
these two shots had mortally wounded my father and it was he who had given utterance to these frightful cries   93.84805953463912
anger made her eyes flash in the darkness   151.69422243766854
at the second turn the count stopped the carriage and requested permission to withdraw leaving the vehicle at their disposal   99.28236003755225
so it is   89.28520625210587
how   189.64358694177812
i hoped in silence   71.509756945678
exclaimed the man in the cloak suddenly expressing himself in french   141.62222959964376
four other noblemen awaited me   248.04350066833405
that it is nearly three years since i have seen him and that i never do see him unless i send for him   60.779359585684695
now m   200.14081167667638
do as i bade you cried the commissary and preserve absolute secrecy   90.99044553579813
ah   190.06103662339893
oh my god   73.8149848013141
gentlemen said he you have heard the comte de morcerf s defence   125.67803990902635
and a desire of vengeance disordered the features of milady which however immediately recovered the calm and benevolent expression which this woman of a hundred faces had for a moment allowed them to lose   32.676828746835156
monte cristo arose and approached her took her hand and said to her in romaic calm yourself my dear child and take courage in remembering that there is a god who will punish traitors   200.13959864146966
then he placed her in the boat and as he was going to set foot in it himself athos handed him a sum of silver   249.9578614593555
very well   126.54690668536468
he desired they should be returned to the queen   76.32932300766487
and it is very sad believe me to see thus two parties in france two heads to royalty   177.46272556010814
run to torlonia draw from him instantly four thousand piastres and give them to the bearer   148.93858098492984
i believe the queen to have too high a sense of her duty sire   137.57534967711098
you can not imagine mother how beautiful i think you   142.8788515568258
it was the date of that strange adventure interrupted madame de chevreuse   161.11467486509912
forgive my vanity and tell me which you prefer   105.8356522138183
then aramis paler than before but subdued by these words snapped the serpent blade between his hands and then folding his arms stood trembling with rage   94.66173813196181
meanwhile danglars stooping to monte cristo s ear your advice was excellent said he   175.5227705522102
let us leave to night we have nothing more to do here   92.8803190181395
so saying she once more climbed the staircase leading to her chamber her body convulsed with chills and her teeth rattling in her head in spite of the intense heat of the weather   182.31556396570696
could not contain himself and he made a step toward the queen s apartment with that pale and mute indignation which when it broke out led this prince to the commission of the most pitiless cruelty   138.64910058488016
the demands in that programme must be granted   124.78373447312381
it seemed as though rome under the magic breath of some demon of the night had suddenly changed into a vast tomb   255.41380857362333
milady however saw that this sort of narrative amused her very much and kept at it   104.69262663409603
he then related to his friends word for word all that had passed between him and his host and how the man who had abducted the wife of his worthy landlord was the same with whom he had had the difference at the hostelry of the jolly miller   251.2705956016161
how   150.3432553730057
what are you going to do   196.8810915669016
every niche in the wall held its living statue   147.6951580296918
chance is so capricious   246.03539355404428
on my part i will go out with my hands in my pockets that nothing may be suspected   10.413672771043636
so that i fear he will never return   217.48327027762883
and who was that   71.10899157540089
no with the baron   135.869775806146
when he was left stiff as a rush in london   139.0747084328385
you are right sir always right said anne of austria   163.22719372002058
then they pursue him and he has suddenly taken refuge in the islands at giglio giannutri or monte cristo   120.09383205304461
well   70.03289758945982
but arriving at four crossroads he stopped again visibly embarrassed   121.50527120164529
see this gentleman out said the count to bertuccio   172.26350589485241
she is indeed daring   26.860092962042742
pale and sweetly smiling she looked like an angel of mercy conjuring the angel of vengeance   143.566105715137
it would not be long before i should be training dogs to say that there were greater traitors in france than the cardinal mazarin   106.23572571785238
there he is   107.37919409066103
but lose no time   178.0225150681004
bertuccio sprang out and offered his shoulder to the count who this time leaned upon it as he descended the three steps of the carriage   167.028652191616
sirs accept my thanks for your politeness said the young man retreating   126.99214289750809
sire replied richelieu rest assured that particelli the man to whom your majesty refers has been hanged   130.58267764045934
meantime d artagnan who is full of invention would find some way to save the king   102.02530304562931
what our enemies say of us is then true   138.74681591766227
anne hesitated   12.968299955175567
tell your good superior that in order that we may be as much together as possible you ask her permission to share my repast   123.0834413534712
d artagnan bowed and thought both at the same hour   50.32812971637199
you were deceived sir   120.63667762418217
besides they have erected a triumphal arch for me to enter my barony which will kill my neighbors with envy   145.42099511427824
my lord i have in my parish a man who might be of the greatest use to you   110.09290994826532
yes said athos that s grimaud s business   53.21935319068342
we will see gentlemen we will see   172.47117454223195
and for a captain s commission i would not write it   90.91156873731649
oh my king   71.79306156062842
felton snatched away the knife   77.36107606794639
bazin my friend come here   152.34118589934513
villefort burst it open with a violent blow   148.01910249554197
everybody is ignorant that you are the bearer of a letter from the island of elba and addressed to m   58.21783600647644
no   46.929572394797276
with the view of assassinating or causing to be assassinated the duke of buckingham   169.3781725625518
the palace of justice would not be burned down for everybody monseigneur   172.06139426252918
you do not know what felicity from heaven what joys from paradise are comprised in a moment like that   101.42810125683977
my dear lad that was yesterday when i was telling you silly stories it was proper to tell me that and not this morning   37.331808396687194
oh madame   72.83142416012043
de tréville hastened to report himself at the louvre   69.29233379420268
he will feel obliged to make some little speech to the cousin and the three young men drew near to listen   132.00382565733065
oh your excellency   173.0120639065475
well   18.680952372987548
oh not the least in the world madame   109.06872799621615
and driving the coadjutor s carriage   100.80291566018354
in short he had reached that supreme moment when the bravest feel a shudder in their veins when suddenly in the direction of the rue de l arbre sec the crowd opened crying long live the coadjutor   24.00567389624777
according to the desire of your eminence i report to the convent of the carmelites at béthune where i will await your orders   110.48895668940216
carriages horses guards and perhaps even the prisoner were about to be torn to shreds when all at once a voice well known to raoul was heard and suddenly a great sword glittered in the air   130.71227085129743
no replied d artagnan   114.1459478831565
at all events if you want me remember the rue tiquetonne hotel de la chevrette   41.55128601008373
i told you one evening in the garden after madame de saint méran s death because his system is accustomed to that very poison and the dose was trifling to him which would be fatal to another   221.24625717621467
most assuredly   71.8083256002094
if you are in haste monsieur said d artagnan with the same simplicity with which a moment before he had proposed to him to put off the duel for three days and if it be your will to dispatch me at once do not inconvenience yourself i pray you   0.49125716598041436
andrea cavalcanti a murderer a galley slave escaped a convict   72.65738152867112
i waited a month or rather i suffered for a month   64.05018508314652
asked porthos   116.78320711704659
asked the count   151.40586829328984
said mordaunt   92.6909142337152
and how is your wrist   115.23303027066602
i did   191.57448889168978

the infernal invention would serve him for this purpose   28.8023099873256
i believe he is a lutheran   108.14333215840682
the new sentinel commenced his walk in the corridor   181.4349800756665

the abbess suspects nothing and believes that i am taken by order of the cardinal   141.31288278133076
ah   173.99198794262801
only 700 000 francs out of my cash box nothing more   121.62493168039504
the lion bit the hand thus favored and at the end of twenty four hours the bite was mortal   204.09298129066872
let me add that i would not for the four thousand piastres at which i had fixed your friend s ransom that this had happened   208.5576580048181

well will you take me or shall i take edward   11.698285715639727
rich   72.84683075604275
at the end of three months he had learned to write   156.13308743904827
why did he kill himself instead of you   83.01265989161884
i swear that i would give the last drop of my blood and the last fragment of my limbs to preserve the friendship of such a friend as you athos of such a man as you aramis   204.7782535836983
see   83.31887818549941
on the morning of the departure from the forest of frosinone he had followed carlini in the darkness and heard this oath of vengeance and like a wise man anticipated it   154.82343270277153
still   259.05437175887766
he cried   136.7545246195527
on entering the room noirtier s eyes met those of the abbé and no doubt he read some particular expression in them for he remained in the room   91.5518085853333
monsieur said emmanuel have the goodness to address yourself to m   63.310275964931
ah   119.36408966661334
you would be the happier for it at home sire and i do not doubt you would be the greater for it abroad   2.2548020932907775
he remained motionless but gnashing his teeth and wringing his hands with fury   133.43827700340208
a long silence followed   93.6187350943604
that he had never spoken to the one or the other   45.70434044181964
said the baroness irritated at the impassibility of her husband   105.06415328697403
yes   271.00522465760287
this was all the furniture   93.11398124127453
we have served them to the best of our poor means and god will recompense the will forgive the want of power   68.16353457096574
well said milady if you keep your word instead of five hundred i will give you a thousand pistoles   35.280164812478546
de boville the inspector of prisons to whom they are due   129.18855162957735
no my lord replied the impassive young man   142.51255428421135
whispered he   112.05291089392216
order of the king he said   240.55532124614626
and what is your excellency s project   71.24950238730955
in the first place let us agree that the word poison does not exist because in medicine use is made of the most violent poisons which become according as they are employed most salutary remedies   120.51067068639267
teresa had become alarmed at the wild and deserted look of the plain around her and pressed closely against her guide not uttering a syllable   179.3408559978157
ah here is m   60.43487446349959
those born to wealth and who have the means of gratifying every wish said emmanuel know not what is the real happiness of life just as those who have been tossed on the stormy waters of the ocean on a few frail planks can alone realize the blessings of fair weather   22.63954043673168
nay it must have been a promise   37.10560915527387
said villefort   48.15941870949821
that happens every day   154.5320897925681
that would be a schoolgirl s reason which i consider quite beneath me   211.8112875188805
the abbé smiled   170.8249843883923
and now why are you here   185.71232204139704
you will have the horses fully equipped monsieur   119.55198613377705
but in losing you i lose my life   84.99597847268302
so it was with monsieur d artagnan this stranger meant to quarrel   155.92598512353916
as grimaud entered he saw this comb on the tea table   37.1652170146352
left alone d artagnan read and reread his billet   191.67348905891578
the breaking of his jug was too natural an accident to excite suspicion   102.80867915547341
two drops more would kill you replied the abbé   11.4931814545307
m   149.11089106639395
the death of buckingham was written there at full length   220.86229121274198
the three last returned he with a negligence evidently unaffected for he could not imagine with what intention the question was put   91.243642856616
but i am not surprised   90.25938864672659
my dear friend said d artagnan if you annoy us in this manner we will all four go and shut ourselves up in your cellar and we will see if the mischief is as great as you say   178.73276808051332
i am dead drunk that s all and never did a man more strongly set about getting so   58.66247660953783
well he has taken nothing yet   208.8562550941641
de tréville   139.7986712598181
at this name no doubt the young man reflected a little for he went towards his groom saying this man is right   32.0964397792923
but after he had gone about two hundred steps d artagnan stopped short alighted threw the bridle of his horse over the arm of planchet and took the pistols from his saddle bow to fasten them to his girdle   64.70564169779132
but had its owner asked half a million it would unhesitatingly have been given   163.90329188684495
or at least i guess   114.90578106137592
as the door closed after them kitty rushed toward it   63.05863841687434
danglars rushed out of the room and made but one leap into his coupé   59.724392541972065
after a momentary examination during which the queen became as white as the cloth which covered the altar on which she was leaning he put it back into the coffer with an involuntary shudder   87.73569593077379
but it is the wretched that man can not injure me haydée said monte cristo   205.14346271704454
why how fast you go on father dantès   288.0738331725303
de boville the inspector of prisons no   134.64898513436427
i   77.21448596047796
that is to say highway robbers   120.56568267596995
no   104.12882086448091
what would you have   76.03470723386472
if on my return justice has not been satisfied i will denounce you with my own mouth and arrest you with my own hands   184.3176699804659
my fortune though small is free and unfettered and the memory of my late father is respected in our country valentine as that of the most upright and honorable merchant of the city   137.05378952979314
money   115.73343308358098
the general remembered that i had formerly been a naval officer and he gave me the command of this expedition   209.2239880141262
you must not weep no you must not groan you must tremble   53.069930080151025
inquired athos   168.60773448034143
murmured the cardinal   61.492689168859634
he expected you will remember to be here on the fifth   176.529078900934
in sardinian   145.60033759140742
i only suppose so   138.947895092997
chance   112.80780014158923
he must be called upon and so ascertain if the thing be true or not   99.22985261765595
cried bertuccio   191.31080279485695
well then i should say for instance resumed danglars that if after a voyage such as dantès has just made in which he touched at the island of elba someone were to denounce him to the king s procureur as a bonapartist agent i will denounce him   156.82750327062507
and that one thing your lost child   137.73147308578868
it was that of a number of men steadily approaching   145.96940351430777
and every day the cardinal under some pretext deferred fixing it   162.43682398978854
milady sprang out of bed and opened the window   101.93483286228178
you must have discovered a mine or else become a stockbroker   119.09434392706692
how old   132.3766940159966
your intended son in law is named m   97.24728782292699
are we going to continue this pace all night   141.5103254515293
i hastened to you continued beauchamp to tell you albert that in this changing age the faults of a father can not revert upon his children   194.63672226311212
i pray for it said d artagnan   98.45081590113323
and i even i opposed the designs of the great man who held the destinies of france within the hollow of his hand   13.090371977073588
inquired a turnkey   117.25284920411549
undeceive yourself monsieur replied monte cristo   116.49121213971793
gentlemen said d artagnan what porthos says is full of sense   135.29876837222585
said athos   123.75987422787249
franz felt it would be ridiculous not to follow his two companions example   163.7162056368156
upon the eighth day he discerned a small vessel under full sail approaching monte cristo   18.963834313030603
to own the truth i should be inconsolable if you were to leave vincennes   29.526592705107532
once across the barriers these two knew neither fatigue nor fear   169.66154162838689
in a very simple manner colonel said d artagnan   70.69674413401474
for stealing   66.46265577959146
dantès obeyed and commenced what he called his history but which consisted only of the account of a voyage to india and two or three voyages to the levant until he arrived at the recital of his last cruise with the death of captain leclere and the receipt of a packet to be delivered by himself to the grand marshal   110.28779303303949
ah said buckingham god be praised   133.32505978466477
maximilian   225.1761732139557
mine was to guard you and i am doing so   117.19449052614281
de tréville which proved to be in the rue du vieux colombier   88.19131409385426
ah true said the englishman with a sigh   37.31714786229129
at length his eyes opened but they were at first fixed and expressionless   11.332192466669994
he followed him   106.11440856890965
he should be reverenced as the author of our being and as a master whom we ought to obey   153.34277811120793
i mistook him for a monk and revealed it to him in confession   121.40374258383729
conversational   73.33642621230082
as to the rest in eight days you will be where you ought to be and my task will be completed   176.68192821434417
what refreshment can i offer   130.44441838613503
but sir answered the steward do you know that these horses belong to monsieur de montbazon   140.0696119741715
you asked for candor and you have it   7.27422507585861
gentlemen return your swords to their scabbards   182.3287713350747
monsieur de chavigny be so good as to lend me your cane   132.41803531650393
i will fulfil all your wishes my dear mother said the young man   216.11632233193797
the wind blew strongly the boat made six or seven knots an hour and they were rapidly reaching the end of their voyage   156.42023788077603
m   32.315870868814145
and then dantès countenance became gloomy for the oath of vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory and he reflected how much ill in these times a man with thirteen or fourteen millions could do to his enemies   128.05995921635432
noirtier looked at her with a glance of the most profound scrutiny   103.80448074336174
no your holiness i take you for what you are that is to say the coadjutor   64.9532390946604
and you porthos   63.40482324994887
of course they will do so as honorable gentlemen and the best proof i can furnish is this so saying he threw his hat on the ground pushed back his chair to the wall and bowed to mordaunt with true french grace   96.92724563848728
try therefore either to carry me to some place where i may see a priest or take the trouble to send one to me here   182.6829998857782
chapter 63   141.12543737930199
cried the dying man with all the effusiveness of a grief declared after long suppression ah   148.26905538741784
d épinay if he is an honorable man will consider himself more than ever pledged to mademoiselle de villefort unless he were actuated by a decided feeling of avarice but that is impossible   144.39607998601747
i recognize this hobbema   81.64062884895417
felton gently repulsed milady and she sank into a chair   23.53040903076426
but not being able to stifle her she smiled upon her   85.08638355447748
inquired the priest   168.38544025327695
good evening sir answered the soldier in a strong provincial accent   179.4947671445488
simply the fact that the idea never occurred to me answered dantès   177.61368346104396
i have only to say after the little that i have seen and heard that i think even better of you than i have been told   69.23483475434654
bonacieux opened her eyes under the kisses of d artagnan   264.7167694731069
yes said they all with one accord   113.52706262073644
for my own part i am quite sure i shall not be able to close my eyes   146.43623714444007
at five in the evening they sent mousqueton on before as agreed upon   129.99566228655985
but as regards the letter of advice i am charmed to find that it has reached you   63.03279826356138
let him bear his share of the loss and we will go on as before   178.24890511915473
the guests stopped formed quadrilles and danced in any part of the grounds they pleased   91.1344752127864
where   103.73386058962322
said d artagnan   180.95932591694782
true said m   157.1797675689616
he mentally ejaculated   48.59510282158112
he opened the conversation about rain and fine weather   99.18159418444809
whenever monseigneur wishes i am always at at his eminence s orders   117.99878018745477
your stairs are so polished it is like walking on glass   81.54218440267522
there are loaded pistols in your holsters   184.08094944764542
in that case go and get ready   100.65582265570782
m   187.27283177906278
the fowl was tender the wine old the fire clear and sparkling and andrea was surprised to find himself eating with as good an appetite as though nothing had happened   126.474516310542
he could not refrain from a smile of visible satisfaction   140.23553914597318
the island of monte cristo loomed large in the horizon   112.94390601880662
what to do   204.828014951316
yes said he   108.11522041153205
maximilian crossed the canal and entered the rue meslay by the boulevards   179.5284371317133
so sick that he is dying and he wants to confess to the coadjutor who they say has power to remit great sins   135.00083826602238
it was not a want of courage which rendered her poverty burdensome   106.35117533424521
i know him   54.86738192039178
finally at lilliers i lost all trace of her   182.6895705687983
above the room in which debray had been dividing two millions and a half with madame danglars was another inhabited by persons who have played too prominent a part in the incidents we have related for their appearance not to create some interest   35.052936733118116
nothing at least personally said monte cristo   65.81312814837463
i acknowledge it affected me and indeed all the committee also said beauchamp   128.59432196913076
i asked you continued villefort in a perfectly calm tone where you conceal the poison by the aid of which you have killed my father in law m   98.987101169871
you got in very well   44.00628334660047
in fact at one of the doors which opened into the queen s apartment appeared the pretty mme   190.1891685557652
i have found a better remedy for my grief than either a bullet or a knife   84.08309883865239
and then my good fellow use your daggers in any way you please and i further promise you to be there as a spectator of your prowess   233.69590395441892
we may like bouillotte delight in whist be enraptured with boston and yet grow tired of them all   112.9087450076034
then after seeing her eyes closed and hearing her breathe gently he believed she had dropped asleep and left the apartment on tiptoe closing the door after him with the utmost precaution   220.1240240952394
moreover she saw that eugénie detested debray not only because he was a source of dissension and scandal under the paternal roof but because she had at once classed him in that catalogue of bipeds whom plato endeavors to withdraw from the appellation of men and whom diogenes designated as animals upon two legs without feathers   169.45569759687922
here is what i am looking for thought d artagnan   98.23488691180532
hastily raising myself on one arm i looked around but all was dark   68.89067988037478
no m   195.0369573952206
athos and aramis were beginning to close their eyes which they half opened when their companion came in again   98.84742269044116
well i left them on my road porthos at chantilly with a duel on his hands   9.18422342330608
40156m the abbé busoni   68.6934161755198
cromwell is mighty mazarin is tricky but i would rather have to do with them than with the late monsieur mordaunt   165.87471887199257
i have told you twenty times that if you wish to die on that day i will assist you   117.68956100110618
the carriage was taking the direct road to it   168.18667298915
at the noise i raised myself up on one hand   143.75846493067792
do you know him   93.1460234638437
pooh   154.42443621622758
i thought there were four of you   163.06553845796856
he said   79.215720671181
cried d artagnan   78.94301127036098
now this point was settled   150.40086831966096
cried he to d artagnan do not kill him young man i beg of you   206.0011370575234
the deputy procureur du roi chapter 7   134.05953070743107
i will make him speak   89.51584857024936
comminges wounded by a stone which had struck him on the forehead had left a picket in the street and returned to the palais royal followed by a menacing crowd to tell his story   59.15463337172347
no said athos it is not raoul about whom i am anxious for i trust he will conduct himself like a gentleman   200.57383741169286
pardon me sir replied the valet   141.26182160035953
milady s secret d artagnan left the hôtel instead of going up at once to kitty s chamber as she endeavored to persuade him to do and that for two reasons the first because by this means he should escape reproaches recriminations and prayers   144.6281634464733
in vain did he court the refreshment of sleep   121.57877442266074
yes sire   46.04453703019702
here i am back again and we are going to be happy   106.13641414363329
speak   157.10165377969187
the count of monte cristo   22.2340980267155
don t you see them   120.70596189826837
at this moment the whole regiment came up and they fell upon the few men who had held out surrounding the two frenchmen   280.36504128429607
e   152.3594265555525
m   152.23894557800347
morrel held out his hand to her   133.42104451793128
but what are you going to fight about athos   132.82654775789516
we have forgotten to mention that the count s coachman was attired in a bear skin exactly resembling odry s in the bear and the pasha   18.88032923224317
something which will surprise you   129.58137289972802
at which hour he rose in order to repair to the residence of m   157.29002754996728
now d herblay said athos dismount and come here   164.94336275341013
you come from the queen   250.67401883735613
at length one evening as the jailer was visiting him for the last time that night dantès with his ear for the hundredth time at the wall fancied he heard an almost imperceptible movement among the stones   171.45196598858553
very well   111.272715529269
so that since i have been in prison a very slight effort of memory has enabled me to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open before me   133.20183655225597
beauchamp looked at albert with the smile which was so peculiar to him and which in its numerous modifications served to express every varied emotion of his mind   119.97342969250369
provided charles is dead it is the axe not the man we must thank   73.16126807625602
you see your friends are wakeful   142.9030569275609
yes my lord   17.753240000740476
what have you done to him then   168.33402278818073
milady was only a queen while among queens   170.5440523190436
continue continue   81.21839001637998
faugh   268.07671004177485
we still remain four friends devoted to each other   168.04812697248394
he must be apprehended   174.74893244099968
he took it up and as he took it he made a low bow   227.05372014266658
for tell me where can you find a love like mine a love which neither time nor absence nor despair can extinguish a love which contents itself with a lost ribbon a stray look or a chance word   138.32010569031715
he was now as we have said three and thirty years of age and his fourteen years imprisonment had produced a great transformation in his appearance   67.47719508549946
the king followed by the three friends turned his steps that way   97.04473644891169
villequier said guitant   127.92487059011282
man s whole life passes in doing these things and his intellect is exhausted by reflecting on them   179.49646903123693
took an active part in the return from elba   170.38783435242692
is he here in paris   97.22964268498407
and now i think of it by heavens he may have sent the letter itself   119.11904846017471
raoul didn t wait to be told twice   103.88821569616853
oh   141.7118242503475
the young man pressed his lips on the same spot on the old man s forehead where valentine s had been   142.21076051074215
but i then replied probably monsieur de chavigny is afraid your pastry is not good   106.62550645727106
only listen to that charming finale   148.05006301215954
repeated morrel as if awakening from a dream   126.03230902019529
i have a despatch from the prince to his eminence   88.86174219837318
and on the contrary i think i have not proved myself worthy of your goodness   116.40495493693443
oh heaven   200.25021130558756
where are you running to   67.13092884259423
inquired the guest as caderousse placed before him the bottle of wine and a glass   133.7880007476238
i like that   118.76798544210546
it was never without a nervous shudder since the dinner at auteuil and the events which followed it that madame danglars heard monte cristo s name announced   87.3712868518689
asked the king   170.21153456681762
i too am going   91.11536526909082
athos fixed upon a certain cahusac a favorite of the cardinal s   135.97986823520364
on one s death bed the crimes of others appear very small in comparison with one s own said the executioner   174.3299997408625
alas   110.51691379998107
12 rue des fossoyeurs   174.80009783032327
yes so long as he pays me you ll honor and believe him that s right   81.55808127830892
with a mighty leap he rose to the surface of the sea while the shot dragged down to the depths the sack that had so nearly become his shroud   175.63442829325453
said the cardinal beginning to feel more comfortable   181.79210304749319
uneasiness now yielded to the most extreme dread on the part of those present   46.674852751659216
the turnkey obeyed and the inspector gazed curiously into the chamber of the mad abbé as the prisoner was usually called   165.9768372135564
and edward who heard this great personage talked of for two whole days made all possible haste to come to him not from obedience to his mother or out of any feeling of gratitude to the count but from sheer curiosity and that some chance remark might give him the opportunity for making one of the impertinent speeches which made his mother say oh that naughty child   90.57704080268944
now you must permit me to take my leave of you   109.7136735203596
from whom then   138.45495305569045
they announced to all their comrades that they had seen the king and that the queen had spoken to them   146.63905001865552
20099m ah yes   28.794873515523634
it was evident that he had not slept   174.04368049476457
in five minutes they gained the land   160.54201415740874
ah my poor d artagnan   150.06011942332773
nevertheless you must not exaggerate the evil said monte cristo for by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into another   133.29406466424996
on reaching the palace d artagnan sent to his eminence the letter in which he had been ordered to return without delay   263.7413001640985
m   144.39434531352626
an apartment as we have said had been retained beforehand and thus he had but to go to signor pastrini s hotel   3.6761908209801533
yes said danglars but i confess i didn t quite comprehend its meaning   106.60636992658252
will you return to the salon   92.25373984141685
without reckoning said athos that if he had not rescued me from the hands of cahusac i should not now have the honor of making my very humble reverence to your majesty   80.1007346279201
there now   107.33789845168802
d artagnan went out first as had been agreed upon   98.33039278576953
and olivain and the host took their way together toward the inn olivain according to the custom of serving men well pleased with their place relating to the tavern keeper all that he could say in favor of the young gentleman   50.21028892785948
you are rich then   74.36011490478643
if i once went up those stairs   107.36065817061696
do these things concern me   151.7383553829679
good god   174.56027062855807
you will hear again from me   69.35970227058742
the baron adored count andrea cavalcanti   148.78312233326227
my dear fellow said athos i ride horses when i have any   139.7372596747013
on guard   107.70547521945056
well gentlemen resumed mordaunt we must set out without delay to day is the last day granted me by the cardinal   59.5490491216591
they set out   9.197424289904049
cowardly fool   73.23718619237604
and his eyes turned from the box containing the greek girl and her strange companion to watch the business of the stage   72.12301072978846
ah ah   178.83386813644734
has the executioner left london   67.77360127329271
debray because i have no friends now and i ought not to have any   226.0914388648516
they sailed   190.162782835107
his eyes rested on the weapons and he pointed to them   168.5382100774965
i kept in the background as you wished and waited not for the decision of your heart or my own but hoping that providence would graciously interpose in our behalf and order events in our favor   88.87228446734301
come athos and aramis go to the right   215.14080565236537
he uses my property without accounting for the use he makes of it   94.21954094336853
there is nothing compromising in the name of a town   127.34871458583969
because i feel that if you were only to touch me with the tip of your finger the fit would return   121.14175823512498
honoré in order to purchase some rouge for madame de chevreuse   178.9974054786154
aramis   136.0803820533259
said bonacieux you are a jocular companion   110.83832237584028
ah my child my poor child   114.27355395120254
he had fired them himself and had killed two men   42.226812969265126
at the foot of the hill the count dismounted and began to ascend by a little winding path about eighteen inches wide   116.52220832841579
i arrived three hours after her at boulogne   126.09788930173455
i know him for a norman and normans are obstinate   95.80909332815438
but you may use it replied lord wilmore   15.75343687982074
and we shall answer   38.919509799749406
chapter 91   59.62697907905159
tell me on which point you desire information and i will tell all i know   76.45354387126136
it was a long time before i was able to make out what place i was in or to take account of the details i describe   96.1643550891014
comminges villequier and guitant were behind her and the women again were behind the men   147.2093849911299
i have sold even to my last diamond to aid him   101.52554717597162
really monsieur you say strange things said aramis   87.21459225813896
gentlemen said albert germain informs me that breakfast is ready   0.27701733336270706
i repeat it d artagnan you are the best one among us   155.3441805796955
yes fair lady   156.82518706756983
undeniably my friend   178.62116603378684
grimaud showed his master his forefinger bent   76.53486137660991
in two bounds he was at the louvre   130.8865800571534
four and the two bandits make six   59.36535268563741
porthos in order to make a greater display had that evening borrowed planchet   35.192851629396856
we can watch the skipper   146.79261580055896
they are soliciting the hat for him   128.901513452597
i do   105.06514662609867
you only speak thus because you are overheard coolly replied milady   59.63510816685733
keep your secret young man and tell me what you wish   192.49760622689806
this door was a mockery to the concierge from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it was free and like that famous portal in the arabian nights opening at the sesame of ali baba it was wont to swing backward at a cabalistic word or a concerted tap from without from the sweetest voices or whitest fingers in the world   67.14827373995502
it appears that in falling continued athos with some hesitation he broke his thigh   65.67912625558576
i carried it in my hand   139.85975885431097
his confidential valet appeared   64.49225012332758
he entered portsmouth about eight o clock in the morning   122.78839587504127
i will go and try if there are any means of speaking to him   76.57359678687303
grimaud thereupon presented himself with his smooth exterior at the donjon of vincennes   87.91605368557444
bonacieux kissed his wife s hand and set off at a quick pace   90.1377898955744
yes you said the count at the same time advancing towards andrea and slipping a packet of bank notes into the young man s hand   138.4041032878702
how ought she really to be supremely loved   126.36426023411019
how dreadful   81.15216189632315
1 through 1   58.852788927053574
trembling and awe struck caderousse hastily shut the door and returned to his guest while la carconte lighted a candle by the smouldering ashes that glimmered on the hearth   165.814855633917
well   110.90400119541486
he s heavy though for an old and thin man said one as he raised the head   92.40238516651853
how do you think these garments fit me   60.21158563981124
thirty five or thirty six mother   180.30181513062354
if so you can spare yourself the trouble   98.18467512759544
said athos   75.9112410101227
come my dear albert said debray confess that your cook is behindhand that the oysters have not arrived from ostend or marennes and that like madame de maintenon you are going to replace the dish by a story   88.17679105835711
long live the coadjutor   38.72658691715826
but who told you i was inactive   159.72822074603528
you told me my dear valentine that you were engaged to m   116.02414545974881
if grimaud was slow in speaking we know that he was quick to act   124.1712462520371
but death checked his thought which remained engraved on his brow like a last kiss of love   99.5994087250956
truly sir you overwhelm me with benefits   69.63637681833188
and m   111.32359447633712
help   100.85473867847517
the island was utterly deserted and bore no evidence of having been visited since he went away   106.73445254376085
the procurator s wife uttered a groan   116.9756140485441
oh   54.485990265451264
asked his lordship   82.09136846545624
that is true sire   139.68215801699785
and he mounted on the bench to try and get a sight of her   71.47052062751428
it is useless for you to say so count   123.02270626110305
aha   49.55284508422855
i hoped that the active and laborious life of a smuggler with the severe discipline on board would have a salutary effect on his character which was now well nigh if not quite corrupt   67.53957264027449
but besides these eight men you doubtless place some guard outside   157.83493889579614
two months passed away in hopeless expectation on my part while i must do the magistrate the justice to say that he used every means to obtain information of the person i declared could exculpate me if he would   150.0214977758141
but you have by the step you have taken called my attention to the paragraph in question and it will remain until it shall be either contradicted or confirmed by someone who has a right to do so   122.9522326623167
such a beautiful woman   125.8806944733087
when i bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded he told me there would not be time as it would require three days to do that   137.16498910448718
indeed i do said athos   129.05854005440762
asked the coadjutor   17.999005624407445
yes and give them a chance of escaping said d artagnan   106.8936651815731
let me die   160.45537620530808
true   147.18537084397443
i should like another sort of oath better said d artagnan to himself   140.7371543859995
particularly when there is money in the house eh   102.01459177998909
athos went down and returned immediately   109.45937027048569
they are prevented at this moment but will join us later   103.13706367137836
everybody pities you sir   97.1315440091362
40168m no   196.99356506658665
d artagnan   60.70630474427066
in some parts of france yes excellency   23.31090617001466
why do you not seek revenge   139.40807071607784
he is a soldier and obeys all constitutional authority   123.91471725680594
he begs you to believe that at a gesture of your majesty everything will be possible to him   152.62584123148054
but at the same time dantès could not believe that the deposit supposing it had ever existed still existed   112.95005797423353
speak out there s a worthy fellow   118.71989635106057
yes and no   170.21919669488594
both the great king and the great poet ought to have known woman s nature well   24.07207900947833
his first remark on entering was you know sir i do not speak french   166.57824494991598
your step mother and her son pass before his door it is that his nubian may save them from destruction   136.6179465131348
cried the queen on perceiving the two friends you have come faithful friends   210.89094789056185
but how is it that we are incurring greater risks than athos and aramis   38.6496130195969
but putting his head out of the carriage eh   153.79707121821704
m   208.86295058161704
it was the cannon which announced the closing of the port   107.03965261210239
the messenger obeyed without the least hesitation but rather with alacrity and mounting the steps at a bound entered the hotel   108.06703272118196
and i am yours body and soul   95.30039496077427
did you ever suffer from a strain athos   265.21648009025034
i am only annoyed about a bankrupt of trieste   146.87969877216642
how many days would it require to make two studs exactly like them   32.30059927067444
illness of body would not affect the validity of the deed but sanity of mind is absolutely requisite   227.1173633001278
but while they were watching the departure of the count morrel had quitted his post and château renaud failing in his search joined debray and beauchamp   264.1167751408091
the fool   97.96521030394268
no for it would be useless   50.85940773924226
what   130.90426468963713
thus then it is your opinion said anne of austria with a sneer and biting her lips with rage that yesterday s riot which to day is already a rebellion to morrow may become a revolution   188.01514145792027
what do you say   190.09067710200642
arrived here only yesterday morning and married today at three o clock   102.94473001443525
hold if that should happen although i am a christian m   175.37642691446885
but only relate the fact that he shuddered and stepped back suddenly   232.65059982635074
do you know said franz i have a very great inclination to judge for myself of the truth or exaggeration of your eulogies   89.8354361162356
as to franz a strange transformation had taken place in him   152.1095613104899
and towards whom do you bear this personal ill feeling then   36.45445637930172
but by degrees carlini s features relaxed his hand which had grasped one of the pistols in his belt fell to his side   116.81929883981847
although our friends were expecting that condemnation it filled them with grief   134.5275886195331
the album said edward sulkily   126.74742057143236
of what use would it be   160.81270806101583
you are to marry the daughter of danglars   253.0293607952965
but a recompense was in store for him   109.96963802698393
well well   103.57870074012673
very good   63.2065325900987
beaten   118.45515784652609
asked milady   44.28363709553686
ah s blood how you have hurt me   161.32590993996044
asked monte cristo   212.5654623681068
he will explain to you the steps that i expect you to pursue   147.1905712845939
but on arriving on the quai they were obliged to stop   85.00158298347071
it is hoped that no ties of friendship or humane consideration will induce you to conceal the truth   159.2809445502482
now in the army from the division generals who desire the death of the general in chief to the soldiers who desire the death of the corporals all desire some one s death   169.16945048335864
as franz spoke he heard the sound of a door turning on its hinges and almost immediately afterwards the tapestry was drawn aside and the owner of all these riches stood before the two young men   118.34119070828821
the queen shook her head   71.09055006465451
do not fancy that i do you a favor   111.82828047440152
here is a letter i have just received on the subject   55.42732934620052
asked athos   41.604460459287594
and his name   90.98662135748008
monte cristo was at home   156.3231925359115
a silk waistcoat covered with embroidery   139.93030335574753
edmond stiffened himself in order to play the part of a dead man and then the party lighted by the man with the torch who went first ascended the stairs   168.44788521429103
the colonel neither had nor could have any suspicion   193.69716028632158
they all bowed and retired by degrees as noiselessly as they had entered   249.00946291354256
well then said groslow bring them with you   121.56449414371824
let us then hope for the best   133.54300956068275
when he again joined the two persons who had been discussing the matter it had been decided that they should touch at monte cristo and set out on the following night   92.5433028901243
no you will not for he will tell you what is very true that perhaps there were fifty officers in the greek army bearing the same name   101.44412621796641
comminges began to laugh   121.72847905236706
the morning air has made me hungry   117.53702187174
since i have this i will keep it   186.08888466270878
the falsehood would then lie at my door and as i am not a gentleman i may be allowed to lie   60.79238089658793
now monsieur de chavigny piqued himself on his infallible penetration   191.31513732276295

the swiss were drawn up along the road but as the road was long they were placed at six or eight feet distant from each other and one deep only   150.0248590968042
i   147.06091386313628
1   118.08493576016859
milady felt that she stood in need of all her strength   76.06027851629835
like athos he had noted the spot where the horses had halted   104.05002556029818
thereupon aramis had given him a clasp of the hand and had disappeared under the arcades   112.03828764204253
what would you have   159.87794228573992
how hot you look my good barrois said valentine   186.61242009112482
what has become of him   62.7333390854203
all at once he uttered a terrible cry   32.72475510539114
but this was not so easy a matter for the streets were thronged with people and rome was already a prey to that low and feverish murmur which precedes all great events   35.144647390188325
that was the title   57.84288526592914
we are looking for the house of monsieur de la fere said d artagnan   24.55076402453487
if he was the friend of d artagnan he was the enemy of the cardinal   31.41776665979951
i suspect said he a tall dark man of lofty carriage who has the air of a great lord   167.71961859953288
25   114.96893050634066
call an officer of justice he said   133.71475246084896
besides the casket is the more precious from being all that is left to me   37.80580689548162
said d artagnan comprehending the slight frown of the musketeer   161.02093217318583
it has so chanced that i met with a spaniard in my peregrinations who had seen many countries and among them the new world   99.80328072614431
and in exchange for the sacrifice that you make gentlemen i promise not to reward you i believe that word would offend you but to love you as a sister to prefer you next to my husband and my children to every one   119.85314401503881
probably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire to make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the day   172.1003512333994
besides i was so seriously indisposed that i could not in any case have replied to them   96.22710129520588
and with these words monte cristo took from his pocket a small case containing his visiting cards and drew forth two orders on the treasury for 500 000 francs each payable at sight to the bearer   50.04031488473527
as to that cried d artagnan after a moment of reflection i shall surmount it be assured   211.31607718333655
tell him to come in said mazarin arranging his pillows so that he might receive the visitor sitting up in bed   137.44383291147915
not worth speaking of   117.43631768318325
now another object not less terrible suddenly presented itself   54.26910940711838
no i had no such idea   157.66816384495587
cried porthos are we all going away then   199.437961668335
except the knowledge of blazons that enables me to decipher them i am very ignorant of heraldry i a count of a fresh creation fabricated in tuscany by the aid of a commandery of st   203.96236782232432
friend he said you have been too good in pardoning me   128.95273843704013
well here it is at last   159.56833749182312
it was for this reason as he said to those around him that he had put on his cloak   198.20212431627237
but which i must impart to you monsieur for you alone can assist me in the mission i have just received from her majesty   92.58464745365131
if you do me sir such honor i shall be grateful all my life   118.87868540575221
speak to him yourself for ever since you were deputed by me to arrest the duc de beaufort this officer and i have been on bad terms   126.09391882399372
the prince bowed low   69.15642695648242
oh we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin is a glorious monument   79.36470778594628
alas   97.16260154349864
i am come to talk to you about a thousand things   177.24625038223667
oh   99.08818245666527
certainly not   137.4554930654696
hide thy diamonds bury thy gold shroud thy splendor exchange riches for poverty liberty for a prison a living body for a corpse   38.63053026891765
and hence said villefort arose my affection for your father my dear m   103.02473780813403
well said beauchamp let them now say that drama is unnatural   118.29493988668908
but in spite of that and of his being king s attorney he is a man like ourselves and i fancy not a bad sort of one   129.50494188481773
the whole army talked of this expedition for a day and monsieur paid him his compliments upon it   122.15842134960815
i am dying with curiosity and uneasiness   72.50531708584501
dantès instantly turned to meet him   83.3069466205406
well   139.4446038039846
the peach like the grapes fell to the ground   150.4049162902947
by confessing all he might prove his good will   128.38373154016045
no said albert   166.31384316546905
he saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law and perfectly well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate decked with his official scarf as to address a petition to some cold marble effigy   169.31988174748486
after a moment s silence the lady inquired do you know my dear count she said that you are a very terrible reasoner and that you look at the world through a somewhat distempered medium   76.35582005728004
asked valentine   138.00374123793858
all the four are at your service   148.3160976477547
come now that we are alone said athos let us talk of yourself   142.44326723896765
he went there to have his beard and hair cut   76.30279596928975
i understand now why they murdered him   174.35381470963944
kitty who was to set out that evening for tours was waiting in the next chamber   22.497431844716544
never replied the count who was by this time perfectly master of himself again   89.5933984286689
said the notary   121.86331191873855
the article was not inserted by me i was not even aware of it   102.23258884196943
the following day dantès presented jacopo with an entirely new vessel accompanying the gift by a donation of one hundred piastres that he might provide himself with a suitable crew and other requisites for his outfit upon condition that he would go at once to marseilles for the purpose of inquiring after an old man named louis dantès residing in the allées de meilhan and also a young woman called mercédès an inhabitant of the catalan village   159.55248917815905
in the first place there is a little intrigante named bonacieux   153.4250341684417
monsieur i replied it is not for myself that i entreat your interference i should grieve for him or avenge him but my poor brother had a wife and were anything to happen to me the poor creature would perish from want for my brother s pay alone kept her   87.60306113492723
edmond dantès replied the magistrate i arrest you in the name of the law   153.806038097706
is there a house in the neighborhood   139.82277140267342
let me act as i please felton let me act as i please said milady elated   146.15408011457242
de villefort moved in the first parisian circles less owing to his social position than to his personal merit   151.07545814066094
we were obliged to keep silent upon the dreadful catastrophe   195.45703355303868
and you want my blessing   102.40878435684162
we will keep a sharp lookout for them   185.20527457098666
exactly so   70.69535967722985
i have known you four days   68.95480439241544
asked he   3.013467818932952
m   68.77775025311254
sir suddenly exclaimed the countess after their walk had continued ten minutes in silence is it true that you have seen so much travelled so far and suffered so deeply   121.1356032588047
the count frowned apparently in gloomy hesitation   127.28685016793128
as for you morrel this is the secret of my conduct towards you   9.957395921068851
that man wait a bit   6.530746201122369
why did you not mention his name at once   165.21401193582028
said he at length   104.41325508899409
valery   137.9377194300099
grimaud remained with his hand extended   84.1857770345933
you are mistaken you will not die   68.34551576059712
the king seeing that he did not reply repeated his question   73.58170273782221
see how deadly pale he is   207.26352963624964
everything had turned out so differently from what he expected that he was stupefied with wonder   168.75017671495098
replied planchet astonished   108.57392269011197
they are bad managers said d artagnan shrugging his shoulders   1.0261253470885379
is there a convent at noisy   108.23974547893847
have you ever seen him   124.19221396844944
all the bodily fatigue of the day all the preoccupation of mind which the events of the evening had brought on disappeared as they do at the first approach of sleep when we are still sufficiently conscious to be aware of the coming of slumber   131.8012587507065
ali smiled with triumphant pride as he signified that he had indeed both chased and captured many lions   60.48949419446909
ah good then replied athos we will teach them these door breakers   77.52720461839213
well i was but four years old when one night i was suddenly awakened by my mother   51.64081655783143
let us then support monarchy in order to support ourselves   38.54335425069368
true enough   120.34392736665204
the one you bought will then become useless to you   146.48441441721684
but as i before said i was anxious to get rid of them upon any terms   125.29989357142338
and you you would pass rather a sad quarter hour with the red duke replied aramis   113.43592747559497
but this is the hour when we usually give m   81.41607243529191
the queen my sister is no longer queen my child   123.74789154810817
sir said she the language which i speak with my grandfather may be easily learnt and i can teach you in a few minutes to understand it almost as well as i can myself   216.1236892938821
all the world was occupied with the ceremony so that neither the chariot nor the precautions taken by those who were within it had been observed   79.86859518181694
yes he is that   148.3743359066702
crimes are imputed to you which had brought down far loftier heads than yours monsieur said the cardinal   77.40953735486642
but viscount since we can not perform the journey in less than seven or eight hours do not keep me waiting   91.1261772263195
this was the young man whom his mother and sister called to their aid to sustain them under the serious trial which they felt they would soon have to endure   117.13253522279035
you were going to ask me if the count of monte cristo had arrived or was expected   139.1750521391123
on your brow i read despair your lips falter ere you announce some terrible tidings your hands tremble   102.57519905843365
then he ran to one of the cupboards in valentine s room which had been transformed into a medicine closet and taking from its silver case a small bottle of nitric acid dropped a little of it into the liquor which immediately changed to a blood red color   88.0554166894016
for whom are you looking my fine fellow   105.75904480073498
inquired the bandits with astonishment   97.0841635701103
though he had acknowledged his guilt he was protected by his grief   109.79012717233435
a bruise   170.83957807579696
but if he does not come   95.32159487981455
this is indeed the reason why i begged you to alter the order of the questions   72.15054600129878
the queen sprang to the window   125.28940792692318
who would ever have thought it   168.43730009711646
monseigneur is correctly informed said d artagnan   118.24411385129042
his dishonor reflects upon us   169.30518894491428
none of her women accompanied her   135.7010750333494
m   118.06650097596525
are you sure of what you assert   55.62939831632539
chapter xlviii   114.93971845289894
the absence of grimaud whose name had never once been uttered by athos gave d artagnan uneasiness   105.25990551196432
but the eyes of his three companions were fixed upon him their ears were wide open and there were no means of retreat   80.19826439285629
and i will say that you are the sextus   89.9978458970509
the englishman with the coolness of his nation addressed him in terms nearly similar to those with which he had accosted the mayor of marseilles   230.5348072224138
aramis colored imperceptibly   161.0893754396308
can it be bad news   35.84798017263421
said d artagnan   127.69331468126775
de villefort when shall i see you again   40.24841113892796
the next morning at daybreak valentine and morrel were walking arm in arm on the seashore valentine relating how monte cristo had appeared in her room explained everything revealed the crime and finally how he had saved her life by enabling her to simulate death   106.18466674648892
suppose that the supreme being after having created the world and fertilized chaos had paused in the work to spare an angel the tears that might one day flow for mortal sins from her immortal eyes   80.68687687702656
at the same time he felt the duke s arms on his shoulders like two iron claws   136.28447163183012
impossible   208.9240381906003
steps sounded in the chamber and drew near   100.03892852721414
i think i shall feel better there   113.38174872887014
at this moment a sudden noise of footsteps was heard upon the stairs   142.30580078752735
i can easily suppose sir that her majesty has forgotten it amid the fetes and the courtiers of the palais royal but i who have passed those years in the bastile ah   107.58527140331807
besides porthos can not owe you much   84.32813756117636
ah monseigneur cried d artagnan spare me the weight of your displeasure   144.2939917817036
he sighed heavily   89.59926417381982
bring my new saddle and carry it along with those of these gentlemen   71.72991381461699
your having sent for me is another proof of your affection   103.50681437292734
the grooms supped for it was already late and their two masters impatient to return appointed a place of meeting with them on the jetty and desired them on no account to exchange a word with any one   234.57846199794636
said monte cristo with well feigned interest   182.25191614203473
they hate it   63.16500933492163
it only proves how little indulgence we may expect from your sex interrupted valentine   165.78396657610185
bravi   142.50067796728737
now listen to me maximilian   100.09376487094774
he added turning towards bertuccio   155.58633119443934
one of them went away and dantès heard his shoes striking on the pavement   110.91779349366396
oh oh   152.44666770354445
come let us come to the point   146.04957650164906
was found locked up in the prisoner s room a gag in his mouth and a poniard near him   149.85547704213067
the appearance of the third gendarme settled the matter for a crowd of curious loungers was extended before him effectually blocking the entrance to the hotel   64.67261309447275
at the moment mention occurred of his having rendered a service to the count raoul could not help turning his glance toward the young princess and then he saw in her eyes an expression of infinite gratitude to the young man   89.97305749436379
he told me it was you who sacrificed to the demon of speculation   10.35763289953644
begin this work to day this instant even and in three days i shall expect the result   41.9071610355886
that time you had nothing to say to me   91.9728920285985
milady put him from her slowly with her hand while drawing him nearer with her look   89.33046708781183
each examined his arms and put them in order   126.93168433990485
thus you see though born in paris i was brought up in corsica   144.41842166588884
nothing and he read you have not answered my first note   69.71126060135342
it is not a wonder they are fat sleeping all day and only waking to eat all night   86.50401656403793
and on what floor does he live   152.2157007827797
the night lamp threw out countless rays each resolving itself into some strange form to her disordered imagination when suddenly by its flickering light valentine thought she saw the door of her library which was in the recess by the chimney piece open slowly though she in vain listened for the sound of the hinges on which it turned   45.897811349989965
the obscurity was broken only now and then by the still darker lines of the roofs of houses   126.09897876527127
said monte cristo   188.35693662264597
yes sir   178.20397637839832
chapter xxiv   92.50813314919814
night arrived   196.2228484914715
let me know always where to find you   136.02948313156446
you have your liberty   79.8654290441165
it will be absolutely necessary that the place you may select have a small harbor creek or bay into which my corvette can enter and remain at anchor   211.9886620861509
i am not without a good reason for my conduct replied the banker   114.39318215424672
20167m as you left the choice of your costumes to me said the count to the two friends i have had these brought as they will be the most worn this year   188.1642354751329
and yet your father a man accustomed to judicial accusations ought to have known that all these deaths have not happened naturally   153.83662439359023
yes sire   193.15358896031333
you are the child of my captivity   126.41237964506031
so rocked by them she soon fell asleep   202.59664349167528
the duke thanked monsieur de chavigny for having as he said cleaned his drawing paper for him   85.56330270579568
i merely tell you to look into my conduct during the last four years that we have ceased to be husband and wife and see whether it has not always been consistent   144.24586934631344
do not alarm yourself monsieur we will duly respect your conscience   52.60154730723218
we will send the carriage to wait for us on the piazza del popolo by the via del babuino for i shall be glad to pass myself through the corso to see if some orders i have given have been executed   100.65179506664813
fortunately said d artagnan all this will be only necessary till after tomorrow evening for when once with the army we shall have i hope only men to dread   68.49872704190781
have you no letter for him   94.4647021402474
d artagnan leaning on athos made a sign to porthos and aramis to keep near them and then placed himself behind the man with the bare arms who was still laughing at his own vile pleasantry and receiving the congratulations of several others   176.2190405289583
for if i mistake not you came to paris with the ambitious idea of making your fortune   189.97868765099327
you appear to be a brave young man   143.06955839295617
did you observe that man s eyes while he was speaking to us   61.83683118515243
you may copy it give it away or re use it under the terms of the project gutenberg license included with this ebook or online at www   132.3724687418767
by a violent effort he rose half out of the water waving his cap and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors   79.3764790681271
look yonder   104.26657216718388
chapter xxxvi   34.307780452653574
and when you are full of money again you can redeem it and take it back cleansed from its ancient stains as it will have passed through the hands of usurers   223.01070596180244
he was conscious that he passed through a door and that the door closed behind him   113.66580356486209
why then not let me out by the door   92.79091504832688
yes   133.7765267064054
and he turned up two cards as usual a king for d artagnan and an ace for himself   69.20477428508205
that makes in all   133.36538396524116
no   108.18654761686321
the devil it does   79.66377927050699
raving mad   209.87793759474886
as to athos he went out without any mystery took his horse which was tied with those of his friends to the fastenings of the shutters in four words convinced the attendant of the necessity of a vanguard for their return carefully examined the priming of his pistols drew his sword and took like a forlorn hope the road to the camp   208.54715608953256
oh no   201.87148422609542
then father said raoul forcing himself to convey a respect by speech that did not come from his heart if you are a priest you have an opportunity as my friend has told you of exercising your vocation   118.12815602094636
this caused so rapid and complete a diversion from the attack that d artagnan s adversary while the latter turned round to face this shower of blows sheathed his sword with the same precision and instead of an actor which he had nearly been became a spectator of the fight a part in which he acquitted himself with his usual impassiveness muttering nevertheless a plague upon these gascons   85.97825526342342
in the meanwhile franz was considering the singular shudder that had passed over the count of monte cristo at the moment when he had been in some sort forced to give his hand to albert   111.23815353590261
there now   6.123879274584695
i must return to the minister s   145.74721020849483
take the gate on the left   170.7055885914351
but immediately through this opening twenty more shots were fired and the flame rushing up like fire from the crater of a volcano soon reached the tapestry which it quickly devoured   132.97955616933902
spare me then i beseech you   154.72402138573918
letters had been despatched to m   171.4932236107286
there is but one way   71.37271732247322
of whom do you speak   160.16472101323401
i had not yet fully recovered consciousness when again i heard groans mingled with half stifled cries as if from persons engaged in a deadly struggle   132.25091914002113
sir   106.90524112559676
the king looked at his old friend with tears in his eyes   141.39211674293725
keep at it all night if necessary and do not return here tomorrow till after the jailer has visited me   2.8566899208778693
and as his talents did not enable him to produce a very good likeness he wrote under the picture that there might be little doubt regarding the original portrait of the illustrious coxcomb mazarin   148.54047752656456
london   80.48814628174301
my lord de winter continued athos what is the penalty you demand against this woman   187.1729015849101
no no madame there is no such thing as chance   115.64570008694021
you do not know at all and in this way they will chase him to paris without drawing a trigger   89.71600036822898
more reason then he should protect a king pursued by parliament   61.7031658756538
exclaimed a commanding voice   85.66961418423263
edmond turned away his head with a sigh   85.10618020617522
i tell you i belong to the queen   117.38301854869422
well where is he sir   21.806358524837606
said porthos drawing himself up proudly   133.6961202470185
athos indeed saw a second smile on the lips of d artagnan   78.76697288030965
moreover great liberty prevailed throughout the immense crowd   51.13412450178528
to me   60.74115655179497
and it is exactly because he is a bold fellow that he is the more to be feared   161.75789740508685
reflect upon it   198.80341379664173
if at the end of three or four months you are set at liberty the ring will be lost or a false stone worth three francs will be given you instead of a diamond worth 50 000 or perhaps 55 000 francs   113.09564885721474
you have just seen him resolve to keep it when he has everything to lose and surely there is more reason for his doing so where he has everything to gain   100.91905853907542
he is a millionaire his income is 500 000 francs   169.06322608947073
yes much   102.9412353730093
pray was not monsieur d artagnan in the time of the cardinal mixed up in some intrigue from which he came out according to report quite cleverly   165.40869943113137
monsieur said athos i have engaged two of my friends as seconds   176.04939447826987
the comte de wardes was announced and d artagnan was introduced   88.95374095851322
your very grateful milady clarik that s all very simple said d artagnan   134.85196974171936
no i never saw him until that moment and have not seen him since   238.22486265719635
suddenly a man sprang out of the english ranks fell upon athos twined arms of steel around him and tearing his sword from him said in his ear silence   30.203769960678045
then seated on a chair she looked at the manly countenance of monte cristo on which grief and hatred still impressed a threatening expression   176.8025070643103
my heart beat so violently that i feared my wound would open   99.17400463076568
the cardinal won t allow it   140.35145288507837
he could no longer cherish any doubt that the cardinal had been carried off by the three prisoners since the prisoners had disappeared at the same time   76.96811687878761
hope my friend repeated the count   192.53521419789692
oh you are no stranger at least not by name replied madame danglars and the last two or three days we have really talked of nothing but you   141.30695858467817
another will be immediately saddled   173.15043644293837
the trial at eight o clock in the morning albert had arrived at beauchamp s door   113.2921078637847
this was the name of madame de longueville   111.52801782576786
that was the reason of your running away from us   135.92922175613282
do you wish me to lend you some   258.1175945566577
milady opened the letter with eagerness equal to kitty s in bringing it   131.85350053621684
inquired emmanuel   15.13182174074501
caderousse lingered for a moment then taking leave of old dantès he went downstairs to rejoin danglars who awaited him at the corner of the rue senac   170.643559685311
i know not sir but i thought it really very fine and grand   104.19821029903285
come in my lord said philip in a low tone and i will show you something droll   112.12936150394277
in a minute the young man darted through several rooms till at length he reached valentine s   219.66949573701785
mousqueton s horse rejoined them and galloped by the side of his companions   132.9887235771378
oh sir   82.90763742368677
we need no witnesses   80.3789449883308
he laid a wager he would tame médéah in the space of six months   51.70437238677306
it is true that my patrimony will go to endow charitable institutions and my father will have deprived me of my lawful inheritance without any reason for doing so but i shall have the satisfaction of knowing that i have acted like a man of sense and feeling   111.4652336269241
they came with their usual promptness and the coadjutor spent with them a part of the night   125.7119777860243
not been there i would have cut off the head of that infamous being without thinking of it or even after thinking of it   88.83223926738388
now in the event of the king s death his successor inherits a crown when the employee dies the supernumerary steps into his shoes and receives his salary of twelve thousand livres   178.51644197968395
inquired the sentinel   152.6373139027814
yes   175.33144965248346
oh   205.39483751646776
morrel farewell and a thousand thanks   110.18028322430344
he is a noble of very lofty carriage black hair swarthy complexion piercing eye white teeth and has a scar on his temple   215.91115677852542
let us go and see whether they are quite dead or if they can still be helped suggested raoul   33.760070427009154
what are you doing   143.97042146476747
if we die for him it will be grand   192.47016106767782
but this counsel effectually decided mademoiselle danglars never to commit herself by being seen in public with one destined for a theatrical life   110.08609104384193
are you fond of traveling   97.78207335201765
d artagnan pressed nothing but a corpse in his arms   113.37222365487483
the novice sat down   138.12187117560057
the young man smiled sorrowfully   109.42939907933719
had the old man s face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less emotion at this news than was now to be traced there   183.51789205818517
and the ill treated people have drawn up the following which i have the honor to present to your majesty   48.81929719757812
that s it said the duke now make me a little hole in the floor whilst i go and fetch the culprit   89.76477648935337
bonacieux to stoop as he did toward the opening   153.16499564837915
that of either our friends or our enemies said milady with her terrible coolness   128.58194901149088
he can not possibly serve you as a pattern for your conduct not being as you are a paid servant but a mere slave a dog who should he fail in his duty towards me i should not discharge from my service but kill   30.084496132073056
he muttered   53.66808090732789
and we can now hear how the poor child is   113.35817805800338
alone and free to act as he wished the man then drew from his pocket something which the count could not discern placed it on a stand then went straight to the secretaire felt the lock and contrary to his expectation found that the key was missing   222.8903030152576
you must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of project gutenberg™ works   85.80221073854025

i could not defer my pleasure so i took a cabriolet and drove to the horse dealer s   207.2343866091856
but as soon as it was finished the buzz was redoubled through all the drawing rooms   200.7485264943564
he had no fears as to how he should live good seamen are welcome everywhere   172.80723265054414
a change of ideas presented themselves to his brain like a new design on the kaleidoscope   145.24675061259472
ah monsieur   78.41192920255196
i am innocent   59.789298327954455
who is there   65.48243427853396
morrel bent his head till it touched the stone then clutching the grating with both hands he murmured oh valentine   93.67974437192527
24 frédérick lemaître french actor 1800 1876   142.0172474669946
he had not long to wait for the queen scarcely remained a quarter of an hour with mazarin but this quarter of an hour of expectation appeared a century to him   134.8010544163162
but he called to mind the words of the will which he knew by heart   71.48263703401435
gentlemen said the president when silence was restored is the count of morcerf convicted of felony treason and conduct unbecoming a member of this house   135.4302780418593
replied raoul especially in expression   136.26026700459627
now suppose that next day one of these eels or pike or carp poisoned at the fourth remove is served up at your table   97.44291951751028

go into harness again gird on your sword run after adventures and leave as in old times a little of your fat on the roadside   175.02695356111363
indeed   148.69238655197472
yes   196.67137890241344
she opened her eyes looked around her with terror saw that the apartment was empty and that she was alone with her liberator   143.5493667773512
do i know m   154.18735565637982
his features bore no sign of that deep emotion which stops the beating of the heart and blanches the cheek   141.27389657182567
de morcerf   71.52985907786388
well my dear friend let us approach the window and there you can match your strength against that of an iron bar   208.49757463867368
then he descended with cautious and slow step for he dreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned should happen in reality   213.43632830084152
porthos lent him his back and d artagnan was soon on the summit of the wall where he seated himself   162.96061485712366
they fled together into berry and there he obtained a little curacy   109.35992736038791
silence   84.42841519762233
by general oliver cromwell   126.34669226455561
what next   72.44779222224815
just then the lamp again flickered   147.78846604212035
one evening i was in a garden   149.09992741536297
my mother inherited an estate from her husband you have assassinated her   86.31810139084183
and as if he only felt strength to detach himself by a violent effort from the hand he held he sprang away running while mme   97.45142146487306
a most active search was still prosecuted in the house near the hotel de la chevrette for the discovery of planchet   71.7093632403165
said he in as pure french as has ever been uttered between rouen and tours   138.96696356775797
the king is with us and his generals are the duke of orleans and the prince de condé although i must add tis almost impossible now to know to which party any one belongs   111.25683957642659
in her bedchamber go on   113.87991681832433
d avrigny had communicated in his nocturnal walk to m   47.6384360022267
at the least noise he imagined himself about to be arrested and that planchet was being brought back to be confronted with himself and his friends   58.22788238313025
two days will be a different thing said danglars smiling   87.46624156487984
cried grimaud   172.5784784179356
0307m edmond was seized with vertigo   176.32949090368322
oh i see you prefer peregrination   120.04168537039139
still more he has lifted the corner of her mask that shield with which she covered herself and which rendered her so strong   48.62807463406217
yes monseigneur   89.42237092672828
20033m such was the state of affairs when the day after his interview with m   41.53651011694187
her eyes which cast the brilliancy of emeralds were perfectly beautiful and yet were at the same time full of sweetness and majesty   48.26822784681771
ten minutes later the escort stopped at ermenonville but the four friends went on with well sustained ardor guarding mazarin carefully   111.68422517872364
she is perhaps dead   65.594016582846
tis that which has made me so cross since yesterday   144.84431028032367
i know her very well   113.28789895527551
friquet   83.92350668013738

he is as you see a very valuable animal said maximilian   142.63964588283363
30213m no   142.33640690051027
inquired albert   138.1212706294863
moreover from being so long in twilight or darkness his eyes had acquired the faculty of distinguishing objects in the night common to the hyena and the wolf   73.8666762328517
he was a simple looking lawyer s clerk elevated to the extraordinary dignity of a provincial scrivener   127.02554834601241
but lord de winter might suspect him   118.8043992003038
but by some strange play of emotion in proportion as the proofs that faria had not been deceived became stronger so did his heart give way and a feeling of discouragement stole over him   137.44793421371253
maximilian you are no ordinary man   82.01690288429745
i make a hasty resolution   174.97298308516054
no this is his blood   185.75886164061393

the sign of the red dovecot chapter xliv   175.66090993144462
this postscript decreased greatly the young girl s happiness   105.968961476927
the young couple gazed with astonishment at the sight of their visitor s emotion and wondered to see the large tears silently chasing each other down his otherwise stern and immovable features   88.3258638178809
what can you expect   98.75966744957091
do no such thing i beg of you   106.61621380614451
now sir said d artagnan wishing to change the conversation here are fifty pistoles that the count has sent you by the same courier   173.61313630517083
no said mazarin again   148.53326741012276
d artagnan was too grand to promise anything   103.55471213132844
i must however first frankly tell you that you must change your mode of life   56.3824515207472
the servant who had travelled at the back of the carriage waited on him   246.6936111988103
but said morrel the culprit the murderer the assassin   94.32045905204076
yes monseigneur replied the faithful cloak bearer of anne of austria but too late perhaps   163.5982488095969
of whom   116.9128995853516
porthos was not very quick to understand the language of glances but now since the name of athos had suggested to him the same idea he understood   163.42254237936137
yes i recognize the features of the angel who appears to me every night crying to my soul which can not sleep strike save england save thyself for thou wilt die without having appeased god   37.74535036271378
villefort answered nothing he simply raised his head which had been cast down before and looked at the doctor with amazement   28.24489914820579
this celebrated woman fully understood the art of being dull with dignity   131.82481248938294
athos repeated to him the same question he had asked the first person he met   42.33350664485424
i thought i recognized him and i was not mistaken   94.68768468152157
we do not give ourselves twice over said d artagnan   114.82984858627177
and i said porthos   123.62673097699218
the countess g wished to revive the subject of the count but franz announced he had something far newer to tell her and in spite of albert s demonstrations of false modesty he informed the countess of the great event which had preoccupied them for the last three days   161.12564584310712
oh cried julie i have not lost all hope of some day kissing that hand as i now kiss the purse which he has touched   109.95231554512772
just the person we require at a time like the present said a second   128.8316426456692

i will take all the consequences upon myself   135.5899377457113
but i solemnly promise you to restrain all this ardor this fervor and intensity of feeling until you yourself shall require me to render them available in serving or assisting you   56.738909711868104
now sir i am listening go on   107.99736507650388
the weather was magnificent and the excursion a treat   121.61943111749393
if your eminence should order me to arrest the devil i would seize him by the horns and would bring him in   109.5214273186792
i am almost a prisoner   108.64635673907843
indeed you could not belong to him   25.37808663637206
you are right your excellency he said   143.20107128348008
danglars did not lose one pang that fernand endured   140.5305788090954
save my husband   121.4928393594261
at last after traveling two days and a night they arrived at boulogne toward the evening favored by magnificent weather   118.05378505351975
chapter 73   68.65273633226528
mordaunt had called on the bishop that very evening to apprise him of the religious desire expressed by the king and also of cromwell s permission   178.10240635493048
thinking that porthos will be at last a baron and d artagnan a captain   6.771434877472288
with the four hundred livres we will make the half of one for one of the unmounted and then we will give the turnings out of our pockets to d artagnan who has a steady hand and will go and play in the first gaming house we come to   8.073767635211269
oh you are a man of god sir cried caderousse   71.30930465293565
the procureur without going to see either his wife or his daughter went at once to his study and offering the young man a chair m   63.39793064915504
but it must be also said that the very name of milady paralyzed him   52.05513127704273
will you obey or do you intend to rebel against the king   154.24636876086396
but i perceive i have not much to teach you   174.57700125916648
wait he continued renewing his fruitless search   142.58519755793623
for the emperor s return   119.42360784793061
madame replied aramis i must ask your pardon but i know not how to hide my indignation at seeing how a daughter of henry iv   103.44609362294615
but as it was the bastille alone he looked at he did not observe milady who mounted upon a light chestnut horse designated him with her finger to two ill looking men who came close up to the ranks to take notice of him   187.68798991127355
yes said milady lord de winter   45.061352388413454
yes said danglars taking it from beyond his reach   162.3220387023433
go to bed mademoiselle said milady   74.06297084555484
at that moment mme   69.92198664561437

for the second time i give you your life   136.44346335732536
but my lord think of what you re about to do and beware of going too far   121.1336134743023
de winter only replied by a groan   108.20240982948414
he saw la ramee twirling his thumbs ten feet from him and his guards laughing and drinking in the ante chamber   23.463882464919138
m   140.22742534981032
cried villefort   51.19058475957294
but that is not all   80.21079019236069
well   190.21271026575027
raoul was about to reply when d artagnan bent down to his ear   116.48460017590291
that s it   186.25812124780825
i have then to inform you sir at the request of m   124.64975274500824
i do nothing without her commands pray understand that   126.29256872600243
morrel appeared and was saluted with an enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the pharaon who hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man whose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first in command of the ship   53.130345582958356
you must know monsieur that marie michon when she returned to france in 1643 immediately sought for information about that child   193.4407014646419
you and i alone know of its existence   97.82758529334036
it is not for me to say   118.04723309853831
madame wait at the door whilst i shall be at the head of the king s bed ready to die for him   44.32441476733912
your private adventures have touched me to the quick   154.4657128273027
what   143.12042436683876
i remember the last time she came as well as if it were to day   114.49875780544998
trust me i am fully grateful for such unparalleled conduct and if as i told you i can be of any service to you i believe you monsieur i believe you   173.57534744778548
true interrupted the young man i had not looked upon it in that light   90.14655764666809
afterwards he was made to promise that he would not make the least attempt to raise the bandage   128.54356265494593
good replied athos whose blood mounted to his face at the insult offered to royalty   95.09019586549992
and have i not been richly paid for that obedience   159.21183572861867
he will be a dead man in a month   80.02043666115534
on guard then   92.01377149334805
i hope you do not doubt it   272.96061650651575
the marshal made no attempt to force that barrier and returned up the quay   168.34048368170176
inquired the marquise   168.18448007227084
felton barred his passage   159.9158530166337
not so loud father i entreat of you for your own sake as well as mine   117.26949235557849
said he   11.125706187493236
behind the event that had overwhelmed him he saw the hand of god   106.19472785742157
permit me to thank you   159.53577062127908
hereafter being able to ask for me at all hours and consequently to take advantage of all opportunities you will probably obtain that which you desire   39.00130187392875
well sir said de guiche are you going to reply   138.4030378796647
they saw a light glimmering in the midst of some trees   172.29369051669875
it is likely   144.8865047210165
and he sat down   125.60754084466177
she was free now to give way to her transports without being observed   148.09387841403264
de tréville listened to the young man s account with a seriousness which proved that he saw something else in this adventure besides a love affair   168.08340109596674
nothing   247.89442259527647
said madame de chevreuse trying to read in athos s eyes   156.13355034348425
i did not reckon upon hunger and infidelity   110.01360797475459
is your love returned   78.3585384804424
remember this is no affair of mine said the trembling voice of la carconte as though through the flooring of her chamber she viewed the scene that was enacting below   237.83102777196228
because madame de saint méran is just arrived in paris bringing the news of m   140.13135199814673
oh said she seizing the count s hand and raising it to her lips   143.07055771643408
it is very hot said athos drawing his sword in its turn and yet i can not take off my doublet   159.7356930862403
for the first article of the constitution is the king can do no wrong   153.93905024514902
you understand dantès relations if he had any might have some interest in knowing if he were dead or alive   118.5153469002551
continued the president   151.61011672782257
ali then entered bringing coffee and chibouques   48.47461547671131
pardon me for interrupting you but it appears to me that that name is familiar to me   96.84039617001986
me   122.10011941431554
she returned to consciousness   15.365143075724703
all these defects pressed hard on a man who had had his stall at the bouffes and had shared a lower box at the opera   71.58774360987256
and now my lord that i see how hopeless the position of the king is tell me with what you are charged on the part of my royal husband   87.33930298258936
the gentleman who receives us   140.76555077174754
today is the 5th of june   91.59139320483483
i was sure of it the cursed letter   183.09666385142776
if when you arrive at cours la reine you find no one you must go on to saint germain   71.60479135444331
i shouldn t wonder if he were at the head of the mob at this very moment   125.09055244176906
m   163.48574505327002
why do you like that best   109.7940935371203
i know it that is sufficient   49.45822503101135
you will be very kind to me will you not morrel to make me forget my sorrow in leaving her thus   90.8095255519688
looked upon by all as a man of talent since those who have never experienced a political check are generally so regarded   233.3771081978847
stop and let us talk   92.23259168064095
valentine who for the last hour had been suffering from the fever which returned nightly incapable of controlling her ideas was forced to yield to the excitement which exhausted itself in producing and reproducing a succession and recurrence of the same fancies and images   197.86094869513232
30241m lucien having left danglars took his place on the sofa closed the open book and placing himself in a dreadfully dictatorial attitude he began playing with the dog   169.4619437401375
i am planchet planchet whom you know well   45.17819009889568
listen madame and recall your remembrances   116.79561852367215
it was at this moment d artagnan entered the courtyard of the palace in the coadjutor s carriage and a few seconds later the carriages of the ladies in waiting drove out and the gates were shut after them   157.03468881257115
d artagnan entered behind him   94.33311559843726
de wardes must take his departure still in obscurity   181.04050649875916
and that house in which the plenipotentiaries are asked athos belongs to to monsieur de chanleu who commands your troops at charenton   29.72035005031796
i will manage the master   165.29940292218714
no i spoke of the duchess de chevreuse   162.65880148789205
that when my coachman was about to harness the horses to my carriage he discovered that they had been removed from the stables without his knowledge   131.92290038800115
said d artagnan pressing athos s hand   172.71934397312685
anne followed him with her eyes and as he withdrew at every step he took a disdainful smile was seen playing then gradually burst upon her lips   105.66985106536075
that is a dream also   135.16723812338319
oh do not kill me   258.68447308613884
there are such in the world and god will doubtless reward them in heaven for their resignation on earth but those who mean to contend must not lose one precious moment but must return immediately the blow which fortune strikes   189.16277605318436
you told me that   159.03392155163934
and at the sound of my voice the slaves redoubled their cries and prayers and lamentations   126.86637541926441
mme   116.11113860086837
nineteen or twenty at the most   100.6221074290095
the whole body of servants arranged in a semi circle at a respectful distance looked on with humble curiosity   126.61640439223808
i must place him in the hands of guards who will take him into camp   201.1421183958324
it seems the fellow had been caught wandering nearer to the harem of the bey of tunis than etiquette permits to one of his color and he was condemned by the bey to have his tongue cut out and his hand and head cut off   92.43524397525238
oh god thou hast preserved my memory   136.24160699542597
dantès cried at the top of his voice to warn them of their danger but they saw it themselves   160.58668235528071
and he had also acquired being naturally of a goodly stature that vigor which a frame possesses which has so long concentrated all its force within itself   142.11822777603473
your age   135.37113782353237
but no he saw that i was unhappy he understood that i could be of no use to him and therefore paid no attention to me whatever   110.40033252815836
that is easily done said aramis   213.26445031427176
then he had made himself another enemy less to be feared he thought   43.51260382673625
morrel he has stayed behind sick at palma   178.6230230952351
battle   103.42206988689868
if the king had desired that the letter should be given to him madame he would have demanded it of you himself   120.31809315793778
cried the gascon who reckoned upon this letter for making his way at court   105.72068553749989
this was not enough he must now learn to write   144.14346064589253
however i have managed to live thirty years without this protection you will say   180.98148477650383
the discovery of a completely unknown manuscript at a period in which historical science is carried to such a high degree appeared almost miraculous   133.48669343896137
in short my lord said athos glancing at aramis your highness is discontented with your party   68.90003361415704
was he placed here when he first arrived   182.436732250662
we hear from yanina if valentine could have seen the trembling step and agitated countenance of franz when he quitted the chamber of m   214.48505750509048
dessessart took up their quarters at the minimes   49.58052505248986
those in whom the king has confided lord leven s highlanders   201.6525488198098
and who served under an assumed name   130.3516690042626
oh yes we sailors are like freemasons and recognize each other by signs   14.011664837437038
you are a man of brass replied aramis   227.65609922017688
on the contrary albert turned frightfully pale   37.45614567825314
everything d artagnan even folly has its limit   82.2686104225813
if i fly she will fly   119.78011279690777
no sir with the exception of two or three friends every one deserted him   91.7037484533528
no nonsense my good fellow   141.4515989026854
he pressed his burning lips to the cheeks but they were icy cold and pale   42.528607973697035
it wounded the pride of the parliament which supported by the citizens replied by declaring that cardinal mazarin was the cause of all the discontent   22.75269898619429
aramis easily aroused athos whose sleep was light like that of all persons of a finely organized constitution   135.95226945867765
besides the same thing had occurred often before   134.97051299456518
and you paid him out of the two hundred francs i left you   202.80702898553142
the hour of dinner soon arrived   184.70737173132406
never sell it   228.5825649842928
if i were i should do for you at once the most that you deserve   199.2914890563963
are you certain of it sir   141.8971356411287
are we going to fight perchance   107.98623265903367
and she resumed her seat as if plunged in reflections entirely personal   146.17121451897245
reiterated the duke   68.28388868293445
then no longer able to resist he called out   94.38508268387052
de chevalier dessessart to admit d artagnan as a cadet in his company of guards   225.44608030681906
and attention   30.640008263098508
and be not concerned for your expenses or for those of your mule   108.06049999409956
i listen i am waiting to hear   116.27109654960152
the sound of his voice was at once penetrating and melodious   82.69656131937211
eh eh   106.173576115005
come at dinnertime   26.649917282527383
the first words exchanged between the four friends on account of the ceremony which each of them mingled with their demonstration were somewhat forced and even the repast began with a kind of stiffness   206.41451285912552
yes my good friend this worthy porthos has just received a sword wound and i am taking him to his country house at saint cloud   32.170716085064754
i know it well   188.60416969910713
doubtless replied the count since no one hears me complain   183.35252036367473
i madame   0.4428757929266993
no   71.75778992387691
anne of austria at the age of forty six   155.67008849651816
yes monseigneur   118.85455634761361
if this man should ever discover the names of the others my master is lost   134.99482450284526
he hastily seized the coverlet of his bed and wrapped it round him   124.29155477851826
see here are two similar letters to that you have yourself received   208.0177727201111
it will be well employed i hope   60.42747921505035
she has fainted   94.34733157262144
that may be done if they can separate the king from his mother   221.37785685927105
cloud   94.73158583302406
my god my god my god   194.91028314761112
perhaps not being endowed with the endurance of athos who seemed to be made of iron he would have preferred a bath in the river seine of which he had heard so much and afterward his bed   166.74656576617184
they found him in the large armchair which served him for a bed enjoying a calm nay almost a smiling sleep   138.1021997834826
raoul delighted at the count s companionship perceived or affected to perceive nothing of this byplay   108.77423332162148
he will tell thee what has become of her   97.18684177969585
but on turning around he saw the beggar between him and the door   63.41727586463411
as to what you say about not seeing you again i believe not a word of it   154.06258740948968
said m   83.62801192608745
said anne of austria drawing herself up to her full height and fixing her eyes upon the chancellor with an expression almost threatening   265.2634935181736
mousqueton who knew nothing of what was going on in the chateau wondered that the idea had not occurred to him sooner   150.2817805488569
he s in the bastile   239.82278694320414
so that you and valentine who are so attached to each other would not be separated and you would be able to pursue exactly the same course of life which you have hitherto done and thus instead of losing you will be a gainer by the change as it will secure to you two children instead of one to watch over and comfort you   119.75206875333613
de morcerf he whom i wrote from rome an account of the services you rendered me and to whom i announced your promised visit and i may say that both the count and countess anxiously desire to thank you in person   91.48883819919837
sky blue velvet breeches fastened above the knee with diamond buckles   190.62037095516945
but you are too intelligent not to know that according to a prejudice too firmly rooted to be exterminated a nobility which dates back five centuries is worth more than one that can only reckon twenty years   102.28976048496895
you have been here a very long time john said he   91.65001148629969
one of his guns was swung over his shoulder gaetano had the other and a sailor held his rifle   56.561713924577774
and if there is a truce the english army has broken it by quitting the town contrary to the agreement which kept it there   176.49327229157464
the vendomois road he replied   172.98602351206776
and then we shall see how the rebels will get on without either king or queen   36.238668357355905
only when pressing his hand a little more warmly than usual he informed him that the company of dessessart was on duty at the louvre and that he might repair at once to his post   134.62084459303685
you will not be pitiless   67.72370613898516
a young man who still adheres to my fallen fortunes passes a part of his time in a belvedere at the top of the house in hopes of being the first to announce good news to me   107.97975700661239
cried the baroness falling on her chair and stifling her sobs in her handkerchief   59.17702821932109
i tried to open the door but it was locked inside   150.90494456283605
cried a third   79.87467143431941
nay nay my good woman make yourself perfectly easy i beg of you   99.84473107585401
he smiled kindly on the prisoner for he was an excellent man and had taken a great liking for the captive prince   190.40946458260467
though it was scarcely daylight our four travelers found the town in a great bustle owing to the reported approach of harrison and the king   159.74738114597508
the carriage again moved on   60.00354352903411
and that was why i threw myself between you and him   167.4098146677668
monte cristo shrugged his shoulders   100.67872054547998
come and watch by the dead and all the wretched family will be grateful to you   178.32004472037585
but they felt the sacredness of his grief and kindly refrained from questioning him as to its cause while with instinctive delicacy they left him to indulge his sorrow alone   144.56707477509218
you are rich then my dear monsieur bonacieux   44.50776317351276
then half carrying half supporting him he managed to reach the abbé s chamber when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed   133.01270751426836
old dantès who was only sustained by hope lost all hope at napoleon s downfall   35.45636002804207
said he   80.57740263109386
his majesty will then take refuge in holland where i hear his highness the prince of wales now is   113.73847678394473
de tréville that you should undertake so long a journey without that necessary passport the sole resource of us poor béarnese   216.4613232330384
thanks   195.25742736304136
it is men who make you weep   165.79945720839376
inquired debray   98.52490433214362
i should not have guessed it   118.12292928223727
well what do you propose to do   145.19642515988247
you acknowledge of course that you owe this sum to him   67.46772655716634
said château renaud   260.5353951550707
on both sides loud cries arose on the one side cries of anger on the other cries of enthusiasm   232.54689679643005
the examination no sooner had villefort left the salon than he assumed the grave air of a man who holds the balance of life and death in his hands   154.3466112371155
are you not mademoiselle julie morrel   2.6956725210700085
at that moment the door opened   148.91356469994628
not like monsieur de richelieu who went on just as he pleased   75.79007323515557
on the sea   91.23624069564376
it was an ambuscade   85.26256368719731
are you hungry   196.97438862269834
my sister is happily married   166.0217720198426
and now we understand each other   174.0074961788788
since you have commenced your sacred office deign to continue it   151.28063092385304
noirtier s eye remained fixed and firm as if to imply that a promise did not suffice   128.50146625797785
now i am convinced   140.54200372819938
at last said he i shall know with whom i have to do   115.75937362676251
d artagnan went instantly to the hay dealer and bargained with him for a hundred and fifty trusses of straw which he obtained at the rate of three pistoles each   131.2916754761429
s   52.88811357585402
valentine instantly ran down   154.89279891236683
in fact of the twenty rose trees which formed the parterre not one bore the mark of the slug nor were there evidences anywhere of the clustering aphis which is so destructive to plants growing in a damp soil   213.33396020569955
he rose and preceded by the host wringing his hands and followed by planchet with his musketoon ready for use he approached the scene of action   91.12722208106243
two royal pages were playing with him   152.77378108686696
truly cried the host misfortune is coming on our house   27.16511381998167
for he comes so seldom it would seem only chance that brings him   139.4522843965775
the order of imprisonment came from high authority and the order for his liberation must proceed from the same source   82.42499267641138
he is a bad priest said porthos who has pity for heretics   85.49921462704052
grief does not stun me   127.67423614543861
our swords   209.43015314507255
you will breakfast with me will you not morrel   187.3471380928333
he consequently sprang up again re entered the office with a turn of his finger set the clock right again that it might not be perceived the next day that it had been put wrong and certain from that time that he had a witness to prove his alibi he ran downstairs and soon found himself in the street   103.24264079197795
under cover of the mea culpa striking her breast so vigorously that everybody even the lady with the red cushion turned round toward her   174.92211709625053
let us not talk about money if you please   64.41082940569552
i shall see everything and at the least suspicious sign i shall begin to exterminate   212.7735468943699
a pistol shot seems quite delightful compared with this catastrophe   48.790982288814874
he asked   90.57838563648377
the first three remained constantly in a small waiting room ready to obey the summons of a small golden bell or to receive the orders of the romaic slave who knew just enough french to be able to transmit her mistress s wishes to the three other waiting women   164.76067563266506
yes yes said porthos trying to give to his mustache a curl which it had lost whilst he had been alone   178.30402134964743
a woman and consequently subject to the weaknesses of my sex i am alarmed at the idea of civil war   88.09551163839524
parbleu   224.81899544366672
the peasant the gardener was rochefort whom he believed to be in the bastile   167.97662862629556
the cardinal however did not unseal the letter at once but continued to turn it again and again in his hand   162.21920031416903
asked his friend   184.25412339992823
valentine and morrel were exchanging their adieux in the presence of noirtier when a ring was heard at the door bell   41.74800884359577
these citizens are dreadfully ridiculous observed d artagnan to porthos and went on his way   167.87034673473886
but let us embark   42.78325893782204
monte cristo exchanged a rapid glance with the young girl which was quite unperceived by albert   82.99759303049571
i ask nothing better   53.06664631500675
a surgeon   131.7653121628913
but never mind continued cucumetto laughing sooner or later your turn will come   130.2371736949999
look d artagnan   135.3480753527677
no   210.39141284737352
tiboulen and lemaire were therefore the safest for dantès venture   73.99400385562757
of the interval passed nothing remains in the memory but a vague mist in which a thousand confused images of trees mountains and landscapes are lost   202.85131604413337
bonacieux into the little apartment of which we have given a description   88.01299840839434
but after reading them over many times i found out that with one hundred and fifty well chosen books a man possesses if not a complete summary of all human knowledge at least all that a man need really know   78.1677698469986
coquenard   53.72994025256058
but without doubt m   127.23536759189572
the abbé did not know the island of monte cristo   165.04812408590664
and not without a deal of trouble too   188.6159446509977
they arrived in about an hour at the cemetery   74.06328575552313
could you incur my displeasure by having followed the orders of your superiors with more intelligence and courage than another would have done   91.93428897280981
morrel then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the new favor which he designed to bestow on him   115.83465150525316
and misfortunes make us jealous   132.16877952562393
cæsar s commentaries said the bandit it is my favorite work   104.4774441255477
and i myself would aid you with my prayers   124.0575298582548
tomorrow perchance it will be our turn   209.00209494908594
you have a good memory   35.59530084785311
but to day you have not fought for the king you have fought for mazarin   141.0837246502481
yes you talk like a child i repeat the word   131.00464244233086
i am as certain of it as that we two are christians   136.49839556426863
said aramis   117.9700257213958
there was an energy a conviction and a sincerity in the manner of the young man which silenced the tumult   140.18166424713507
but ere he entered his travelling carriage albert fearing that his expected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into placed in the care of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the count of monte cristo on which beneath the name of viscount albert de morcerf he had written in pencil 27 rue du helder on the 21 st may half past ten a   66.36407929444286
you are a soldier and if you remain at the catalans it is because there is no war   133.76011889883264
but not for me who discover a gentleman by instinct and who scent out an aristocratic family like a very bloodhound of heraldry   187.24104308861675
aramis was wiping a slight moisture from his brow   128.02172777470608
it seems sir steward said he that you have yet to learn that all things are to be sold to such as care to pay the price   15.747469804094052
yes   167.61216209861357
well the abbé the abbé busoni   125.26932745289602
i have seen them before   176.36473358396353
and what will you do in that case   73.13786298861805
bridle in mouth   175.7358535097874
i am not allowed to see you madame but you shall every day hear of me   203.3486629281049
he was waiting for a woman continued tréville   180.52736144449193
and when he was alone in the world i tried by absolute devotion to his will to make up to him all he had done for me during ten years of unremitting kindness   158.2505256368622
cried he springing up is it really you   128.27808136314047
yes   169.49171921953726
half the 15th of this month half the 15th of next   96.7690310566076
ah this visit was expected   117.7289289653702
bigamy my dear   93.34044134909213
albert de morcerf   138.18525885413072
and louis xiii   159.8534523147474
then it became the turn of athos porthos and aramis to mount guard with d artagnan when he was on duty   172.5468083139511
fernand kneeling by her side took her hand and covered it with kisses that mercédès did not even feel   162.28512349742448
not so murmured the journalist   178.285511155003
0120m if i took them and were detected i should lose my place which is worth two thousand francs a year   31.978151186432754
as they say in my country   172.42086926531206
true said he and i have some questions sufficiently serious to put to you   146.06529599672086
chapter lxvi   137.15492317996052
to him who is called the comte de la fere   134.33351482910618
so i have a little adventure to propose to you when the count is gone   110.37326399405464
speak monsieur speak said d artagnan who instinctively scented something advantageous   151.19938784264698
alas how gladly would i exchange the half of this wealth for the happiness of at least sharing my father s love   90.42585253312517
this man is scarcely five   126.32403764900043
d artagnan made all these remarks with the rapidity of a most minute observer and doubtless from an instinctive feeling that this stranger was destined to have a great influence over his future life   51.36097181724148
and if you wished to die you would choose this death count   93.22960767546444
to call for monsieur le coadjuteur   99.81060327607199
meanwhile do you know where the duchesse de chevreuse and the duke of buckingham are now concealed   94.41164060225725
i had the honor of saying to your eminence that there had been some mistake   146.16411418204865
of what use to day   126.04874372746393
to see him so self satisfied reconciles me with myself   99.97221012364771
generously   128.81232479762642
la ramee entered   165.41049180828998
but the connection will be seen by others and therefore i will have the article contradicted   88.40859866285122
leave me   95.44588215327312
he gave me a sign in the affirmative   187.32974758246246
no   141.89757544123486
they said a quarter of an hour   128.0592422427858
cried milady in her turn   158.26482731188665
i was forced to go out of my road to obtain some information near nîmes so that i was somewhat late and therefore i did not choose to stop   202.45150310754332
my dear m   145.04247158988912
stuart bradshaw was saying listen to the roll call of your judges and address to the court any observations you may have to make   213.74204138876127
this is a kind of usury banker that i do not understand   134.64723479969086
because i sigh when thinking of someone i am leaving   37.87784788742108
athos   105.86477346577212
then said raoul this monsieur scarron is a poet   150.23892557805777
ten minutes afterwards villefort reached his hotel ordered horses to be ready in two hours and asked to have his breakfast brought to him   102.56952837353107
i have no other master but you   41.607064037783886
twelve hours delay was all that was granted that is until nine the next morning   114.8556261243304
it is well   148.078226478093
cried mazarin   99.0818959882819
she is not the less guilty monsieur duke   101.73133308828396
this picturesque attire set him off to great advantage   115.73818926379992
morrel now emerged from his hiding place where he had remained quite unperceived so great had been the general confusion   118.28322364381374
and m   173.92055498207088
she directed her course towards the faubourg saint germain went down the rue mazarine and stopped at the passage du pont neuf   99.11258906181186
the chancellor entered half smiling half blushing   80.48826817342746
morrel said the count have you ever seen me fire a pistol   179.6234020971644
his excellency is not perhaps aware that m   106.63551173510653
he will convey you to a little port where certainly you are not expected and which is ordinarily only frequented by fishermen   162.18427044701428
morcerf alone knew not why such profound attention was given to an orator who was not always listened to with so much complacency   104.08326180444526
and monsters of all shapes and kinds requiring to be overcome ere victory is ours   199.51127324558024
the trial   72.35664374937534
look said he to the procureur whose heart beat so loudly that it might almost be heard here is in this cup some syrup of violets and this decanter contains the remainder of the lemonade of which m   73.1358036655435
he soon arranged a prompt and certain manner of traveling by sending relays of horses to chantilly so that he might be in paris in five or six hours   101.26797128539407
do you then regret nothing   111.4948648735595
yes i admit it   233.32111144341584
our own to be sure the little one louis xiv   62.62132522631741
but we are not equal to the four that you know of   169.09136282606676
be on the qui vive   47.881463125078156
madame where do you keep the poison you generally use   209.43313397599655
a horse stumbles and breaks his knees to the bone   39.65820588010497
lord how i have eaten   116.21481047074228
in the middle of the lid he saw engraved on a silver plate which was still untarnished the arms of the spada family viz   52.87992136138031
he turned round   54.5891348402385
but when will that be   175.1623304821409
what is she doing then   237.0634703807093
cried the executioner   51.502040552765266
i hope it does not exceed she stopped   105.09767952656458
but said villefort who was the first to break the silence i consider that i am the best judge of the propriety of the marriage in question   176.11280953275525
and the more he thought the more entire was his conviction that the person who wore the mantle was no other than his former host and entertainer sinbad the sailor   130.78150700744743
monte cristo watched her with an air so thoughtful and so full of affectionate admiration that she turned back and grasped his hand   107.64250146224927
coquenard wished him all sorts of prosperities   209.97475487935776
the evening arrived   188.19647909388567
meanwhile he cast his eyes over that unfortunate city which contained so much deep misery and so many heroic virtues and recalling the saying of louis xi   174.36386851745556
but as soon as he perceived that the orifice of the barrel was motionless he threw himself upon the ground   2.3274131488378345
you want something   123.66717160225242
you   80.73958851397803
1   74.00739651053055

it is true she speculates with her own money not mine   76.10194046521745
excuse me   90.9691778588671
she is a slave whom i bought at constantinople madame the daughter of a prince   95.80006765990402
de tréville in practice instantly d artagnan directed his course toward the rue des fossoyeurs in order to superintend the packing of his valise   66.36569739187738
morrel you are going to destroy yourself   105.85380933353558
precisely   137.75380062562337
doctor d avrigny said barrois staggering as if he would fall   107.38992859803417
morrel guessed all this   125.2908816311802
he approached the duke took his hand held it for an instant in his own and letting it fall all is useless said he he is dead   199.28696518624267
there were too many unpleasant possibilities associated with the catalans and eight days after the wedding they left marseilles   45.354819734787256
you see said athos   118.04674019271103
no for two hundred thousand francs   168.05507125467358
you must be tired said she to the jeweller   133.48932920799598
well said d artagnan rising we have them friend porthos and even something better   28.78107693855145
do you then believe in god   81.96911372766348
the house was now being searched   93.81194096729836
four persons have been assassinated in the rue st   154.9127078522014
to wait concealed in the neighborhood and assure yourself who are the men who come to ask for you   89.81866221613143
what else have you done   13.874792076528493
now that you are no longer beside me i am afraid every moment of erring   170.94908084839727
why he must be a nabob   85.14610026662172
said mousqueton who had ridden by the side of d artagnan without speaking a word on the journey you may think what you will sir but i can breathe now for the first time since my departure from pierrefonds   218.45669536893445
but to return to what you were saying beauchamp   109.2855210760154
asked the count   145.92499545893082
let us see said aramis how are we to act   102.80296597225518
thank you and god reward you   76.14813844892441
there now m   175.79196429864106
this disposition visible as it was in his majesty did not prevent the courtiers from ranging themselves along his pathway   179.89140580820396
where shall i find the governor   122.54282034898624
the young man was already dressed and was reading a new book by m   128.22311337624575
three poor gentlemen escorted by a prince of the church   188.68148514204478
mazarin was in his study working at a list of pensions and benefices of which he was trying to reduce the number   67.77452809656623
listen count   125.2072034328426
mounted on an excellent horse which he was to leave at the end of twenty leagues in order to take the post planchet set off at a gallop his spirits a little depressed by the triple promise made him by the musketeers but otherwise as light hearted as possible   41.63050897623084
no   163.2940258614716
tomorrow i will see you again to take my leave   204.7269612194716
she appeared much dejected   143.21427078950552
mercédès and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at the door   107.63724188192298
cried the priest with a laugh which made the dying man s hair stand on end   97.57528718393392
we owe nothing to our enemies   110.53094288503998
then listen to me   121.39678638011378
louvieres became very pale and waited impatiently for the officer to explain himself   147.3194714414389
during the last five or six months that this weakness had been felt the worthy procurator had nearly become the slave of his wife   176.34391884835716
better my lord   87.92187329753206
she is in safety in a convent   81.35164817560832
aha   229.42682418320214
cried aramis turning around   151.43120765083074
milady arose as if moved by a powerful spring and her eyes flashed lightning   140.12791164985475
madame de villefort would not believe it and valentine was thunderstruck   70.08149953371068
you have indeed a noble nature edmond and i see by your paleness and agitation what is passing in your heart at this moment   104.80809927651299
as athos and aramis proceeded and passed different companies on the road they became aware that they were arriving near the field of battle   150.8261345563134
cried mordaunt as if disposed to reply at once to the provocation   41.289033232301065
said d artagnan   187.6057852993871
during the recital mazarin entered and glided noiselessly up to the queen to listen   67.51562413981539
where   55.4449492425926
monsieur he carried on a trade which i have always thought satisfactory   118.22467100642413
leave us germain said villefort   196.3726483050482
good   37.3523947834466
you have seven martlets on your arms   117.47904553371711
the same night such a man of regularity was the patron of la jeune amélie the profits were divided and each man had a hundred tuscan livres or about eighty francs   58.56405976257521
have you never heard that queen anne of austria was once saved from the greatest danger ever incurred by a queen   101.44720660573606
and if you are acquitted well by the faith of a gentleman i will kill you at the corner of some wall as i would a mad dog   101.09344852652316
d artagnan turned mechanically looking behind him and between the figures of two soldiers he could see parry standing up and charles leaning on his elbow with his hands clasped and apparently offering a fervent prayer to god   146.63184656306618
monsieur replied bertuccio it leads to the garden   175.82589851479668
i congratulate you   142.9297183295195
he cried   155.41402845499186
it was plain that the small shagreen case which he turned over and over in his hand did not seem to him commensurate in value to the enormous sum which fascinated his gaze   158.5670857654964
but i said d artagnan can go and inform monsieur laporte   27.888089202242924
planchet took the crossroad and by seven o clock in the morning he was at armentières   107.47675461134082
but you do not know this man   55.582236547231695
i never go there   104.17728423280991
the master was to get all this out of leghorn free of duties and land it on the shores of corsica where certain speculators undertook to forward the cargo to france   51.05324772323175
if the marquise will deign to repeat the words i but imperfectly caught i shall be delighted to answer said m   89.84281572240232
said the light horseman drawing from his fob a very handsome watch studded with diamonds   28.233320289261357
silence   143.01327162364467
ah sir exclaimed cocles what can it mean   69.22409998344264
i am waiting my lord till you tell me of what exploits you speak   170.96954221824728
the presence of my daughter and myself in france is already irksome to him   60.336277632788686
that is no impediment sir said she   149.4536016294569
humann section of the indirect contributions corridor a   130.34811040042507

we started a stag of ten branches   94.20595518512508
i have   121.03935935025947
but the gentle voice which usually has such power over me fails to convince me today   141.73874820630365

but do you mean to say you have not heard of this   87.48360973907884
anxious as you may suppose i was to behold and comfort my dear sister i lost no time in hastening to corsica but when i arrived at rogliano i found a house of mourning the consequences of a scene so horrible that the neighbors remember and speak of it to this day   56.573783102124615
i wish to see valentine   175.99353221050112
do you not think with me m   111.50731411798328
bonacieux became as pale as death and grinned a ghastly smile   177.57127402939744
you owe me an explanation and really it is but fair that i should know what circumstance has occurred to deprive my son of your favor   166.10300755243455
he almost immediately got up and took his leave   66.1605586320402
the people threatened to hold him responsible for the evils that hung over them   132.3829566400817
in the place of the palais royal d artagnan saw a sergeant who was drilling six or seven hundred citizens   189.93968330298168
and do you say this wedding is at hand   186.71253213926627
instead of taking the waters of forges i go and take sea waters   49.047458358777206
therefore i do not doubt what you say monsieur athos i do not doubt it for a single instant   73.426721636125
porthos turned aside in order not to show by his honest round face what was passing in his mind   113.54987158113127
said aramis the black points and the red points are visibly enlarging   59.59750003371432

you who love and are beloved   98.58369310531029
raoul trembled lest he should laugh among the rest at madame de chevreuse for whom he entertained deep and genuine sympathy but either instinctively or from affection for the duchess he said everything in her favor   169.20688702580952
which you sir struck twelve times answered raoul smiling   85.8929961382373
i must go thither tonight   86.04805113343667
but go on signing said monte cristo   108.83994773633691

but his person was so admirably shaped and so well proportioned that more than once in his struggles with porthos he had overcome the giant whose physical strength was proverbial among the musketeers   55.756120277965344
yes   188.3925332913525
that i might the sooner see you again my dear father replied the young man   104.47263233525324
at the extremity of the building on the contrary he saw one of the three windows open   222.99900463308052
and with a deep sigh he again sank into the reverie that had been interrupted by mordaunt   166.05224474204152
at every step you encountered dead bodies and bands of murderers who killed plundered and burned   86.89696911547013
in fact i have rarely seen such excess of impudence   158.62398445311618
whilst d artagnan and porthos were engaged in conducting the cardinal to saint germain athos and aramis returned to paris   151.2406390397034

upon the landing leading to the chamber and crouching against the door he found the poor girl all in a tremble   153.9780255697956

raoul was directing his horse toward the unhappy man in danger   193.72689614252306
saying these words the transteverin disappeared down the staircase while his companion muffling his features more closely than before in the folds of his mantle passed almost close to franz and descended to the arena by an outward flight of steps   142.89338171897984
as soon as she perceived him she cried you have promised your protection   177.1110080549003
well well we all say that fifty francs will be enough for us at present and that we will wait for the rest   154.4450152028215

the coadjutor let the storm pass over his head and resumed still with the same tranquillity madame if the opinion i have submitted to you does not please you it is doubtless because you have better counsels to follow   73.11614620395343
i would fain fix the source of it on man that i may no longer vent reproaches upon heaven   3.627808932579967

cried the young man whose agony drawn breath at times when his head went under water under the wave exhaled and made the icy waters bubble   111.07706775793812

never till then had i placed any confidence in presentiments but now i can not help believing them valentine   52.21068069055751
he cried out and staggered against the wall like a drunken man then he hurried to the opening that led from the abbé s cell to his own and said i must be alone to think over all this   230.30115976777097

who told you that   124.60694837584121
he described the death of the other soldier and the perils they had encountered   142.9221287704106
it is he   83.55009110184974

noirtier did not love his child and yet he sleeps   127.60424345121257
and i smile with pity when i reflect that if the names of those gentlemen are unknown to you it is because the queen has forgotten them who ought to have made them the first noblemen of the realm   145.88690385867258
he was my friend he had no secrets from me and if this had been so he would have confided in me   160.22592615284984
cried madame danglars a man may murder another out of revenge but he would not deliberately drown a child   83.33026888482755

without doubt porthos had reasons for not abandoning this part of his vestments for instead of quitting his hold on the flap in his hand he pulled it toward him so that d artagnan rolled himself up in the velvet by a movement of rotation explained by the persistency of porthos   178.45174478810162

he took pity on these poor animals and went to a corner of the stable where he saw a little straw but in doing so he struck his foot against a human body which uttered a cry and arose on its knees rubbing its eyes   25.47830944557967
but to this hireling valentine only appeared to sleep   33.75899309423572
what sort of a man is he   133.9954827651476

he married a woman who keeps a confectioner s shop in the rue des lombards for he s a lad who was always fond of sweetmeats   142.15296414995024
then he disappeared after throwing a farewell glance on valentine who slept with the confidence and innocence of an angel at the feet of the lord   146.08995025177157

i had sworn to die of hunger rather than part with these precious pledges   106.17972570838093
the sound of a kiss was heard and valentine fled through the avenue   213.83029228170426
villefort sprang into the room ran to valentine and took her in his arms   145.1218628738296
noirtier s face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble while on the contrary villefort s eye was endeavoring to penetrate into the inmost recesses of the old man s heart   131.03021886594865
and that it was owing to you that he was very nearly being damned eternally for remaining a musketeer whilst all the time his true vocation was the church   23.9358159916178
my mother is only astonished that you remain so long unsolved   136.43807598427068
ah indeed   86.59466031705792
the air i breathe is the air of liberty   184.1476882389481
twice the count left the ranks to see whether the object of his interest had any concealed weapon beneath his clothes   182.4360720975585

in one of the despatches the cardinal declares to the queen that the treasury is empty and that her majesty has no more money   165.1109497206768

on reaching the pont neuf the coadjutor found it strictly guarded and a man approached him   152.10038332788335
thank you thank you murmured she   148.52655644778378
you can understand honored and dear guardian how precious and indispensable to me is the remembrance of the years that i have passed with you   230.44509020105312
d artagnan in order that there might be no time lost had saddled his horse himself   136.5941105494786
at the moment when he was about to retire she was cheered with a ray of hope for she thought he was about to speak   184.12089927216317
return emmanuel to your charming wife and present my best compliments to her   40.62877521715416
this first sound or rather this first grinding was followed by a second then a third   56.788884902058726
but he stopped on the landing   80.65199089064423
as for me i will fly only on condition that we all fly together   66.760631589523
the town is in open revolt and just now as i was crossing the rue montorgueil with monsieur du vallon who is here and is your humble servant they wanted in spite of my uniform or perhaps because of my uniform to make us cry long live broussel   59.93510318446296
i must divert my attention   231.32278366442804
now in the opinion of d artagnan it was certainly the man in the black cloak who had carried off mme   147.04192061467262
every one was full of curiosity as to who that unknown executioner could be who presented himself so opportunely to assure to the people the promised spectacle when the people believed it had been postponed until the following day   140.5151653909176
and unless a man be endowed with that admirable instinct which causes louis xiii   79.2610217911586
returned d artagnan   83.15456008943012
he will meet you   205.1709632343032
albert turned away his head with a sigh and went to his own apartments   202.96888498379238
immediately replied d artagnan   165.39930553086285
the blows which he received increased greatly his esteem and friendship for monsieur de tréville   158.04443354273647
asked this person   152.40301972270834
cried mercédès   117.05618467541963
but that will compromise me sadly you know   190.90850302916337
but at all events i gave him absolution in articulo mortis   190.81838589599556
madame replied valentine he has not even breakfasted   81.53407837200166
insolent wretch   113.14029853606854
it is for that reason you see me so early   186.02667922047348
then with a promptitude which indicated that this was not the first time she had amused herself by adopting the garb of the opposite sex eugénie drew on the boots and pantaloons tied her cravat buttoned her waistcoat up to the throat and put on a coat which admirably fitted her beautiful figure   112.75907810983301
the pope awaited him   160.3689429365479

he invited me to a hunting party on his property in the month of september 1646   95.5863171097481
now if your mistress is not dead if it is she we have just seen you will meet with her again some day or other   131.64779860967235
the coadjutor threw a piece of money into the hat which was on the ground   97.72313757974649
the young man pressed her to his heart   192.43135830951695

this was divided into three compartments one which was covered by the floor of that room in which athos porthos and aramis were to pass the night   89.35917334849734
that evening milady was still more impatient than on the preceding evening   213.13078467598132
you know not the subject of their conversation   46.040146974599025
he went straight to the queen and in an altered voice said why madame have you not thought proper to wear your diamond studs when you know it would give me so much gratification   99.17691710819618
the count by any opening from the bedroom or by concealing himself in the dressing room would be able to defend his property himself   74.15395301567338
yes replied the angry look   52.57968956426734
a more than deathlike silence then reigned in the house   21.941442975582206
willingly my lord   167.70924267967484
this gun had an excellent barrel made at brescia and carrying a ball with the precision of an english rifle   161.34587924083394
on opening the door villefort found himself facing him and the young magistrate s first impulse was to pause   82.11038712931092
exactly my daughter   117.24700547381383
without a blush men made their way in the world by the means of women blushing   85.2966065429398
then too when alone i can call forth mighty pictures of the past see vast horizons bounded only by the towering mountains of pindus and olympus   215.06357335333715
at this moment mazarin became very uneasy at the turn which the letter was taking and paused to glance under his eyes at the young man   31.036261416204425
he is an original then   39.93637578866391
he saw overhead a black and tempestuous sky across which the wind was driving clouds that occasionally suffered a twinkling star to appear   32.65097413670543
yes yes when the campaign is over replied the gascon   204.70813914857735
i think the only chance of saving your majesty has just been proposed by monsieur d herblay   209.68597805185664
in consequence of this feeling of repugnance he was about to pass without speaking to him but as he had done the day before m   104.83006821614703
ah that is a good joke   97.55042291437594
but with all that he outstripped ariel and barbare against whom he ran by at least three whole lengths   161.02471952845264
to be sure   117.75876971993283
today is the 29th of august   200.20103219231996
well transfer it to me at the price it cost you   151.50351899745297
de morcerf interrupted morrel   146.4132725289684
and you responded to his bidding you imprudent man   113.33746905989594
but as for the carriage what as to the carriage   196.69505781024958
amen   138.86105864610371
athos porthos and aramis instantly drew near one another while jussac drew up his soldiers   137.09876081979257
sire said villefort your majesty mistakes   57.94264890336499
the king as we have said was to follow as soon as his bed of justice had been held   172.104369264635
the handkerchief was thrown down and the iron heeled shoe replaced on the foot of the wretch to whom it belonged   157.3692213832465
my leave is at an end   109.33425975503758
at the sight of this slaughter and devastation i became terrified not for myself for i a simple corsican fisherman had nothing to fear   83.03948249784597
no replied morrel   202.82132524561547
you believe so   110.87675465747576
fernand was enrolled in the active army went to the frontier with his regiment and was at the battle of ligny   107.43107920751488
teresa returned it all this with the consent of the chief who was in the carriage   52.250089741166505
it seems said d artagnan that whilst i thought i was coming to noisy i have entered without suspecting it into the kingdom of mysteries   178.15901660958002
fearing however to make use of any valuable piece of paper i hesitated for a moment then recollected that i had seen in the famous breviary which was on the table beside me an old paper quite yellow with age and which had served as a marker for centuries kept there by the request of the heirs   20.115431689859435
asked d artagnan   146.62075042214886
f   157.3734006945592
devil s coachman   154.07931671090972
culpable at the most of weakness how cruelly punished by his subjects   190.96837214154877
justice is done said porthos wiping his forehead   174.68290749259674
such learning is very rare among ladies   210.6848322648347
bonacieux accosted him   121.44997127382582
i will do anything you desire except relinquish my determination of finding out who this man is   100.91206474043086
20222m it was   94.15500305408112
keep the commission   102.07410072152916
it was on another   114.95410007616604
cap de diou   260.43498390568107
he saw that he was on the highest point of the island a statue on this vast pedestal of granite nothing human appearing in sight while the blue ocean beat against the base of the island and covered it with a fringe of foam   48.14957882294733
till then then   153.0558799836064
but surely you are monsieur d artagnan   6.542327009816859
you think so   131.85199862668821
to day look around you and it may astonish you that in order to accomplish a plan which is dearer to me than life i have only lord de winter the friend of twenty years and you gentlemen whom i see for the first time and whom i know but as my countrymen   183.0010767416632
d artagnan fought three times with rochefort and wounded him three times   137.37269920524062
his recital finished the abbé reflected long and earnestly   88.79678196305436
it is closed after them and they are arrested   139.364466534344
there they are   153.958182090675
upon the gospel said d artagnan throwing himself down by the dying man i swear to you that the wine was poisoned and that i was going to drink of it as you did   110.42717500619139
the other ten were sunk three hundred fathoms deep into the sea   101.22264377368191
he had seen in his province that land in which heads become so easily heated a few of the preliminaries of duels   71.7526194293095
gentlemen interrupted albert i think you did not understand that something very serious had passed between m   70.4219894891038
d artagnan seeing athos rise did likewise took his arm and went out   81.92680964776567
constance constance   149.87425554469516
thank you parry   264.64205633761213
what next madame   105.82608408448958
athos you have done wrong   115.85080488147099
he almost believed in the tenderness of milady   184.43135007406437
in which m   107.54046497270976
oh yes i do indeed repent   123.33912881900463
no we shall beat them by merely temporizing   130.37091278958297
was he awake or was it but a dream   114.0171079844786
at the sound of the fireworks the carriages instantly broke ranks and retired by the adjacent streets   232.74621416669027
the gascon and the italian   94.63267373164966
the doctor had put him on a diet   200.57562356003305
but the walls were solid rock a man was sitting reading at the only outlet to the cell and behind that man shapes armed with guns continually passed   100.13396218913098
curiosity that is a terrible word   90.85762008764905
porthos said d artagnan if you can still speak say a word my dear porthos to this good planchet   141.8817053305031
as he spoke the abbé took the diamond from his pocket and giving it to caderousse said here my friend take this diamond it is yours   142.3232032108167
the ghost of samuel appeared to saul and it is an article of faith that i should be very sorry to see any doubt thrown upon porthos   36.525600041732815
the hand of your time piece will not be more accurate in marking the time than myself   157.8460796374299
but where is louise   76.67578503571858
gutenberg   138.02695558233415
yes if you will not consent to retract that infamous calumny   91.79872084913461
the queen immediately exhibited strong emotion   138.8381258868768
and will he talk thus of affairs in presence of two strangers   49.617103770369226
but melancholy interrupted master edward snatching the feathers out of the tail of a splendid paroquet that was screaming on its gilded perch in order to make a plume for his hat   135.35570090018626
that happened as i told you in 1829   167.58639366881127
is that not true monsieur bonacieux   167.11173759166172
oh nothing but that he might get me out of this if he were favorably inclined to me   168.48219263995813
he made that quarter of a league in four or five minutes   190.97116535920864
you understand that you are in no way obliged to go with me   87.97151366161742
i bought it from him but it belongs to d artagnan   121.80320131125401
in another hour every light in the house was extinguished and it might have been thought that all its inmates slept   102.58307252844294
there was so much firmness in the look which gave this answer no one could at any rate doubt his will if they did his power   173.33986731505138
on the contrary that time was most favorable for us smugglers but for my brother a soldier of the empire returning from the army of the loire with his uniform and his epaulets there was everything to apprehend   106.91302295066254
whether success rendered us imprudent or whether we were betrayed i know not   50.77771488384195
he had the fiery eyes that seem to penetrate to the very soul and the haughty and disdainful upper lip that gives to the words it utters a peculiar character that impresses them on the minds of those to whom they are addressed   61.78173525589852
some grew rich and some were ruined   167.7051623758303
two hours and a quarter that is nothing   103.04455569474969
and indeed the little note and pin upon the table confirmed or rather corroborated the sad truth   115.2757557307989
calm and resolute he treated any peril as he would an adversary in a duel calculated its probable method of approach   40.53438027277937
asked the abbé   207.94689751779558
he added putting his lantern on one of the casks   126.98620356718818
he asked coldly   120.17347492818998
i will accompany you   11.216275583934419
what do you mean by that question   228.09499113080227
no but by browsing the shrubs and trees that grow out of the crevices of the rocks   27.355710292042588
felton said milady with a solemnity full of melancholy imagine that your sister the daughter of your father speaks to you   170.0617418539516
excellent   67.22704334004737
but on the contrary the particulars which are given prove that fernand mondego raised by ali pasha to the rank of governor general is no other than count fernand of morcerf   64.85167659061423
certainly i will do so said the young man with a quickness which gave proof of his ready invention   133.8789709007366
i was not rich   55.672824446840394
the doctor without shaking hands with villefort without adding a word to what he had said went out amid the tears and lamentations of the whole household   158.95020141601003
i have been told said the count that you do not always yourselves understand the signals you repeat   80.44184974495118
and here is danglars who is a wide awake clever deep fellow who will prove to you that you are wrong   105.73064496263432
mazarin was by degrees recovering his senses   87.53152809978774
he would fain have gazed upon his gold and yet he had not strength enough   127.74402589043555
said d artagnan   140.66935342264776
what chance brings you here gentlemen   126.34504539052574
de tréville s   77.54260068318754
to the proof   73.2276190883398
follow me said morrel   98.90569539033783
possessed with but one idea he cleared the last four steps with a bound and rushed into the kitchen where he saw the decanter about three parts empty still standing on the waiter where it had been left   125.21998952425842
our host   76.77783206716214
my name has been mentioned to you the comte de la fere   115.3654689081413
i will let you know that directly i have seen m   42.19531576487506
that s unfortunate   147.28900002236605
your note of this morning has completely bewildered me   125.11223671070908
on reflection the procureur was not a merciless man   214.65309179066685
i dragged myself toward the bed to seek the only defense i had left my saving knife   144.0073999223201
well they fastened a thirty six pound ball to his feet and threw him into the sea   77.51417788708186
really   147.76365235961248
and you complain of that   229.35343130211766
they are quite new and have not yet been used   160.65403315404686
and signor luigi vampa such was the name of the chief of these bandits would have scrupulously kept his word   182.8431003313072
poor father   80.36377422061967
his costume was no less elegant than that of teresa   11.429886832213782
the return   167.30436249901538
it is as if you said for example chastity modesty innocence it is a kind of baptismal name as you parisians call it   144.89271710188447
cried luigi and teresa at the same moment   150.4785459268246
still replied porthos   101.91270646388568
dear maximilian interrupted the count listen how adorably duprez is singing that line o mathilde   113.57636747586798
then they came and boasted of their fine exploit in the cabaret of the next village where my brother and i were drinking   93.15669843596987
said bertuccio in so calm a tone and with so steadfast a look that andrea was moved to the very soul   128.50073744854973
this promise of an impotent old man was so strange that instead of being the result of the power of his will it might emanate from enfeebled organs   109.40790508095813
monsieur pailletin if you please my good woman replied andrea   58.45838858103734
mercédès sighed   24.31554604961012
de boville manifested signs of extraordinary admiration   145.11920089832404
but this year continued the horticulturist i ll take care it shall not happen even if i should be forced to sit by the whole night to watch when the strawberries are ripe   4.561475074569188
mordaunt replied grimaud   124.64435726285039
d artagnan alone was calm at least in appearance   54.128005744989096
he had seen château renaud who had promised to be in the orchestra before the curtain was raised   102.78381960198848
but do you think that we ve got them this time   219.23967663443034
asked the president   100.21769644780237
well   43.34581397539368
here you can get anything you want   78.14354301833026
danglars surrounded by deputies and men connected with the revenue was explaining a new theory of taxation which he intended to adopt when the course of events had compelled the government to call him into the ministry   144.72244059748024
lend me your livery till tomorrow   139.8546069412053
ask of me as mayor what is my opinion of m   122.6584255323337
the man who was with caderousse was evidently a stranger to the south of france   124.9853839473674
said the old man he is so much attached to us   126.59422694129748
women of a certain grade are like prosperous grisettes in one respect they seldom return home after twelve o clock   170.5870106103168
the reference is no doubt to the wistaria frutescens   24.022538380841937
is it large   112.99008278820169
he made fruitless efforts to go on   128.9684662233383
nay do not press my hand edmond   164.90390463807134
he might have been executed at that moment without his making a single gesture in his own defense or uttering a cry to implore mercy   138.89992965245116
the scotch   157.69143829340283
let us proceed therefore to the usurper s conversion   166.88837690122418
three nights   56.10951786090956
your brother has been the victim of this   95.8894762409018
you know i am not familiar with the french language which you monsieur le coadjuteur both speak and write so well   118.41923379423015
by an incredible effort of will i even raised myself up but only to sink down again immediately and to fall into the arms of my persecutor   184.02009075206604
oh as for that said danglars angry at this prolongation of the jest as for that you won t get them at all   51.756553072919516
for my part i declare i want two thousand   121.63970072230192
have i not a single friend in the world who will aid me either to live or to die   96.2756667595858
but where did he find it   139.71173757050636
but the easy chair of the old man was heard rolling along the floor and he soon made his appearance in the room   115.43239026138555
i shall obey the wishes of the people   146.27101509290532
16 but i being only a little child was terrified by this undaunted courage which appeared to me both ferocious and senseless and i recoiled with horror from the idea of the frightful death amidst fire and flames which probably awaited us   192.5476430037588
lord de winter and the three musketeers looked at one another inquiringly   72.45683645135522
let us hear   184.2416548907778
the duke de guise killed monsieur de coligny in the place royale and nothing was said of it   77.71211638814606
well if you know them you know that they are good and free companions   158.85305187118223
monseigneur replied athos for amid the general fright he alone had preserved the noble calmness and coolness that never forsook him monseigneur the musketeers when they are not on duty or when their duty is over drink and play at dice and they are certainly superior officers to their lackeys   40.72933958476426
the smile was melancholy   216.81495442258438
see the sneaks come without drum or trumpet   109.55695785498692
and the scotch   109.58113142877694
the best you could have at the present time believe me   121.42352180502922
can not i serve you as a waiting maid   221.46950673912227
we shall descend by the first window in the gallery   186.92903416150932
i will make the journey on purpose to see him if it is worth while   77.91411559770765
with a watch spring one may saw through an iron bar   134.5554423179186
little flirtations perhaps and that s all   101.5704375734009
it would be a still worse affair for mazarin whom he execrated for the greater offences he had committed   103.6564226834592
i hope sir replied the youth smiling that there s no idea of a marriage for me   136.51301907244155
my dear fellow said albert turning to franz here is an admirable adventure   132.67396909285398
d artagnan started   192.1262428498711
she would supplicate him by the remembrance of guilty yet happy days   103.2668853775769
the next day on awaking the count perceived raoul by his bedside   203.87494811179795
stop said d artagnan   107.50055439578576
how so   125.06121155446296
ah said the marquise de saint méran a woman with a stern forbidding eye though still noble and distinguished in appearance despite her fifty years ah these revolutionists who have driven us from those very possessions they afterwards purchased for a mere trifle during the reign of terror would be compelled to own were they here that all true devotion was on our side since we were content to follow the fortunes of a falling monarch while they on the contrary made their fortune by worshipping the rising sun   109.67645965739683
if i call come said he   111.98662595468011
he gave a ball every year at which he appeared for a quarter of an hour only that is to say five and forty minutes less than the king is visible at his balls   77.52967802039956
a considerable number of clowns were assembled and rendered homage to their lord   47.985372559010145
hush   227.07904089687003
in two hours in four in six hours at latest planchet will be here   110.96454200912174
yes which catches the thief in a trap and plays a tune   161.15130268923733
this fresh impertinence reached the ears of the cardinal and alarmed him greatly   123.34300225604099
from the notary m   115.08149139651537
midnight struck slowly and sadly   207.65845276187514
much money to be gained   222.22415257517397
he thought of aramis who without possessing any greater advantages than himself had formerly been the lover of madame de chevreuse who had been to a former court what madame de longueville was in that day   145.12153503471552
yes   116.52762227085472
one thing now is only awanting and that is that our grooms should not keep us waiting   233.72754718704476
asked the latter are you going to be ill just now   83.68185142526937
his opinion of me is altered for the better then   173.04684431877675
in thirteen throws i had lost all in thirteen throws   175.8064550462268
well what have i to do with that   91.7848891437596
there is but one person or rather one cause to whom a man like me can be useful that of the king   85.73556475490898
the mere sound of it filled them with terror   154.1985433908659
he fell asleep again and another vision appeared   81.42484629243569
d artagnan immediately made a step backward and raised his sword   172.53824993457383
but villefort uttered words which even he himself did not believe   144.4357423949845
when he reached the landing he placed the armchair on the floor and rapidly rolled it into valentine s room   168.20395168829356
i think you hailed me mademoiselle julie   112.0763684131256
the coachman received his master s orders and drove down the via del babuino   133.91607668692305
murmured the dying man that they may not separate us if you save me   120.19952686389075
de morcerf   181.3801424983555
de villefort was not only a magistrate he was almost a diplomatist   208.50702029310153
he cried are the prisoners still there   129.4961065473609
leaning against the tree he gazed thoughtfully for a time at the upper stories of the shabby little house   170.08179446845253
vampa in this attire resembled a painting by léopold robert or schnetz   181.1281081763694
it shall be so   215.64500934822226
i swear to you sir should any harm befall me your name will be the last name that i shall utter the remembrance of you my last thought   130.54086459732463
judge not rashly says the gospel replied the cardinal   66.09589639434131
cried the cardinal i thought you were a gascon my friend   60.24395627185019
yes my lord   110.19949849696567
i never like upstarts   142.11923898334834
no gentlemen it seems to be the result of certain propositions which mazarin made last night to the parisians   100.61535457354795
and in the second because he delighted to see a countrywoman take so lively an interest in his success   6.86896395103399
this time he could not blame dantès   54.104674977204866
god he murmured not knowing what he said god god   70.25687536162498
chapter lii   56.455462660837306
sir said villefort upon my word you overcome me   106.42406013686565
i took them home with me with the permission of the guardian and devoured them   30.567161804629094
he recollected the call he had made upon him after the dinner at auteuil and then the visit the abbé had himself paid to his house on the day of valentine s death   118.27377262360952
like a philosopher   99.94806474856655
both got into albert s coupé   168.46151749668005
the sea is the cemetery of the château d if   13.544917216847026
well then it appears that we are the crœsuses of the society   68.8257140708456
in what language would you like me to converse with him   17.17229414149763
0177m what is he doing there   121.65473988697951
milady smiled   73.58426162268532
the voice and gesture of the man who followed danglars ordered him to do the same   170.20843276956015
are you then pressed for this money   25.728638057425357
besides has she not yes sir said the major she has 30127m paid the last debt of nature   217.30148830203774
the stronger reason why it should be sold replied athos   172.68574910129
aramis pleaded as his excuse a commentary upon the eighteenth chapter of st   46.774180949404425
compression is needed to explode gunpowder   70.25732654034296
you are not hurt   116.37622204564845
the queen was ignorant where the mercer s young wife was but had promised to have her sought for   134.95502431094286
take the post chaise which you will find waiting at the porte de gênes as you enter nice   52.30030121563988
hoarse shouts were heard from the excited mob   39.86648534373174
and he related what he had seen watching athos all the while   137.5474430731141
left alone the cardinal seated himself again and wrote a letter which he secured with his special seal   55.4061351179396
fernand do you mean   158.75382372056526
asked franz   171.85333153811996
i shall then be far away   89.74500091051968
he criticised everybody humorously   120.17504973656146
perhaps they can yet save my life   37.69215991251369
sure of himself convinced of his own power certain that the laws which rule other men could not reach him he went straight to the object he aimed at even were this object so elevated and so dazzling that it would have been madness for any other even to have contemplated it   86.34917189239279
time presses   60.85474780543752
but you are not the men to allow sword wounds to be inflicted upon you thus said the cardinal   110.65580398795255
i would offer myself as your surety and friendly adviser said monte cristo did i not possess a moral distrust of my best friends and a sort of inclination to lead others to doubt them too   29.96723926048908
d artagnan bowed to the duke and made his way as quickly as possible to the riverside   209.4999213624814
madame de villefort sighed   71.40197095464477
i am manifestly protected in a most wonderful but most terrible manner said he   190.28080526472104
ah   161.90085164705184
and still further it is very probable i should not have done anything of this if it had not been to make myself agreeable to someone who is my lady as the queen is yours   55.303396869530175
so the invalid disappeared soon afterward and went into his sleeping room   161.52277627890652
if they are arrested they will only be put in the bastile   96.6612727033149
yes   67.08414008006993
is it you   1.3083853367255216
let me blush for the faults you know and perhaps perhaps for even more than those   12.422337631214603
if you like replied the latter   70.17774598283148
one of our party is still wanting   69.87932160587022
and caderousse bowed his head with every sign of real repentance   188.69149625048334
he was in the front row of the crowd admirably placed for seeing   103.52739136167207
did you come here to fetch me   125.83248998909939
conferences   91.7653484986633
in an instant the horse s eyes grew bloodshot and he was white with foam   195.81306881908012
i had a betrothed albert a lovely girl whom i adored and i was bringing to my betrothed a hundred and fifty louis painfully amassed by ceaseless toil   136.02435525067182
the soldier replied that he was and that he had given orders to be informed if the prisoner wished to speak to him   91.83899614542848
very good replied albert   76.56208632620041
i will run then till my legs no longer serve till my heart bursts in my bosom but i will arrive before they do   150.45433549404322
oh then my father has really a very large fortune count   76.94276235624181
thence he once again looked towards morrel who weeping with joy was shaking hands most cordially with all the crowd around him and thanking with a look the unknown benefactor whom he seemed to be seeking in the skies   131.46700516649304
bah   179.2741329703926
you may perceive madame by my uniform that i am an officer in the english navy replied the young man   143.14329056041393
gaetano then exchanged a few words with this man which the traveller did not understand but which evidently concerned him   103.49755292387576
nothing   152.01354497407434
on arriving at the king s private antechamber m   106.01802441765092
they told you then that m   31.24846875932839
at the expiration of ten minutes the clerk returned with a beaming countenance   147.13927747856857
they are approaching said she   127.33402159404105
i tell you he will never return   107.1863804339141
how could i make such a proposition especially to a woman who always professes to be so entirely disinterested   132.79652545138768
that which i found at your feet and replaced in your pocket   40.46453882255308
dandré looked at louis xviii   148.50542423558414
royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation at the address specified in section 4 information about donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation   171.3771451698553
and we are pursuing the duke with the very horses he has just left   30.19657266513748
thanks danglars that will smooth over all difficulties   95.06919704143537
they have rarely been successful   64.50037554359872
you understand then monsieur resumed planchet that if it were for some enterprise like that undertaken against monsieur broussel that you should ask me to take my carbine no don t be alarmed   184.89552573176957
felt instinctively that he ought not to reply to this question the queen having put it in an almost dying voice   39.44929012233713
your wit is always leading you beyond bounds   3.0192909516661786
if i am killed well then mother you can also die and there will be an end of our misfortunes   117.64397031718438
such as the son of a noble house would have   117.05047441778271
tell me is this the moment for a wedding   57.24869946133631
aramis opened the paper and in a voice trembling with hate and vengeance read d artagnan   246.39667215025094
when this was done eugénie opened a drawer of which she kept the key and took from it a wadded violet silk travelling cloak   111.7926041156873
but it was reformed and led again to the charge by the duc de chatillon in person   165.36926270844089
hem replied d artagnan   182.05827616701248
he hastened to cleave his way through them to see if he had not lost his strength   93.62231443431486
well i reply that you shall be served to the height of your wishes and that we shall see each other every day   136.0098241865951
no one ever asked her where she was going   105.49874715909601
is that monsieur   136.22806541291857
andrea cavalcanti with curled hair moustaches in perfect order and white gloves which fitted admirably had entered the courtyard of the banker s house in rue de la chaussée d antin   119.00874768779126
give him the despatch raoul   43.867596490612414
no   161.7602078271612
besides added he lowering his voice and looking with a suppliant air at the cardinal let us give them apparent security   146.1896278373517
i gathered myself up my knife in my hand and when i saw him near me stretching out his arms to find his victim then with the last cry of agony and despair i struck him in the middle of his breast   198.61562647105626
if that s the case said mousqueton with a learned air take some nourishment   98.6849064673981
some day when the world is much older and when mankind will be masters of all the destructive powers in nature to serve for the general good of humanity   134.10978406688554
the king and his escort were no longer there   226.50614840183852
the abbé replaced the large spectacles which covered not only his eyes but his temples and sitting down motioned to his visitor to do the same   79.01278210275326
well you must become a diplomatist   69.10607701695002
my word of honor sir said athos   185.63964371062576
the four friends looked at one another and a cloud came over the brows which but lately had been so cheerful   40.32620071156704
de morcerf entered at the last stroke   34.36435214484629
yes   23.336120890010093
1   111.58333295733077
come   94.33213219676989
but the most fearful spectacle was noirtier being pushed towards the bed his face expressing all his meaning and his eyes supplying the want of every other faculty   76.29565164928226
chapter li   99.18075882306965
at the sight of the little letter the heart of d artagnan bounded for he believed he recognized the handwriting and although he had seen that writing but once the memory of it remained at the bottom of his heart   173.4674304790339
the post chaise was happily bought three days since   103.66411380468443
he was in india with zaccone   138.18933010174166
what did he say   167.48723538224672
but unfortunately every executioner has his assistant his man or whatever you call him   95.23400437099428
planchet said d artagnan i am going out for all day perhaps   107.08083664082812
cried the prince   27.28978633587579
then she suddenly cried oh no no   78.35925914515974
ho there my friend   93.70922668467983
ah madame said villefort you forget that i was obliged to give a mother to my child   172.80710475879386
this portrait attracted the count of monte cristo s attention for he made three rapid steps in the chamber and stopped suddenly before it   164.6450645808829
barrois his features convulsed his eyes suffused with blood and his head thrown back was lying at full length beating the floor with his hands while his legs had become so stiff that they looked as if they would break rather than bend   171.22173375282716
comminges looked up and saw amidst the smoke the threatening face of louvieres appearing at the window of the second floor   144.99391987246332
at this moment there was a tremendous clap of thunder accompanied by a flash of lightning so vivid that it quite eclipsed the light of the lamp   179.64191859012956
he was thunderstruck   114.26064296921818
concerning a court intrigue in the meantime the forty pistoles of king louis xiii   45.667247832701804
you are right i have seen very great spanish nobles whose whole suite were mounted on mules   135.48306041966018
he was dressed in violet tinted velvet trimmed with silk of the same color   29.60704630336994
murmured the voice   154.11196739342196
the devil   136.47648059988288
the place royale   104.52875147885428
repeat it   156.62266505483308
he was of pale complexion with clear blue eyes rather deeply set   120.29082521091112
you do not fear lest he should betray you to the cardinal   87.51457775931004
you know well enough what it is to be unfortunate   190.25729078291624
it is enough   182.70974017453
because he may be tried for it   158.982741769425
he then tried to slip away under pretext of giving orders to some one   56.85151673889767
a moment later madame de villefort entered the drawing room with her little edward   123.38044251486444
1   21.255324999050814
keep the struggle for yourself bear all the suffering but spare her the trial of poverty which must accompany your first efforts   57.30850798923736
why was not m   164.4329589983588
it is impossible said comminges   175.80604720399054
come then   89.49692225034106
are you not aware that we are never seen one without the others and that we are called among the musketeers and the guards at court and in the city athos porthos and aramis or the three inseparables   164.33017595932589
then our gascon extending his arms drew to him the heads of his three friends till they almost touched one another   48.31669032935132
they unfastened the two horses that were waiting at the door leaped upon them buried their spurs in their sides and set off at full gallop   129.92101283088078
cried the young girl   20.572130603914545
never mind said the coadjutor   131.80157030525152
yes   122.70114419816363
begin with me my lord   170.71296991803177
at length he found himself at the foot of a staircase and he mechanically lifted his foot five or six times   24.74473528673994
they ask for broussel and are only too happy if you release him to them to live under your government   74.05880359560332
in the cellar monsieur   213.38526766818467
come take a little oath for me on the cross   86.24444115813606
patrick said the duke bring me the casket in which the diamond studs were kept   81.66444102069616
to this cavalcanti replied by saying that for some time past his son had lived independently of him that he had his own horses and carriages and that not having come together it would not be difficult for them to leave separately   87.11945320140983
the members apprised of the sort of presentation which was to be made that evening were all in attendance   152.4023899544836
then in the long days on board ship when the vessel gliding on with security over the azure sea required no care but the hand of the helmsman thanks to the favorable winds that swelled her sails edmond with a chart in his hand became the instructor of jacopo as the poor abbé faria had been his tutor   94.51911662146135
i ask for no more   163.07658321263725
you told me to hope and i almost did so   206.97122704502925
d artagnan went down and found the carriage at its post and the musketeer on the box   134.29557454468355
andrea cavalcanti the young man in a black coat looking at murillo s madonna   92.27526294301006
for if as i am all but convinced general quesnel who would have been so useful to us at this moment has been murdered his assassins bonapartists or not shall be cruelly punished   8.535573224268731
help   164.20185886840923
eleven o clock sounded   173.15817356344166
and the tremulous voice of dantès surprised in the midst of his happiness struck a sympathetic chord in his own bosom he also was on the point of being married and he was summoned from his own happiness to destroy that of another   63.98464439988007
and do you not think me handsomer so   103.80037979021655
and as i hear everywhere that at the court they are ill disposed to him i wish to warn him that he may be on his guard   138.6071849141876
what is that stupid fellow troubling himself about   168.62931916581982
he purposed only to do all that he could to increase the glory of his name   163.95398133638577
and the guide went out   158.28293582994928
the rencontre   73.34507999475456
who is he   137.8483896718885
it was evident that madame danglars was suffering from that nervous irritability which women frequently can not account for even to themselves   181.54787690363042
never commit such an imprudence as to try to escape except in your dreams   202.32060958253084
the face of the latter became serious when he had cast his eyes upon the paper   197.54001834187488
asked bradshaw of the king   133.64910746764434
that fellow has a decidedly bad countenance said the count in a tone of disgust as he shut up his glass into its ivory case   37.25986783459233
you do not propose anything   153.22500953805408
but he turned visibly pale and ran to his closet trembling all over locked up his gold and jewels in his caskets and put his finest diamonds on his fingers   214.72517117009133
de tréville   193.28517986447474
oh   86.73003796603246
halloo grimaud   213.71594908457166
yes i have said it and i now repeat it our destinies are irrevocably united although we now pursue divergent roads   93.6949657299179
nothing replied aramis nothing   114.12054842810629
here is a glass with one already prepared said villefort entering the room   109.6981380809692
how soon can he be here   221.065144853241
it is a pleasure to work miracles before them   107.26972405424578
how is that   172.30760619213012
like many old houses occupied by a single family the room door was panelled with glass   169.1460267260462
it is not he   131.34347341005738
and he saw again all he had seen before his sleep from sinbad his singular host to ali the mute attendant   180.7342973670675
i purchased mine at constantinople   144.51550147166776
it was not long before they joined the escort   222.96252609925511
well said porthos arrange the table mousqueton and while we breakfast d artagnan will relate to us what has happened to him during the ten days since he left us   186.50748673620961
the scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling clearness   107.80423667939085
bonacieux moved by a double sentiment love and curiosity   54.94424052454539
sir said planchet when he saw d artagnan on the summit of the ladder this way is easy for monsieur aramis and even for you   246.42772992638214
i hear a horse   272.9532911365606
bonacieux   124.63770720699156
accused said the president your name and surname   9.307877839286391
the second floor a house with a balcony   96.18989099492833
present yourself at the wicket of the louvre on the side of the rue de l echelle and ask for germain   127.94984690922051
i propose to defend no one but myself and i shall defend myself vigorously i give you warning   153.7233470018801
no doubt in the subterranean palace gaetano told you of   92.44050244556752
i say you are a miserable creature   93.93568386216464
i could kill an ox with a blow of my fist   45.14638815036933
having passed through the rue du mont blanc guided by the instinct which leads thieves always to take the safest path he found himself at the end of the rue la fayette   39.127511355633445
lord de winter passed before the door without stopping and they heard the noise of his footsteps soon die away   154.00176202584566
i have been sufficiently unjust to believe so   242.07354654077548
where has he gone   117.16008099841075
sire buckingham has been in paris five days and only left this morning   190.1867803546648
did he give you any details   196.73450126106053
now if aramis had been at home when planchet came to his abode he had doubtless hastened to the rue des fossoyeurs and finding nobody there but his other two companions perhaps they would not be able to conceive what all this meant   36.33684114342084
you know what it is to be in love   98.13703904717003
for if you return home safely then then   147.3531403477386
the contract shall not be signed   90.49039463831339
that is to say replied d artagnan that you will wait until i have proved myself worthy of it   171.80160449634792
but as soon as the daylight gained the pre eminence he saw that he was alone with a corpse   180.79627938151287
see that now   97.262063304831
but as the banker had accompanied andrea madame danglars appeared to take no notice of it   131.43499293805948
but you have never told me that you did not love me   117.59173955929367
next milady whose secret i have discovered   148.1662430607871
i did not lose sight of him for an instant   70.1930670004759
and for this very reason said danglars with a smile which he tried to make sardonic i prefer m   200.0656682212118
very well done   121.15323153375475
it had evidently been rolled across the pass by some arm of giant strength   177.34361990161185
a portion of the troops had already arrived and the remainder was expected from moment to moment   93.49612184381908
and yet it has not prevented your sending for me to play me some trick   139.11730675589303
nobody knew   72.85687801739559
can i be so lucky as to find what everybody is seeking for   33.272762738895025
yes   72.781124800566
oh the heartless treacherous scoundrels   66.85188180764285
gentlemen said the queen laughing pray take up your abode in the chateau   125.32759549811942
this sum i have expended upon travelling expenses and and you want money   88.66209344568838
no monsieur jester replied d artagnan   110.9765653975635
the boat approached as near as it could to the shore   66.19276741873469
they had not long to wait for an answer   67.82819625562632
he took with him several of his subordinates and amongst them dantès jailer   194.28098566879632
set your mind at rest replied athos   21.8908676121561
but on our return he said aloud may we that is my friend and i depend on having he his barony and i my promotion   60.18890009777029
hush   98.77279068994235
can copy and distribute it in the united states without permission and without paying copyright royalties   143.53720277596256
monte cristo inclined himself without answering but the gesture might pass for assent   161.08490539288465
when you have cherished a wish and have charged me with its fulfillment have i ever replied it is impossible   122.87302054659017
bonacieux so much happiness is not in store for me   85.1985614160031
this time in spite of my terrors in spite of my agony i began to feel a devouring hunger   170.31672680501003
no   157.40557693852824
he placed the young girl again on the chair her lips were scarcely discernible they were so pale and white as well as her whole face and remained motionless looking at noirtier who appeared to anticipate and commend all he did   30.728264712683142
aramis had discovered the idea the lackeys   95.72467978153233
you know they are never closed   130.76676717875014
jewels diamonds gems   53.48928479439101
my father died but i did not die   178.1471802860492
then d artagnan being alone struck a light and lighted a small bit of tinder mounted his horse and stopped at the door in the midst of the soldiers   180.74241362444045
madame de saint méran two months since   152.86806873637946
very well wait a minute   43.686300012567415
do you mean is he a good comrade   174.79439866526388
and what kind of a man   161.63889034915357
he asked   132.57221991712382
it was likewise an indelicacy   17.060907798562994
be at ease felton said lord de winter   160.110937523263
but buckingham did not even turn his head to see what became of those he had knocked down   186.623658913737
i do not often laugh sir replied the stranger as you may perceive by the expression of my countenance   251.18267210734768
e   157.12287349876456
the other one the gardener s   205.54702009743625
said laporte   134.35947790535755
for owing to the good taste of mercédès one was sure of finding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing or even copying in case of need   133.95006875094822
behold madame   69.69103625368956
milady remained for some minutes in the same position for she thought they might perhaps be examining her through the keyhole   3.365235851916239
but that is not all   184.94640548413167
he related the manner in which he had become acquainted with valentine and how he had loved her and that valentine in her solitude and her misfortune had accepted the offer of his devotion   157.75648715379054
around this shrubbery two alleys like two arms extended right and left and formed a carriage drive from the iron gates to a double portico on every step of which stood a porcelain vase filled with flowers   135.93089712236417
you understand my dear baron that legal methods are the safest in criminal cases   99.57599445026099
grimaud rose   171.6093644091482
he seemed to fulfil the duties of a host by sitting down with his guests and awaited their departure to be served with some strange or more delicate food   130.9601227423243
i ll circulate that saying be assured my dear fellow   96.37010559195477
for another   88.85180248222886
i am to fight today   139.88804915639588
replied the doctor   142.52447617617418
but when it becomes a question of serving the cardinal or of fighting him of being mazarinists or frondists then we are only two   107.29659265297926
you are exaggerating athos   160.9224572243239
really this is frightful   194.41336920327007
did your excellency desire to see me   21.636115198896576
once more farewell my dear sister   115.245530083686
said she   79.2429636092618
imprisonment menaces ill treatment she has suffered everything   75.46420109094643
we shall soon succeed in sending him to join his boon companions   172.63001425450008
porthos called him drunk and the stranger drew his sword   160.98328745408423
yes looked the old man   167.4954618549
eh   168.60330923449098
bravo d artagnan   66.04918741239726
why our lord ruthven the vampire of the salle argentina   26.023786628623085
oh go on monsieur go on   116.17002651693022
but instead of finding sympathy in the eyes of the doctor and his father he only saw an expression as inflexible as that of maximilian   106.99687917380557
i answer   80.78046107583187
albert had himself presided at the arrangement or rather the symmetrical derangement which after coffee the guests at a breakfast of modern days love to contemplate through the vapor that escapes from their mouths and ascends in long and fanciful wreaths to the ceiling   96.32647746420363
besides the harness of your bucephalus and mine   78.75122314378044
asked charles   132.15488030599397
good   110.16342536548453
i saw it in the paper   173.25182086975724
it is a rock of almost conical form which looks as though it had been thrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean   137.30084991938338
oh no monsieur replied monte cristo   43.04340598622255
at this instant the second door opened and the young girl her eyes bathed with tears appeared   19.31910300546086
don t you say dear d artagnan that it is the queen who has made choice of the convent for her   52.006961649273805
porthos was the first to speak   19.776790940791926
they all set off swift as the wind   85.36573655936438
well said the doctor after a moment s silence i will wait   96.6434559661759
as to franz he had no longer any inducement to remain at monte cristo   165.54630449718863
or rather you insult me continued she pressing with her stiffened hands the two arms of her easy chair and raising herself upon her wrists   119.91020703573396
d artagnan looked and was seized with pleasure   99.96049980447341
and she assumed upon sitting up in the armchair a still more graceful and abandoned position than when she reclined   121.1228286846124
you were waiting for horses which were delayed in consequence of the festival   89.58364029088871
now go and tell athos and aramis to stand on each side of the door and clap their hands if they catch him   94.89644945318524
murmured winter his eyes glazed and he allowed his sword to fall to his side   72.89731764288257
speak my friend   180.81571241648987
why cried the queen   142.51345588309252
is monsieur your brother   156.12637570408944
the sitting is adjourned gentlemen said the president   75.54022347960316
you said so yourself   119.20856541574634
oh my god my god cried mme   175.91372302682103
and d artagnan followed by a lackey and traveling with four magnificent horses despite the simplicity of his uniform could not fail to make a sensation   98.20569548440838
noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort because she is going to marry m   137.99301970337248
i am here to petition you too happy should my prayer be favorably heard   145.37709345379037
indeed there was but one porter there to receive them at the gate   115.27622214620355
your interview will be private   32.86425000789025
if she caused his death you said that she caused his death   167.2958988883966
but at the moment he prepared to proceed to his chamber his friend entered the room in perfect costume for the day   135.99973585821994
a confession   58.60110489016373
only i tell you beforehand the carriage will cost you six piastres a day   66.2084639274739
certainly if milady s strength had been equal to her hatred mme   115.89248360739639
monseigneur said he my life is yours   182.2091006803962
no emmanuel i am but a man and your admiration is as unmerited as your words are sacrilegious   172.63117531375434
oh returned she it was a gift of heaven   104.72570231959031
yes   115.87908469814923
the count of monte cristo turned dreadfully pale   58.05664485279675
if only for the sake of m   156.1188388599548
maximilian in his devotedness gazed silently at her   115.74372264355428
the king came out first from his room   197.38698207373167
his mocking laugh and threatening words passed over their heads carried by the breeze until lost in the depths of the horizon   45.64440539108787
we can not say how long the night seemed to milady but d artagnan believed it to be hardly two hours before the daylight peeped through the window blinds and invaded the chamber with its paleness   60.88233617755346
and you too said he come if you like monsieur   186.08261401269266
she cried   121.79673330147531
only this time it was no longer from affectation but from terror   94.38568216636259
exclaimed la ramee   84.53489420458433
answered the prince   59.317034844827745
surrounded i suppose only by clodhoppers with whom you could not associate   27.88525583588067
do you intend to struggle against our ill fortune   40.39911825942781
you all know that i had the fancy of going to africa   180.17233287174773
i remember it said athos   186.8347128621388
and yet notwithstanding he could still hear her cry and threaten   48.205837407938944
2   89.56778698958499
as for franz he remained at florence and after having passed a few days in exploring the paradise of the cascine and spending two or three evenings at the houses of the florentine nobility he took a fancy into his head having already visited corsica the cradle of bonaparte to visit elba the waiting place of napoleon   126.00049512019169
he calls me his dear monsieur said the mercer to himself   63.535694673878304
sir said anne to mazarin with an accent from which daily habits of dissimulation could not entirely chase the real expression see if we can do something for these gentlemen   143.1961352434449
but i guessed what these bundles were and that he sold by degrees what he had to pay for his subsistence   169.3617820517733
as a misfortune necessary to the welfare of england   85.27103169992009
look here said the englishman   105.46557307744548
and i my dear aramis quietly replied athos i think it would only change monsieur de retz s appearance   175.11659922735794
m   120.23970101411281
my god   165.11464876713774
i think that if you would take the trouble of reflecting you could find a way of simplifying the negotiation said franz   183.3929972361176
cried athos and aramis at once   10.58801498578886
your history is quite a romance and the world which delights in romances in yellow covers strangely mistrusts those which are bound in living parchment even though they be gilded like yourself   219.1492880892206
d artagnan tell us what sort of a night you have had and we will describe ours afterward   20.649187273961516
adieu gentlemen said the count   117.47557526023711
it was said athos had met with great crosses in love and that a frightful treachery had forever poisoned the life of this gallant man   66.79594731978307
so suiting the action to the word d artagnan thrust the remnant of his sword into its scabbard picked up his hat and ran down the stairs followed by the others   85.24502065383007
m   147.0547480361854
athos said the musketeer   109.85186924446174
i will not torment you much but only on condition that you become a frondist my young friend and a hearty frondist too   58.330199594241556
the house of thomson french is the only one who from humanity or it may be selfishness it is not for me to read men s hearts has had any pity for me   135.17920606310392
the noble and pure voice of my husband was no longer here to defend me   22.57573119303592
heaven preserve him   128.81544045091167
mercédès   143.4462626350699
and m   131.34024232046121
he put it into his pocket   100.17194872975548
one or two shouts of long live the cardinal saluted his shadow   165.04780963103354
today you serve napoleon and you ought to protect him it is equally your duty   234.60102973409744
cried kitty springing forward to meet her mistress   17.41530897469434
but my dear fellow replied m   61.26843078763775
but the instant your majesty considers me a prejudiced judge i withdraw   139.9811627968702
then he added sign anne i implore you i command you   140.6363802492273
e   174.0358322449527
well   46.71700846788674
d avrigny   153.18258271292046
nevertheless he did return   99.79541698914808
then the castle of saint angelo fired three cannon to indicate that number three had won   150.09769074494307
that i will have a little romance made of it wittily turned with a plan of the garden and portraits of the principal actors in that nocturnal romance   7.433839928659452
a cry of surprise ran through the royal assemblage   145.2975119907965
this tension lessens the accuracy of the aim   160.27892546039223
is it you   53.33098375348466
you are too charming said d artagnan sorrowfully   109.38826883214489
come m   51.04014677454647
i tell you to the left and you are looking to the right   128.8964921039148
directly my father caught the sound of your name he turned round quite hastily and like a poor silly thing i was so persuaded that everyone must be as much affected as myself by the utterance of your name that i was not surprised to see my father start and almost tremble   35.711502824290335
it might be thought that milady timid as women are in general would have interposed in this commencement of mutual provocations in order to prevent the quarrel from going too far   103.83945267227108
certainly replied the officer and left the room   79.70187569178962
that perhaps might not be considered a large sum in paris especially said the count   52.01912691908892
i will not be caught like a fool at a first disclosure by a rendezvous under the clock as they say at the opera balls   160.32458803392515
said the inspector   145.6971736544259
my dear friend all those things i have but i am a hermit in the midst of superfluity   13.074313244050145
noirtier uttered a kind of hoarse rattling sound   50.684920804586895
excellent   128.599545194243
before tomorrow   73.64761684993226
monte cristo raised his eyes but he could not see the heavens   102.62843888721665
to the point sir said the queen to the point and answer me yes or no   196.57590050925387
but i am grateful i swear to you   148.02710538936975
my young vicomte replied scarron i suppose you wish to propose to her an alliance offensive and defensive   152.55587192754348
in after years whether he had forgotten this interchange of presents which ought to have cemented our friendship or whether he did not recollect me he sought to take me but on the contrary it was i who captured him and a dozen of his band   58.60359256138103
to grief succeeded rage   54.344093355586814
i rang for a light but as no one came i determined to find one for myself   95.04413301340817
well then i repeat you are wrong   228.4731584021908
i never heard you mentioned and i did not dare inquire for you   161.949544079929
because your palate his not yet been attuned to the sublimity of the substances it flavors   117.69682015915748
pray signor pastrini asked franz is not some execution appointed to take place today   188.03315786587945
haydée   142.77211084883535
that s true   128.8332823164522
i wish to tell you that though remaining invisible to your eyes i have not lost sight of you   162.7027851515108
this voice made everyone bow before it resembling in its effect the wind passing over a field of wheat by its superior strength forcing every ear to yield obeisance   56.01440945540755
what must i do to attain such sublimity   112.35172276444393
what happened to the worthy captain   57.65905775224272
but poor captain leclere what happened to him   141.4789994576109
you came through meung where something befell you   198.6525705550267
this could only have been accomplished by means of unnatural strength supplied by powerful excitement   47.386876453871594
they had a youth with them   137.62331907032333
and the queen laid her beautiful hand on her bosom   214.14029026068732
is it you aramis   138.68462686251772
don t be afraid you idiot   9.39189267207911
oh no replied monte cristo   114.34977511346757
org   107.42861355617399
said a clear voice which seemed accustomed to command   78.84551832819955
patrick galloped off reached the duke and announced to him in the terms directed that a messenger awaited him   117.11763448346315
de tréville who as we have said were that evening on guard   39.88002360062886
god knows how much i love revere you   93.09148113607799
or richelieu for two of these armchairs adorned with a carved shield on which were engraved the fleur de lis of france on an azure field evidently came from the louvre or at least some royal residence   46.00797686222309
nay dear mother say the accused person   141.69489983657607
said porthos   156.74678340340242
unfortunately he was an honorable man   119.90924107540121
i am a lost and ruined man   53.9259823272067
who goes there   144.9323576725281
the baron came forward   87.93360019706017
the ball was given by the count for the particular pleasure of his daughter carmela whom he adored   221.87563092323495
you think m   117.60197029088047
do you still feel the same feverish impatience of grief which made you start like a wounded lion   137.46245285291732
my lord understands that there can be no supper unless he is allowed to be present   176.90768938996757
no it had just struck four   74.85149475707823
that emetic villefort see if it is coming   116.97548983591265
danglars left last night   110.68232774359595
i did not even draw my sword but i took him who offended me round the body and threw him out of the window   62.46357880909077
we are not on duty and we believed that not being on duty we were at liberty to dispose of our time as we pleased   124.17390438559332
who   76.058120150615
listen   76.18560258260794
d artagnan it is wrong thus to neglect your friends particularly at the moment you are about to leave them for so long a time   128.94806429710974
i can answer positively on that point for the musketeers belong to our forces and monsieur de cambon the substitute for monsieur d artagnan still holds his place   128.46341912939516
to the waters of forges   86.12880057886619
at the first beat porthos rushed out and stood on the other side of the door   141.05509633499528
ah sir   105.41812784240665
will she permit it   91.57297093109517
what   109.98276329188732
he could not do this he whose past life was so short whose present so melancholy and his future so doubtful   87.35270753185625
no athos no you are mistaken said d artagnan   131.0971844280715
indeed maximilian did you hear that   209.8467754505678
mademoiselle was holding flowers in her hand the interesting boy was chasing a beautiful peacock in a garden and you madame were under the trellis of some arbor   194.298828381873
and i did more than that replied morcerf for i caught one   139.2780488318387
good   13.996838399752704
the circumstances are more serious than you perhaps believe   122.3048778096945
yes yes i understand very well ejaculated the baroness   155.94314784048473
well let us see what is to be derived from this gloss   110.91767740823845
yes replied aramis and the sloop out there making ready to sail must be that which is to take us to our destination   161.5012770628573
debray   146.32544510797405
you are fifty five years old   133.20575813640815
asked debray   220.67735302487955
what do you say of this   124.05534965009922
entered the tunnel again drew the bed against the wall returned to the other cell took from the hiding place the needle and thread flung off his rags that they might feel only naked flesh beneath the coarse canvas and getting inside the sack placed himself in the posture in which the dead body had been laid and sewed up the mouth of the sack from the inside   167.374388588479
oh yes monsieur raoul   65.45528026226961
having assassinated a man   174.93243925130633
forty said andrea after a moment s hesitation at the end of which he remembered that he might safely promise   70.96738868876541
d artagnan even fancied he could recognize amid this strange disorder fragments of garments and some bloody spots staining the cloth and the curtains   119.50538020629082
they both listened   73.37201180625698
he was doubtless the first lover and accomplice of the fair lady   103.52027553859068
i consult them when doubtful and if i ever do any good it is due to their beneficent counsels   146.94065129564905
something connected with this story   42.042126537303815
the clerk seized his pen and peppino his beads   136.45883934352588
will go night and day   132.2966250916941
but milady with her ear on the watch had heard the noise d artagnan had made and opening the door said come in   124.13955232589926
said d artagnan   52.670720634460196
this traveling dress will serve to show the cardinal my haste to obey his commands   75.04193746995301
tomorrow flame of my life   121.18762106656617
yes it is   69.82010927330019
madame de villefort was dead   81.97444536738865
murmured the young monk shrinking back and showing on his countenance the feeling of repugnance which his penitent inspired   127.8473515493694
yes added planchet like the famous ass of buridan   103.57485723791072
well i vow i felt exactly the same sensation at sight of that man when he said why do you ask me that   82.67384432485332
to the judge to the judge madame   154.25765867061475
it is very well for you who risk your life every day but for me who only did so once we gather from all this baron that captain morrel saved your life   117.01099216029185
thank you for the compliment my young friend replied aramis we can see from whom you learned courtesy   176.64352329233583
speak speak   114.78211371225477
it was that of la carconte   100.30003832521295
when i say one spoonful i began by one now i take four   63.88380281550127
i never fancied men of his dark ponderous appearance singing with a voice like a woman s   68.76774419409935
but m   82.95954991470636
underneath a lamp in an inn anywhere they ask are you one of the fronde   53.359122696270205
their days were passed in endeavoring to catch all that was said in observing the proceeding of the cardinal and in looking out for all the couriers who arrived   117.0135038844685
do you invent then said fernand impatiently   204.83362699980057
at this moment the four guards appeared at the door of the antechamber but seeing four musketeers standing and their swords by their sides they hesitated about going farther   157.45250918112268
if when on the ship you speak a single word to anyone before the captain permits you the captain will have you thrown into the sea   67.82883630191252
the king signed the order for release and tréville carried it away without delay   95.62650363941866
four of the guards who were constantly near the prisoner assisted in picking up the tennis balls   117.5729023453342
m   76.21286863801632
asked madame danglars   77.93560606534672
now said planchet let us thank the queen   185.9718748930742
enough sir muttered the cardinal you have said enough   170.82339913798936
the count de la fere formerly styled athos   120.92233285680328
in that case they have eaten everything   161.9301168703843
d artagnan said athos this is no joke i trust   230.29559478875763
but if she has good taste oh said monte cristo my fondness may blind me but i assure you i consider morcerf a charming young man who will render your daughter happy and will sooner or later attain a certain amount of distinction and his father s position is good   32.991012552680374
the gascon therefore instead of answering growled out ja   119.59411872273455
asked porthos   4.790570011378094
a lady it was said had just fainted   171.3218711180387
ah indeed   118.98145419619266
then they saw as the felucca turned two other heads peeping those of aramis and grimaud   124.0022106284941
good   161.7739759344495
see   85.52178789504688
at times there passed before me clouds which pressed my brow which veiled my eyes   65.42540336268516
i have never accomplished anything alone said d artagnan shaking his head   122.6913077599262
there are no horses   46.44250649891059
if so depend on it you will be happy   95.63860777152273
madame de villefort who was in very good spirits would neither believe nor think of the misfortune but mademoiselle valentine at the first words guessed the whole truth notwithstanding all the precautions of her father   187.82675121127403
you are right   77.10075123215302
i answered mazarin i shall not sleep at all   83.64168647157362
chapter v   147.3423483630352
said monte cristo compassionately it is a hard blow for a third rate fortune   104.88879714887531
how so   127.30659521569702
and where am i   99.79593734979464
peste   174.46151378856223
in truth madame do you think that can be possible   109.75638821926354
at the same moment whilst d artagnan was leaning over the aperture to listen a metallic sound as if some one was moving a bag of gold struck on his ear   158.0691658960439
asked the doctor eagerly   52.697745060193085
said he reasoning to himself according to the strangely easy morality of that gallant period there is one who will be equipped in good time   66.17952357121925
a newly born infant repeated debray   262.2852391326622
his glance was keen but showed cunning rather than intelligence   146.41453412875975
it is not long ago you see and i was in continual expectation of being called on to deliver up my accounts   129.07748827934287
some parting words to his friends   146.35874425488925
she thanked them both with a smile   161.5541314914529
at the same instant the woman inside drew a second handkerchief from her pocket and exchanged it for that which had just been shown to her   100.20697863324907
this is my counsel our accounts are made up and our bills paid   148.2797536093551
and that she almost wished her father might lose his fortune that she might become an artist like her friend mademoiselle louise d armilly   154.71460167224035
i will go away   166.99888168092224
then they follow you   130.20452331839613
a burst of laughter from the auditors did not in the least disconcert the speaker who continued yes gentlemen   27.329273182085004
bazin entered at that moment carrying a bottle in each hand   51.53610106034252
asked the young girl   133.81071129427158
where are we going   214.73748903530827
she cried   42.08529946035324
then in accordance with his usual custom and judging from experience that few people could hide anything from him when he began to question them fixing his eyes upon them at the same time he thus addressed the messenger you are very young monsieur mordaunt for this difficult task of ambassador in which the oldest diplomatists often fail   163.28225312451892
come that is something   128.42954123612427
she allowed the vessel to pass lorient and brest without repeating her request to the captain who on his part took care not to remind her of it   171.29762362653398
45   130.3217894282876
yes why   50.20155929502867
have you not just rendered him a service that can never be forgotten   108.01148413373164
i will be silent but you must endure your captivity quietly   105.7291674440032
dearest dearest valentine exclaimed he forgive me if i have offended you and forget the words i spoke if they have unwittingly caused you pain   161.66918913612975
but he was never to be found at home   43.26617045307346
at length the escort passed through paris on the twenty third in the night   94.30218365789955
every one turned around and beheld athos livid his eyes dim and his hands trembling supporting himself on the edge of the boat   63.61094662737417
mark s column at venice and on the borders of the arno at florence little imagining at the time that they would be arranged in order within the walls of the château d if   116.05224002356728
half past six o clock has just struck m   114.0974570926571
asked athos   133.399295031038
where are you going marechal   127.00779757829454
oh   135.7930934002061
it is reported your political opinions are extreme said villefort who had never heard anything of the kind but was not sorry to make this inquiry as if it were an accusation   114.17234738227305
your betrothed valentine de villefort   56.40008617308057
and he described to the two nobles the affair exactly as it had passed   144.45733066556733
it is difficult to form an idea of the perfect change that had taken place   43.6706608371032
oh traitors that ye are   126.74862607483199
it is now three years madame since i saw you for the first time and during those three years i have loved you thus   142.29895715106233
though once i confess i envied him his good fortune   58.224306493281084
come take them and monte cristo forced the bank notes into his hand   18.203429393691906
have you really met with some great misfortune   159.04378645642052
i therefore may hesitate between you   175.89957199551952
he saluted and made a movement to depart   59.78578027057644
chapter xxxii   126.67408969035782
the tree forsakes not the flower the flower falls from the tree   153.6218295525838
doubtless she is in her bedroom   165.9329280871334
good it is by my side   210.51162928034222
asked d avrigny   77.76347802870973
and what did he say or rather do   74.95946728175707
and she remained in bed with her eyes fixed   163.52418666359324
mr   195.8293566696562
the name of monte cristo sent an electric shock through the young man on the other side of the iron gate to whom valentine s i am coming was the customary signal of farewell   143.27485087656495
at the end of the second he had ceased to mark the lapse of time   203.96962352545708
this was the last blow to the prisoner   50.3706673882493
a half hour afterward d artagnan returned with the two thousand livres and without having met with any accident   95.03622942948876
athos now descended the ladder in his turn without losing sight of the young man   48.49558468769395
it appears said cromwell that this improvised executioner did his duty remarkably well   90.08364968559043
the queen bit her lips and moved impatiently on her chair   122.34269677501496
my mother has noticed him and he must therefore perforce be remarkable   88.42577451596449
30075m really madame this is a scruple which naturally must occur to a pure mind like yours but which would easily yield before sound reasoning   162.50761701661474
but i what have i in the world   86.74922280477202
we will soon alter our direction   37.9295652874187
said the duke   88.99315883018537
meantime the three friends were standing motionless before the awful sight which d artagnan in raising the shutters had disclosed to them through the narrow opening of the window   117.55373681674467
i am to remain minister then   60.300115104433395
for wherever you see madame herbault you have only to look within a circle of four yards and you will find m   40.31545639891728
it appears to me that this is quite enough   12.395774543194676
i create nothing   125.01664332610504
oh said milady raising herself i defy you to find any tribunal which pronounced that infamous sentence against me   78.01383964165571
no not to you so i am going to tell you where he is   176.7317381243093
lord de winter will now be upon his guard if the letter should reach him   82.79455701013691
bravo cried château renaud   95.11100813609109
but you are dripping my dear fellow   23.064675966084422
fortunately deceived by d artagnan s trick they neglected to reload their guns   88.35339479883689
will you permit me to inquire said madame de villefort as she arose to take her leave whether you usually reside here   171.6254278462584
what   134.40662912106617
i will not marry count andrea cavalcanti   64.13860412725211
and what was his mania   111.9426674438942
i do not understand you sir said the baroness trying to disguise the agitation of her voice and the flush of her face   11.926341671024957
by a chance which added yet more to the intensity of the darkness the moon which was on the wane did not rise until eleven o clock and the streets which the young man traversed were plunged in the deepest obscurity   123.3015635332903
what s the use of mentioning that   107.93326036524486
ings have been made in these caves   131.24966047523284
then he explained to him the cause of his visit and the service he required of him   149.7660655502362
the challenge then continued beauchamp i took advantage of the silence and the darkness to leave the house without being seen   187.78989670014352
they approached the spot where the unfortunate victims lay   43.564575265148704
who told you that   21.714368487457847
mamma mamma said i are we really to be killed   53.13059629130805
chapter iv   117.13016918167848
yes miserable wretch   129.06735188430113
they were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing so legible that dantès could easily read it as well as make out the sense it being in italian a language he as a provençal perfectly understood   111.94171279081706
this boat contained an officer a mate and eight rowers   87.97377647897179
be it so   150.49601314187464
if the emperor remained on the throne gérard required a different alliance to aid his career   121.07102100668966
just then a handsome young man with bright eyes black hair and glossy moustache respectfully bowed to madame de villefort   30.749600674635005
as for the queen furious and left to her own guidance she went for the marechal de la meilleraie and desired him to take as many men as he pleased and to go and see what was the meaning of this pleasantry   131.3885845093566
for when the lower classes alone complained the court of france separated as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of the gentry and the bourgeoisie seldom listened to their voice   61.89314194497879
and which i discovered in the pocket book of the messenger   72.70051726394351
but who will distribute these things   139.41597646361313
the evening at amiens   129.2298969894731
de villefort saw it open before him   155.67230568162822
give her that poison recommending her soul to god and save your honor and your life for it is yours she aims at   54.810177075637164
it is through my grandfather s room   86.41508786651178
oh it s nothing said d artagnan   106.26253606280915
and if they come back fire   158.24346232589642
porthos without reply retreated a second step   193.49821236988652
let one of us put on the dress and mount the king s horse   74.85890078446795
when you arrived madame de saint méran had already been panting for breath some minutes   152.2662772241576
my lord has perhaps no faith in those words   232.39469388282018
devoted men are so rare tréville by the back staircase   212.1014518590705
the count understood him   26.5114512527323
yes but we will talk of it   103.23656080379865
since it is at the same time the opinion of d artagnan and of athos it must be the best   122.64705641873533
i reasoned thus money time and fatigue are nothing compared with the reputation and interests of a whole family   10.327502727682855
you mean to allude to the recollections perpetually revived by these three gentlemen   142.4598278435301
this time the gentleman closed his eyes and fainted   50.263986652503135
yes kill them   157.95017423498211
i say that valentine is dead   168.85397601364033
it is an infernal apparition   4.252452707039609
but a serious minded man deserving all my confidence and charged by me to watch over the south the duke hesitated as he pronounced these words has arrived by post to tell me that a great peril threatens the king and so i hastened to you sire   5.55939181202848
at eight o clock all were in their places and m   201.56635316832876
i am just setting out for blois   132.46466865309517
a cup of chocolate   62.99612838422345
i recognized monsieur d artagnan   246.35813439974754
that s what i mean said andrea endeavoring to smile quite overcome by the strange tranquillity of bertuccio   158.34587583605452
the above mentioned purchase was made on his highness s account whose mandate i had for the sum of four hundred thousand francs   244.05820426288443
still my lord i can t travel on my pay for it is now three months behind   137.9166582527513
cried he   181.7643587719799
this chase was however advantageous to him in one sense for in proportion as the perspiration broke from his forehead his heart began to cool   99.93645459126364
there is only one thing which grieves me observed the major and that is the necessity for my leaving paris so soon   147.04685026768533
he was an annoyance to the cardinal   144.87980741613717
tréville was one of these latter   46.40702279936035
yet replied carlini   163.28329801550453
and may that blood fall back on those who cause it to flow   193.26975817403752
ah replied the duke here i think is one of my servants who is seeking you   233.10400696909394
i will do more than i promise said dantès   65.13419565220605
but d artagnan remained impassible   121.58658702539886
asked lord de winter sternly   195.45582974257565
besides our supper can t delay you much   141.86123617332973
he will enter by this door   144.44003209621496
in fact said mordaunt with a calm voice and immovable countenance a single blow sufficed   90.3810606882454
go young men   25.29151158060148
to morrow morning   57.21037258937954
on my honor they are not poisoned   48.29043902548918
but have you no request to make for yourself mercédès   192.54769515851336
what took place at portsmouth august 23 1628 felton took leave of milady as a brother about to go for a mere walk takes leave of his sister kissing her hand   104.92136020410156
cried the pit in chorus   17.2293825799281
after casting a rapid glance around him in order to assure himself that he was unobserved he entered by the small gate and carefully closing and securing it after him proceeded with a hurried step towards the barrier   223.0418223389263
cause her to lose a hundred thousand francs and that would teach her prudence   64.7277594039901
return to greenwich and bring them here   131.3532254160042
there is no word though it should come from the profoundest depth of my heart that can express my gratitude   191.19987767602726
every evening either in the antechamber the corridor or on the stairs he met the pretty soubrette   127.56019703734225
if he refuse either through interest or ridiculous pride after i have proved to him that he would be forcing my wife from me that valentine loves me and will have no other i will fight with him give him every advantage and i shall kill him or he will kill me   102.60731529344906
yes madame replied the magistrate   52.03717852267299
edmond welcomed the meeting with this fellow who had been one of his own sailors as a sure means of testing the extent of the change which time had worked in his own appearance   169.86655797807808
i must confess that i was mistaken   105.26015241724525
and yet we must be drawing near the disclosure   150.22727192285333
he hurt my shoulder   65.18157766669171
and that is situated   138.44920210677208
you see i am a good sort of a man   136.39765094037637
i spent perhaps an hour in coming from the yard to this place   216.40769685539374
made tréville the captain of his musketeers who were to louis xiii   117.30327661829796
oh ungrateful girl that i am cried valentine sobbing i will give up all even my dear old grandfather whom i had nearly forgotten   142.1828135475136
every one shuddered and there was a moment of silence during which the queen pressed her hand to her side evidently to still the beatings of her heart   107.74225279104124
the explosion would have done what the axe had failed to do   105.76584229508475
the music of william tell is so sweet   131.75439011419095
and with this good feeling drawing near to aramis who was departing without paying any attention to him monsieur said he you will excuse me i hope   20.297121938898115
here i am my friend dear athos   34.15967383484565
he certainly bodes us no good said athos   148.22189515150362
asked mazarin   224.97650511353132
a gascon a match for cupid the evening so impatiently waited for by porthos and by d artagnan at last arrived   92.84648804032055
milady smiled with a strange smile   93.3946828632237
do you then never appear but to act as an escort to death   141.56388973570253
de guise had who so nearly became king of france and whose cousin was emperor of germany   108.6735263320849
said aramis on seeing them arrive   36.82616783111928
with a calm smile and a gentle wave of the hand monte cristo signed to the distracted mother to lay aside her apprehensions   193.41993955260048
and this reputation which he justly enjoys had decided me to confide a secret to him   4.4373064510386655
or camille de bois tracy   131.40330190765746
you may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing access to or distributing project gutenberg™ electronic works provided that • you pay a royalty fee of 20 of the gross profits you derive from the use of project gutenberg™ works calculated using the method you already use to calculate your applicable taxes   82.58903850254079
i think i may aspire to that honor said danglars with a smile which reminded monte cristo of the sickly moons which bad artists are so fond of daubing into their pictures of ruins   119.85307437643802
at the barriere des sergents the procession was obliged to stop   124.8326690248561
asked athos   135.96104169860783
you played very willingly with us without knowing our names said athos by the same token that you won our horses   140.33836142166547
i may sacrifice my soul but what matters it   40.92256622169474
oh it was a touching superstition monsieur and although i did not myself believe it i would not for the world have destroyed my father s faith   109.73159867576209
but delay may ruin our plan sir replied the young man   108.70914404583615
sir said the president rising with gravity be careful what you say   52.423935149613385
as my sole heir   216.18492950584462
we can not fight with such names   110.76714448433034
believe me there are only the two plans i have proposed to you   87.59906991538662
dantès approached the upper rock which now without any support leaned towards the sea   18.00713724115535
the drawing room was lighted up they went in there   104.81164431600985
there s a providence that watches over the deserving   223.71279540377816
but at all events i have two and if you like i will throw with you for one of them   126.44314702483771
although the key was in the door the coadjutor knocked   142.98106553468688
let us go down   97.43672938272022
ah   145.44074903077933
if they should arrest him i know that sometimes prisons afford means of escape will you leave him in prison   212.59739653344042
i wish to tell him replied friquet screaming with all his might that there is a whole regiment of guards coming this way   179.50333428516575
the young man stored in his mind the admonition whilst he admired the delicate tenderness with which it was bestowed   130.01066266742944
we are here   100.37573836546235
what is the use of time rewards of merit medals crosses monthyon prizes if they do not lead society towards more complete perfection   145.52723821702403
the doctor   107.29095552216026
then make yourself quite easy   176.79149492530408
and he placed you in the company of his brother in law monsieur dessessart leaving you to hope that one day or other you should enter the musketeers   174.23869174716273
paris is not paved with cambric   78.7781567459516
the doctors are embalming the corpse and when it is ready it will be placed in a lighted chapel   187.9804225418204
everywhere the last requests of a dying man are sacred   167.16174183962255
approach gentlemen said albert   203.77845439824705
rochefort rendered suspicious and cautious by these words entered the apartment where he found mazarin sitting at the table dressed in his ordinary garb and as one of the prelates of the church his costume being similar to that of the abbés in that day excepting that his scarf and stockings were violet   88.10358375173917
however i hope you will excuse the two or three seconds i am behindhand   83.19608819792529
valentine took maximilian s hand   80.58620980190759
well   135.9750568005937
really sir you must allow that this is most extraordinary said the astonished notary turning to m   168.13628046875357
the description he gave me perfectly corresponds with the features and character of the man before us   165.01142167256336
and she took two or three steps forward   178.55488993350943
a gentleman has but his word and i have given you mine   265.1981775482336
he therefore informed m   191.10530807305267
but for the intention only for the information you must agree is not likely to be at all agreeable   78.26726286320212
yes replied the narrator   23.256668844803244
write a second letter for that clever personage who lives at tours   151.49895585686954
take care madame said the young man coolly you will kill yourself in jumping   218.20561588336318
leave off i command you   67.2918435747221
bazin who was crossing the ante chamber majestically in his clerical dress turned around to see who the impertinent gentleman was who thus addressed him   145.7712285571827
franz felt a shudder run through his veins at observing that the feeling of the duke and the countess was so much in unison with his own personal disquietude   105.93568385099455
there was nothing remarkable in the circumstance of a fragment of granite giving way and falling heavily below   106.09631240521756
drunk as he is he is not much out in what he says   59.88843341413507
exclaimed d artagnan to the two friends you may well wish ill to mazarin   60.74661756974178
the officer entered   125.6676423938101
porthos replied aramis i have had the occasion to observe to you more than once that you are very indiscreet   114.38240211942423
well don t be alarmed if i return at one two or three o clock in the morning   69.46651438832293
who goes there   15.482260921100576
certainly   29.402752840019517
it was a gilt table supported on lions claws   117.90800012251164
this way light us downstairs bernouin   178.7812882060955
it is not sufficient as in italy to go to the priest and say we love each other and want you to marry us   132.09524145860738
first love is accompanied by such excessive joy that unless the joy be allowed to overflow it will stifle you   198.74335039811137
to morrow evening if you like   196.11628480808284
what though she has lost her own mother at a tender age she has had the happiness to find a second mother in madame de villefort   104.32790432384502
it has been made up a long time said gondy   198.69341127189023
seven or eight leagues at the most   106.17094856583014
good so much the better said caderousse his eyes sparkling with avarice   146.78334593873822
grimaud speaks   87.8372415419474
a quiet conscience does not occasion such paleness in the cheeks and such fever in the hands of a man   101.74165082931304
my name must rest unknown replied franz   124.29008051659292
well   55.61850291723859
monsieur d artagnan   119.73425133075634
no   323.20114322438167
other footsteps going and coming were now heard and a moment afterwards the noise of rustling canvas reached dantès ears the bed creaked and the heavy footfall of a man who lifts a weight sounded on the floor   201.99830094159583
yes caderousse you have seen me   9.884671247744237
ah monsieur interrupted aramis permit me to observe to you that you have not acted in this affair as a gallant man ought   173.64596259202534
but it seemed that the history which the inspector had related interested him greatly for after having perused the first documents he turned over the leaves until he reached the deposition respecting edmond dantès   146.7427170935783
the latter bent on his knee and kissed it   260.3224792679718
caderousse was thoughtful for a moment   41.44325817368774
the answer pleased him and he laughed   115.28495463094528
the former found guilty of the murder of a venerable and exemplary priest named don césar torlini canon of the church of st   117.72445295725258
duc de beaufort amused his leisure hours in the donjon of vincennes   92.42729860306669
answered a solemn and imperious voice accompanied by a menacing gesture   127.76337638302624
athos was standing before the door enveloped in his cloak with his hat pulled down over his eyes   130.23293716123987
yes   176.64821425159482
i have promised you the truth   150.43438614064846
remain then sir   64.15624469675028
there is still hope   75.61720628918022
that other ball contains a letter   161.5688769426556
no   124.12529526609701
then when all was over they went away leaving the house empty and exposed   13.773518243969662
i should have thought the continual failures you have met with in all your own love affairs might have taught you better by this time   100.92857877491682
high cheek bones a sign of sagacity   101.60966698503748
porthos turned to look at his sword which was hanging on the wall   197.98288003676322
act prudently   5.269886072635572
morrel looked at monte cristo with astonishment   126.85825130758988
and it has staggered everybody   157.02020852807487
madame de villefort stretched out her hand to ring intending to direct her waiting maid to the spot where she would find valentine when the young lady herself entered the apartment   142.41275978661537
in one hand she held her handkerchief with which she appeared to be wiping her face and in the other a bottle of english smelling salts   190.21236072361205
no it was somewhere away from here it was i do not know but it appears that this recollection is connected with a lovely sky and some religious fête   85.67917910100104
a family affair concerned nobody   92.67410566072859
but still to speak to a man even though mute was something   141.18396252904898
i am lieutenant in his majesty s musketeers said d artagnan and consequently your superior in everything   150.26816479217612
but for the honor of the king of the queen   197.83089261710532
but it wore the same wild barren aspect when seen by the rays of the morning sun which it had done when surveyed by the fading glimmer of eve   119.61676910506179
monte cristo shook it coldly according to his invariable practice   150.0965543015756
my brother had arrived the previous evening at nîmes and at the very door of the house where he was about to demand hospitality he had been assassinated   71.2585297246633
the count in taking leave of him said something in a low voice to which he answered willingly count   69.29471587292862
you see felton the drama has gone through all the phases i named   153.328757623611
danglars therefore concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the illustrious descendant of the cavalcanti who most likely in lucca fed upon trout brought from switzerland and lobsters sent from england by the same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from lake fusaro and the sterlet from the volga   71.71708502789002
they deposited the supposed corpse on the bier   128.8498682799845
she had one hope which was that felton would appear at the breakfast hour   127.13035242023857
and shrugging his shoulders with unaffected contempt he passed on   13.688169618432582
gentlemen said aramis decidedly it is a night for meetings   85.2160563065785
will you be good enough to explain your meaning   83.67940323595977
nothing will ever go well with us hereafter   83.07781151589518
there is no gainsaying the fact that a very unfavorable construction would have been put upon the circumstance if the two women had gone without escort while the addition of a third in the person of her mother s admitted lover enabled mademoiselle danglars to defy malice and ill nature   111.37825105067016
to make us between now and tomorrow two roman peasant costumes returned albert   91.4318068498106
for two reasons   113.18524742714263
but said monte cristo do you not know any cause for this hatred   107.71398755041486
i have brought her here sir and i have deposited her in charge of charlotte who till better advice comes has bathed the foot in cold well water   132.2802945227345
battle   160.62982322254507
the cardinal therefore got up perfumed himself dressed and went to the queen to tell her what had detained him   79.3978470382525
an instant after the guardsman descended in his turn   168.53830151073797
ideas were but the germ the plan was reality   105.17633967996505
by the countess s visiting the colosseum as we did last night by moonlight and nearly alone   138.8449554904142
one of marie michon s adventures   67.82383137019971
assassin assassin assassin you have still on your brow your master s blood   130.84850839527613
yes since she lives   39.40620721019283
pray tell me what you think baron for i feel uneasy i can assure you having some considerable property in their hands   89.72222837929652
the marquis of saint méran   150.52335426034298
the two young men bowed and separated aramis ascending the street which led to the luxembourg while d artagnan perceiving the appointed hour was approaching took the road to the carmes deschaux saying to himself decidedly i can t draw back   21.201413981745247
he said respectfully   49.57423526810149
and that particularly at this period the compatriots of d artagnan had the reputation of not being easily intimidated   185.88667339457533
i thought i was right in believing that cavalcanti to be a stingy fellow   94.51029686777161
stay said debray   31.526428591084013
and the latter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious and sanguinary bandit luigi vampa and his band   135.45550478777008
now begone said the count pointing to the window   143.28517942531113
come quick quick   148.34287825988744
you must make some reformation in that quarter   58.43017954887259
undoubtedly   118.4742627653782
interrogate me i entreat you   159.7669427494743
this movement revealed the spot where winter s body had fallen   231.2370626242033
he left paris more than six weeks ago and is believed to have gone on a mission to england   181.14903049047837
he no longer loved her   234.1992573317737
half past seven   221.01767116964453
i ve still two pistols charged   155.99204031770105
while yet young unfortunately handsome i was dragged into a snare   83.02645605090895
yes   115.50897462270872
twenty pistoles on one throw only one the last   104.09531015839511
at them   148.76233196474078
why did you not hear all we said   99.98811212580702
a man is not privileged in all ways said d artagnan   184.23892250163306
athos is near you said d artagnan   143.80075167815536
bonacieux with some embarrassment the cause of this event   87.53559887559466
and i caught it mamma don t you remember   161.35079117436212
cried porthos and aramis in a breath   92.1328475387644
ah   38.228030423587484
monte cristo pressed on that pure beautiful forehead a kiss which made two hearts throb at once the one violently the other secretly   106.16833162049522
very well monsieur   13.180799299289063
there s nothing in the wake of the ship   99.71588453680116
indeed i did   101.18985398515875
she had been standing at the door to prevent his going out without seeing her until sleep which the young can not resist had overpowered her frame wearied as she was with watching   83.34602644034501
sir when you have told me to obey an order did i ever answer let me see that order   138.79930393452682
it was past midnight   187.25782911557855
yes how do you know it   75.11606135030031
there can be no longer any doubt but that it is himself said he   57.18354304024724
the curtain was drawn and yet the image of his father was so vivid to his mind that he addressed the closed window as though it had been open and as if through the opening he had beheld the menacing old man   138.73325424376873
said the count   77.96026065507283
asked the king in a severe tone   53.28684282714438
it was then in the silence of night in the dim light shed from the alabaster lamp on the chimney piece that she saw the shadows pass and repass which hover over the bed of sickness and fan the fever with their trembling wings   219.56763857408288
besides here s the end of the cable   61.993767462378905
my misgivings had been but too true   86.68106119330884
what more need be said   17.209946857988427
but it appears to me that my guards mine are also his majesty s guards   122.56602738036483
he said   83.24001130002594
i did not mean to say silence silence   79.16191384804902
he was luxuriously stretched in a good english calash with double springs   47.72312810658768
is it not the desire of seeing a husband again from whom you have been separated for a week   78.34111343776294
it was m   50.435410338600775
he cried what bad stabling for my horses here   109.9198712792587
do you not form a very rash judgment emmanuel   151.67095446694452
help me lend me your assistance   40.18626525485311
no replied the latter   112.16553821998741
milady was about to cry out immediately but she reflected that such precipitation would not be very gracious toward d artagnan   88.13759337971754
i made them but you know my dear friend madame du vallon porthos in pronouncing these words seemed to gulp down something   197.58527645287137
grimaud intimated by a scarcely perceptible nod that he should consent   55.4168685155668
danglars is a money lover and those who love money you know think too much of what they risk to be easily induced to fight a duel   153.25466292830293
and indeed for a man in andrea s situation an arrest meant the assizes trial and death death without mercy or delay   105.22900763067082
at length they reached the tent lit a lamp and while planchet stood at the entrance that the four friends might not be surprised d artagnan with a trembling hand broke the seal and opened the so anxiously expected letter   126.7621927640382
yes if we are better mounted than he   111.47525723237668
tomorrow   26.08654672015939
let us go to rueil said athos   123.0837827986916
come beauchamp said château renaud i will bet anything you do not believe a word of all you have been telling us   59.86205515998835
through the open door was visible a portion of the boudoir containing an upright piano and a blue satin couch   181.25014307288953
and the man after throwing two or three silver pieces at the foot of mine host galloped after his master   130.8608419652621
then he took the boy upon his knee   90.81044518127455
noirtier did not move   186.16494940336213
ten years and five as a supernumerary make fifteen   148.75839719876114
so dressed he really appeared the first gentleman of his kingdom   154.69464164295678
each word fell like a dagger on morcerf and deprived him of a portion of his energy   75.53803486921348
in fact we must not dissemble that the oscillation of the tall trees and the reflection of the moon in the dark underwood gave him serious uneasiness   109.82692296217135
that is to the purpose   53.36063810571393
but do not be uneasy   111.36685437029548
haydée scarcely had the count s horses cleared the angle of the boulevard when albert turning towards the count burst into a loud fit of laughter much too loud in fact not to give the idea of its being rather forced and unnatural   124.40562428596282
having in a few words thanked the district doctor he turned to d avrigny and said and now the priest   68.94111961956668
and madame danglars four   115.48266664156671
yes very well   21.185010137496704
he was occupied with the preparations for raoul s departure and was seeking to gain time   111.24004370510093
said porthos   50.52086501827621
then he had eaten some without saying a word more   69.00467880575937
art thou an angel or a demon   56.01328555634313
there was a dispute among the guards   89.06011014449125
i see they kept their promise   179.40234511945005
the king   194.42822609655303
often killing others but then certain of not rotting in prison m   118.40847014295653
at each cross path was an orchestra and tables spread with refreshments   113.8278151114845
a prisoner   86.29125295132513
mazarin clever politician as he was was for once mistaken   102.52739630352184
said he   105.14569133143482
but we were not captured by fair means   142.1037400013777
there they are coming out   53.291313429734416
if i had had a single ornament left i should have bought wood this winter to make a fire for my daughter and myself   127.99868179063009
and do you command nothing in your own name   105.7637150959462
her mouth which might have been found fault with as too large displayed teeth of pearly whiteness rendered still more conspicuous by the brilliant carmine of her lips contrasting vividly with her naturally pale complexion   124.80153670260779
thou wilt knell out damnation to my mission otherwise   126.26783506776823
oh monsieur i thank you with all my heart   105.9885202321628
chapter xxxix   166.32539862439086
i never returned to the country where she lived   149.68203776934163
one word more sir   162.09444845746992
her fine blue eyes seemed to start out of her head and her carmine lips compared by all the poets of the day to a pomegranate in flower were trembling with anger   55.874704526218615
never fear dear friend said porthos   76.44859445469446
dear constance   164.04660257155098
what   122.2257731919084
is that all you want   140.58464940277605
have you lost it   121.89768040398346
there again   126.34054825384685
go   136.4138852281737
how a gardener may get rid of the dormice chapter 62   128.25371671525502
the judge chapter 109   69.63213229151094
ah   160.62829422581905
said the queen to aramis   188.5903376951024
planchet took place behind his master and kept at a distance of ten paces from him   137.6171690476039
i pardon you and i weep for you   83.72089922590521
asked athos   110.29992340714523
i feigned a criminal process and employed all the most acute bloodhounds and skilful agents in search of her   120.77754384658016
but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed said villefort   145.0321153560645
these words were pronounced with that imperturbable phlegm which distinguished athos in the hour of danger and with that excessive politeness which made of him at certain moments a king more majestic than kings by birth   140.89345149062103
which of the two denounced him   92.43399968039687
asked mazarin trembling   76.50346866346484
what is your errand then with me sir   29.517867467680745
the bearers went on for twenty paces then stopped putting the bier down on the ground   58.87204814451901
now to see things which i can not understand to procure impossibilities these are the study of my life   107.81064593494123
fly fly   80.98155112849443
the morrels have been shipowners from father to son   118.90650716505398
as to aramis he dwelt in a little lodging composed of a boudoir an eating room and a bedroom which room situated as the others were on the ground floor looked out upon a little fresh green garden shady and impenetrable to the eyes of his neighbors   93.20061514389853
bonacieux had just attained that happy period of life   196.18541220000247
muttered mazarin unable to recover from his astonishment   191.42522091572786
but no his heart is beating   124.9472878746864
you comprehend   92.77805830135235
my friend there is the viscount of bragelonne and i am the count de guiche   47.56306714941114
she did not name madame de chevreuse the duke of buckingham or madame de vernet   148.13113099463357
ah ah   99.23720894748328
exclaimed the abbé   169.77347172190974
why every day in the trenches we go cheerfully to expose ourselves to worse than that for a bullet may break a leg and i am convinced a surgeon would give us more pain in cutting off a thigh than an executioner in cutting off a head   120.08269946046491
cried caderousse drawing from his waistcoat an open knife and striking the count in the breast you shall disclose nothing reverend sir   96.31463543875667
without uttering a word they bandaged his eyes with a care that showed their apprehensions of his committing some indiscretion   110.56731758835613
of the handkerchief   1.570566445816084
they will treat you as a deserter i warn you   145.8729438638247
planchet is a frondeur answered d artagnan   42.10393286293393
is it possible that you do not know of whom you purchased it   176.9879160699457
this instant duke   46.55341959525197
yes   75.66823279171656
when the ladies had finished their supper the queen feigned extreme fatigue and passed into her bedroom   152.07936716823843
well you may be assured that your horse will not be half so serviceable to you for that purpose as good golden louis   101.19442813165391
and he took the invaluable paper from the pocket of his uniform   5.026272076492063
i thank you my son   151.71627583759079
a slight oscillation showed dantès that all went well   100.69217377217993
to what do you allude   126.04060164185573
and grandpapa has become my physician and i have the greatest confidence in him because he knows everything   39.9760007621622
said the major who seeing the object of his journey frustrated by the absence of the papers feared also that his forgetfulness might give rise to some difficulty concerning the 48 000 francs ah indeed that is a fortunate circumstance   220.72350374909837
athos glanced around at his friends with a melancholy smile   148.74944497170387
an enemy in my house do you say edmond   204.72035874453428
bring hither that horse   73.57759639814438
and to marry mademoiselle danglars would be awful   104.35953934461145
continued the queen without restraining her tears it is better to fight as the king has done and to die as perhaps he will than live in beggary like me   164.7079370665342
what then are you   83.20293513869159
de boville he was in such a state of despair that it was evident all the faculties of his mind absorbed in the thought which occupied him at the moment did not allow either his memory or his imagination to stray to the past   130.93553388869017
oh i comprehend now said the astonished porthos   81.2160114090236
well said the coadjutor on seeing him you are in disgrace then abbé   144.03987314136197
my poor mother   57.052297424772384
your fine chateau is worthy of affording its princely hospitality to his eminence   162.15910310187576
but who is she   92.48007751122864
but if you bring him back to me dead or alive you may ask all you wish   105.05373371952166
oh misery oh vanity   224.50508163450104
and as the wound is very serious seeing that after crossing the shoulder it penetrates into the chest it is to be feared at this instant the tapestry was raised and a noble and handsome head but frightfully pale appeared under the fringe   70.14547222824562
morrel s   47.68155209152796
do you think it is worth while   122.5279251979942
it was an impossibility   83.57194286711115
the notary solemnly took the pen flourished it above his head and said gentlemen we are about to sign the contract   50.198501577042535
not the least in the world   126.15480105452245
la ramee drew near to grimaud who spoke to him in a low voice   101.43609112106567
patrick let no one enter   214.3397639886362
and he convulsively grasped the hand of d avrigny   187.91917464449514
and that unfortunate on coming to himself found ten guineas that the french gentleman had slipped into his pocket   167.12355142286867
they wished only to be allowed to fall on their knees before their sovereign and that they might move her to compassion   79.30074755193276
well   69.87785229612618
i will stay   140.22905847498342
kitty guessed what was passing in the mind of the young man and heaved a deep sigh   106.7918122311984
for d artagnan had assumed a threatening attitude and planchet modeled himself after his master   124.4983805265405
the next morn broke off the coast of aleria   107.06761117574463
oh dear mother it was a dream   23.33953270718679
the shade of richelieu was mazarin   101.38153874954108
ah you fear your prisoner should escape   86.99868362659416
i have not seen you nor your friends and i don t think you could gather all that dust that i saw planchet brush off your boots yesterday from the pavement of paris   178.5338650924496
chapter lxx   135.859415387827
to which you attach more value it seems than i do to mine   31.478599067958854
ah   32.26778060251476
m   184.49383083047846
i did go there   35.62757861804843
you he said you who are so trusting read and reflect that there is something in this letter important for us to see   193.42399121375456
and raoul could hardly understand his replies containing a mixture of flemish and alsatian   68.32542983220893
in heaven s name my dear athos do not make a useless sacrifice   166.995830446892
as soon as these studs shall be in your possession inform me   54.70650849488646
the gentleman appeared to be enumerating all his qualities to his auditors   9.223793646451185
this day of reunion was the same day as that on which kitty came to find d artagnan   166.73953397059995
very well   75.71119213500927
said the count the approbation of whose eye villefort had frequently solicited during this speech   147.0025241482365
i know that by name at least   51.05711208651795
yes sir she replied every confidence   211.18971968848217
porthos took advantage of this circumstance to ogle the women   70.83368596062512
indeed   114.6368416215011
he made a sign which i understood but the king s guards must have noticed it and held themselves on guard   107.27504797693487
do you love me still   166.011603068618
and immediately put spur to horse which set off along the rue saint honore with the speed of the whirlwind   170.4291697385816
dantès saw the light gradually disappear and fearing to be surprised in the cavern left it his gun in his hand   145.251349463294
all noise in the streets had ceased and the silence was frightful   139.185295606091
then monsieur said planchet you must buy me a watch   106.45177734463996
he had just strength enough to place the scent bag at the bottom of the silver casket and to let the knife fall into it making a sign to laporte that he was no longer able to speak   167.45020530797484
yes indeed   102.77531742558142
but in coming too early i should be afraid of awakening your majesty   24.306783569080963
cried buckingham forgetting everything in thinking from whom that letter came   148.4426136391544
that will be the first time i have done so for sixteen days   160.18738020765161
her devotion to the queen is known   91.72666770375602
the other two gentlemen were unknown to him   119.47014823478814
he was about at last to pass that mysterious threshold to climb those unknown stairs by which one by one the old crowns of m   181.84401475840596
how i have searched for him replied villefort wringing his hands   100.06834564579066
his house   282.52495185150485
and five minutes after a boat appeared rowed by four men   107.76867535738698
until that time continued the young girl in a calm and self possessed tone of voice we will conform to circumstances and be guided by the wishes of our friends so long as those wishes do not tend finally to separate us   74.69261569707209
at every step that edmond took he disturbed the lizards glittering with the hues of the emerald   2.8002112388544305
i want to find out who was the man in the mask who so obligingly offered to cut the king s throat   45.675942972448624
d artagnan after asking the man the right way continued his route agitated in spite of himself at the idea of seeing once more that singular man whom he had so truly loved and who had contributed so much by advice and example to his education as a gentleman   152.77995022687767
and what did you reply to his most illustrious eminence   102.18279412268585
comminges seized the servant around the waist and would have dragged her from her post   152.90696823097352
at two and twenty one calls every man one s friend   156.9113018435831
in matters of speculation however though man proposes yet money disposes   113.86803246758947
m   211.1984866331195
the duke shrugged his shoulders   90.41346809583811
he went away thoughtful and anxious and returned to his own room where he summoned bernouin and desired him to fetch thither in the morning the special guard he had placed over monsieur de beaufort and to awaken him whenever he should arrive   158.85784516662096
bah said athos we were always dry   160.4931825051822
at this point i have to accuse myself of a fault madame   226.30505176390477
the queen made a curtsy less from etiquette than because her knees were sinking under her   63.17520601091049
in fact her position was terrible   123.27247859128128
m   124.17553113291467
yes that the usual phrase   230.0704460432778
perhaps you will think sir that prosperity has spoiled me   169.79424719907857
so let us go and get killed where we are told to go   105.88253268149138
we have heard all it was necessary we should hear   138.19771886277522
de winter has changed his usual stupidity into a strange prudence   158.16476035624402
aramis again presented himself at the bishop s   125.68362065369978
but take care for i fear that this man is entirely devoted to the cardinal   161.8877716453855
and you monsieur porthos   210.87280777125147
but the host was unable to decide to which of the two nations the traveller belonged   118.36845677999135
the corsican ogre chapter 12   148.4555527439694
said selim in a voice at once so gentle and yet so proud   97.22173485532696
listen to aramis said his three friends   3.940319643968536
i thought you were at smyrna   107.10132151647218
now then to breakfast said beauchamp   63.98123586678478
the coadjutor is at this moment one of the seven kings of paris and has a court   168.3122099964882
oh yes scoundrel   212.40294085630825
9   72.56383619057912
remember also villefort that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your fealty and strict loyalty and that at our recommendation the king consented to forget the past as i do and here she extended to him her hand as i now do at your entreaty   90.08986187188151
he took the key which was customarily given him as one of the family ascended the stairs and introduced mme   106.37903014572325
the person who opened it must have taken me for a madman for i rushed at once to the stable   59.78095285859744
but what is there to investigate sir   128.0544456673276
then you have but one hope   167.200451595961
i persist then madame in my wish he laid an emphasis on the word that your majesty should receive the coadjutor   126.04511970716217
and so continued the englishman who first gained his composure he was drowned   56.222362076775646
i believe so   28.543960106786855
the host called the stable boy and ordered him to saddle le blanc then he awoke his son a child of seven years whom he ordered to ride before the gentleman and bring back the horse   94.51637085079399
well sir said the abbé you have spoken unreservedly   128.05953599746977
i lent you money and you returned it   94.21872953042856
and a thousand francs a year   199.40193699782668
the latter had received most peremptory instructions from monte cristo to treat haydée with all the deference they would observe to a queen   112.86136654171621
which proved that the person represented by the picture had served in the wars of greece and spain or what was just the same thing as regarded decorations had fulfilled some diplomatic mission in the two countries   155.52560133364256

but that s quite enough gentlemen   161.57120149011132
he was going toward the door when mazarin stopped him   135.55593908960185
why   29.79196039908284
madame de chevreuse was not queen murmured anne of austria overcome in spite of herself by the expression of so profound a passion   173.9025768694134
lemonade was a very bad thing for him   34.19471794656009
his father was introduced to me as a marquis so he ought to be a count   69.77731215938678
for he thought this death would cause the wedding to be postponed indefinitely   145.29812207644056
help help he murmured   96.52597389331008
to conspire against my honor with madame de chevreuse madame de longueville and the condés   36.376050666355596
but she is now at length a little reassured having sent her secretary away in order that nothing may happen unexpectedly   7.5390952100058115
all the world was ignorant of it   122.63748852536129
bertuccio s forehead was covered with perspiration   158.86295590828217
porthos wanted to follow him   187.47856466718127
in april you went to dine at the minister s   91.98926471544357
returned the cardinal   132.51586075801407
i have replied d artagnan   125.04560566657301
it is no affair of mine   196.84149302837352
count for yourself   172.12213306772034
each time he had been brought into contact with his father something terrible had happened   178.48241129826627
d artagnan had heard the conversation and had understood it   77.90209971480367
meanwhile you will raise my monthly allowance to five hundred francs my little fellow   107.82612450196432
your excellency does not require a permit for the island is uninhabited   169.14756565262087
it was also considered a luxury to have them alive it being an amusing sight to see them die for when dying they change color three or four times and like the rainbow when it disappears pass through all the prismatic shades after which they were sent to the kitchen   80.47386200777808
who said it was a crime   4.431469083320749
they heard the horsemen pass under the windows   94.57146928787341
where did you study heraldry   93.64759633352108
tony carries our muskets   12.616243720960327
well yes replied raoul   177.1980860229822
the shadow of a cloud passed over aramis s face as quickly as that which in august passes over the field of grain   77.62171844712816
and everything considered it is our lot to risk our lives   3.4323549955476125
well what are you doing count to a former lackey   176.55124746239844
cavalcanti to meet your lost andrea   125.84402734637092
yes said noirtier   123.5875699276382
morrel   187.16089465733785
d artagnan thought it would suffice for him and he sprang forward like a dart between them   135.39723716933804
no replied the count carelessly   113.22646177670427
said d artagnan filling two glasses with the beaugency wine which he had obtained from the liberality of m   41.90049404351326
asked athos in a low tone   185.08194730879774
for the pleasure of a meeting with you i would go to the end of the world   82.50039160394533
it was not money   50.91635484567867
you know that very well as i gave my order to saddle my horse   126.02178963022516
a terrible fear transfixed him   181.66842999315128
there is a very pretty girl waiting for you upstairs   137.39818896865035
avail yourself of it   185.7716282607441
it is you who surrendered the castle of yanina   143.34424470537581
is he then so ill dear voiture   166.94803632001032
inquired aramis   143.3502131407962
place the hands repeated the curate with a gesture   219.2153172734452
lord wilmore   87.98806020613965
do not question me said the prisoner   63.67901756352096
a delay would save my honor and consequently my life   154.21056816424544
m   149.1691080436202
you know that the famous waistcoat was found in his house containing the letter which stopped the signature of the marriage contract   78.1377489428514
oh very shortly madame said he   3.1871159776360685
we went by bologna perugia and rome   116.26937664129781
but where shall we go   144.95060163441414
but no matter   127.42722808665188
come this way and let us know when the wedding is to be for fernand here is so obstinate he will not tell us   109.73206707996691
when do you want your twelve hundred francs   148.94282180947818
come come we must be off   47.37046668901583
first madame who are you   66.10021608662643
no with a relation   101.41178654759152
it is said that he is married to the queen   246.82747252425918
athos was then sent to the cardinal   105.23839441373262
it was a man who would answer for the offence whether trifling or serious   77.2396178337135
d artagnan although he was not a musketeer performed the duty of one with remarkable punctuality   168.43922445249416
oh oh   124.13403503274161
this was the costume that best became the king   201.27273055631093
i would arrest ten of them ventrebleu a hundred even all the company and i would not allow a whisper   70.4270615910198
strength and sagacity   125.22574582193158
his resolution not to sign lasted two days after which he offered a million for some food   9.213712683513052
convinced that the ship was full of powder instead of having a cargo of wine grimaud hastened to awake d artagnan who had no sooner beheld him than he perceived that something extraordinary had taken place   83.58820073567665
it was thus worded my dear fellow the moment you have received this have the kindness to take the letter of credit from my pocket book which you will find in the square drawer of the secrétaire   61.118664462187134
and this constitutes the zenith of human fortune   165.08542269343315
chapter xxvii   120.7014865318023
you married oliva corsinari in the church of san paolo del monte cattini   68.17065067727377
he has a free will yet he fearlessly condemns   93.11470318425536
hi   43.769597467075414
said d artagnan i see that although we have had the honor of traveling in your company you do not know us   113.25554083930503
you are right   167.14312525817292
monsieur porthos du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds   161.5333563493148
a youthful indiscretion i suppose which you were anxious to conceal from the world at large   115.12718459863815
or rather sir said aramis with his peculiar irritating politeness the error of the person who was with you when we met you in the guardroom   95.62526738524359
no   77.87889947259265
cried she you have basely betrayed me and still more you have my secret   200.16046774875414
oh yes   146.99734950483023
d artagnan   43.96389913453717
aramis received a ball which passed through his shoulder and mousqueton another ball which lodged in the fleshy part which prolongs the lower portion of the loins   100.91651880051442
for my part i shall go unarmed   123.72621247087199
cried the young man and set off at full gallop   71.31630796199524
adieu   203.54526470844593
why   3.336129357445003
ah   144.11609796820042
look there said maximilian laughing   166.8977925131553
i know them from having heard one of their friends monsieur d artagnan say a great deal about them   76.43477922986628
commend me to the cardinal   170.92027784975727
sir said the notary whose interest had been greatly excited and who had resolved on publishing far and wide the account of this extraordinary and picturesque scene what appeared so impossible to me an hour ago has now become quite easy and practicable and this may be a perfectly valid will provided it be read in the presence of seven witnesses approved by the testator and sealed by the notary in the presence of the witnesses   168.40714299007422
i spoke to benedetto alone and proposed to him to accompany me endeavoring to tempt him by all the promises most likely to dazzle the imagination of a child of twelve   219.3723304428591
besides said she the sum you required me to borrow was rather large   93.15999091330525
oh yes said buckingham grating his teeth with rage   64.10652840308002
yes replied the young man i ask you in what year   85.58382694081277
cried d artagnan   98.10186218465334
your excellency he said the master of the hôtel de londres has sent to let you know that a man is waiting for you with a letter from the viscount of morcerf   85.49980046785623
milady raised her head saw close to the panes the pale face of athos and screamed   171.98711669048626
by the light of a lamp he saw a woman wrapped in a dark mantle seated upon a stool near a dying fire   97.18390728473793
a thousand thanks and now for the letter   132.4035170301
cried the sentinel who was less abstracted and who saw by the lamp light a shadow approaching his chief   170.83802157542448
don t let him escape   154.35619138998624
but at two o clock she had not returned   66.26999458791792
not at all said athos calmly   158.1836714233956
at this moment m   27.26790270406599
everything relating to this young man is true   105.58489743057862
madame de villefort expressed a desire to return to paris which madame danglars had not dared to do notwithstanding the uneasiness she experienced   89.730636280093
i hear my brother   153.96016199784012
all i do know is that i observed some suspicious looking people go in there nonsense   194.92254348766375
but this is not to the purpose our business concerns valentine let us leave the dead in peace   139.67637862324509
said porthos opening his eyes at that last word   125.78141961357248
the procurator s wife saw him pass in his new uniform and on his fine horse   223.22170554524854
thus the terrible secret which beauchamp had so generously destroyed appeared again like an armed phantom   60.67400041555311
how   142.0668528005707
the bad side of human thought will always be defined by the paradox of jean jacques rousseau you remember the mandarin who is killed five hundred leagues off by raising the tip of the finger   118.00376309816262
some traveller seems impatient said the host   147.4799929477446
well said morrel changing his expression of calmness for one of violence well and if i do intend to turn this pistol against myself who shall prevent me who will dare prevent me   238.19178215043533
cried the host   164.46244374747977
do not run down m   134.2854097118263
these two men then went toward the compartment in which grimaud was secreted   20.59283243360457
silence   62.20764605919533
you think then that the fire at the palace of justice was not caused by chance   65.80556230487294
it was then with a sentiment of uneasiness whether planchet who alone could give them information was alive or dead that the friends returned to the place royale   156.24815178712424
and besides i am on my guard   157.33114378832727
what shall we do   65.35078497876856
he will   149.37441301143036
what are the turks to such men as the comte de la fere and the abbé d herblay   121.69772657975348
d artagnan entirely overcome by this terrible story remained motionless and mute while all the demons of anger and jealousy were howling in his heart   33.800290780559465
two hundred and eighty seven thousand five hundred francs repeated he   142.05109923738883
he said falling on his knees   73.5459038178549
franz bowed and left the room   153.86262922121716
you are the best companion that i know d artagnan he said offering his hand to the gascon   125.6017104382323
i am very glad to see that you understand the value of these papers   133.88761042557542
and i too murmured the young lady with the velvet eyes   88.34792792023082
but you will not make me your confidant maximilian   116.2263442403933
dear friend to an englishman interrupted athos   173.1596354002094
but at seven o clock you must hold yourself in readiness with two horses   195.29852598034066
i don t understand it at all   162.9830346029993
but they have corresponded   167.0983690016716
this charge was so fierce so skillfully conducted that chanleu was almost surrounded   219.62879178638215
indeed   136.91099786541938
he is quite unaware of them and i have but one fear which is that he should disapprove of what i have done   146.4989599883654
oh my god my god have pity on me   93.49276532423971
he bowed and went out   89.29597544348215
i think he tasted them one day   119.16446393939616
and i am ready to offer you all i possess on loan   145.70620709194478
how can i tell you   193.02141030487846
i know that you were one of them my uncle and that you cried louder than the others she must die   154.74830634865612
ghosts chapter 63   131.64710057373722
you keep the registers of entries and departures   69.69512039369144
however the two culprits advanced and as they approached their faces became visible   137.30107827588728
but yet m   80.6183502891168
some contribute their talents others their industry   153.79988087449823
de villefort and not the prefect who returned to the house of m   138.21448896279097
certainly   172.290252207406
she had her portrait painted thus six or eight years ago   111.84642010181514
he fixed his eyes upon d artagnan even more earnestly than before   90.69015185402137
my attendants obey my slightest wish   96.88648822733542
she perceived athos and became thoughtful   49.900645601867325
another recollection contributed also to sadden raoul on their arrival at sonores he had perceived hidden behind a screen of poplars a little chateau which so vividly recalled that of la valliere to his mind that he halted for nearly ten minutes to gaze at it and resumed his journey with a sigh too abstracted even to reply to olivain s respectful inquiry about the cause of so much fixed attention   65.83028126233614
now we shall make use of your shoulder friend porthos if this door proves to be locked   153.85802793233242
ah yes said the factitious abbé who began to understand   59.95218657159703
no no   3.0057154653773352
you thought to escape my munificence but it is in vain   137.11860895102794
de villefort had taken   111.3482119022567
de villefort spoke of it to me a paralysis i think   46.14604418824797
i have no wishes count   145.1975572960595
his hand always wonderfully beautiful and strong was set off by a ruffle of lace like certain hands by titian and vandyck   35.179945075661195
besides that does not concern the home but the financial department   93.89536104548586
there can be no doubt we would all be broken on the wheel   142.92230822725935
of how much does he rob you every year   184.6784937640042
send him away or you will never make a man of him   85.5597505868735
i can get you out of paris and leave you beyond the barriere and can return for her   119.83648614716881
god is wearied   119.51357089602766
you understand then that if it were so said he rising in his turn and approaching the baroness to speak to her in a lower tone we are lost   189.82306280701974
i heard it from m   10.173998451109867
that is to say he had the most remarkable audacity seconded by a most powerful organization a man who has not perhaps like yourself seen all the kingdoms of the earth but who has helped to overturn one of the greatest   165.13012211839504
then it will be tomorrow   58.56966716256667
he looked at albert he was as white as his shirt and mechanically cast away his cigar although he had not half smoked it   45.90968115669126
what do you desire it to be   188.99669611833212
he held out both his arms while the hebrews beat their enemies and then he blessed them with his two hands   96.70512213230701
and one for me the best for last   118.92169542937599
but he has wealth i believe already   70.8568190712956
albert summoned his servant and ordered him to acquaint m   75.19754541080661
and he began to laugh loudly but nervously   103.74400793974796
then the diamond is safe   257.0818645010223
they pitied the young king who was unconsciously ruining his country and threw all the odium of his proceedings on mazarin   134.90690331880032
and if there had not been a postscript probably i should not have understood it   203.42694047351222
what did you say   79.7508298848133
this one will not oppress you by his dignity   216.00567182050037
and why has the count bought a rock   138.09396263697505
there were no questions   94.32704001419225
danglars observed a man in a cloak galloping at the right hand of the carriage   136.65703299509642
franz anticipated his wishes by saying that the noise fatigued him and that he should pass the next day in writing and looking over his journal   174.05492341544345
interrupted the count smiling   118.14413128860505
they asked   115.61936119210007
and so my friends we return to paris   211.52352946138058
but yet detail them to me   65.27184874501995
i speak of that adventure in behalf of the queen of the ornaments of the journey you made with three of your friends   157.3717404313129
very fine anne   174.4357661504348
they were taking the part of a plebeian and in defending broussel they instinctively felt they were defending themselves   180.09894519578376
they arrived that very moment at the gate of the town guarded by two sentinels   11.968193671728855
the despatch simply stated the fact of the landing and the route taken by the usurper   52.41826600438846
may i also be allowed said morcerf to pay my respects to mademoiselle danglars   8.591965162399205
wretched wretched that i am   62.35611071151699
no cried felton no   58.13075262385515
asked he   170.69433337052132
how could she extricate herself from this labyrinth   105.11284488313659
then that explains everything that is extraordinary said andrea   195.0785246407267
the old executioner of bethune muttered grimaud   114.62839200847829
it turned out as d artagnan had foreseen   89.20934419577063
consult some politician of the period of which you speak and if you pay well for it you will certainly get to know all you want   137.5358935784045
well two words will refresh your memory   63.05125853080561
mazarin opened the coffer   56.524876416565405
in consequence after having traveled all night at seven o clock she was at the fort of the point   173.09703431277285
aramis called bazin and after having ordered him to join them at athos s residence said let us go then at the same time taking his cloak sword and three pistols opening uselessly two or three drawers to see if he could not find stray coin   42.82039788390172
and as much at least in pearls diamonds and jewels said eugénie   194.5273715879489
d épinay will be frightened at this pecuniary loss   86.2050297280605
they entered the roadstead   57.54688289112313
on entering his house he met morrel who wandered about like a ghost awaiting the heavenly mandate for return to the tomb   221.99839516880775
m   152.75396689375228
while mercédès glanced at the clock and made an expressive gesture to edmond   123.71180079752104
but first of all athos begged that he might go to the hotel du grand charlemagne to see raoul   169.23664820045198
friquet had a quick eye and a fine ear   214.77702688414638
he found that he was in a grotto went towards the opening and through a kind of fanlight saw a blue sea and an azure sky   82.15358680006199
i hope we shall have something better to do to night than to draw the sword   82.2221063057398
20135m from the imperfect means franz had of judging he could only come to one conclusion that the person whom he was thus watching certainly belonged to no inferior station of life   112.49554475773351
eight o clock found franz up and dressed while albert who had not the same motives for early rising was still soundly asleep   138.6979248637523
the waiter did as he was desired   28.07843999102684
what asked the duke what do you mean   190.38084002043183
but replied franz this ambrosia no doubt in passing through mortal hands has lost its heavenly appellation and assumed a human name   141.7527401586517
he placed the casket on the table   171.12264644301683
and though he considered the treasure as by no means chimerical he yet believed it was no longer there   80.96044570920832
he appeared calm but it was evidently not without a mighty effort   91.10693713540812
then as his boat drew nearer the songs became louder for an enchanting and mysterious harmony rose to heaven as if some loreley had decreed to attract a soul thither or amphion the enchanter intended there to build a city   122.75974935241808
two or three houses were in flames and a dull noise was heard which indicated what suffering was endured by a town taken by assault   210.67111251104723
then this house belonged to m   159.74107603200156
you make the demand badly replied aramis   77.00415682275971
said the englishman i have the key of that door   124.93661412230811
zounds   196.83753727252812
oh yes exclaimed raoul fixing his glance on one point in the stream splendidly illumined by the setting sun a horse a rider   96.33712014046222
the article relative to morcerf   139.830950680846
louis xiii   15.898232429104894
the second notary had also arrived   143.28995888493301
my lord fronde is the name the discontented give to their party   137.51840077557057
i doubtless wrote   155.4145369872946
on a rustic table made by luigi were spread out the pearl necklace and the diamond pins and on a chair at the side was laid the rest of the costume   67.05040341650965
stammered the unhappy woman completely overwhelmed   78.60878104675315
they will not dare to refuse me then   134.0677413353807
i know monsieur le curé said the beggar that you have always been very kind to me and therefore i in my turn will be serviceable to you   84.52781721718705
that s true said athos and he rang the bell   133.51163413893758
you agree that you have no remedies for negligence strict liability breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in paragraph 1   113.83808102203076
bertuccio raised the lantern and obeyed   40.8972618599293
and it seems to me that if he ventured into the south it would be easy to raise languedoc and provence against him   68.12542843220034
come my lord you shall be treated like a prince as you are   55.72671645825105
murmured the king   116.46733265692849
the snare is rather maladroit for the cardinal replied the young man smiling   118.29362757623662
welcome to ye   146.45976575997287
that man is a messenger of general cromwell   100.68382394501589
we must go said the superb lord of bracieux lest they should say we were afraid   250.47093700708086
i understand my game kitty   141.32906343477936
it is evident by their sending for me that matters are becoming complicated   64.89103960833094
from the cardinal   164.13559431008727
yes to go and meet him   77.65227194457071
my expedition has given me an appetite   162.2448187771088
mordaunt felt that he had no time to lose and he lost none   33.56357333467379
money never comes amiss at any time my lord   134.47876677686384
they then separated   79.41889852435382
it was agreed in a brief council held among them that julie should write to her brother who was in garrison at nîmes to come to them as speedily as possible   115.0121144871531
go then animal said the duke   70.46566635441016
this second signature explained everything to franz who now understood the objection of the messenger to coming up into the apartment   174.51700560729844
friquet counterfeited surprise and twisting his new cap around in his fingers said it is not astonishing for you to know it monsieur broussel who knows everything   108.4942604900558
franz introduced me to her at rome replied albert   70.22305924486156
and i know my son had good reasons to wish to fight with you and to endeavor to kill you   54.91498788008474
yes he said there have been some who have suffered more than i have but then they must have been martyrs at least   129.09001109949355
do you think the thing possible   54.28224678266145
exactly so   144.90654447692975
i see plainly that notwithstanding the sixty four years that have passed over your head you are still the same man active and zealous   97.04171671276575
she knew her brother in law to be a worthy gentleman a bold hunter an intrepid player enterprising with women but by no means remarkable for his skill in intrigues   61.27203059223757
because said the old man the natural repugnance to the commission of such a crime prevented you from thinking of it   127.65589039460049
d artagnan and porthos withdrew to a corner of the cabinet   111.28868298649438
she had a son observed athos   38.743071838159224
i address you because you know that although i esteem him from my heart i am a little awed by the comte de la fere   132.6248733366926
what then   77.25039203604223
number 3 has two staircases inside and outside   258.22620289270856
he labored and toiled until he had amassed 250 000 francs   37.41364302769718
ears have they but they hear not   131.94680696776516
help me out of france   102.3433136556266
their plan was to pass through the hole they were making into this loft and cut out from below a piece of the flooring of the king s room so as to form a kind of trap door   89.66835312913504
he looked to see if the dish of beans was still there   81.83658819052478
and where will your worship drink   71.28313049766372
everybody except the person who gave it to me   227.05549911300767
enter gentlemen said laporte since the queen desires you so to do   222.21474612840268
i offered you tyburn said lord de winter   151.82626242330434
the magistrate was seated in an armchair writing with his back towards the door   134.17458336101407
in the hour of rest between noon and one o clock galley slaves having a nap after dinner   99.19764433887114
he is coming to play with us this evening   9.86444261187384
five millions   103.63307284128842
tell me why does a steward rob his master   47.50657941426678
beauchamp uttered an exclamation of surprise on seeing his friend leap over and trample under foot all the newspapers which were strewed about the room   237.5637438114309
what musketeers are now within the palace   173.56431575850308
a play   205.88592589227702
put the gag in grimaud   160.7299843171662
you think then i have something to dread   115.5710371192074
sir replied the mayor   152.20179034769725
well said aramis what think you about these two enemies whom it requires besides comminges s troop ten good soldiers to confront   161.01160206465448
so much the worse sir said anne of austria   167.2694118205473
well responded porthos you may imagine with the physique with which nature has endowed me i am not in want of good luck   195.78599474553334
then calling to the crew he said let go   118.75513581246989
it neither increased nor decreased my income   23.409745907021218
your italian prince   135.42347805004403
i used to divide my soup and beans with you when you were hungry   79.37962690382145
for the rest the orders had been issued by the count   5.980912879516026
he has put out the lamp i can see nothing now   166.52526188481622
he was then a more unhappy son than you morrel for he could not even find his father s grave   164.5696804291697
sir replied the queen closing the coffer and leaning her hand upon it if there is anything to be said it is that i have always been ungrateful to the brave men who saved me that i have given nothing to that gallant officer d artagnan you were speaking of just now but my hand to kiss and this diamond   96.65820413833612
the steward bowed and was about to quit the room   88.06828840606764
it is indeed a sum which might be regretted even by a philosopher   132.3246169630692
he threw them on the table without looking at them so sure was he of victory   74.95351002469144
the sight is hideous   72.6546194559904
on what i could get   200.58139682563794
at the door he found the two men and the spare horse which they held   155.2451105922451
monsieur morrel   57.55559680577343
he then drew two crowns majestically from his purse and gave them to the host who accompanied him cap in hand to the gate and remounted his yellow horse which bore him without any further accident to the gate of st   91.17263085039716
excuse my not coming to meet you   186.39374317339445
oh my god no   169.3787498540267
on the contrary we shall meet again said mercédès pointing to heaven with solemnity   118.84977352829067
i should injure the queen instead of serving her   103.90872673960938
you must be aware at all events that it is impossible for me to understand motives before they are explained to me   50.46626164133316
you make me shudder doctor   102.8168184471287
morrel   40.54175445693748
wishing to know on what topic the soldiers were conversing he approached with his wonted wolf like step pushed open the door and put his head close to the chink   113.84798592082811
asked the magistrate   136.92927623389892
edmond fancied he heard a bitter laugh resounding from the depths   108.19668954383035
said milady returning the letter to mme   148.78735893771133
then proposals from any quarter will be agreeable to you since for the moment you have no master but god   93.25302392197149
i am afraid that what was first done was unskillful if not worse than useless   76.80833786418141
next morning faithful to his promise he sent the prescription requested   9.28846508928514
everyone waited anxiously   122.044467691833
milady   161.60914787758952
but do not fear it   100.28498805208648
then he let his head sink upon his two hands while d artagnan stood before him stupefied   76.24624160344811
come what did she say   87.99959487563397
the cardinal s   22.151487978784232
20281m my dear monsieur bertuccio said monte cristo laughing control yourself   120.31293769842199
at the same time added château renaud your count of monte cristo is a very fine fellow always excepting his little arrangements with the italian banditti   106.5059087790867
the remembrance of the scene at st   14.74840585705968
what has just happened   230.52257509019907
i believe so   46.28269170029333
but you were right to return as soon as possible my boy   185.9304560949867
but the wine said d artagnan who furnishes the wine   94.77549258367256
said aramis with that mildness of language which was observable in him every time that his ideas were directed toward the church   59.07610157625689
but i took them for visions raised by my feverish imagination and indeed when you entered i thought i was under the influence of delirium   160.8907801237039
i am going to fire   14.777243395690377
stay said monte cristo as though he had not observed her confusion i have heard of a lucky hit that was made yesterday on the neapolitan bonds   64.6476828915577
bonacieux you speak that in a tone that frightens me   132.62281650194745
your excellency s name is the baron franz d épinay   91.77897124903117
beware sir replied the president you are no longer in the assembly and have only to do with individuals   152.6415107733573
it appears that the method i have adopted with this boy is decidedly the best   112.88383445197498
yes   238.76574390361856
i lost a battle in spain i have been defeated in trieste but my naval army in india will have taken some galleons and my mexican pioneers will have discovered some mine   164.57261874421752
for you know more than we do   53.59464349090621
my father said i was his joy you style me your love and both of you have called me my child   160.91667224430296
this treasure exists dantès and if i have not been allowed to possess it you will   150.25812258268192
all these circumstances did not strike me as painfully at the time as they have since done   45.36799787698767
sebastian   205.22240418403447
the cardinal there awaited louis xiii   204.82486047205802
perhaps so   29.774854890455458
said athos who never used thee and thou but upon very particular occasions what has happened   171.00760765619162
at the fifth or sixth blow the pickaxe struck against an iron substance   110.70414840706765
still what   156.75368797033087
grimaud had made himself a kind of sentry box out of a hollow willow and as they drew near he put his head out and gave a low whistle   77.11980116108127
i must take care   171.51923730340278
yes   204.58022674206808
the jeweller took the ring and drawing from his pocket a pair of steel pliers and a small set of copper scales he took the stone out of its setting and weighed it carefully   106.9406479707435
very well   112.99154105189564
said the tutor joining in the conversation   80.76235323685007
in what way   123.89437209841452
and the young officer shook the count s hand so warmly that monte cristo could not be mistaken as to the sincerity of his joy and he saw that he had been expected with impatience and was received with pleasure   97.31964658586661
he therefore promised albert that he would content himself the morrow with witnessing the carnival from the windows of the rospoli palace   53.80656801559968
suffer me also madame replied villefort to add my earnest request to mademoiselle de saint méran s that you will kindly allow the veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past   59.063736351683936
and having snatched a hasty dinner they continued their journey to louvres   74.85469909300093
30157m i own that your question embarrasses me valentine for i can not say that the count has rendered me any ostensible service   156.70562688874315
you see mother i treat you handsomely for thirty five francs   125.50171743730809
porthos went and leaned against the side of a pillar   133.27242223034028
cried the baron i shall never console myself   130.12431385672465
here it is said aramis taking a small key from his breast and opening a little ebony box inlaid with mother of pearl here it is   99.51892523826109
someone was taken in the mousetrap   278.86804162859113
you know the rest   208.96052441133088
i hope so   110.53477365309806
he seemed moved by this last remark   146.36748474390308
after pitching heavily for twelve hours we sprung a leak   116.96735042122188
what is it   230.25233281788718
i made inquiries and found that the house in the champs élysées is his own property and certainly it was very decently kept up   205.97619936185447
yes said the messenger and i bring you his ring   81.55302318219691
it was an apparition   138.73794814820153
morrel followed her on tiptoe   63.59561747391199
20323m alas i have still to recount the most distressing period of my life   87.52880215044559
as we said before by ten o clock almost all the guests had dispersed   3.908343287118015
by mordaunt   107.64646431870261
aramis will follow us by that of noyon   122.54938256240006
if in the depths of the tomb there still remain something within us which can respond to the voice of those who are left on earth   77.49161730459966
it would be a dishonor to all the nobility   148.16077980736483
today is the 30th   187.982185219082
of what consequence   164.79719408197127
they were influenced by hatred by avarice and by self love   47.88931943372124
ah   112.94706710621219
alas faltered out the abbé all is over with me   135.40188700569203
but felton called to the officer of the post and drawing from his pocket the letter of which he was the bearer he said a pressing message from lord de winter   162.91840015243147
in the cellar   98.93703743822941
the carriage had stopped here   112.12589527845768
your friends will be proud of you and m   157.97577919543437
very well   171.37400213920304
three months passed away   25.255405121277377
exclaimed dantès his heart wrung with anguish   94.69400682388834
he opened the case and offered them to the queen with deep and silent anguish   175.37588018575153
ah ah   77.25384498595987
m   116.47094542726252
the apparent reason at least said madame de villefort   82.71879813367708
but whilst they were indulging in extravagant joy at the palais royal to increase the hilarity of the queen mazarin a man of sense and whose fear moreover gave him foresight lost no time in making idle and dangerous jokes   142.25964830441936
said the count   150.8233825578955
it was there a lodging was prepared for them   67.60820951822525
said the magistrate without any introduction placing himself between his wife and the door   83.3285758841017
no monseigneur   52.96195446631329
let him know   154.64968890725623
yes you must   92.02174725562033
has she returned   157.2041929043762
and from whose hands the count extricated me in so wonderful a manner   150.34106481096327
his panegyric has been uttered   83.42395453884382
it was three o clock   149.09151181198914
well said the jailer are you more reasonable today   188.4752739438581
dangerous   41.909768302115666
beppo got in inviting the frenchman to follow him and he did not wait to be asked twice   161.24761517101595
one chamber alone had been respected by the magnificent bertuccio   132.10020504776867
how can you tell me that   185.06413289749483
sire i entreat you to do so   148.89903539273521
so porthos sat down to table without another word and ate with an appetite that did honor to the confidence that was ever inspired in him by d artagnan s inventive imagination   207.9228491429724
d artagnan no longer doubted that this was porthos s pleasant dwelling place   32.8930433720609
will you not embrace me sir   84.12288721046642
well   215.01271192501105
luigi vampa himself searched   81.31547577695194
he exclaimed what has thus disturbed you   175.68866658546122
bathed in tears she wandered about the catalan village   87.46304589548093
let him run on said danglars restraining the young man   44.15727424547366
look fernand your eyes are better than mine   51.52710361345579
the pickaxe that had seemed so heavy was now like a feather in his grasp   156.3359210342625
said the astonished athos   61.13121391621033
to tell you that you are free your excellency   126.01832807563837
he grants a full pardon to the vizier ali and not only gives him his life but restores to him his fortune and his possessions   79.9368131718941
i do not madame rejoined mazarin   92.18478286869423
what would the patron think   103.3471343729977
the two men smiled at each other shook hands and saluted his eminence   143.31277714243896
i shall meet them there and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview   125.22668826774046
the count and franz ascended seven or eight steps after the chief who drew back a bolt and opened a door   46.390136996140555

but here it is you have sentiments the devil knows what such as every one can t entertain   158.3934595074507

if you do you know that my hand stretches far and that you shall pay very dearly for the hundred louis you have from me   121.49758949064741
but he perceived that the man at the desk wrote or rather corrected lines of unequal length scanning the words on his fingers   158.62099362444383
i turned around i looked at the trees i tried to recall the details which had struck me at the time   248.19257021821028
who could have said so the evening before   104.47121421889878
but swear that you will not strike me as i go down   46.11902029108023
yes   138.19922910233947
some years only   84.59695962523014
the comte de toiras retired into the citadel st   237.69920797357986
art thou a minister from hell   126.06482914697386
and to all these questions poor kitty forced to put on a pleasant face responded in a stifled voice whose dolorous accent her mistress did not however remark solely because happiness is egotistical   154.58701546591988
there s one way of settling this said jacopo   131.5407477460014
ah this time you can not lose ground my fine friend   147.5084471143826
yield   106.42825707011613
it was the fault of that blockhead pastrini that i did not sooner assist you in your distress   132.3563603418821
but this promise was very vague and did not at all reassure d artagnan   16.43849095532866
let us hope my child cried the marquis that m   105.14645299438907
it was therefore easy in the midst of this confusion to remain as unobserved as any one might wish   152.71852681546187
ah   79.14393787364881
mazarin resumed his reading it is important therefore monseigneur that i should be informed as to the intentions of france   103.03203759532234
if ever you meet him again wherever it may be whether on the high road or in the street or in a church anywhere that he or you may be put your foot on his neck and crush him without pity without mercy as you would crush a viper or a scorpion   132.87858826706213
so that now if there were anything to inherit from him they may do so with easy conscience   64.4825407264043
the box taken by albert was in the first circle   5.781088375487329
yes you are right tréville you are right   154.52313606689012
and one may draw fifty or sixty pistoles from this good man   122.77521441913933
come then said the prince   42.14434081447121
you said before that you were obliged to leave us monsieur said madame de villefort and you were about to tell us why when your attention was called to some other subject   138.87060750939918
it was impossible that his best friend if indeed he had any friend left could recognize him   127.85403643058086
shall further inquiries be made   171.9637939887094
excuse my putting such a question to you   166.50900705255918
well don t budge then   79.3795930378474
swear to be united in spite of everything and forever and may this oath bind us to each other and even also our descendants   130.47095930847286
the two women looked at this person whose presence they had entirely forgotten and retired   122.32069733113043
mazarin was large in promises quite unlike the virtuous monsieur grimaud so bepraised by la ramee   171.14804429491602
pray let me know what it is you have discovered   143.60644730571897
his brain was on fire and life and energy returned   138.7788141095544
do you hear   161.96677101113772
there is an enormous quantity of rats in that cellar   172.9397849691157
what do you want with me   115.00350667966153
you alarm me   100.45819598568183
yes sir answered raoul   128.70595869254257
but who then was this man   120.14258451507273
while saying this he looked at his friend with an earnestness that embarrassed him   95.72624622726592
andrea   12.124291470048874
he showed him the open door the empty room   50.43139715999972
the general s carriage was ready but the president told him it was impossible for him to use it since it was useless to blindfold the master if the coachman knew through what streets he went   119.86365949567633
listen whispered villefort to valentine who could not conceal her joy   106.44034359709173
oh i am listening with the greatest impatience replied the young man   137.02026089159932
d artagnan who as we have said was exceedingly prudent for a young man of twenty then remembered his suspicions regarding milady   222.76613913615682
but in everything friend one must always return to the same question a stupid one i admit but very necessary have you any money   73.76558724755824
there is one in particular which he prefers in his journeys large enough to hold all the world   14.720025887921622
but his eyes darkened by death encountered only the knife which had fallen from the hand of felton still smoking with the blood spread over its blade   97.74412170797004
it is easy to perceive that you come from a distance   115.25460661521926
and this king s attorney was named villefort   115.32973617002558
has your majesty forgotten that the king expects your reply and awaits it in agony   4.023961579141499
why should an exception be made in her favor   158.28981270906579
and now said athos what is to be done   122.59504904297198
milady breathed again   156.2666316425336
caderousse stammered out something while he wiped away the sweat that started to his brow   224.16063745666358
it may be easily imagined how great was our joy when in turning over this manuscript our last hope we found at the twentieth page the name of athos at the twenty seventh the name of porthos and at the thirty first the name of aramis   129.37175092846206
he knew he must call assistance   205.3530386071959
d artagnan who had secured the key shut himself up in the closet without reply   101.06981150097549
the two harnesses were worth three hundred pistoles   83.29304840558527
are the half of the sum mother   135.02103110539593
as he was perfectly acquainted with the details of gastronomy d artagnan and aramis made no objection to abandoning this important care to him   112.93756835282701
a regiment of cuirassiers nearly equal as to numbers issued from behind the hill and came full gallop toward it   122.39466522746697
or upon my soul i will blow your brains out   110.74515898200421
that would have been difficult   120.55612418163645
but the parisians are so subtle in paradoxes that they mistake for caprices of the imagination the most incontestable truths when these truths do not form a part of their daily existence   185.4677824881349
d artagnan took off his hat and could not be persuaded to make use of his cloak   105.94667492097025
d artagnan already fancied himself so rapid is the flight of our dreams upon the wings of imagination accosted by a messenger from the young woman who brought him some billet appointing a meeting a gold chain or a diamond   148.19391273295486
said porthos it appears we are feasting   196.96310551521418
one of the two men was peppino and the other a bandit on the lookout   57.66715404641303
look emmanuel   130.11742916279474
i did not even wish to know her name nor do i know it   46.645594626749315
they expected that his stupefied silence would be followed by a fiery outburst   132.38003984285967
the man who had performed this daring act with so much indifference wore the transtevere costume   99.02872916564492
why we are looked upon with a rather favorable eye by a lady of quality the duchesse de but your pardon   227.1717940883558
i can comprehend that the spy may have been deceived by the person   141.65214821695068
he then returned to the captain said a few words to him and as if from that moment the vessel was under his command he ordered a maneuver which the crew executed immediately   30.719312744146777
the prisoners transported the previous evening from the carceri nuove to the little church of santa maria del popolo had passed the night each accompanied by two priests in a chapel closed by a grating before which were two sentinels who were relieved at intervals   58.83411549503854
m   138.8872080517991
oh the wretched hours i have endured the torture to which i have submitted when i saw the deadly poison poured into your glass and how i trembled lest you should drink it before i could find time to throw it away   111.34369044287295
but at length the two englishmen felt ashamed to draw back and the angrier one descended the five or six steps which led to the cellar and gave a kick against the door enough to split a wall   104.61054485362422
on entering his hôtel m   170.88970945439348
at eleven o clock kitty came to him   149.25410420863244
this man has gone and for the moment has consequently escaped my vengeance   90.0311566750879
thou man of noble heart   74.4402062067119
at the same time i felt inclined to learn dancing of the danseuse who acquired such a reputation in london   86.21944526597231
oh sir exclaimed m   166.28746535666858
murmured he   212.42484570307863
and once more he bowed low before his highness   143.5117050648532
as he said this he pressed grimaud s hand who seemed honored by the distinction   149.33130404152627
you who have faith and hope oh do not follow my example   161.3801458168516
come along said caderousse   41.74119868822389
he to whom you have confided your destiny he from whom death would have separated you calls you to him   108.3481414535456
tis true that our position is an awkward one   77.21944072835973
de villefort   65.68410364867
milady knew that lord de winter lied and she was the more alarmed   205.34154521616125
i command here   154.57076376212876
but excessive grief is like a storm at sea where the frail bark is tossed from the depths to the top of the wave   102.64181866152542
have i not already told you that there is nothing between me and the duchess de longueville   126.89948691765247
the president frowned imperceptibly   148.80102258019377
indeed   93.3419572991885
to the visitors room   70.01734457086943
we will simply settle our hats on our heads and we will escort his eminence   76.59981591921559
yes yes edmond that is true but you forgot at that time a little debt to our neighbor caderousse   126.41835204361102
and how proceed   84.23325621672609
will you accompany me to the harbor maximilian   117.05519578701552
this corridor was guarded not by a sentinel but by a confidential servant through whom in case of urgency charles could communicate instantly with his faithful subject   100.48239644154656
monsieur d artagnan   68.91378224687003
the door had been opened and shut again   125.65265383221286
i am on my own ground and have an undoubted right to place a ladder against the wall and to look over when i please without having any apprehensions of being taken off by the police as a suspicious character   127.24421034606395
now my wife came home four days ago monsieur   144.23258997010194
only tell us where we shall find a house at which we can demand aid and a village from which we can fetch a priest   182.70508500590995
his agitated features presented the appearance of pale and hideous terror   82.71939740018492
does he speak to you of this conspiracy   143.62073539064838
i should be carried home in triumph like monsieur broussel and athos would proclaim me the french brutus   138.1398548569817
at each shot morrel turned pale   89.51584743229107
the floor was uncarpeted   136.40730794688918
the wounded man heaved a sigh   155.4200846735477
remember that i affirm nothing monsieur the commissary and that i only suspect   156.95389465997675
no   52.25384172710838
she believes that someone has written to the duke of buckingham in her name   148.2933140424747

why it is indeed a true royal jewel which is worth a thousand pistoles if it is worth a denier   66.67438452212346
never answered de guiche   159.84178230374772
i no longer understand anything   133.7365480709017
so you may have the diamond for 45 000 francs   199.71115255374502
a woman of such inferior condition   147.70813961755468
and before you went to the bastile   57.235867288706515
a deathlike silence reigned in the room above   94.67975811280715
jealousy indicates affection   209.19856975360565
there are situations which the heart of a father or a mother can not be made to understand   7.49243105075945
but what is going on in this accursed paris   159.17551362744058
well said porthos it appears to me that the means are very simple   119.83642000501631
i thought i had told you a most lamentable story   63.18989076401417
i am saved   130.6407658758739
before she went to bed she had pondered analyzed turned on all sides examined on all points the words the steps the gestures the signs and even the silence of her interlocutors   29.796001457170007
i uttered a cry of joy   169.86782797293603
has lamoricière that ney of the south been killed   64.27682848754594
and unwilling to interfere with the pleasure he so evidently felt took up albert s glass and began in his turn to survey the audience   119.81833406369537
really impossible   93.03600048373612
a problem my dear count for everyone for my mother as well as others   84.54273604161841
you then served louis xviii   60.32862300239286
debray   123.94346131790573
is it news to you   29.78932823469337
asked an officer who appeared at that moment upon the threshold of the room   139.41299798322711
asked the king looking at the cardinal who colored with vexation   103.3808364350079
what do you mean   234.2289661282704
all these corsicans are mad on my honor replied m   64.24732609286329
d artagnan rattled the gold in his pockets   223.17548793366853
for the last hour i have not heard him stir   165.95720825005014
the abbé s chamber chapter 18   199.2029133203196
what can it mean   145.29126503963195
but when she saw the careless bow of debray and the glance by which it was accompanied together with his significant silence she raised her head and without passion or violence or even hesitation ran downstairs disdaining to address a last farewell to one who could thus part from her   208.57669239660603
monsieur de beaufort in common with many other prisoners was bent upon doing things that were prohibited   239.38442646516086
it is five minutes past seven and the appointment was for eight o clock   176.83669214410844
but i as you see am nailed to my bed ah   44.327936581036454
the horses impelled by fear flew towards the house   132.47258751264226
0189m dantès had but one resource which was to break the jug and with one of the sharp fragments attack the wall   103.73432325853643
he wants to be sure that i go away said d artagnan to himself   238.87465001649667
dantès thought as they passed so closely to the island whose name was so interesting to him that he had only to leap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised land   69.12635468195434
he turned it gently on its hinges   193.09986754564935
yes my lord replied the servant m   112.16063396026152
my dear father said villefort i am on the contrary delighted   64.27852211455959
wait whilst i light the lamp said la carconte   144.08436024269122
and the wounded man sought to recall the features of the person now before him   48.22015527556809
i ought to have consulted you on the point and have had some dishes prepared expressly   46.70800706542285
for mine was broken at the first parry   106.41441172999893
said the abbé   54.155939583433934
other men may have entered before them and waited for them   68.1376058601266
that imbecile lacked but one thing to become a cardinalist   70.33739979203087
i am ready to answer any questions your excellency may address to me   150.81727575401595
ah monseigneur do not mention it   47.06515066904329
he asked   134.85422113259776
asked the young man   118.24077321960225
murmured cromwell   139.09686551715004
she had often in her youth spoken of poverty but between want and necessity those synonymous words there is a wide difference   51.23255337640987
monte cristo ran down the steps and advancing towards the spot designated beheld villefort encircled by his servants with a spade in his hand and digging the earth with fury   126.52978280177716
come count you do not do that young man justice   134.75837322772173
his mania   211.87808169379133
cried d artagnan springing forward in his turn after the servant   183.13999540402608
they played and i won   9.908475353474216
yes my lord it is i   148.08027616715225
they seem like poor fishermen and suddenly they open some mysterious cavern filled with the wealth of the indies   121.14527792599964
the tower of st   89.60519341353732
i dare say you know how to navigate should he fail us   86.83778094403097
such is the atrocious logic of revolutions   122.45620826185156
you are certainly a prodigy   158.67988559223625
how can i   184.32886111009668
you will see danglars that it will turn out an unlucky job for both of us   86.11554246512917
afar off a few small fishing boats studded the bosom of the blue ocean   48.36474352737709
what was his name   176.94265454211487
i like your manner raoul and your politeness has touched me   180.12134909708624
he has about him a little of that foreign manner by which french persons recognize at first sight the italian or german nobleman   29.84339017880147
don t be distressed   65.53392062315187
cavalcanti three times and he took no notice of it   270.9964625734255
d artagnan has turned aside from buckingham whom she hates as she hates everyone she has loved the tempest with which richelieu threatened him in the person of the queen   39.11967382378177
jump then monsieur pistache   94.1921231102414
he had only two hours work to do to open communication with the king and according to the calculations of the four friends they had the entire day before them since the executioner being absent another must be sent for to bristol   111.86105166855508
are there any others   136.1469688217846
sire interposed the minister of police i came a moment ago to give your majesty fresh information which i had obtained on this head when your majesty s attention was attracted by the terrible event that has occurred in the gulf and now these facts will cease to interest your majesty   208.52234398693085
courted by my step mother who regards him as the epitome of human wisdom   70.55327862696036
what has become of them   9.785121654451345
dantès examined the various articles shown to him with the same attention that he had bestowed on the curiosities and strange tools exhibited in the shops at marseilles as the works of the savages in the south seas from whence they had been brought by the different trading vessels   114.42228420373019
i am acquainted with it   172.53479324876884
madame said he if i dared in my turn advise would it be to give up broussel sir   97.06343682849186
no   79.80290162499344
my good fellow you must have lost your senses to think it possible i could act with such cold blooded policy   218.50645161177357
well valentine resumed maximilian i can only say again that you are right   1.2402951014475434
but if you intend to tell an untruth reflect it were better not to speak at all   65.16210571211471
in all well organized brains the predominating idea and there always is one is sure to be the last thought before sleeping and the first upon waking in the morning   81.69183825520571
at ten minutes to eight beauchamp arrived   12.959713511115027
i will not irritate him thought edmond and taking the paper of which half was wanting having been burnt no doubt by some accident he read this treasure which may amount to two   78.3012075187036
the cries which the police officer repeated twenty times in the king s name were powerless against this formidable multitude seemed on the contrary to exasperate it still more   257.9011693542596
the men he beheld saw him undoubtedly for their cries were carried to his ears by the wind   84.77405933755709
the abbé told me it was worth 50 000 francs muttered caderousse   8.224401803349025
because if you do not possess the 175 000 francs i reclaim you must have lent them to your friends and m   103.17999048624007
exactly   169.4142197440658
all right   175.81905346203857
but you have broken all the bottles   109.6365397526551
the man who had the appearance of being a butcher descended a little steep and isolated street looking on to the river with two of his friends   200.58215322121134
the vicomte and myself will go and find a priest   150.81145529182538
he had tried victory by means of superhuman undertakings   137.25429781875494
30327m she then turned towards the avenue   161.6460453073144
this time without knowing why d artagnan felt a cold shiver run through his veins   116.8846835509337
avow freely that you accuse him   133.84903922562552
you were going to complete the fatal project you cherish in your mind   108.59765977944352
bonacieux   227.8028523318695
be silent i will write   167.80606446973437
recovering himself however he wiped the perspiration from his brows and stopped not again till he found himself at the door of the house in which his father had lived   185.61505426051392
go on said he   32.64071804288082
the door opened but before it could be closed the lady exclaimed oh lucien oh my friend   168.21555110545356
they went the whole length of the garden without uttering a word   148.56553004308282
andrea as we can see was surrounded by misfortune   102.50138151394346
d épinay went on you are still as brave in your carriage as in your assembly because you are still four against one   183.95160013668607
still this extraordinary silence appeared strange to him and he called a second and third time   183.73192555907877
favorable yesterday she may turn her back tomorrow   145.20321719372828
but since monseigneur permits me to speak freely d artagnan paused   130.61211648277094
repeat what i have told you   125.35292349404911
athos will set out two hours after by that of amiens   169.08169728917647
well once returned from the country half by the protection of her cousin half through what we have personally done for her we shall obtain from the queen what we desire   104.41970293857793
the army marched silently the prince at the head of the column   94.11648720948438
come louise said mademoiselle danglars to her friend   164.92504793153034
e   40.74925523775097
is not it true you fellows there   74.55350842380398
and monsieur leaves me here alone   3.057105783472025
monkeys are not found in our woods chained to trees said i   72.66401787296934
and the cardinal was at that period what we now call a man of progress   166.19461370834415
at this moment they were hailed by a voice from the sloop and a few seconds later men servants and baggage were aboard   122.95514124530375
a brow a little receding as is proper for poets enthusiasts and soldiers was scarcely shaded by short thin hair which like the beard which covered the lower part of his face was of a beautiful deep chestnut color   216.20288182306598
confound you and your punctuality   125.9230668473478
said he showing it   89.45490431626423
and when we have been alarmed we see nothing but trouble   142.54220942056716
what sort of person is this count of monte cristo   64.46950715761491
he stepped forward   95.5902060432835
de villefort was never known to change a determination once formed   165.243075167079
a sigh escaped him   182.72873162142233
then said the count i refer you to your confessor   102.91132894433119
arrested were they   87.32833073396299
the cardinal seated himself before his bureau and taking a sheet of paper wrote some lines upon it whilst d artagnan stood imperturbable without showing either impatience or curiosity   177.66711164454892
the actors made their entries and exits unobserved or unthought of   287.9782404992324
is it true asked gondy feigning astonishment that her majesty summoned me to ask for my opinion   115.11848806270257
by degrees everyone awoke   87.00387060476565
from these rocks that i had the good luck to cling to while our captain and the rest of the crew were all lost   156.20418953283033
well then we will put simply my lord do you remember a certain little enclosure where your life was spared   48.385447771869025
but i will endeavor a little to illustrate my meaning   223.81615138920688
they were anxious about you here   200.10982218944585
yet man will never be perfect until he learns to create and destroy   139.61353137285533
then the hand was withdrawn leaving in his an object which he perceived to be a ring   18.065004967815568
said d artagnan   164.2906096247507
the friendship which united these four men and the need they felt of seeing another three or four times a day whether for dueling business or pleasure caused them to be continually running after one another like shadows   114.42304021995
be satisfied of that   117.12951023376613
porthos told him of it in his calm manner   86.67841371415238
prince or not said the man open   89.39813862227093
a smile of terrible import passed over the count s lips   196.98475776337597
yes i have replied franz   85.10832025984004
then you can let me have some money can you not   117.19783576364105
to describe the impatience and anxiety of these two friends would be impossible   76.02312889250271
we are all invited my father madame de villefort and i at least i understood it so   60.6912954034508
d artagnan refused   121.30724627077754
we will recommend you to him   82.8240869231431
exclaimed the baroness without expressing the ideas which the exclamation betrayed   171.0851988989412
a mournful answer awaited each of edmond s eager inquiries as to the information jacopo had obtained   9.113592719122522
yes   117.6746903435644
due information was given to the authorities and permission obtained that the two funerals should take place at the same time   157.642271116562
answered danglars   142.29150969991753
one was the notary s   172.4367040033563
so you know beforehand you must perish   167.05040931986093
said the king we shall soon see whether my highlanders have betrayed me or not   75.31959634053933
both resumed their way   259.8123181341808
how did you leave the count   3.792797508115072
monte cristo took albert into his study and pointing to a seat placed another for himself   136.61795840398358
i do not understand you   98.01802250471232
there was indeed reason to retreat to be alarmed and to scream   64.71750702012771
danglars looked at him askance as though to ascertain whether he spoke seriously   125.95796959525593
yes   90.63024027217061
de la trémouille reflected for an instant   91.17991961011195
sign the liberation of milady de winter said felton holding out a paper to the duke   71.70920851364079
this is modesty indeed   160.0697802104475
it is the pede claudo of the ancients   46.67010765890926
where you please after you have put me on shore at portsmouth   85.07987654287132
but they were uttered in the romaic dialect   167.072761723435
and going quickly to the designated place they called for a bottle of wine and two glasses   85.52531628303703
have you been working all night   110.51879988148139
i tendered my resignation for when you have gained your epaulets on the battle field you do not know how to manœuvre on the slippery grounds of the salons   82.69993936485336
god pardon me   166.0246493988535
they re entered the boat which had brought them to the louvre and thence proceeded to the halles   81.43466705253198
the slave of the count of monte cristo   221.41339389076654
at the same time she seized that of her son and joined them together   34.18160414288741
the old man s eyes beamed with an expression of gentle affection   105.41179006535826
once for all tréville had placed his stable at d artagnan s service   207.46167840774615
and however the old sailor and his crew tried to pump him they extracted nothing more from him   117.71514084749639
well on the faith of a minister   74.97214828947304
well said he they likewise have refused me   152.53597150129323
bah   199.94767841271982
i see my lord i shall be obliged to fetch a second grimaud   48.80867203015666
i thought so   102.43624920543606
i had risked my life and favor to see you but for a second   91.59348716044565
but he died calmly and peaceably because in dying he knew what i should do   78.49314917195021
0148m eh pardieu   64.1890727210916
ah reverend sir i tell you the simple truth   176.32491507613136
i again reminded her that you were a friend and that she need not conceal anything from you   116.03090577724242
chapter l   125.1968310712752
cried athos   54.52257090260103
she first extended her arms to prevent me but after a moment s reflection yes go florentin said she and may he come quickly   136.98236140480304
i am aware of that and i have told him a hundred times that he was wrong   114.81729725992942
for she would have served as the sport of the whole band   74.71532136423816
they were a pen ink and paper   143.56375851383697
said aramis   131.14130649394292
as to the sailors of the pharaon they must have found snug berths elsewhere for they also had disappeared   110.12087573420331
the young louis was already dressed with the exception of his shoes and doublet   150.46518814711544
your excellency said the man you are fully persuaded of my entire devotion to you are you not   20.021538123746083
we will return someday to pray over her grave   144.16097514904078
i think that disgust is even more sickening than hatred   1.269569107911991
we performed the usual burial service and he is at his rest sewn up in his hammock with a thirty six pound shot at his head and his heels off el giglio island   78.11057250576751
d artagnan saluted went out and hastened to repeat to his friend mazarin s flattering promises which gave porthos an indescribable happiness   202.60805659867455
on arriving at the extremity of the castle d artagnan found himself overlooking a beautiful valley in which at the foot of a charming little lake stood several scattered houses which humble in their aspect and covered some with tiles others with thatch seemed to acknowledge as their sovereign lord a pretty chateau built about the beginning of the reign of henry iv   60.20928316383291
adieu raoul said the count   170.1165868277227
smuggling is a profitable trade when a certain degree of vigor and intelligence is employed   36.16974849421166
i will listen   172.18658991603803
said milady with the utmost ingenuousness   104.66409452300653
would you like to hear the story sir   58.450604431398034
he dragged himself towards the child s body and examined it as a lioness contemplates its dead cub   7.8809520298787135
indeed count you are the most polished man in the world   149.9959984821352
sir   76.1303690104208
but if he should be a cavalier   125.15523559302602
only during the respite the absence of his rival afforded him he reflected partly on the means of deceiving mercédès as to the cause of his absence partly on plans of emigration and abduction as from time to time he sat sad and motionless on the summit of cape pharo at the spot from whence marseilles and the catalans are visible watching for the apparition of a young and handsome man who was for him also the messenger of vengeance   185.49003203429004
monte cristo approached and dropped on his purple lips three or four drops of the contents of the phial   165.28012972601138
how do i know   171.09806827230545
dear good renée whispered villefort as he gazed with unutterable tenderness on the lovely speaker   49.0205927689434
she shuddered and yet had not strength to utter a word   76.145326904424
but the night passed away without any fresh attempt on the part of my persecutor   127.40103583226734
and besides loves your majesty too well   114.53876452929725
yes   162.24763636704463
a shudder crept through the judges at the revelation of these unknown crimes   66.93193923092242
why do you remember when it forgets   58.93068055431247
the good abbess had naturally consented to her request   57.612960725880924
to name them would be to commit them to ruin so i merely said they were fifty and we were two   52.31760972565917
yes   211.02222306878565
exactly like me   140.86773737879764
he presented himself this morning with a bond of 40 000 francs payable at sight on you signed by busoni and returned by you to me with your endorsement of course i immediately counted him over the forty bank notes   134.4680075678817
i killed one man if i recollect rightly replied d artagnan with a look of inquiry directed to athos   87.90419850878368
yes but with a jovial partner and dice and guineas clinking on the cloth the night passes like a dream   95.91870936270887
but asked danglars in a timid tone how did you manage about the other formalities the contract the settlement   200.6205318204013
look at it and tell me what you think of it   189.31981543182062
well   84.72907538267029
he is beadle   124.60524313877114
the count laid his hand on franz s shoulder   151.45147810094193
it was perhaps some plot against you   223.37636003230176
what cried morcerf   108.17304928607379
besides he did not wear a sword and the others treated him with small consideration   29.97735274331501
do you know who carried off your wife   167.04946126242896
but never mind let us hear your plan for dinner porthos   97.55197538637032
you have heard what i said   150.9660048614519
i have reached my destination   161.67073312873504
repeated the doctor   67.86163358893339
said the marquis   216.51966563337615
yes for you my lord but not for the queen   112.0692538147525
i have had no occasion to notice him particularly   183.56707601981478
ah my mother my poor mother   112.24956313937224
has he anything remarkable about him by which one may recognize him   118.34636920605178
yes that was the way it ended   28.932517045541772
tell them oh tell them that corpse belongs to me   270.0525183596612
for added he the future can not fail to mend   190.78636478130997
of course   116.3325978836072
and thirdly from my own imagination   168.102366956806
said the procurator rising yet supporting his weight upon the arms of his cane chair   91.08705376164878
whence have you these ideas of death   80.27452207572907
chapter 100   14.29194867011664
and that you should fail me   100.60620821258496
i go he said only shall i enter the chamber where those gentlemen are   195.7049082957205
the minister made a slight sign with his head whereupon the queen said to madame beauvais it is time for the king to go to bed   61.107806586988325
we have cruelly wounded as you know that personal pride by which d artagnan is blindly governed   43.22688826923883
since none but the dead pass freely from this dungeon let me take the place of the dead   185.44401361651103
shadows ran as if bewildered to and fro on the vessel and mournful cries accompanied these delirious walkers   58.248204737058586
why should i   20.81049762636364
danglars said monte cristo   105.07697320444112
athos wished to restrain him but it was too late   139.3924129050478
this is a fruitful soil and i feel certain that the seed sown will not be cast on barren ground   110.15532719056205
before grimaud had finished he rose without noise and putting his mouth to aramis s ear and at the same time touching him on the shoulder to prevent a sudden movement chevalier he said get up and don t make the least noise   169.41765837659185
apoplexy is a rare disease among fowls i believe but very common among men   133.16396174433982
in what state was the house when you left   198.9080907779438
i mean that miserable d artagnan   84.92286036920292
yes said porthos let us break the door in and fall upon him   240.3609338678439
said valentine maximilian come back i entreat you   172.85746816987995
through the grating however dantès saw they were passing through the rue caisserie and by the rue saint laurent and the rue taramis to the quay   124.74294049300802
madame de villefort was overpowered   69.95553421670138
monte cristo pointed to a chair which the procureur was obliged to take the trouble to move forwards himself while the count merely fell back into his own on which he had been kneeling when m   63.22630089354906
d artagnan ran out and returned directly after   143.33090935991157
danglars intended travelling to venice where he would receive one part of his fortune and then proceeding to vienna where he would find the rest he meant to take up his residence in the latter town which he had been told was a city of pleasure   166.66842339229524
emmanuel did not conceal his joy at the peaceful termination of the affair and was loud in his expressions of delight   150.63102904723686
felton was indeed behind the door and had not lost one word of this scene   122.22908308332977
is the abbé at home   24.244422334659703
he has said it and will do it   111.95573131765649
i don t know   182.36838800795286
he entered and on his way met the waiter   150.12884698917122
that woman was once a young girl as beautiful as she is today   142.25435775110503
d artagnan here   184.75418013716535
does not your eminence fear that the punishment inflicted upon ravaillac may deter anyone who might entertain the idea of imitating him   122.72393951442908
the suicide meanwhile monte cristo had also returned to town with emmanuel and maximilian   97.52852929434188
it is that we are each of us twenty years older   61.60281153108462
monsieur d artagnan shall die   196.31530142077474
jean in front of the silver buffet of the city which was guarded by four archers   137.35049538928843
at the moment he went out a piercing glance darted through the opening of the nearly closed door and she perceived felton who drew quickly to one side to prevent being seen by her   124.36788197768273
my mother was a christian and she prayed   178.49870729088025
pardieu   190.0919566347519
said athos in a low tone to d artagnan after explaining to him in french what the sailor had said in english   101.66580423153925
i am a man of honor said d artagnan determined to come to an end and since your love is mine and i am satisfied i possess it for i do possess it do i not   100.9305750852566
hum   190.56362166063894
the count recalled baptistin who had left the room after delivering the letter   83.87098461540518
but said franz in his turn interrupting his host s meditations you had some motive for coming here may i beg to know what it was   41.03248318452022
returned d artagnan   154.13135747248506
as the carriage started off the cries were redoubled and more than ten thousand people thronged the quai and overflowed the pont neuf and adjacent streets   31.098548998754296
i have always served you faithfully cried bertuccio in despair   171.78627793200212
first a thrust with the coadjutor whom i met last night at madame de rambouillet s and whom i found particular in his remarks respecting me   63.057444194472396
nobody knows better than yourself that the bandits of corsica are not rogues or thieves but purely and simply fugitives driven by some sinister motive from their native town or village and that their fellowship involves no disgrace or stigma   159.57676542542998
he examined the broken stock calculated what change it would require to adapt the gun to his shoulder and made a fresh stock so beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen or twenty piastres had he chosen to sell it   55.74570610113769
the deliverance of the cardinal perhaps   125.26635958127007
cried d artagnan making the best face possible and never retreating one step before his three assailants who continued to shower blows upon him   39.972573312395255
diable   139.4978771846267
albert listened trembling now with hope then with anger and then again with shame for from beauchamp s confidence he knew his father was guilty and he asked himself how since he was guilty he could prove his innocence   106.5697035736509
ck from the small creek to the east in a right line   109.2338159321353
have you seen him   31.804185828808656
in the baroness s box i believe   162.8077613639404
would not m   135.3393989981312
said debray to franz   157.6560057527987
said d artagnan   105.2169359164821
danglars by the unexpected appearance of the brigade of soldiers and by the disclosure which had followed the mansion was deserted with as much rapidity as if a case of plague or of cholera morbus had broken out among the guests   164.2947812680917
meanwhile andrea and the two executioners were struggling on the ground and he kept exclaiming he ought to die   55.18267034208156
well those studs continued mme   195.78083359891565
then turning to his men allow these gentlemen to pass he said   91.85656006524547
indeed   24.209299507627904
may i venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit   185.41299567776105
a rapid change took place in the young man s feelings   76.96133463252
what reason do you assign   65.61660151333683
then said the coadjutor this evening at ten o clock and if i am pleased with you another bag of five hundred pistoles will be at your disposal   45.140361431580345
morrel and this day and a half was lost from pure whim for the pleasure of going ashore and nothing else   93.41579334944397
the presentation when albert found himself alone with monte cristo my dear count said he allow me to commence my services as cicerone by showing you a specimen of a bachelor s apartment   63.98684246232241
but what are you going to do until this evening   113.38420282143755
if on the sixteenth day after your departure at eight o clock in the evening you are not here no money even if it be but five minutes past eight   119.85614762704208
suggested athos   136.91716679846715
yes   167.96950286184557
yes in truth yes answered the young lady turning very red i do remember conversing with a person wrapped in a long woollen mantle   77.7365982796964
these devote their blood those their nightly labors to the same cause   76.43162516959856
friquet and nanette continued to shout   114.51079158726655
multitudinously is good said château renaud   283.2043120477156
i may sleep perhaps at an inn   79.49545508774122
what is her name   133.3535175904234
really he is by no means a light load   97.02750994576795
at the end of three months he had learned to read   208.71476306192383
50271m then he said aloud listen morrel i see your grief is great but still you do not like to risk your soul   294.420466776743
i now understand why you are in the service of cromwell   72.57823458812273
can it be   36.26728050191093
m   18.957139924364142
fortunately they have left me all i had   211.50398382141705
yonder is the house porthos said the gascon   86.10142342992172
you are mistaken   135.84845403356795
d artagnan said nothing but twirled his mustache with a peculiar gesture which showed that his fine gascon humor was awake   77.25805312672561
i have the price   124.30664476205641
raoul on foot for he had not time to mount his horse again tired like the guards of distributing blows with the flat of his sword had recourse to its point   173.88044042028787
you will lose the preference and that will be your fault   173.13142914947082
we have not a minute to lose   157.47796325388845
the juncture was favorable   100.93807320633921
until to morrow evening you are not at your own disposal   146.04093468161557
and not a man to instruct them   147.6410999381934
d artagnan saw that the moment was come   100.29611186030957
the abbess who was the daughter of a noble house took particular delight in stories of the court which so seldom travel to the extremities of the kingdom and which above all have so much difficulty in penetrating the walls of convents at whose threshold the noise of the world dies away   114.50605563838299
ho   103.4877314916866
asked the host   196.11616126394105
i must be somewhat altered since he last saw me   228.77674053913762
no   126.22838835653774
this sediment first took a blue shade then from the color of sapphire it passed to that of opal and from opal to emerald   146.71802874947798
m   43.373102844607814
yes replied a gendarme   119.93015921785721
for what purpose   136.9582106190606
grimaud fell precipitated into the moat   117.57465192354172
that madame is an official secret   92.45500455476574
uncle and nephew   72.79173599279866
oh my god   127.3532340407773
tomorrow immediately when you please   88.37176788170302
she asked me not to send the protestants of la rochelle the assistance i promised them   99.45444518866516
nothing else   118.940794037883
dried plants minerals and stuffed birds their flame colored wings outspread in motionless flight and their beaks forever open   162.69645745088565
well do you comprehend now   196.8850564026189
one of the most charming persons that lives mademoiselle frances d aubigne   147.71872726559727
we don t know the locality and shall never find the wall   92.66146034655347
it is the usual block answered the man in the mask   8.497917713299387
and if this person be not a smuggler who is he   180.41557708689908
said to bear the name   39.122189876443855
the latter put his hand to his sword and said with the smile of a man who for thirty years has jested with death would you assassinate me sir   64.36168793930707
face long and brown   88.65969992280003
perhaps you are an officer that i am detaining here   41.86085438863307
i think decidedly observed aramis gentlemen that the son hasn t his mother s energy   98.65013255442894
m   88.72179614936849
strike i am prepared for everything   142.32041140900722
at the sight of him she expected though probably not in such a costume the young woman started in terror and was about to make a hasty retreat   72.9226773771567
and you couldn t remember   129.2072209084836
no more do i and that was what i was observing to this gentleman just now   83.97346610514887
so soon as she was left alone with the woman whom the baron had summoned to her assistance she opened her eyes   139.82866018041557
with repressed smile come in baron and tell the duke all you know the latest news of m   141.0820329345819
exclaimed la carconte rising and descending to the chamber with a tolerably firm step   149.99210181843603
his first cry was for his father   68.42014210960654
in the first place la rochelle appeared impregnable   48.684653814622266
i should like to have seen his face at that moment   131.38232112575056
on coming near the bank she jumped lightly on shore and took to flight   66.27866619877398
have pity on me doctor   102.66906128297828
in that box   130.28334122205186
he said nothing almost nothing scratches nothing more   117.4930204025317
attend to it then at once   121.97088614731524
i have just discovered how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that eat his peaches   151.91866970627217
yes indeed   56.59335773322073
during this time the jeweller made the diamond play and sparkle in the lamplight and the gem threw out jets of light which made him unmindful of those which precursors of the storm began to play in at the windows   208.40549584547756
alas   120.65212185369738
perused too the application dated 10th april 1815 in which morrel by the deputy procureur s advice exaggerated with the best intentions for napoleon was then on the throne the services dantès had rendered to the imperial cause services which villefort s certificates rendered indisputable   161.77094697507266
between these large dishes were smaller ones containing various dainties   135.90891009710901
you have a sword by your side i have one in my cane   212.73239290380428
hurrah for you then my beautiful lady cried the captain   208.75088924923097
but in order to have known everything so well you must have been an eye witness   224.1203145727057
at last   99.98840727530944
this done instead of leaving the door fastened he drew back the bolts and even placed the door ajar as though he had left the room forgetting to close it and slipping into the chimney like a man accustomed to that kind of gymnastic exercise after replacing the chimney board which represented achilles with deidamia and effacing the very marks of his feet upon the ashes he commenced climbing the hollow tunnel which afforded him the only means of escape left   155.02579865301166
albert wandered about the theatre until the curtain was drawn up   113.09979021271482
the elder prisoner pondered the matter   162.4238154793285
if d artagnan forgets his host or appears to forget him under the pretense of not knowing where he has been carried we will not forget him and we know where he is   113.31372289771106
for i think you told me it was a boy m   62.75398314955238
let those who have ears hear and those who have eyes see   47.32324987021225
you believe and yet you deliver me up to him who fills and defiles the world with his heresies and debaucheries to that infamous sardanapalus whom the blind call the duke of buckingham and whom believers name antichrist   77.63922074513451
asked the cardinal   56.39599219788833
captain gaumard recovered from his illness had returned from palma   85.84926959944184
at least according to pistache   135.94814693640785
the fourth was to return to béthune in order to inform athos and serve as a guide to the four friends   116.66694348334177
and it is a rather difficult matter   223.39573710510763
said he what does this mean   224.31873762740656
twas a thrust from a sword but his cuirass turned aside the blow   123.64749930758902
make room   113.70561214189081
d artagnan being the bearer of the letter is naturally the head of the enterprise   89.35983198993826
what are you going to do   144.53800570571227
but what is the matter albert   171.12452960827915
a whole bottle if you will drink my health   125.07440965278849
moral wounds have this peculiarity they may be hidden but they never close   110.95609634427883
be assured replied albert that if i had been aware of your arrival in paris and had known your address i should have paid my respects to you before this   153.384479731957
good morning madame said the count bowing   44.126647414957915
now as i have never known any sinbad with the exception of the one celebrated in the thousand and one nights well it is one of his descendants and a great friend of mine   82.21927739981668
but still her voice involuntarily murmured softly edmond edmond edmond   228.87751086337698
de blacas returned as speedily as he had departed but in the antechamber he was forced to appeal to the king s authority   126.99627511262887
at the sound of the key turning in the lock and the creaking of the hinges dantès who was crouched in a corner of the dungeon whence he could see the ray of light that came through a narrow iron grating above raised his head   182.19541686003828
rapid as had been villefort s glance it had served to give him an idea of the man he was about to interrogate   72.44495500451148
andrea felt his heart leap with joy   28.9438722341922
then give me a letter to him and tell him to sell out without an instant s delay perhaps even now i shall arrive too late   167.21462304193366
bonacieux   117.10373650601677
how many guns gentlemen   92.67448561622882
zounds   38.88669455815348
the old man listened attentively making a sign only that it was all so   154.05905131012378
chapter 90   101.25556737023963
he saw a corpse at his feet   84.47815217449676
he then set himself to work to count his fortune   147.02071047410732
please to know monsieur porthos said she that my strongbox the strongbox of a procurator s wife though it may be is better filled than those of your affected minxes   40.5011987545447
in that respect my dear friend it s delightful   100.9332943145472
in fact a great noise was heard in the ante chamber   122.39133527049302
his excellency did not charge me to purchase this house   172.63278797279352
the lackeys were ordered to act as sentinels   186.25104174862398
monsieur the comte de la fere whose family is allied to the montmorency and the rohan is easily the equal of monsieur de mazarin   181.97319699014247
but peppino instead of answering threw himself on his knees seized the count s hand and covered it with kisses   111.31900325704753
she drew her husband to the door   103.78434619501287
stop   116.83608870897751
it is i   98.19148651489678
asked porthos   173.48221501678447
this very instant   120.98040564492202
well then said the host your young master was here a quarter of an hour ago   70.79442473715542
i felt in bending my head toward you your beautiful hair touch my cheek   37.624356474649076
he said   154.31173449285336
no madame they struck me always struck me   232.90806870733383
suddenly she heard a step she knew turned anxiously around the door opened and fernand dressed in the uniform of a sub lieutenant stood before her   119.3392204368806
oh if you do know him cried julie can you tell us where he is where we can find him   153.19752269501618
villefort suffocating pressed the doctor s arm   88.33819114223952
grimaud made a sign in the affirmative   178.8335021062153
eugénie bowed not as a submissive daughter but as an adversary prepared for a discussion   232.66865421014302
ali is my slave and in saving your life he was but discharging his duty to me   23.580810544127175
he determined therefore to direct his course as clear from it as he could when on the opposite side of the road from behind a rock he perceived the extremity of another musket   141.4905751149446
and for myself i will write to you depend on me   120.7447777650757
he said there he is at his post   90.03541022494295
let me carry it out and we shall laugh   12.069804872781432
porthos opened his mouth thinking it a good opportunity to put in a word in his turn   49.805225442376155
then turning to noirtier do you hope the assassin will be tried   19.35758636821494
instead of that louise do you understand   99.63628123334323
in the name of heaven duke leave me go   194.75387449306322
bertuccio you make use of heraldic terms   60.530764290662596
yes returned franz finding that the count was coming to the point he wished   84.62019751380339
and he arose   47.595945235376064
his eminence then orders me said the lady   147.792494776794
all this was achieved in much less time than is occupied in the recital   44.53227811736791
on the contrary i am certain he will do so   197.56874224074446
the four friends followed ten paces behind him   59.534143057542536
the report of a cannon announced that something new and unexpected had taken place   111.96138396147767
no   172.8949884484005
cried d artagnan   74.33008494237754
silence is the last joy of the unhappy   52.82296592745263
be easy kitty there is something between that man and me that he is quite ignorant of he nearly made me lose my credit with his eminence   207.5455984067466
so much do i esteem them that i am going to make the comte de la fere a visit that i may converse with him tete a tete and that we may not be disturbed at our interview you must conduct him as i said before to the pavilion of the orangery   68.83403850490946
but as to the sword he said it was sealed to its place and should never quit it until its master should himself quit his lodgings   76.53488986680651
a jest   219.98369092608078
the doctor was right   97.00739547554261
upon my word you did well to come back   137.449077768389
but by this evening there will be four   166.53351853897416
why should i obtain you by violence if our love is mutual   95.24105311542955
see sir replied caderousse in this corner is a crucifix in holy wood here on this shelf is my wife s testament   167.93685759238622
henceforth we have nothing to fear   141.70925644379207
well sir i am waiting with impatience to hear what you wish to say to me   64.78233849165443
i had but to write to the duchesse but i won t repeat her name for i am incapable of compromising a woman   20.970481122769357
athos she is your wife i tell you repeated d artagnan   40.38651421211782
the young man rose and took a step toward her   41.643269967265
our young friend will be extremely well received   118.67298203146132
the swiss became as purple as a peony   170.80349133233614
de villefort   79.18522600228891
mordaunt s very lips grew white with rage   141.1057314455972
i was like you and had a king in keeping   148.7013949136188
to regret the world is to regret the devil   72.18780289027393
the conversation between milady and the cavalier was so animated that d artagnan stopped on the other side of the carriage without anyone but the pretty soubrette perceiving his presence   81.52378276552989
ah yes it is true murmured d avrigny   97.62863112742679
answered caderousse double locking the door   159.41463625974188
it was then that ali tepelini after having sent to the sultan a french officer in whom he reposed great confidence resolved to retire to the asylum which he had long before prepared for himself and which he called kataphygion or the refuge   143.04924946457683
here we are said monte cristo   186.53470065428004
come now you don t really wish it   102.93229928838444
i have seen him also said d artagnan   96.39301655417657
what might be the consequences   177.88576072446693
to get married   43.93631376466925
but in a word what are you going to do   117.16523829185444
listen then lord winter   108.9207078512164
ah he has a palace   145.01462425554575
just so   206.34290408225274
i   126.2274693493051
but the vehicle turned to one side leaving the barrier behind and danglars saw that it was one of the ramparts encircling rome   164.17748914954458
be it so said the count come   43.124668222968424
said beauchamp   153.52467556416485
impossible   143.04083180306958
yes   165.1484402862834
it was the letter of aramis monsieur d artagnan you know that i have had a quarrel with a certain gentleman who has given me an appointment for this evening in the place royale   136.50834055174218
very possibly i may not go answered franz   160.34805900315394
her innocence had kept her in ignorance of the dangers that might assail a young girl of her age   205.85601944812208
i merely await your commands   134.58556006748418
come then my friend we will go forward   1.9569057789618824
oh your majesty exclaimed laporte monsieur d artagnan is right   112.2532109566312
preoccupied as monsieur was with the letter he had received he did not observe that   158.59928633154044
at court provided you have ever the honor to go there continued m   155.37310563221965
this was their mutual declaration of love   119.08465198627465
caderousse drew a deep breath   56.816349531714984
i scarcely know replied the count   42.726347844328245
yes mademoiselle you especially replied the doctor abruptly   78.0226871510181
yes sir   132.42404214223853
anne of austria looked with wonderment on the warlike countenance of d artagnan which betrayed a singular expression of deep feeling   132.56298294045143
i think replied porthos it would be imprudent to attempt the same manoeuvre again   132.50312193807002
the queen entered   205.09658389651332
was a villain   79.80020440648366
the shops were deserted houses closed   188.7815704099043
as for the ladies it is needless to say that while they coveted the millions they thought they did not need them for themselves as they were beautiful enough without them   121.73012048196611
for a week since he had resolved to die and during the four days that he had been carrying out his purpose edmond had not spoken to the attendant had not answered him when he inquired what was the matter with him and turned his face to the wall when he looked too curiously at him   184.93572846455186
he found pleasure in feeling the water trickle over his burning brow and over his body agitated by feverish shudders   84.38103899948143
and d artagnan answered having first asked the word of the cardinal louis and rocroy   172.6985674288981
hell has made you rich hell has given you another name hell has almost made you another face   138.60171895268968
and the best advice we can give you is to do so unresistingly   91.37759738145486
their agony formed part of their merit if they were not seen alive they were despised when dead   117.01020062210098
the latter were occupied in breaking up the pavement and stretching chains across the streets when headed by the coadjutor appeared the prince de conti the brother of the prince de condé and the duc de longueville his brother in law   184.00440066481787
i have never interfered in your affairs excepting for your good   150.3175667908022
what of the postscript   136.12225496652118
on descending the queen found the prince awaiting her bare headed to offer her his hand   160.47519450144236
but at the moment when the cardinal saw his means already bearing fruit and applauded himself for having put it in action an inhabitant of la rochelle who had contrived to pass the royal lines god knows how such was the watchfulness of bassompierre schomberg and the duc d angoulême themselves watched over by the cardinal an inhabitant of la rochelle we say entered the city coming from portsmouth and saying that he had seen a magnificent fleet ready to sail within eight days   40.474775618697834
one only   154.24991826882913
yes yes they could not help admitting that the king for whom we sacrificed rank wealth and station was truly our louis the well beloved while their wretched usurper has been and ever will be to them their evil genius their napoleon the accursed   85.3908508900258
that is it is it not monseigneur and i shall have nothing else to do   35.789263701098065
then de wardes to whom i have given three sword wounds   98.75872407869379
last of all i speak to you   129.15159000564418
oh bid him enter   165.57114300630246
well said the baroness do you leave m   208.89513002549845
well sir what do you require of me and what document is it that you wish to be drawn up   56.692174399525484
yes yes mazarin continued whilst his wonted smile full of subtlety lent a strange expression to his pale lips   60.321496568423214
well said monte cristo it is just as i thought   87.69706839372634
a charming woman was that marie michon resumed athos one of those wild creatures who are constantly conceiving the strangest ideas   129.81334035623527
de morcerf s that messrs   13.82269290979643
that is the very truth cried the mercer   100.2505492164859
ah he is not a man like that cursed d artagnan   188.8334148132892
to have you as long as possible near me to hear your eloquent speech which embellishes my mind strengthens my soul and makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible things if i should ever be free so fills my whole existence that the despair to which i was just on the point of yielding when i knew you has no longer any hold over me   95.61192465779062
the fortunes of that monarch now are at low water   201.3544607715657
and who is the countess g   210.3332588539868
we learn this from the memoirs of a man who was concerned in some few of these defeats and in many of these victories   131.1286616009936
ten kicks on his back   134.64250822314034
i require an order which would ratify beforehand all that i should think proper to do for the greatest good of france   193.082716009283
the prince is beaten since he can no longer fight   76.99896222486603
men of the robe and men of the sword chapter xvi   74.6852025488031
my master had appetite enough three days ago but what can one do   92.57916511815567
the more so that the ship was sinking under us and seemed to say get along save yourselves   134.22083428492277
if i bore my name you would have heard one of the most illustrious names of england   174.91434843534995
still no answer   157.5493354144477
de blacas wiped the moisture from his brow   84.81869521869154
she held a book in her hand and her arm was supported by a cushion   93.88237531426125
have you brought it   119.89907604154375
and that is the reason why i have the honor to inform your eminence of what has happened   71.66295200546813
raoul   97.28764178359609
athos followed him before the felucca rose again on the waves   116.62407941096829
arrest musketeers   101.68486948552095
i will try and think over what is the best thing to be done   91.82321645228734
heaven grant that this may not be visited upon him   141.4859099016496
and without adding another word grimaud profiting by the astonishment and terror into which he had thrown his auditors rushed from the room   119.26147223991957
but when i did so the shade disappeared   174.90615527109475
said dantès turning pale and looking alternately at the hollow cheeks of the old man and the empty cupboards   100.829086809009
but this proved useless for though he knocked ten or twelve times in succession no one answered and some of the neighbors who put their noses out of their windows or were brought to their doors by the noise had assured him that that house all the openings of which were tightly closed had not been inhabited for six months   128.41265272225567
d artagnan put the gold in his hat and in going back to the chateau settled the reckoning with porthos each of them had cleared two hundred and fifteen louis   144.58259480508724
had madame de saint méran any enemies   133.65145044281195
it would be a difficult matter to arrange said monte cristo   101.15279274321651
the baron d épinay was my friend as you know and an alliance with his son is the most suitable thing that could possibly be arranged   100.48309573614448
the young men rode up to the wounded man to announce that they were followed by the priest   126.00897217797392
maximilian had scarcely finished his story during which the count s heart had swelled within him when emmanuel entered wearing a hat and coat   198.47171199654426
some voices even added long live the marshal   106.25766879161327
i wish to be providence myself for i feel that the most beautiful noblest most sublime thing in the world is to recompense and punish   45.624780310593025
said d artagnan with that jeering manner which our readers have so often observed in him since they made his acquaintance   153.39044087800096
now said the unknown to franz i do not know if you are of my opinion but i think nothing is more annoying than to remain two or three hours together without knowing by name or appellation how to address one another   48.109124446239946
thank you sir   162.805809708514
replied anne with queen like dignity extending toward the open coffer an arm despite the lapse of years still beautiful   176.48516891547828
i am determined to tell them all about it   99.74575409538447
no i don t want your help watch the cardinal   125.28569138953785
that s more time than we want   176.35506971727614
though i have had but little evidence of that good nature of which your eminence speaks   135.84883543138278
indeed the name of bernajoux was known to all the world d artagnan alone excepted perhaps   88.88889482224647
for the first time an emotion of terror reminded her that she was a woman   129.44061308220577
what do you want with us   197.80055477803222
a second after he saw it again approaching with frightful rapidity   136.16609386899287
i am a gallant fellow   106.4504055928958
is supper ready signor pastrini   71.1454002234305
go therefore and await it at boulogne sur mer and promise me to set out to morrow morning   128.31787837459817
meanwhile the object of this hideous admiration approached the wicket against which one of the keepers was leaning   13.496206351666231
they ask where i was born   107.61010047700452
well i wait patiently do i not   134.47645337857864
50119m where is morrel   147.00502268913647
they deputed ten of their number to wait upon the duke of orleans who according to his custom affected popularity   28.234670710962845
his eye seemed to burn with a devouring fire   133.80507217770756
love   127.90370781246699
and scratches himself for amusement added the king   137.62293933264434
he is going to turn his house into a badhaus as the germans term it   56.015283055460095
• you provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies you in writing or by e mail within 30 days of receipt that s he does not agree to the terms of the full project gutenberg™ license   113.14983735396298
mousqueton collected a store of crusts   112.29347292764521
andrea shuddered   169.84947554210544
these arcades opened on one side into the corridor where the count and franz were and on the other into a large square chamber entirely surrounded by niches similar to those of which we have spoken   116.6782563347904
boy see if the mule belonging to the monk is still in the stable   114.74791528059288
scarron and raoul laughed   126.84563225742872
yes replied the abbé it is very affecting   139.52069780424773
d épinay was quite a child when his father died he knows very little of m   183.70987388397793
dear benedetto said he i think he will not be sorry to inherit his fortune and he who hastens the day when he can touch his five hundred thousand will not be his worst friend   101.8608651040986
this was all the visitor wished to ascertain or rather all the englishman appeared to know   110.70099462504578
you are too fortunate in your love for play not to take its revenge   0.4999578831560143
fortunately we have the great cardinal   136.84296505326392
danglars smiled and seemed to say it is of no consequence   19.26430227492557
there was no child disinterred no   125.01215713325561
and why have you come here   66.80566699629344
but what has this vision of henry iv   98.80408160911216
but he will make it up in you i am sure   143.1920917680458
thereupon the cardinal hearing the clock strike eleven bowed low asking permission of the king to retire and supplicating him to come to a good understanding with the queen   111.06472963230999
there were benches here and there   69.64746889886915
1   33.295098787370534
oh heavens   77.74310763401043
the concert must be a delightful one   137.9965419574125
a shorter clerk came behind the first a taller clerk behind the second a stripling of a dozen years rising behind the third   67.66927470167943
the editor was reading with apparent delight a leading article in the same paper on beet sugar probably a composition of his own   159.6784794608634
but all things are possible   116.4736396827295
because like machiavelli i desired to alter the political face of italy and instead of allowing it to be split up into a quantity of petty principalities each held by some weak or tyrannical ruler i sought to form one large compact and powerful empire   80.35380371671526
but all the time he was in paris you of course did not lose sight of him   77.0766591503704
arrived at leghorn he repaired to the house of a jew a dealer in precious stones to whom he disposed of four of his smallest diamonds for five thousand francs each   154.26694595362875
old woman   78.64157888343018
the king is surrounded by an army which is conducting him to london   59.60847211847068
this brought back to franz in spite of himself the recollection of the terror with which the count had inspired the countess g and her firm conviction that the man in the opposite box was a vampire   97.20940205189774
the man of meung   220.2398604340419
think often of raoul   118.83901646290806
do you believe it was because i committed the sacrilege of mounting en croupe behind henry iv   49.96932809916713
at midnight the two travelers were at dammartin but it was then too late to make inquiries the host of the cygne de la croix had gone to bed   80.34829786028817
take them said cromwell   154.57818881304843
how s that   124.47650660962924
how can i tell   163.9914721586792
they say that monsieur de buckingham is in france replied aramis with a significant smile which gave to this sentence apparently so simple a tolerably scandalous meaning   82.01291070692022
it is in poor taste to make a display of a challenge   158.36287919873652
he has five or six rings as testimonials from eastern monarchs of his services   82.0251395780693

my lord if among these forty there had been one good way he would have been out long ago   57.94137961921594
this is the mode in which they manage these things and succeed in eastern climes where there are grave and phlegmatic persons who care very little for the questions of time in conjunctures of importance   47.14971870290405
i am john francis de winter he repeated and that woman well that woman   158.99680926978576
i also i love you   27.089187767839277
but are you really the executioner of bethune as these people say   160.6275253791148
of the evil you have done said the voice   109.37975677808824
i think he was your colleague   137.95685235531764
i was going to ask you replied the baroness with a beating heart   70.15579774245111
is there nothing more you wish   52.89069939580233
de villefort cried he i am delighted to see you   105.49736491884481
villefort ceased to contend   98.90633427267996
edmond rose again but this time his legs did not tremble and his sight was clear   68.06647483954727
but there was such an ardor in his eyes such persuasion in his voice that she felt herself constrained to confide in him   107.70650646203254

i am afraid that remaining at blois would be dangerous to his youthful mind   146.44078872230045
what injury has fernand mondego done you in betraying ali tepelini   80.88440120553895
but why valentine do you persist in anticipating the worst why picture so gloomy a future   3.3977545850147806
well m   116.70519768456927
madame said the cardinal affecting an effusive frankness of speech i shall convince your majesty i trust of my devotion to you and my desire to terminate an affair which you have so much at heart   173.3981508547416
now as they had already traveled eleven leagues d artagnan thought it time to stop whether porthos were or were not in the inn   63.79759632268089
i know this because the landlord came into my apartment when he left his   115.3761807483336
yes i know that said buckingham   144.3769776904827
she must have a long arm   186.61587033198623
these symptoms to a less alarming extent were the same which had preceded the death of barrois   146.6442933633356
the prisoners therefore had remained silent as they marched along in company with their conquerors which they could do with the less difficulty since each of them had occupation enough in answering his own thoughts   135.43356349913665
morrel reddened for his own conscience was not quite clear on politics   26.312515497094395
asked la ramee   64.27760854924333
your friend edmond dantès count of monte cristo   172.68163740450717
no   137.23562972887265
danglars coming out of his cabin who will furnish you with every particular   116.42796177443647
ah   144.4740026562951
undoubtedly   94.05121624399042
upon this plate was written with the point of a large pin rueil   109.44061694170834
not a tree not a street that he passed but seemed filled with dear and cherished memories   156.93974320372027
silence   250.73487194211856
said morrel   35.92124343709958
in exchange for his silence athos drank enough for four and without appearing to be otherwise affected by wine than by a more marked constriction of the brow and by a deeper sadness   174.37245043417977
i believe he has not a franc in his possession   174.375183620116
he demands your head   214.8980538336598
of what   144.72491748626447
and inquired dantès with some hesitation do you know how my father is   48.858876593416454
he has rendered the whole life of one who had the right to expect from heaven that portion of happiness god has promised to everyone of his creatures an existence of misery and infamy   50.39944041509462
that letter you have received and which you believe to be from madame de chevreuse well   74.03072001397558
hold your tongue imprudent man   74.84460901947358
albert completely exhausted with the exercise which invigorated monte cristo was sleeping in an armchair near the window while the count was designing with his architect the plan of a conservatory in his house when the sound of a horse at full speed on the high road made albert look up   213.5011963411795
let us die then as de winter has died   86.12653647997678
go   77.17941066896573
yes monsieur said the englishman bowing   95.19047483347347
will you take charge of our invitation to messieurs cavalcanti   64.76576559483323
or at least i will go later   114.91935726517157
yes my lord said the young man with such peculiar emphasis that the cardinal felt a shudder run through every vein   170.80212418563104
it is enough said athos bowing low if the lives of three men can purchase yours madame   130.37560288473375
monsieur de mazarin had thought that we had rendered service to general cromwell instead of king charles which would have been a disgrace rebounding from us to him and from him to your majesty a dishonor which would have tainted the royalty of your illustrious son   114.24603612715305
but it s all my fault   87.84923573704664
asked debray   162.58331096005148
at this moment my mother seized me in her arms and hurrying noiselessly along numerous turnings and windings known only to ourselves she arrived at a private staircase of the kiosk where was a scene of frightful tumult and confusion   70.05226349973825
i believe so said the major   114.94175789197638
at the hotel de ville my dear fellow   147.66657417016773
yes sir   133.86253369348006
bonacieux   158.94684623738067
responded peppino   127.54340676842286
he felt assured that benedetto was guilty and he hoped by his skill in conducting this aggravated case to flatter his self love which was about the only vulnerable point left in his frozen heart   101.27747712458223
the child unaccustomed to such treatment arose pale and trembling   132.07225466205097
that is the most just remark replied the stranger i ever heard made concerning myself   162.43702665370654
he tore himself from the arms of porthos and aramis and threw himself like a madman on the corpse of his mistress   205.03829316640224
here it is   112.23242933079555
everything believe me   123.24238860014025
hardly had they put foot on deck ere her head was turned towards hastings where they were to disembark   101.0909564855793
i accept   142.77958663541662
that concerns your majesty more than me said the cardinal   119.72510332204736
i know only one other woman who can do it as well   96.70977911871269
villefort franz and a few near relatives alone entered the sanctuary   175.27690277706668
the poor duke became perfectly giddy   35.26553384065913
the place royale be it so   162.4459819342718
as to their majesties they did not return to the louvre till six o clock in the morning   237.3489537539367
20115m carlini threw himself sobbing like a child into the arms of his mistress s father   142.89223431645337
danglars but i am quite as incredulous as he is   135.68885903149177
he quickly saw two heads appear above an abandoned work within thirty paces of him   143.59543404512112
i will not repent   23.31627856490941
as if all the world did not know who the countess g was   146.75717334519055
they are ready to open for you make use of them   53.50510145053242
cheer up said she to noirtier   180.0886087668747
i will not abandon buckingham thus   91.94025355102323
ah said he to debray who had thrown himself into an easy chair at the farthest extremity of the salon and who held a pencil in his right hand and an account book in his left what are you doing there   89.40491051727246
yes my dear aramis we all know that your views have a religious tendency   121.87150442599948
we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance   228.9933211130611
anne of austria sought to read in mazarin s face the occasion of this unexpected visit since the cardinal usually came to her apartment only after every one had retired   84.92430462813073
he was desirous of an explosion because in that case the mine throws forth fire and fire enlightens   74.08132273567529
0147m who could know that i was here already   182.88777667511056
returned the old man what hast thou done   132.45108793388292
his breast was covered with a coat of mail   129.07599100133984
you must be mad to run against people in this manner   112.27473708050192
said d artagnan seizing his own   118.30286874895167
beware athos beware   158.69428857174395
you wish to speak to me alone   100.10312271990222
useless to look   177.85272887703226
this silence self control and struggle lasted about twenty seconds then the count raised his pallid face   20.475786518197467
valentine   150.85079394570946
the queen had restored broussel and blancmesnil to the people and had therefore nothing to fear since the people had nothing more just then to ask for   95.25208630263508
but it was too late   156.7434299989008
cried d artagnan pale with terror   147.57765162095023
he found his carriage at the door and doing his utmost to restrain his anger he went at once to find beauchamp who was in his office   34.24524060499668
too many diamonds too much gold and splendor are now reflected by the mirror in which monte cristo seeks to behold dantès   149.89926248189676
valentine rose quickly and was hastening joyfully towards the door when m   112.44349921660262
oh   86.9734305599152
you knew we were there and yet wished to kill your friend the chevalier   62.42773380399289
i have dreamed that the unlucky englishman was dead   96.9908340348161
my lord has forgotten the supper   103.03207591338548
about your own height sir   63.369297851931265
gutenberg   131.8526544443152
he received the enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with evident pleasure as though his chilled affections were rekindled and invigorated by his contact with one so warm and ardent   85.76382822027631
how farewell   98.68475969604904
with a single glance the prince took in the extent of country that lay before him from lens as far as vimy   83.90842862054224
let me ask you why you deceived me   182.62536959391247
oh   143.77855251349268
at this instant a bright light shot through the mind of dantès and cleared up all that had been dark and obscure before   201.33094142981764
dessessart s valet came to d artagnan s lodging and gave him a bag containing seven thousand livres   265.38039462570475
alas   185.11484221163374
that neutrality consists simply in excluding king charles from the territory of france and in refraining from helping him a stranger to your country with arms with money or with troops   158.1515271367351
by whom   93.70849224849417
no   98.21206775000975
for a man so well off will never change his happy condition and i shall fail with him as i have already done with aramis   97.22906392221387
behind him pale indeed but marching with a firm step was charles stuart who advanced between two priests followed by a few superior officers appointed to preside at the execution and attended by two files of partisans who took their places on opposite sides of the scaffold   97.01619917919716
because remembering the scene at armentieres i thought i should find four axes for one as i was to meet four executioners   193.51839174111052
here i await the army of my rebellious subjects   31.4037733425167
furnished with this plunder andrea leaped with a lighter heart from the window intending to slip through the hands of the gendarmes   100.52408261899885
you are an intelligent fellow my friend   171.72984338264928
consequently i shall marry my daughter to the baron franz d épinay because i consider it would be a proper and eligible match for her to make and in short because i choose to bestow my daughter s hand on whomever i please   75.17055153892366
she had just poisoned a young woman who was her rival and before leaving england she had it was believed caused the favorite of the king to be murdered   159.14864479141937
no said andrea no   127.71141557177636
i do   96.53743283267838
as porthos had foreseen the cavalcade produced a good effect   210.38636466966938
the vessel in which you wished to fry us is still smoking   140.146594740823
besides it is rendering a service to one s country to denounce these wretched criminals who are unworthy of the honor bestowed on them   265.10289924998284
it is you mordaunt he said   62.36674429093726
d avrigny   84.76875198418924
the answer was so little like the one mercédès desired that she turned away to give vent to a sigh which sounded more like a groan   102.78719539698918
1   140.21829612894123
nevertheless it was the rendezvous of the great world and all paris went there   44.95194269762575
they understood then from the few words which escaped from d artagnan what affair was in hand and as they thought that overtaking his man or losing sight of him d artagnan would return to his rooms they kept on their way   76.79303021576857
in the country people alter   149.7068019895287
to have seen them both sitting at table together under an arbor at père pamphile s the evening before the day fixed for my wedding   70.59925043346553
oh no answered caderousse that was not my reason i can assure you   107.86167054714207
i love my sister julie i love her husband emmanuel   119.82581091567378
if then i should learn that you had taken upon yourself to speak of me to anyone favorably or unfavorably to comment on my actions or watch my conduct that very instant you would quit my service   83.75330030716945
a carriage below is waiting for your majesty   71.22749528509016
i am sent here by government to visit the prison and hear the requests of the prisoners   100.30309687140641
it was indeed aramis   228.07801426752184
i must again excuse myself m   231.23795185552143
let him accompany you   97.67113366452867
my faith   131.4128891947994
a cavalier richly dressed was close to the door   88.82005524008783
brave young man   153.78108433910973
every reproach his friend uttered struck deeply in his heart   194.06784288559768
in an instant his sword glittered in his hand and he sprang upon his adversary whom thanks to his great youthfulness he hoped to intimidate   77.6493997038889
did you not see his face   68.73398871131477
château renaud who has lived in russia will tell you the name of one and major cavalcanti who is an italian will tell you the name of the other   91.81581573443749
again the abbé had been obliged to swallow a draught of water to calm the emotions that threatened to overpower him   115.63887262653606
he remained therefore mute and motionless hardly venturing to breathe   92.73888210939856
twenty minutes afterwards a carriage stopped at the house a lady alighted in a black or dark blue dress and always thickly veiled   143.5678515525915
no valentine for i have foreseen all their plots   72.1500179110087
very well cried d artagnan at last furious very well since you wish it let us leave our bones in this beggarly land where it is always cold where fine weather is a fog fog is rain and rain a deluge   123.60762538946007
in other parts of the forest the light could scarcely penetrate through the foliage and the stems of two old oak trees the refuge of the squirrel startled by the travelers were in deep shadow   176.65898601014246
nor indeed had she fallen into that state of depression where it is impossible to conceal the garb of misery   56.06713500081373
the duke vouchsafed no reply but sitting down at the table made a sign that la ramee should seat himself opposite   174.358154950792
you will stop me when i reach the one representing the amount of your own possessions   118.29689311218984
i thank you for having insisted on seeing me   89.50856064884402
see   115.46559201117634
it had been supposed some of the papers might be in the arabian romaic or turkish language and the interpreter of the house was in attendance   117.7810751513885
tell him this gérard   189.2306994899059
for on my word you haven t reached the end said the gascon in a jesting tone   87.05068194461516
these words carried a ray of hope into fernand s heart   181.08199633376807
listen returned d artagnan when our embassy is finished well   12.609170327091661
and as to my other instructions   165.9667697379928
so that you see there is a deadly feud between us   174.5922056017962
willingly said maximilian   86.25041940843808
said she   153.80322628490347
noirtier cast an appealing look on valentine which look was at once so earnest and imperative that she answered immediately   90.02731002811447
you certainly are a demon sent upon the earth   68.1201353400722
bonacieux whom the boatman had noticed   44.07977551237788
to follow out my simile your skin has been opened by bleeding and this if repeated three or four times will cause death so pay attention to it my dear monsieur danglars   108.49305882066601
copyright law means that no one owns a united states copyright in these works so the foundation and you   57.76648265544866
in whatsoever way it is absorbed it will be found again in the body of the victim from the moment when it has been taken in sufficient quantity to cause death   184.38223296308297
he was compelled then after having swallowed the contents of his bottle to pass the time as well as to evade suspicion to fall into the easiest position in his corner and to sleep whether well or ill   89.89218294913651
do i   127.53014062768943
permit me said the notary turning first to villefort and then to valentine permit me to state that the case in question is just one of those in which a public officer like myself can not proceed to act without thereby incurring a dangerous responsibility   168.82450620023107
the swiss refused by shaking his head and drew his sword   94.14349630285102
said aramis   241.6165631855929
de bassompierre had been talked of twenty years before and that was not saying a little   141.39317524759178
there will be extenuating circumstances he replied   118.2345092967159
the count soon heard the rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys such as the locksmith brings when called to force a lock and which thieves call nightingales doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they grind against the bolt   233.99178810855068
that s ingenious said athos   133.33899510123325
on the contrary said the count after this time you must live with me you must not leave me and in a week we shall have left france behind us   44.017771177069875
curiosity prevailed over prudence   99.01421017193135
that is true said d artagnan let us call the others   233.17038711287574
benedetto   93.93642477772164
you should recognize him among a thousand say you   66.1489173972889
shall i ring for baptistin   139.79584921309336
he cried they must have obtained my arrest   118.39269518646795
lord winter you are not the king   44.16045173284279
sir said she i perfectly understand my grandfather s meaning at all times   128.47879523583862
murmured the priest   141.25286750358316
i could never agree to it   107.38282207613739
well louis said anne why do you not kiss me   160.94431043326537
come you shall take charge of the money i of the jewel box   146.46602284416164
and do you know who is his lieutenant   85.50162462793733
the prisoner himself is named edmond dantès mate on board the three master the pharaon trading in cotton with alexandria and smyrna and belonging to morrel son of marseilles   67.2778964616489
presently presently cried the latter when you haven t your cloak on   33.09171261857129
responded caderousse waving his hand in token of adieu to danglars and bending his steps towards the allées de meilhan moving his head to and fro and muttering as he went after the manner of one whose mind was overcharged with one absorbing idea   200.8965322899905
put your two hands together   202.97821792529425
he took up the deadly weapon again his lips parted and his eyes fixed on the clock and then shuddered at the click of the trigger as he cocked the pistol   108.35809747964173
why it seems that i crushed for him a parliament councillor   40.46180081892297
noirtier my master wishes to speak on important subjects to m   116.75780249429233
but a woman who wanders in the streets at this hour only ventures out to meet her lover   78.18742777513447
come here grimaud said athos   106.16550434460082
that is because your fancies go too far replied the triumphant bonacieux and i mistrust them   85.36705640091553
and then you know he said an idea a supposition is sufficient   94.39266384736908
here are five francs for his trouble   178.8520770641283
i have always said to you i love you as a brother   108.96438386827549
there remained in the banker s house only danglars closeted in his study and making his statement to the officer of gendarmes   16.09561070692415
the nurse was engaged in watching the chemical analysis and villefort was still absorbed in grief   258.7688469416608
i   106.08223982835707
yes such a one as would be made by the grazing of a ball   134.79055621123624
it was seven o clock in the evening when the marshal arrived at the appointed place   244.32316924069477
nothing good replied d artagnan shaking his head   110.53955248476079
what fortune has she   107.45628276746194
this would cause inquiries it would be found that i left toulon without giving due notice and i should then be escorted back to the shores of the mediterranean   99.9019518983148
said the count   96.43723615684894
dandré announced by the chamberlain in waiting entered   135.7091833303171
i command you to speak   99.35223532203615
when landing at boulogne after a two days passage she passed for a frenchwoman whom the english persecuted at portsmouth out of their hatred for france   53.25754086812741
i can not resist doing so   170.06350978805114
then here is my master s card the baron danglars   194.14243810367086
a gentleman in his opinion and according to d artagnan s portrait of him the stranger must be a gentleman would be incapable of the baseness of stealing a letter   120.98501233874273
asked athos   5.76453087244424
poverty was repugnant to her   69.20234042311102
answered d artagnan i wish you joy of it   111.00333698866322
so you would rob the count of monte cristo   96.26717891446654
you will not abandon me   0.16216279548876855
said monte cristo   197.5269904490329
asked me questions about the vessel the time she left marseilles the course she had taken and what was her cargo   98.55665805239607
oh my former friends my former friends   74.92615636853012
begone quickly   127.20503959584236
you monsieur le comte de la fere to the right of monsieur groslow   30.212875681902872
then throwing himself back in his carriage danglars called out to his coachman in a voice that might be heard across the road to the chamber of deputies   93.10130767071192
it s of no consequence   222.97381429599176
you do not know with whom you have to deal   46.82357667684522
during the whole time he was speaking the queen appeared to be well pleased with the coadjutor s harangue   96.03182400057253
my god   137.4894985681329
i made them one day to calculate the age of my father that i might know whether i should find him still living and that of mercédès to know if i should find her still free   98.51943054543003
but after that you will make short work with those fellows   3.8748297650771235
said noirtier   168.26145263306182
be assured gentlemen we shall do you honor in our dying   138.50348418239307
de villefort had on the right hand madame danglars on his left morrel   196.45910130399443
the abbé s chamber after having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean passage which however did not admit of their holding themselves erect the two friends reached the further end of the corridor into which the abbé s cell opened   118.24668864708704
you are a very complacent husband my dear monsieur bonacieux said the cardinal   194.69762147971886
then as his eye caught sight of him in the mantle he grasped a floating mass of thickly matted boughs and glided down by their help to within three or four feet of the ground and then leaped lightly on his feet   76.6287987554613
as to haydée these terrible reminiscences seemed to have overpowered her for a moment for she ceased speaking her head leaning on her hand like a beautiful flower bowing beneath the violence of the storm   185.81146350062954
this time it was a great matter that was under discussion connected with a vessel laden with turkey carpets stuffs of the levant and cashmeres   21.754501674225736
tell me on what footing your household was established by your first husband and although i am only your brother in law i will arrange one similar   50.66733218540588
although general d épinay served under napoleon did he not still retain royalist sentiments   151.01379703058137
you allow me to give you this title   183.84060790599813
was felton suspected by the baron about to fail her at the decisive moment   201.08877137081979
you are not boasting   171.52183453390523
we render service to god madame in serving a prince so unfortunate a queen so virtuous   33.90878253745194
the result was that our seven travelers were outnumbered in weapons   87.08216524665376
who are these gentleman   168.59761004612244
said d artagnan   215.23283727866334
then i shall enjoy as much happiness as this world can possibly confer   114.26068326327811
you will say he calls himself andrea cavalcanti   59.99337036824949
org donate   110.1576624967891
cried he on perceiving d artagnan ah   179.23660254855565
danglars listened with the most profound attention   129.11562995799525
to sea viscount   97.24784955560494
said he however far i may come it is not you who can give me a lesson in good manners i warn you   31.829867652806712
we want first to put our prisoners in a place of safety replied d artagnan   4.932417434827158
but then she became pale and rising as if touched by a spring she stretched out her hands as though conjuring an apparition   205.04231579607196
asked maximilian   162.81246534562325
she first and he afterward   134.1418120572768
the lady was surpassingly beautiful while the rich magnificence of her attire drew all eyes upon her   205.66391317299593
is he living   65.1011769704798
as no attempt was made to prevent it the door was opened and a magistrate wearing his official scarf presented himself followed by four soldiers and a corporal   60.18778105286006
yes   207.0377230596346
death to the cardinal   95.11732547928297
it appeared light and well constructed   139.0145737706284
and i likewise said athos   96.15031869890304
am i to be captured   103.79866176769569
besides he is a turbulent fellow who will ruin our party   108.05521846285073
d artagnan relates that on his first visit to m   118.9391098020558
i have not done so   90.30941207196423
the reason for so publicly announcing all this is that all good and faithful catholics may offer up their prayers for the unfortunate culprits and above all beseech of heaven to grant them a sincere repentance   127.61562276956398
at the extremity of the village planchet turned to the left in obedience to the orders of aramis and stopped underneath the window which had light in it   125.55316099791222
for although one may not choose to proclaim oneself one insists on respect suitable to one s rank   123.57944756269887
de schomberg on the south from perigny to angoutin   118.78842766722997
ho   137.19852844930986
it is evident enough to me who am always at his house   66.98852409202757
no i will never pronounce that sentence which would not be orthodox   50.278433792859474
we are going to return to the service mouston replied porthos still trying to restore his mustache to the military curl it had long lost   235.40989547748967
repeated the cardinal who could not believe what he heard dead   11.877026719993893
fortunately lord de winter is rich   42.7054824510941
dantès remained a prisoner and heard not the noise of the fall of louis xviii   199.8885907050867
murmured athos   137.74779592322264
the palace rose from the bosom of the water and to see the number of boats around it one would have fancied one s self not in paris but in venice   162.21584200289126
but i hate hypocrites and among that number i place musketeers who are abbés and abbés who are musketeers   77.52476669643842
how so   121.75620235717885
cried d artagnan which well becomes good citizens like us   96.28781785892238
yes just so   159.42342452433672
think it   186.68964634971073
of glorious memory was about at the same time to invade flanders and italy in order to attack austria on both sides   126.08472778702347
reverend sir i am impelled every criminal says the same thing   70.66340951194834
at these words which left no hope milady raised herself in all her pride and wished to speak   101.62762160996648
yes and i say to you if you are really strong really superior really pious or impenetrable which you were right in saying amounts to the same thing then be proud sir for that is the characteristic of predominance   111.5276315023274
athos was meditating   125.55942198360101
and he drew from his pocket a marvellous casket formed out of a single emerald and closed by a golden lid which unscrewed and gave passage to a small greenish colored pellet about the size of a pea   140.8868725875172
the day had begun to break when athos arose and dressed himself   40.56703689016234
de morcerf was so proud   21.76364926541423
repeated the count   56.384198150667586
he regrets the devil   62.8356593850343
then turning to ali she directed him to bring coffee and pipes and when he had left the room to execute the orders of his young mistress she beckoned albert to approach nearer to her   192.2421545924081
tell me cried danglars in a tone whose bitterness harpagon30 alone has been capable of revealing tell me that you wish to despoil me of all   117.77588371300641
there was no end to the inextinguishable laughter at the rochellais   148.1311170363517
come observed the countess smiling i see my vampire is only some millionaire who has taken the appearance of lara in order to avoid being confounded with m   171.1442338675564
as to planchet he thought of little or nothing but was happy as a hunting hound in his old master s company   116.31531231195235
please pay to my order from the fund deposited by me the sum of a million and charge the same to my account   208.96168699128037
50141m mercédès had never known misery   43.71629346854563
jacopo dived into the hold and soon returned with what edmond wanted   12.509150515073586
i have concentrated here at naseby camp all the resources heaven has left me and i write to you in haste from thence   167.40932767180607
deliberations were being held when a lieutenant in the guards named comminges made his appearance with his clothes all torn his face streaming with blood   83.07630616151408
with his instinctive delicacy edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord and faria had been equally silent   47.33051247964919
then you regret that you did not cut your serpent in two morsels   198.8738638372762
and what does he say   164.4645790351672
for the other he glanced at the tablets as if to recall the name for peppino called rocca priori   55.046068130688056
i hear no balls whistle and i see nobody   142.84552896048282
and you say that monsieur d artagnan was one of those four men   179.97173255140962
the same story muttered the jeweller   118.42992114312882
come ease me of my anxiety or else frighten me at once   19.67000877167837
to be sure   54.242075647667534
and he turned to the door just as the valet de chambre announced m   107.63647683996591
to porthos and aramis to accompany their friend whom they are not willing to abandon in such a painful condition   59.16669063694569
we rode in his carriage all day and now we have taken possession of his box   72.94849317078899
said the cardinal   122.8292242390826
those men must be poets   123.21381736185559
bicarat was a gascon as d artagnan was   119.82711657613473
lord de winter   120.40414870872725
now listen albert   155.1686829190362
felton listened without uttering any word or sound except an inward expression of agony   83.5326008667006
however a few instants after she had finished her religious song milady thought she heard a profound sigh   143.46472995363945
3 1627 it is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has done   200.4740110344357
now madame danglars feared eugénie s sagacity and the influence of mademoiselle d armilly   85.88194396759738
as he spoke villefort drew the letter from his pocket and presented it to dantès   142.4419023059635
if you go on so his eminence will be forced to renew his company in three weeks and i to put the edicts in force in all their rigor   126.84191122567239
certainly they were   232.9684876220129
we shall continue our conversation to the end of the village   143.07385449267304
asked athos   118.03314001982905
woe is me   117.13273641013195
the baroness rose hastily and was going into the study when danglars stopped her   208.26404401418566
he resolved this time to know with whom he had to deal and fell upon the body of his comrade as if he were dead   71.51313849308478
i will go this very evening to tréville whom i will request to ask this favor for me of his brother in law monsieur dessessart   18.599290260374048
he s well guarded now   11.522071403716339
for though the child went to school during the day his mother could not allow him to be separated from her at night   101.42293789603602
no fine lady ever trained and watered her geraniums her cacti and her rhododendrons in her porcelain jardinière with more pains than this hitherto unseen gardener bestowed upon his little enclosure   60.55605043266497
well said d artagnan to athos you see my dear friend that this is war to the death   101.27745392877732
impious task   89.31088318096499
if they send an army out against us we will give battle and the survivor as d artagnan says will carry the letter   91.66195764293434
it was to this end that he performed from time to time some of those early masses which the common people generally alone attended   236.8395069378712
his haggard eyes glanced around as if in search of the traces of some terrible event and with his clenched hands he seemed striving to shut out horrible recollections   114.59732583779069
a thousand thanks for your kindness viscount returned the count of monte cristo but i suppose that m   117.8112713663151
but beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young man and perhaps in that of the old man many repressed desires many stifled sighs which found vent when faria was left alone and when edmond returned to his cell   121.72624354357269
what is it then   96.62106283786083
no replied monte cristo   191.2096796841111
cries of despair resounded on all sides   96.86168664776207
poor fernand has been dismissed continued caderousse   133.98128035643785
they are looking at us   136.26654694856734
noirtier nodded his head   156.80534848659383
25 in the rue de vaugirard   157.93804364572716
she loosened her hold of the gate her arms fell by her side and two large tears rolled down her cheeks   120.37081100448061
but the sailors seemed like the lynx to see in the dark and the pilot who steered did not evince the slightest hesitation   202.72916377352732
there he ascertained that the bracieux estate was four leagues distant but that porthos was not at bracieux   91.92825313550412
you know i hate moralizing except when it is done by athos   142.8165507617165
but a reinforcement having come up the assailants had been put to flight and the leader had taken refuge in the hotel next to his lodgings   191.41741255806858
his hair of a chestnut color was curled slightly   122.09112941707248
why so planchet   238.05818532692268
i have been looking for him but without success   211.11602370070142
however he had not ventured thus far to draw back   110.13536918568741
you have two unruly prisoners there sir   161.72289251511717
you know that my means are limited and that i am what would be designated a man of moderate pretensions   112.01255695177434
i should think not indeed   32.374278387464315
with some gentleman who was traveling this way to whom he proposed a game of lansquenet   144.71792314196387
the sergeant made a sign of comprehension   100.50393345475308
we must then as it appears to me travel in company   140.48254866829905
but as the second turned around and placed his finger on his lips parry started back in amazement   160.81660152696853
ah yes it was just after this that you spoiled everything   38.2404537014928
yes madame   153.07977762992812
but this time as i yielded to fatigue or as if i had become familiarized with danger i dragged myself toward my bed let my robe fall and lay down   133.6457711178016
i must first tell you that monsieur de rochefort is planchet hesitated   119.66355918842086
diable   137.4774934353117
unlimited credit about two o clock the following day a calash drawn by a pair of magnificent english horses stopped at the door of monte cristo and a person dressed in a blue coat with buttons of a similar color a white waistcoat over which was displayed a massive gold chain brown trousers and a quantity of black hair descending so low over his eyebrows as to leave it doubtful whether it were not artificial so little did its jetty glossiness assimilate with the deep wrinkles stamped on his features a person in a word who although evidently past fifty desired to be taken for not more than forty bent forwards from the carriage door on the panels of which were emblazoned the armorial bearings of a baron and directed his groom to inquire at the porter s lodge whether the count of monte cristo resided there and if he were within   110.36469243162908
asked monte cristo   179.60107064189998
my dear beauchamp i wish you to contradict this statement   121.90044016215758
so many unexpected things happened to her all at once that for the first time she was at a loss   189.81138274573675
said he to himself while the lamp and the wax lights were nearly burnt out and the servants were waiting impatiently in the anteroom   182.95394108217823
vampa when this man is satisfied let him be free   104.75600623476302
moreover it is possible that the genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know nothing but what they should know and believe nothing but what they should believe   61.89670991160606
well said andrea admitting your love why do you want me to breakfast with you   111.61461295280179
yes pretty well   206.49171254874173
let s see   106.27402011288635
noirtier had just sent for him and he was in such haste to know the reason of his doing so that he had not stopped to take a cab placing infinitely more dependence on his own two legs than on the four legs of a cab horse   102.24543586550433
this is what the god in whom on your death bed you refuse to believe has done for you he gave you health strength regular employment even friends a life in fact which a man might enjoy with a calm conscience   101.72168647237008
gentlemen he said our presence here is the best proof of former friendship   8.834945916947092
on then   50.850057577862444
well continued mazarin the time has come to put to use your talents and your valor   24.27922432035207
to horse   132.08093819500678
the tumultuous agitation of the young man was succeeded by a profound stupor   93.73521707255787
you would then be tempted to believe said the abbess that this young person is innocent   101.8229997413283
the count s heart was pierced by the utterance of these two words   186.74409902850925
said aramis   92.47130354974882
then in a low voice morrel added this delay is not natural   141.93902412444174
she sighed as she looked at him   77.27800560607005
ah   97.35294828915482
much obliged to you monsieur dulaurier   134.17438716465935
on the front of the monument was inscribed the families of saint méran and villefort for such had been the last wish expressed by poor renée valentine s mother   129.93696136642404
precisely   158.45108460284422
said athos   156.47540501243046
said d artagnan   89.2106377780784
barrois asked mademoiselle valentine   98.94909891762688
he took the full glass and a biscuit   181.69231781949645
because we dare not speak aloud in one or the other   64.69342184652109
caderousse entered hastily   124.34163846759665
we still have five minutes replied mousqueton   134.79438472377942
or had she been discovered and stopped in her flight   12.383077748524357
and with that white teeth a piercing eye dark complexion black hair and haughty carriage why that s my man of meung   145.7787870674759
i would take the hundred pistoles   103.80679832575339
aramis shook his head with a motion of indescribable insolence   195.86217885380228
you may retire said milady   105.38623100797102
i suppose that is not all   134.4978736763942
delaunay   179.97239162473693
parry bent his head and whispered to the king it is the comte de la fere and his friends   78.0289801480111
by leaving this light on the right he kept the island of tiboulen a little on the left   80.57390931220417
and you say that he has a great influence over his compeers   125.59787071099001
i showed it to him   130.23573120615887
madame said mazarin your majesty overwhelms me with flattering distinction   245.30547483043972
the monk made no reply but silently wended his way to the room where the two valets had deposited the dying man on a bed   2.1800936062326173
there was no one in the whole group in a bad humor except cardinal mazarin   176.00562156502576
exclaimed the cavalier   37.397196641856695
then it was not in society that i met with mademoiselle or yourself madame or this charming little merry boy   119.73689798136449
then turning to the governor on my word the poor devil touches me   43.027062602898695
she will be the sooner with her mother   63.504909726054876
the devil   115.20400003416985
everything was ready at ten o clock for the departure and as athos was watching raoul mount a groom rode up from the duchess de chevreuse   120.08546847653918
the foundation s ein or federal tax identification number is 64 6221541   45.04396046714113
oh yes in spite of all i could say   91.99606049435408
in the middle of the lawn i stopped to light it then i continued my path   147.88758176433896
nothing weakens a man more than these devilish strains   124.43153295157846
the servant bowed and retired   75.37122491027374
d avrigny about the death of m   178.4563235230169
but they may do as they please the brave gentlemen   95.44588938642222
cried d artagnan unable in spite of the gravity of the occasion to help laughing   183.1086626070371
your pardon my officer said athos   144.16905695819904
noirtier looked his conviction that she was right in her supposition   102.41953265249045
you do not know that i remained for fourteen years within a quarter of a league of you in a dungeon in the château d if   196.97665506263846
cried the owner greatly delighted   83.05374249674063
but quick as a bird she glided between his hands and when he wished to speak to her her finger placed upon her mouth with a little imperative gesture full of grace reminded him that he was under the command of a power which he must blindly obey and which forbade him even to make the slightest complaint   92.65561194882838
have you not thought so   152.54311393604647
i remember too well   106.35920145519668
he ll defend himself   152.51262403763977
beauty has always been and always will be all powerful   102.77989600290786
and if i had any money he prayed me to leave it for him at nîmes with an innkeeper with whom i had dealings   93.30452290422079
noirtier   118.16274910285794
i should be too happy to be of any service to her   115.10020305498759
the day after to morrow is a holiday   126.51030965423422
and i can set out immediately   111.45598536259598
replied the young girl   123.90478593071468
i was seeking the gentleman to whom this horse belongs an officer brave and handsome as a youthful caesar   71.21468371596055
but really my dear count we are talking as much of women as they do of us   187.19255085942353
what could you do against a dozen bandits who spring out of some pit ruin or aqueduct and level their pieces at you   102.3677330445892
certainly said danglars in the most natural tone in the world   214.99973150533856
but does he know this secret then   186.9465991090036
but how can lord de winter my protector my father asked felton possibly be mixed up with all this   166.2095646332184
then caderousse feeling that he was leaving him raised himself on his elbow and with a dying voice cried with great effort murder   168.0699505973973
said he   55.19291480837955
porthos next made an effort which shook the solid wall and by the aid of his friend s hand gained the summit   166.9533017223899
you desire to fathom this horrible secret   106.14657206303961
good   30.26829894509359
ah   221.421585279689
what is this   220.91487375921736
and although the entertainment was fixed for twelve o clock an hour previous to that time the balcony was filled with impatient and expectant guests consisting of the favored part of the crew of the pharaon and other personal friends of the bridegroom the whole of whom had arrayed themselves in their choicest costumes in order to do greater honor to the occasion   145.34552028399608
on no account speak to her of henry iv   80.61546633370605
he was profoundly versed in hunting and falconry and had one day when conversing on this great art astonished even louis xiii   126.03825681192757
said charles that is a severe chastisement for a very trifling fault   257.9598121231204
dantès let go of the timber which he now thought to be useless and swam vigorously to meet them   93.86384781025342
i am glad to see said d artagnan that you have still that honest lad with you   63.08618340353658
then the officer with the same calm politeness invited his prisoner to enter the house   85.80068279398085
and is not above fifteen feet from it   124.40788256832228
yes yes said monte cristo   43.083152777620484
i will even venture to say that i am certain m   81.13545812242424
said the young man looking fearfully around him   114.96758771124966
when i leave him i place in my stead a bold fellow who aspires to be his majesty s special guard   137.11497650151728
i can still say it is a dream   76.00859664680993
that s quite as many as we shall want   124.7222245162999
a man   132.42170564140565
go my dear curate and may god assist you   86.43985152833302
why then didn t you reply   108.87475669337269
allow me to observe madame said the count with that kind tone he could assume so well you are really very severe with that dear clever child   12.337337458041418
ah so much the better i feared this little precaution might have been forgotten   128.01875780632506
you come from noyon in picardy   116.33402131957965
aramis shuddered in spite of himself   110.39294578176052
this was simply because he lived in the hôtel   17.009030667700472
the king again shook hands with all three exchanged hats with winter and went out   131.12356814319304
and madame danglars will think me a very ill mannered person   27.683081685917443
in that case replied the major it would be necessary to write to the curé for duplicates and it would be some time before they could be obtained   110.3772189977701
danglars signature the next morning dawned dull and cloudy   137.68813461959763
when i went to ask m   97.985734162143
it was no longer the same man the fearful revelations of the three last days had crushed him   118.81408475298126
he arrived safely at the top of the staircase and while he was feeling his way a sob indicated the direction he was to take   133.82206809691095
but where are you going monsieur where are you going   149.96064524205715
unluckily i hit him on the head and immediately his face was covered with blood   116.72133939758771
in a moment the whole party was assembled   133.7362034597098
faria fixed his eyes on him with an expression that would have convinced anyone else of his sanity   111.51368399004407
from their dress covered with dust and from a certain easy manner by means of which a man accustomed to travel is always recognizable the two friends excited the attention of a few promenaders   52.8483630582993
really porthos you are a gifted individual   145.02785458768258
now i can move neither my right arm nor leg and my head seems uncomfortable which shows that there has been a suffusion of blood on the brain   105.47350424404094
that of informing you beforehand of my coming   151.4801913089198
this was a great affront to the king s army and a great inconvenience to the cardinal who had no longer it is true to embroil louis xiii   93.29813345589449
you are the only man of whom i have heard her speak with interest   175.13310736926712
oh heavens   70.86468243147586
knowest thou not then mordaunt   90.51942750272485
they might be said to be of coral   101.34378043946413
he was alone   93.08911540617444
and more than this he insisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned in the address   125.90855692225058
he said looking at the stone this is the work of either hercules or porthos   123.58455354071047
very   144.9332923437401
she read it is important that you should fulfil this mission in person and alone   137.58862545799906
i will be an abbé if it suits me   140.7535938906822
chapter vii   48.54836221289074
now madame here are 800 notes of 1 000 francs each resembling as you see a large book bound in iron   105.8281020957543
far from wishing to learn whither he has betaken himself i should shun the possibility of meeting him as i would a wild beast   101.5924744872938
franz and albert had received that morning an invitation from the celebrated roman banker   175.25347629628118
yes   134.62279999306804
we fear so and our only regret is to die so far from both of you   96.53668612707013
but we do not go far from this place   84.78196977239574
and thou planchet   39.63691037286523
then at length invested with the entire confidence of the cardinal a confidence which he had so well earned he received the singular commission for the execution of which he presented himself in the queen s apartments   162.03862854324439
and one which will go far to efface the recollection of his father s conduct added the incorrigible marquise   132.96608124945962
he could not cease gazing at and kissing the sweet girl   146.05956181668034
when he had finished he went to a table upon which was a salver with spanish wine and glasses   112.67964695672059
if he be innocent of course he will be set at liberty   27.303100025324255
he has already been invited by my father   73.31527215139891
thin and lanky   139.90573278771143
at this moment danglars who had been incessantly observing every change in fernand s look and manner saw him stagger and fall back with an almost convulsive spasm against a seat placed near one of the open windows   42.61230012512698
org donate   58.97562895150647
take notice captain he continued giving planchet his expected title take notice that one of the three men who just now went out from here told me privately to distrust these gentlemen   92.02773596332526
said milady listening in her turn to the noise of felton s steps which withdrew in a direction opposite to those of lord de winter   118.6961608949763
the coadjutor proceeded onward to the quay by way of the rue de la monnaie   144.93287018945747
no i feel that i have reached the goal and i will go no farther   124.8820447080468
this rochefort cried porthos if i were the esquire of poor chalais should pass a minute or two very uncomfortably with me   111.61190657315944
but said franz looking round him uneasily where is the viscount   107.9914515077996
be kind enough then to send me 500 000 francs tomorrow   172.8293602519389
that s not bad   273.16389021244214
it is a lovely night and a walk without rome will do us both good   121.29235950971346
no   15.054457141607742
cried the horsemen rushing on d artagnan with naked swords   120.86219445375158
i am the viscount de bragelonne and he is called grimaud   167.99471536937858
felton quite bewildered almost mad stood speechless   80.79895120132855
franz   173.66135200343618
i too said porthos who faithful to the instructions still held the cardinal s arm   90.55173106057181
as i was weeping and begging on the high road a minister from kingston took me in instructed me in the calvinistic faith taught me all he knew himself and aided me in my researches after my family   178.27822321322108
answer me   147.41591806865188
as for the ink said faria i told you how i managed to obtain that and i only just make it from time to time as i require it   118.35113750072158
why so   134.8242596483148
but wait wait   144.43653940903866
i can not answer for the queen   74.24554641433255
yes you have guessed rightly morrel said the count that is what i intended   147.1104279640577
and what guarantee will you give me asked she if i consent to confide this message to you   171.45648392948354
but how can the news be brought to you   86.54710550398242
but it is understood you will only cross the river in case of danger   100.15660772247685
now if they believed us they laughed in order to insult us   93.3394959963174
i do not quite understand you replied franz   151.8537270917467
go to him with this letter and make him your model in order that you may do as he has done   117.0471059531548
but drawing from his belt a little silver whistle such as boatswains use in ships of war he whistled three times with three different modulations   28.57225802043807
and you did not awaken me   132.14697300679418
the old man wrapped in a large black doublet in which the whole of his slender body was concealed was brisk and dry   109.83143091500193
you said just now that the sea was treacherous and he has been gone four months and during these four months there have been some terrible storms   123.247573648868
cried d artagnan you could not have arrived in better time   176.51384015590855
their greatest dread now was lest the stone through which the sentry was doomed to fall should give way before its right time and this they had in some measure provided against by propping it up with a small beam which they had discovered in the walls through which they had worked their way   68.14908002363404
de baradas by the comte de cramail and by the chevalier de souveray   172.79581591330628
coquenard entered pushed along upon his armchair with casters by mme   62.12259542402987
the feather in his hat is worth at least five and twenty pistoles   125.80072325250484
chapter lxiv   78.5291282099686
de tréville opened and pointed the way to porthos and aramis who bore their comrade in their arms   188.0697396978737
monsieur said the count to albert i do not ask you to accompany me to my house as i can only show you a habitation fitted up in a hurry and i have as you know a reputation to keep up as regards not being taken by surprise   73.42883121406751
said athos   128.01021379321628
in about five minutes planchet returned   154.90691372364245
ho there boy   113.83833097094056
some evidence required from us perhaps   214.63404932246476
then infusing all the humility he possessed into his eyes and voice he addressed the inspector and sought to inspire him with pity   115.55348185267398
asked the guardsman with the same jeering air   76.16512306690204
i threw and i lost   96.44785596210369
but in attempting to execute this command the soldiery were attacked in the market place with stones and halberds   103.651958162573
yes especially if you will show me the poor abbé s room   181.51687741386468
oh yes returned the young man smiling   75.59637515306389
murmured milady becoming exceedingly pale and drawing back till the wall prevented her from going any farther   168.2325490325827
we are going to execute your wishes   96.56495722171503
why the devil does that foolish girl who pretends to wish to speak to me not come into my study   146.63572342357637
but your host behaves very well toward you as it appears my dear porthos said d artagnan directing the sick man s attention to the full stewpans and the empty bottles   117.13626367043949
it must be with my title deeds   162.26101852976802
he struggled against his thirst till his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth   22.454449466542883
your crime   239.46844448084136
while the count picked up the paper he put spurs to his horse which leaped in astonishment at such an unusual stimulus and shot away with the rapidity of an arrow   70.11547437812669
speak said the duke   84.20645284575582
have patience but one day longer   20.37140100666406
wherefore did you not apply then madame to the first person you saw from us   62.80528198050247
oh monsieur you can write as much as you like   79.15597254088571
yes   181.95910983897966
wish your sister good morning master peter   112.77610476949332
oh   144.2537476757323
i sought for a reply but could find none i was silent   117.40421108503295
ah excellency you can not imagine how hard it is to rear fowls in these horrible caves   220.26913687611574
oh said julie pressing the purse to her heart no no i beseech you do not take it for some unhappy day you will leave us will you not   39.60911815056983
good   121.19525784705246
and in the politest tone monsieur duke said he to me and you madame continued he addressing the lady on my arm the doctor s niece   177.21615891421175
said felton i can do but one thing which is to pity you if you prove to me you are a victim   65.80509721585045
the count was thoughtful and silent   36.73328161305541
de tréville what has become of your three companions   62.69781753278246
that ought to satisfy you   74.23787185901882
and rather from your lips than another s   225.98952564378413
athos led his guest into a dining room of moderate size the windows of which opened on one side on a garden on the other on a hot house full of magnificent flowers   171.84275045142107
i too said the young man am a musician at least my masters used to tell me so   128.81538237038407
the boat followed in the wake of the ship a speck near the enormous mass   94.68641516786383
as regards yourself the need of protection   24.307707319479874
andrea ran to the other door leading to the gallery ready to rush out   139.95713534994624
am i then threatened with the omelet of crevecoeur   86.36056551429701
and your majesty has in him so firm a champion that it was he who gave jussac the terrible sword thrust which has made the cardinal so angry   146.1297163747265
repeated the cavalier a second time letting his cloak fall and leaving his face uncovered   91.5251806353301
and after asking bernouin who stood at the door whether anything had occurred during his absence and being answered in the negative he desired that he might be left alone   48.77575683493504
his name had been mentioned as a name of terror at the palais royal   166.60592904465216
you must resolve upon one simple and single line of conduct and for a man of your intelligence this plan is as easy as it is necessary   122.9533313162595
the cardinal s hair stood on end   93.07842255198081
cried the two musketeers in a breath   174.06218929788062
the scaffold forms part of the fête   109.55943339770356
listen said he   126.13717104427393
valentine gave him a look full of gratitude and remained as docile as a child   76.1587670199711
and how shall i travel then   154.22456063452918
with what view   33.75101924229044
i therefore maintain in spite of morcerf that not only is the count the object of interest at this present moment but also that he will continue to be so for a month longer if he pleases to exhibit an eccentricity of conduct which after all may be his ordinary mode of existence   145.8953419713817
yes they are wrong said d artagnan   82.45587043417308
just as my mother was on the point of pushing open a small door we heard the voice of the pasha sounding in a loud and threatening tone   49.092212349065846
he spoke elegantly although i thought from his accent he was an englishman   43.29403860320156
what   136.91385587843035
i thought perhaps that the king s death has only hastened their flight   171.20103566652102
if anyone could have looked into the room just then he would have noticed the hesitation with which madame de villefort approached the bed and looked fixedly on valentine   113.70411072439641
well picture to yourself a future more gloomy still certainly frightful perhaps sanguinary   51.107490467066484

come come continued he patting edmond s shoulder kindly you did very right dantès to follow captain leclere s instructions and touch at elba although if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the marshal and had conversed with the emperor it might bring you into trouble   221.64888839379012
never mind renée replied the marquise with a look of tenderness that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features   72.43827685477608
but at the moment the glass touched her lips her hand remained suspended   107.31603783298783
for everybody must be aware that a cadet from gascony does not find such stones in his mother s jewel case   94.54203713846209
in fact in crossing the city two or three accidents of this kind happened   125.58355328214596

we have said that at half past twelve o clock madame danglars had ordered her horses and had left home in the carriage   95.85876035112398
if we are so it is because we generally judge under the influence of excitement   142.2837240392623
supposing for instance and do not be angry at what i am going to say well   62.928499054917616

come let us endeavor to get to the end of our story beauchamp   201.61736674288156
oh no   52.436805357787236
the coachman without saying a word drove up it passed along the piazza di spagna and the rospoli palace and stopped at the door of the hotel   38.66465313017879
really my dear albert replied lucien lighting a manilla at a rose colored taper that burnt in a beautifully enamelled stand how happy you are to have nothing to do   215.14270302742784
but you is there nothing that you want   99.65757309420992

the chief s mistress   76.88799496477041
the count soon mastered the mechanism the gate opened and he then found himself in a little garden about twenty feet long by twelve wide bounded on one side by part of the hedge which contained the ingenious contrivance we have called a gate and on the other by the old tower covered with ivy and studded with wall flowers   136.9081345862695
just at the moment when they were taking the dainty animal from the spit they saw edmond springing with the boldness of a chamois from rock to rock and they fired the signal agreed upon   12.375078276031132
are you sure of it   124.64727468034623
the porter knew him and let him pass only calling to him in his study monsieur procureur in his study   106.63442487605579

his highness the prince charged eleven times in person   100.46654163456864

i think he entered the service   118.45340800030365
not a word   183.19785759740776
the casket passed around the table but it was more to examine the admirable emerald than to see the pills that it passed from hand to hand   159.15196704474624
contrary to custom this gentleman had not been watched for as the report ran that he was a person of high rank and one who would allow no impertinent interference his incognito was strictly respected   191.38489741056355
avenge me of that infamous de wardes said milady between her teeth and i shall soon know how to get rid of you you double idiot you animated sword blade   73.00468083124237

obeying the queen athos read aloud the letter which we have already seen in which king charles demanded to know whether the hospitality of france would be accorded him   119.36056694865957
but the two young men sought the privilege of passing the night together and it was accorded them   147.76325758392449
how so   93.70199385842349
alas he exclaimed how can i restore the happiness i have taken away from these poor innocent creatures   122.60974541476173
at eleven o clock albert had not come back   78.38281106204775
here i am pursuing you remorselessly he said with a benignant smile   116.5791057495976
i will do my best   32.77289803718922
whence comes that cry   189.26756803522926
the major clasped his hands in token of admiration   92.8709307564705
after having exhausted the ideal they found they must talk of the actual   209.74695849687188
in fact porthos could be heard snoring through the partition   71.06019075285842
de winter stupefied looked on while the soldiers bound felton and could not tell what to think of such insensibility   166.91541963185142
have i by any means displeased you   146.86118884163523
it was then especially while conversing with madame danglars and apparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation that the count noticed m   137.28090009276812
grimaud will accompany you with his musketoon   19.49517213305579
yes but in exchange said porthos covered with perspiration and soiled by dust in exchange i have torn many skins   40.22633327180466

the skiff lightning   94.34925471771709
mercédès seized fernand s hands with a transport which he took for love but which was only joy at being no longer alone in the world and seeing at last a friend after long hours of solitary sorrow   101.0807661693467
said athos trying to smile in his turn   150.27651102080165
in his convent   128.79580097262408
like virgil s wounded hero he carried the arrow in his wound and arrived at the salon villefort uttered a sigh that was almost a sob and sank into a chair   146.28921699439616
they might have remained much longer lost in one another without anyone noticing their abstraction   113.60447155960155
said the count with a smile which petrified the dying man when you had just broken your knife against the coat of mail which protected my breast   53.85319572612235
30271m when daylight dawned i went down again   129.70856839856327
exclaimed athos pressing him in his arms   139.53292070049156
the praise was well deserved for had not the count heard it from the baroness or by one of those means by which he knew everything the baron s countenance would not have led him to suspect it   50.35834623695456
then you have some other motive unknown to us   35.1044172209111
fie   41.04020152751929

anne of austria s eyes shot glances of fire   5.496420969365516
this is the way you keep your word as a sailor   120.44157204757121
i know not   114.41683497146359
now said he will you come   85.3244782867555
but he feared lest this mark of affection bestowed upon his lackey in the open street might appear extraordinary to passers by and he restrained himself   139.03658412558522

even beauchamp accorded twenty lines in his journal to the relation of the count s courage and gallantry thereby celebrating him as the greatest hero of the day in the eyes of all the feminine members of the aristocracy   116.14421855279427
this letter is here in this pocket and he pointed to the pocket which contained the letter   45.91558144178394
she was in tears and strange as it was in spite of the emotions he felt at the sight of these tears he looked also at madame de villefort and it appeared to him as if a slight gloomy smile had passed over her thin lips like a meteor seen passing inauspiciously between two clouds in a stormy sky   126.88310804158576
on reaching the top of the bank she slipped and fell upon her knees   160.41891920315481
cried she   56.95390717061363
nevertheless believe that i heartily pray that i may not become to him a father however much i might be proud of such a son   229.9396457870689
doubtless the musketeer knew him for his hair stood up on his head   64.87880191813045
yes certainly   150.79508878257536
yes   36.98746618464253
not even me   95.55794796055642
but i tell you a million   135.45405294642535
he reached it before the carriage arrived   21.095534453198567
from an apoplectic stroke   76.51078185528243
he knows them then   170.76424832975363
it was a pledge a remembrance   115.88163964294009
they dragged us away by force   193.39610445835035
cavalcanti   114.55131357455069
six days ago i landed at portsmouth   8.130495543727207
my lord excuse me   32.33682408973935
there are a few things that you can do with most project gutenberg™ electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement   142.52728284664747
the light of day reassured me   143.86883088956708
come gentlemen have you decided   45.82885381120413
a senseless word   100.13065085192224
about two hours afterwards its foundation was reported to be unsafe   159.0841858328658
begone then   146.61064695104443
ah and as if struck in the heart he let go the hook and dropped with a groan   130.68978198694592
i invented a preparation that makes linen as smooth and as easy to write on as parchment   196.5809547554373
it is only by comparing the pains of actual being with the joys of the assumed existence that you would desire to live no longer but to dream thus forever   87.95258258567488
the inspector listened attentively   149.3092369891094
that is apparent in your surroundings   145.58561513361565
so i summoned up all my courage and read it as firmly and as steadily as i could   176.83594842967815
danglars door just at the same time that villefort s landau after having deposited him and his wife at the faubourg saint honoré stopped to leave the baroness at her own house   7.947354074882938
and all the nobility of france would demand an explanation of your disappearance   41.710359664341524
look attentively then at this gentleman   151.3642156537723
i will not sign this order   31.57598055850177
this woman is full of mysteries murmured d artagnan to himself   50.71902384703651
or he will forget us added d artagnan   100.32554233550059
it might alienate my protector   65.77955740441364
asked mousqueton   117.37093935930429
meantime he was going to try to find out milady   138.3836585998113
the jeweller began eating his supper and the woman who was ordinarily so querulous and indifferent to all who approached her was suddenly transformed into the most smiling and attentive hostess   116.81324307522625
oh well then said monte cristo i am not particular about these five notes pay me in a different form   127.15184590943551
athos however perpetually recurred to his proposed interview with the queen   120.30299254616905
stop exclaimed villequier so mazarin was here   94.71289658773749
i have finished mine   75.62502671496478
well said morcerf impatiently what does all this mean   109.4125053448906
let us go then said athos   119.22607045188494
morrel looked at him in utter amazement   95.66223942414115
said he after this embarrassing silence   49.49243892850707
the telegraph chapter 61   73.69628920804385
one individual went from door to door bending under the weight of swords guns muskets and every kind of weapon which he deposited as fast as he could   90.44392528859439
you know the word must   100.81880209324682
it was half past nine o clock and the coadjutor required half an hour to go from the archbishop s palace to the tower of st   139.6121331513926
since in our romance of the three musketeers we took leave of d artagnan at no   75.54858310901359
as for m   59.990262971796184
the three cornered hat over this effectually transformed the count into an abbé   74.48876811688126
live maximilian and i will be yours   88.39352221598033
cried villefort   64.6659600260779
i have served them without enthusiasm god knows that i estimated them at their real value and that they are not high in my esteem but on principle   166.96644002086975
an hour afterward rochefort set out at a grand gallop   116.70380856659676
he comes to fetch his wife and daughter   105.62987590929286
come come this is very droll very amusing i allow   162.78023191145115
dantès raised himself up and began to talk about everything   44.738521998612214
laurence on his gridiron   149.97951926088933
he is preparing a way for your majesty to escape   117.77553106881162
upon what   147.08896780689938
20045m and he glanced towards the clerk of thomson french who had remained motionless in the corner during this scene in which he had taken no part except the few words we have mentioned   158.17620510654882
cried d artagnan loosing his hold of her dress and remaining mute motionless and frozen   137.28528729079912
i think it does indeed   162.08773965546547
and without losing a minute thinking he saw an opening he thrust his right in and forced mordaunt to parry a counter en quarte so fine that the point of the weapon might have turned within a wedding ring   191.33485435445886
i called the valet i stopped the postilion i spoke to m   159.01472186197662
my idea   110.60166017916166
the snow was falling thick and icy   125.59369453314557
nothing but saddles   103.30403157247939
what country does he come from   131.29393201068754
the comte de rochefort bowed like a man who acknowledges the superiority of the master as great and retired   53.39337753629232
absorbed all the smaller stars of his court in his own vast radiance   171.79934578870143
what she had taken for confusion was a tumult   103.92263902750047
for example you see these two fish   29.269850812538067
to good principles   2.9784486832653414
and she again tried to think what it could be   156.47837007070245
there he said throwing a louis down   260.1117184964969
dear d artagnan   203.19882746855052
do not pay any attention to him count live in the chaussée d antin that s the real centre of paris   30.365517033297678
how beautiful it must be   176.78630686286607
ah said the jailer do not always brood over what is impossible or you will be mad in a fortnight   114.89293785985444
the first act of franz was to summon his landlord who presented himself with his accustomed obsequiousness   230.17793948200682
fortune lavishes her smiles upon you   158.57251133407726
when he had pointed out to her in exchange for the precarious and contested royalty of paris the viceroyalty of font de l arche in other words of all normandy   149.72295613048456
on seeing this figure mute and immovable as a statue milady was frightened   80.84092003816393
my mother gave it to me and i fool as i was instead of keeping the ring as a holy relic gave it to this wretch   127.57054084365593
did he mention my name   131.14147733753026
there do you hear   227.92047824633156
on the other side of the house to match with the library was the conservatory ornamented with rare flowers that bloomed in china jars   103.026467288904
afoot my lord   81.67632531600657
noirtier and let him tell you if ever once during that time he has entertained a thought which he was unable to make me understand   101.30749568152056
i am tired of hearing only of market reports of the end of the month of the rise and fall of spanish funds of haitian bonds   139.28289575627548
would you like to know how matters have progressed   53.52085043446418
on leaving the paternal chamber the young man found his mother who was waiting for him with the famous recipe of which the counsels we have just repeated would necessitate frequent employment   83.63937746166579
that will be better and you will be more useful to me   213.94733842761997
you are convinced now edmond are you not   174.65620989243632
god will give it me   82.20255572656521
the magistrates freely discussed their political views   115.34452197658747
for the rest this vengeance was very easy   107.35880700948996
but said andrea if my father had met me i doubt if he would have recognized me   21.23516654689979
but how did the accident happen   190.40527319816772
the queen on seeing him uttered a cry of surprise and asked him what was going on   79.02899311354845
be friends said the tutor   105.69253096020007
that is exactly what i was going to say if your eminence had let me finish my sentence   156.58256359888955
and he struck his breast with his emaciated fist   102.54169842755277
tell me your wishes and i will comply with them   149.39863234938738
i   131.92987056315962

but you guess it now do you not   87.4394791456446
as for andrea he was launched and when he was once launched nothing stopped him   117.33092203433975
the crime was depicted in the most vivid colors   95.43091898648154
unable to have me for your wife you will content yourself with having me for your friend and sister   18.81625086277832
why really i know no one said the major   150.0409416281902
general i wished to see the ceremony to the end which delayed me   80.54812502250367
do as you like said raoul who was beginning his apprenticeship with that particular class of society who when there were robbers on the highroads were connected with them and who since highwaymen no longer exist have advantageously and aptly filled their vacant place   155.08642143940614
charles perceived it and took his hand   101.52884868478193
yes   92.61062234495225
the thought was maddening and dantès threw himself furiously down on his straw   110.55418375590587
mercédès extended her hand to the count   225.00765474495185
asked milady with surprise   128.3729044074072
la chesnaye   133.91510494571324
oh i entreat you exclaimed morrel in a low voice do not speak another word count   156.06516105624027
search among your friends your oldest friends   32.45780101742261
the moment you leave me valentine i am alone in the world   164.72587608743768
six days had already passed out of the ten he had asked from mordaunt   32.822931084339544
do i know   64.86656083454784
come upstairs with me and i will give it to you   87.10545030739718
coysel is a madman   255.45327179343525
their demand was fair and the chief inclined his head in sign of acquiescence   47.298348409991945
certain dantès could not escape the gendarmes released him   90.43843146628107
but this time the terrible brother in law of milady did not content himself as on the preceding day with passing before the door and going away again   131.50995290967185
but there is another over me   37.61182006063116
yes continued the jeweller   143.84173869777203
but what shall you do with him   58.19342856646071
cried monte cristo starting to his feet and seizing the two hands which morrel was raising towards heaven   40.07289894070797
they are lucky here indeed   53.26386219160425
and you would be right my friend   77.01511005569999
and when napoleon returned to france he after the manner of mediocre minds termed the coincidence a decree of providence   139.17564893198573
what does your chamber open on   0.030988716727861743
when madame de villefort pronounced the name of franz the pupil of m   196.92027696383622
the pharaon sir they signal the pharaon   64.64474777806497
your hour   166.06593569068266
well   141.24284290669576
no signature   97.14574784822064
he then returned to paris and although in the same carriage with château renaud and albert he did not hear one word of their conversation   156.66487751414806
she heard him enter but she did not raise her head   244.10584429318146
it was indeed a flight which my father was trying to effect   157.12650984346112
gaetano departed with the reply   47.200383408893856
bah   97.7227493298684
said mordaunt with a terrible smile   115.61372444639007
recollect what i told you when you asked me to propose you   131.22449996052444
on the nineteenth the impromptu army had attempted a sortie more to assure itself and others of its actual existence than with any more serious intention   116.34775782653679
so much the better muttered athos   51.09562773648125
villefort looked disdainfully at morrel and replied coldly you are aware monsieur that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in private life and the best seaman in the merchant service and yet be politically speaking a great criminal   117.07752970556615
the second i heard his name by chance   146.863531272306
a learned man before whom the last circumstance was mentioned as a fact declared he had seen the quarries in question which gave great weight to assertions hitherto somewhat doubtful but which now assumed the garb of reality   87.47476768394063
i have come to speak to you of a very serious matter   232.19670452886098
they descended into the plain by the ladder   27.34880766161423
i come to bring and to hear bad tidings   97.78836093420482
here s a crown for thee but should he ever be insulted and thou dost not let thyself be cut in quarters for him i will cut out thy tongue   195.9678834929378
from that time d artagnan had been cautious with respect to handkerchiefs with arms on them and he therefore placed in the pocket of mme   115.28047971797692
you may join me at the hôtel des gardes   166.3236936720671
this sir is all i can tell you and you see how uninteresting it is   82.48268185248972
death raps at your door it enters it goes not blindfolded but circumspectly from room to room   229.75747696484547
there were large bottles filled with serpents ticketed according to their species   139.17449007191254
0185m nearly four years had passed away   171.5917175155016
you do well to boast of it said andrea who without becoming angry as caderousse feared at this new extortion quietly resigned the ring   54.6540215724187
for in three years madame i have only seen you four times the first which i have described to you   173.74193421816688
it is more difficult than i thought   154.78702139588887
here are our three leaves of absence which came from monsieur de tréville and here are three hundred pistoles which came from i don t know where   89.21337352767232
prayed the kneeling suppliant protect my husband guard my son and take my wretched life instead   128.72755868578574
monsieur said albert with affectionate courtesy the count of château renaud knew how much pleasure this introduction would give me   108.96655196064481
you will bring the priest with you and will oblige me by introducing him into my child s room   74.83515103019064
i have pledged my last jewels sold your clothes and my own to pay his servants who refused to accompany him unless i made this sacrifice   210.11658797040337
d artagnan passed through the very midst of this discontented mob just as if his horse and he had been made of iron   119.28490984252036
at length a sense of dignity prevailed and if she did not entirely master her agitation she at least succeeded in preventing the fall of a single tear   114.54604392606224
the jailer went away shaking his head   78.66775520084613
answer me without acting as if you were on the stage   180.535629593836
d artagnan without losing sight of the lady of the red cushion continued to watch the proceedings of porthos which amused him greatly   178.76493132364567
said danglars   66.76061567813198
what s to be done   0.44102230469098913
is this carriage for us   72.14144202367642
still i agree with you in thinking that my present ignorance of the first city in europe is a reproach to me in every way and calls for immediate correction   97.35400293716026
the position of the cardinal was indeed critical and recent events had added to his difficulties   149.982533165906
and you spoke to him   58.439550139353756
but said danglars thoughtfully how is it that your patron m   226.6866595634221
sir   119.31338132471647
to ask me if i want money   148.57599345483123
m   229.9863643931719
i shall therefore not visit either of these telegraphs but one in the open country where i shall find a good natured simpleton who knows no more than the machine he is employed to work   36.04087500249392
it was indeed madame danglars and her daughter whom valentine had seen   95.38017924089664
you went to sleep full of thoughts of vengeance   50.351216720907416
we will take a bite and shall be there as soon as you are   124.47549448491066
asked gondy   173.34730330045454
yes to a convent   24.6906984789088
come come   110.55248432988621
tell them this athos resumed d artagnan   125.98273902095133
i pretended that i disliked the idea that a house belonging to my wife s father and mother should pass into the hands of strangers   74.34104885161571
cromwell looked at him with astonishment   160.91308452915683
are you armed   169.16158702283377
there was a moment s silence then the carriage cleared the gate   151.15420509632787
said fernand lifting up his head and looking at caderousse like a man who looks for someone on whom to vent his anger   142.3613192436165
the devil   244.60037539481527
the manuscript was the great work by the abbé faria upon the kingdoms of italy   187.32805186278154
a singular introduction   76.72357496686527
nothing   146.76214621686566
yes yes continued m   122.24742532779362
charlotte backson comtesse de la fère milady de winter said he your crimes have wearied men on earth and god in heaven   210.0050720838828
inquired the notary   195.73580811784922
you will soon know   132.80155261070837
i shall hide myself in your cabin   161.24943113611545
d artagnan ground his teeth   172.59228475896873
has anyone an interest in preventing your arrival there   86.57005526164555
no father stammered villefort   88.0176769935589
you see i make an ample allowance for all delays and difficulties   113.22276646410975
then by one of those wild caprices which made her so adorable and at the same time so dangerous she had suddenly put her arm around his neck and kissed his forehead saying vicomte may my good wishes and this kiss bring you good fortune   87.67591895914087
a few minutes afterwards a flash of light which was extinguished instantly was seen on the land and the sound of firearms reached the yacht   106.024596016244
there is to be war in flanders   101.89007793365008
and have you any recollection of your country   84.7529032733051
he heard the measured tread of sentinels and as they passed before the light he saw the barrels of their muskets shine   107.06380608889188
that will do me great honor said the leader of the posse and i accept thankfully   78.05273093175094
besides maximilian morrel though hardly two and twenty had great influence over his father   104.0639517291288
de villefort so that no one could reach the sick room excepting through that of madame de villefort and little edward   223.11603506439283
or if you have them why don t you keep them to yourself   75.41185922564063
asked d artagnan   39.93854431745851
why what nonsense are you telling us   142.59094053855313
ah gentlemen he cried as the two friends entered you are very happy   110.89389314005287
take care returned albert   220.43303856524335
she continued then as if she had not heard his exclamation or as if she thought the moment was not yet come to reply to it   175.466237894625
i have taken from you one carte blanche to give you another   77.60417262889509
she was the exact duplicate of the other pharaon and loaded as that had been with cochineal and indigo   123.79521559694508
this can not be monsieur porthos observed planchet replying as it were to his master s thoughts   154.11365337937593
hardly compensated for the loss of that which he had experienced in going from time to time to visit his family   248.8086967259785
we shall be absent at least a week said the patron and then we must run out of our course to come here and take you up again   95.31912779952143
chapter xiii   255.5738771776609
mazarin saw the sign and remained convinced that d artagnan had seen and heard everything   189.41880399645692
we consent to that   128.9174774271045
occasionally but seldom he played at whist and then care was taken to select partners worthy of him sometimes they were ambassadors sometimes archbishops or sometimes a prince or a president or some dowager duchess   203.07971878596982
sire replied m   51.74581056540316
athos and d artagnan with the activity of two soldiers and the knowledge of two connoisseurs hardly required three hours to purchase the entire equipment of the musketeer   152.15265566704687
stop cried d artagnan   142.31447373421395
punctuality said monte cristo is the politeness of kings according to one of your sovereigns i think   137.4932842867047
did you see it all   85.48230173140394
remove from me the remains of doubt which if it change not to conviction must become remorse   138.68733284936383
sir she replied did i not say and did you not hear me say to those people that you should do as you pleased   22.436497671369935
your strength will return   132.57807054305698
have you been long in the orangery   33.61555360756846
caderousse was like fernand enrolled in the army but being married and eight years older he was merely sent to the frontier   131.01908960242875
when you have discovered where they lodge come and await me at the town gate   107.56200815078613
i am from the country   148.18451020465153
he had assumed the entire costume of cucumetto   249.1490776748616
i desire that a statement contained in it should be rectified   150.81490553294128
oh here are two flints and a piece of burnt linen   157.46218941850782
i descended into the arms of the archers   126.75634772852729
that is a tenacious old grandfather said beauchamp   71.75946276861353
yes i know said franz that human justice is insufficient to console us   119.61429679205476
but i recollect perfectly one thing that being unwilling to let such talents as mine sleep i wished to try upon the arabs the new pistols that had been given to me   138.19599829179964
so that what we presumed to be merely the betrothal feast turns out to be the actual wedding dinner   126.14543424209663
first she fancied she saw her stepmother threatening her then morrel stretched his arms towards her   105.3427772127034
my brother who made you his heir died in three hours of a strange disorder which left livid traces all over the body   143.39512496864143
because she was in fear of being arrested   163.10508503592865
cried the host   130.43262726249424
what a disgrace to us   163.6082887541342
besides in addition to the pioneers there are four soldiers and a brigadier armed with muskets   52.13661528680707
royalty is the gift of god   114.08656265558642
said athos to aramis we were to have slept here but we can not we must push on   226.21953041825537
i know i have kept you waiting but you saw the cause of my delay   105.54922183590797
the verger opened the iron grating that guarded the royal tombs and stood on the topmost step whilst athos and raoul descended   119.38282863404574
then for the odd cash making i think about 110 000 francs here is a check upon my banker who not being m   123.73602666528338
i shall require your services to see that all be properly arranged   105.407338526069
not if thou dost not oppose my flight   91.13495945974095
that doubles the offense said porthos disengaging his arm from that of the procurator s wife   103.63733417343751
monsieur d artagnan monsieur du vallon you are free   126.57659073775937
who will give it to you your prince   146.0786481946008
de tréville s courtiers and this his first appearance in that place he was at length noticed and somebody came and asked him what he wanted   116.52564283029986
call the viscount and take the musket with you   159.31200232481177
i m certain of it   129.5201858316008
i   137.8946592123181
because it is taking people unawares   146.49205576049206
he loaded them looked at the priming and waited quietly   20.105833329926114
raoul was but ten yards from the shore   106.57369818853672
where must we place him   29.176211972244218
most of my readers are aware that the second act of parisina opens with the celebrated and effective duet in which parisina while sleeping betrays to azzo the secret of her love for ugo   156.39026854320636
i will get access to her without her suspecting me and when i catch my beauty i will strangle her   102.2226183094067
it was m   221.94322194931024
instead of being knocked on the head as you would be if once they caught hold of you he is simply sentenced to be guillotined by which means too the amusements of the day are diversified and there is a spectacle to please every spectator   64.63561045216251
i will perpetuate the crime and punishment by making a frightful example   124.64823903200893
the leave of absence monsieur has asked for replied the lackey   136.5979533283473
oh from some heartbroken waiting woman some desponding grisette   70.54644141073598
agreed   116.31137178395491
that surely can not be denied to one who is accused   105.98958572831368
villefort looked at valentine as they said this   66.02123862173661
the heart of d artagnan swam in delirium   144.2822451273814
is it permissible   188.49243160310692
and you too my poor monsieur mouston are out of place in this poor hotel are you not   156.6509673603114
he was at that period of intoxication in which vulgar drinkers fall on the floor and go to sleep   145.96055895874028
he is said to be of good family and rich but i never trust to vague assertions   70.16550569987918
and that means replied monte cristo laughing that you had probably just dined together   142.53256577723369
everything is relative my dear young friend from the king who stands in the way of his successor to the employee who keeps his rival out of a place   123.01803058395714
chapter 101   87.02520480402814
the roll call finished the president ordered them to read the act of accusation   79.41115755582214
m   138.4605839704525
yet in spite of his earnest prayers dantès remained a prisoner   103.60161905526148
the clerks who as it appeared had smelled unusual perfumes in the house were of military punctuality and held their stools in hand quite ready to sit down   186.45291944632936
but meantime send for monsieur the keeper of the seals   116.65035667428617
if they do not bring life we will give them death   247.99268348262882
he approached and soon recognized the coachman   128.48315777669592
albert passed his hand through his hair and curled his moustache then having satisfied himself as to his personal appearance followed the count into the room the latter having previously resumed his hat and gloves   217.3728321434808
and often when they least expect it they have proof of a kind remembrance   94.15872128363657
in fact they saw the soldiers running to their arms   86.49781346893282
here monseigneur said aramis is the treaty proposed by the deputation of frondeurs   111.59163064560089
grimaud nodded   101.51351555778973
la carconte on the contrary rose and going with a firm step towards the door opened it saying as she did so come in dear m   113.84074966736952
the spectators followed the little vessel with their eyes as long as it remained visible   224.83011170328234
and lord de winter do you know anything about him   110.91864259657896
the timid girl could not understand that vigorous nature which appeared to have none of the timidities of woman   131.26420205194435
you will kill yourself cried planchet   51.615241619689016
the young man stopped suddenly looked around him and perceived caderousse sitting at table with danglars under an arbor   143.90822735701536
and m   45.14860431528136
but your age reassures me   174.20246075279104
tell me did he put all these questions to you   3.7725847135562987
this is an adventure worthy a place in the varied career of that royal bandit   121.71647191931424
it is the first time i ever saw her in this condition said valentine   157.18482958945089
why did you so maladroitly restore me the handkerchief   29.956192387330702
at this precise time the first gendarme andrea had noticed walked upstairs preceded by the commissary of police and supported by the second gendarme who guarded the staircase and was himself reinforced by the one stationed at the door   223.32172621123436
noirtier is spared because nothing is expected from him   15.784487624295252
his features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he already knew and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them for the first time   128.80159875074887
an idiot who held the life of lord de winter in his hands and did not kill him by which i missed three hundred thousand livres income   194.78018007889017
that i think is as much as i shall want   145.76176068087085
if not i will apply to the chancellor i will apply to the king i will apply to the hangman i will move the courts against you i will denounce you as branded i will bring you to trial   125.26430891313723
i tell you it is too late   113.53924549170777
the dead once buried in their graves rise no more   197.80465040751278
yes i promise you as faithfully as you have promised me that this horrible marriage shall not take place and that if you are dragged before a magistrate or a priest you will refuse   106.91130410911953
i have that permission said the gentleman drawing the paper from his pocket   157.25013592435923
i have been here since the morning   59.301574174788335
well then replied the major they paid me 50 000 francs down   122.57438581535936
a boat   135.84289445836245
all minds were uneasy most were foreboding many of the people used threatening language   207.24772336766364
so much the worse   51.15960060211222
you promised me take my arm madame said the stranger and let us continue our way   223.18964460199678

the robust scotchman accustomed to the snows of his native hills had stretched himself against a post and like a fallen statue insensible to the inclemency of the weather had allowed the snow to cover him   161.488509762727

on the same day the treaty of paris was signed and it was everywhere announced that the cardinal had shut himself up for three days in order to draw it up with the greatest care   52.30994695114997
the light streamed forth on the gilt mouldings and the silk hangings   218.48918352421546

be it so then replied athos sorrowfully   1.8337309500343508
what then   135.11216160747978

this beam crossed or rather blocked up the hole dantès had made   175.3224123571844
then inviting albert to take the vacant seat beside her she recommended franz to take the next best if he wished to view the ballet and pointed to the one behind her own chair   28.160329033848413

the second interview between the former musketeers was not so formal and threatening as the first   126.62448932749271
many of our readers may be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in the period at which our story is dated   92.02505075156115
goodnight   170.5051464115598
cried morcerf it is your fault   138.62214823731964
he asked   101.66358522368763
p   59.138780764881794
you are joking   142.06932688962132
meanwhile the duke hung the crawfish up by a thread   121.96415951153622
what is he waiting for   196.9246323849959
you must hope for us both maximilian   187.1409921669652
yes   151.97083531883516
as a reply he wrote the following letter do not depend upon me madame for the next meeting   109.73629141529105
said d artagnan half rising and bowing   222.81505767672516
athos in his turn smiled also   132.86339828400435
monsieur du vallon has a cold and did not cry either   98.30248606170774
he wished to hasten their steps   102.5318080951406
and did he invite you to dine   205.76043748752204
he looked upon her less severely and bowing to her said slowly farewell madame farewell   83.91042981554772
oho   139.755604559787
d artagnan took the letter touched his hat with his hand turned round upon his heel like a drill sergeant and a moment afterward was heard in his dry and monotonous tone commanding four men and an escort a carriage and a horse   23.093245321579857
indeed it is after so long a separation   115.8273150352085
excuse me   80.02184610276407
a cold sweat broke from d artagnan s brow   132.8872732410274
here i am my lord   139.16217045660113
the queen fell into a chair took the pen and signed   189.1828033522655
anne of austria cast her eyes upon the treaty that d artagnan presented to her   176.91180384175368
bonacieux knew that in talking of money to her husband she took him on his weak side   175.6089585041634
he sent us home in his own carriage   156.93702870448607
and then commenced a roar of laughter in which they all joined to the astonishment of poor porthos   146.54253798466095
and d artagnan chinked the remainder of his pistoles in his pocket   117.11036443495335
d artagnan obeyed like a child without the least resistance or objection which proved that he was really in love   109.35531693863612
and by chance was there yesterday at the same time that i was and it was my duty to offer to conduct her to her carriage   119.31923502368235
with a little more heart he might have been contented with this new conquest   72.1925553040247

and should you see one whom you could prefer i would not be so unjust i have never seen anyone i preferred to you and i have never loved anyone but you and my father   81.30621018752967
but if in spite of all my precautions i am at last obliged to fight will you not be my second   237.7294286421335
send one of your men disguised as a penitent friar and i will give it to him   156.89563109510334
good quite right   139.6370857481744
the law we have seen how quietly mademoiselle danglars and mademoiselle d armilly accomplished their transformation and flight   193.8663271009288
yes   62.35524469181765
at this cry from the soul of the frightened cardinal anne became alarmed in her turn and would have recalled comminges   92.21854136519956
stop and aramis gave him a louis d or   129.16525012767502
when i look at this room whence so many guilty creatures have departed trembling and ashamed when i look at that chair before which i now sit trembling and ashamed oh it requires all my reason to convince me that i am not a very guilty woman and you a menacing judge   117.41519475638052
what is going on   88.5577965448628
i only ask you to examine my position as if it were your own and then judge for yourself   99.528642329419
cried mme   43.492768323708745
then all his suspicions were confirmed   179.67933069035726
the cicerone reclosed the door and sprang up by the side of the coachman   117.0069693986459
and reclined upon a sofa her head supported on the rich tapestry which covered it   44.379351256351384
and that you know is fernand   86.32535220050988
speak   92.98740420982267
ah   195.79564012930865
then she knew that he was one of the friends of m   93.21003824108116
saying these words the cardinal saluted the three friends with an inclination of his head and took the right hand followed by his attendant for that night he himself slept in the camp   164.5532561936554
said danglars   75.12677133923532
i have met him several times at florence bologna and lucca and he has now communicated to me the fact of his arrival in paris   128.56763056436392
on leaving the convent he entered into the magistracy became president on the place of his uncle embraced the cardinal s party which did not prove want of sagacity became chancellor served his eminence with zeal in his hatred against the queen mother and his vengeance against anne of austria stimulated the judges in the affair of calais encouraged the attempts of m   183.39436314548863
mother i must go said albert in a firm calm voice   140.55864044270936
we shall laugh over all this in five minutes   236.53070380141645
indeed   185.2136189213116
these can not be for us said athos   105.72199766779588
swear to me then never to let them put a crown upon your head unless you have a legal right to the crown   50.33601258922444
cried renée unable to hide her emotion at this unexpected announcement   119.2838715614915
the young man then entered the apartment of aramis   205.09229661656204
what planchet is monsieur d artagnan here   164.01881595459537
rochefort alone was dissatisfied with the termination of affairs   91.71193740621611
murmured the young woman ought i to confide such a secret to you monsieur   71.48589682329492
i am a ruined man lost destroyed   193.6614106376441
fort la pointe or fort vasou was not built until 1672 nearly 50 years later   222.63650902055633
the painful catastrophe he had just witnessed appeared effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication of the evening before had raised between himself and his memory   140.49925672484346
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law   174.20787928163884
and this evening if you please or tomorrow at the latest we will meet   130.8472399932721
albert she asked did you notice that   93.63383792720359
all that he had heard from these three different men comminges guitant and villequier confirmed him in his conviction that in case of serious tumults there would be no one on his side except the queen   40.256999446096884
d artagnan was really insulted   80.02522350807489
stammered danglars   141.0413312466637
i am getting more and more seasick   182.69655033152458
bonacieux in a voice almost caressing and pressing the hand of d artagnan who had not relinquished hers well i will not say as much as you do   126.36193350581526
they resolved to profit by the count s courtesy and ordered the horses to be harnessed while they substituted evening dress for that which they had on and which was somewhat the worse for the numerous combats they had sustained   114.2856844544977
i suppose had he found another additional vertebra they would have made him a commander   91.47460105506026
happy   141.74584969413488
a million in gold remains   112.00015310115467
but she murdered the woman i loved   104.01159789375
and if lord winter s men but do their duty we are saved instead of lost   165.6543427573503
ay that will do at armentières   32.676887812842466
and mme   98.9452546329577
yes but i could give him the order i guitant and i preferred to give it to you   209.73098885754322

you know my opinion of my mother count   25.74238846452343
you give away horses worth a thousand louis   173.57961464486385
ma madame   8.15423463035637
athos you make me tremble   85.63128522981029
and her style of beauty struck him more forcibly from its being totally different from that of the southern countries in which d artagnan had hitherto resided   69.14921785676063
he swam to the cap placed it on his head seized one of the timbers and struck out so as to cut across the course the vessel was taking   27.085656989964363
he denies himself nothing   128.18654425674717
i doubt not you will consider these praises the result of blind maternal affection but there is a soul of iron in that delicate fragile body   176.78814574435725
yes have you breakfasted   25.9631795813208
take the republic for a tutor   131.92402557663524
then the foolish criminal is taken imprisoned interrogated confronted confounded condemned and cut off by hemp or steel   122.9925156513483
if by chance our amphitryon changes his mind and receives only porthos and myself why then we must resort to heroic measures and each give two strokes instead of one   140.33836026804886
life is the greatest treasure and speaking candidly ours hangs by a thread   164.1937586728818
d artagnan took off the ring giving it again to athos   193.26463152652772
ah yes so i was   164.78558486944792
nevertheless time passed on and the rochellais did not surrender   145.81383986735003
must i tell you replied the duke on what i most reckon and what i determine to try first   142.8903185400187
at the end of this time they had reached the thickest part of the forest   120.40091097307179
you will one or other of you perhaps both return it to me at paris   135.09348215702892
on my word said franz you are as wise as nestor and prudent as ulysses and your fair circe must be very skilful or very powerful if she succeed in changing you into a beast of any kind   93.09490015524686
an event took place in the church of st   132.76938292087326
de sable mme   49.7123285041456
but then young man and i pray of you to give me your full attention then i thought i could not be doing anything displeasing to the almighty in trying to set an innocent being at liberty one who had committed no offence and merited not condemnation   109.63566550646709
at rome you spent fifty thousand piastres in furnishing your apartments but i presume that you are not disposed to spend a similar sum every day   103.70439578123829
two musketeers were pacing the court to whom d artagnan called by their names   105.1635131057414
holà mousqueton seats and order double the bottles   108.44565449139431
ah   164.6734019870919
hallo fernand   121.67332288771736
i don t know what it was   126.13561610061475
ah true   108.18807658899951
i do not wish you to be seen leaving   87.65991383363179
and he is in the fort l evêque   137.3559810252993
this was the first time morrel had ever so spoken but he said it in a tone of paternal kindness and julie did not dare to disobey   99.58474049918577
meantime between charenton and the royal army was left a space which looked ready to serve as a last resting place for the dead   39.32672144765934
acknowledge then you stony heart said d artagnan that you are wrong to be so hard upon us tender hearts   159.01177496109202
the duke had thrown himself as he was wont to do in moments of dullness and vexation on his bed   145.10904147533967
ah ah   148.27943540789704
shall i write your deposition   97.69220439560539
he soon however returned his whole face beaming with delight   62.90353534126024
it was by always offering a million of francs to the governor for his liberty that an abbé became mad who was in this chamber before you   211.0660534349706
how should i know what horse furniture is   91.99443783517822
go and try   82.6331789726018
how do you mean   178.21258632040033
doctor pray recall your words   29.87173861540049
my position is not sufficiently elevated for that   140.02628188996766
but he is gone and can no longer send us news of himself either to me or to your father   52.38207611466699
he intended to pass the day in making a small gallows and hang one of the finest of these fish in the middle of his room the red color evidently conveying an allusion to the cardinal so that he might have the pleasure of hanging mazarin in effigy without being accused of having hung anything more significant than a crawfish   89.88551962869624
and supposing he should be able to get so far he determined to dispatch him in good style or at least by hitting him in the face as cæsar recommended his soldiers do to those of pompey to damage forever the beauty of which he was so proud   144.43514745521847
you understand me perfectly on the contrary said danglars but if you will persist i will tell you that i have just lost 700 000 francs upon the spanish loan   98.10599527397532
he never spoke of women   95.43742223768001
porthos nodded in sign of agreement   129.78663528571667
patience   69.80329927245262
if you are deceiving me rascal you will be hanged to morrow   184.33286447442453
take him alive   86.3935031182495
i have not quitted you since yesterday returned fernand sorrowfully   123.45462043296492
the diminutive abbé scarron who however was an abbé only because he owned an abbey and not because he was in orders had formerly been one of the gayest prebendaries in the town of mans which he inhabited   202.32815556902042
let us try him   189.8506389252786
caderousse sank pale and breathless into his chair   116.88336355379532
shouted d artagnan or you are dead   134.0338907747923
i   93.38163571625195
gallop fast planchet and when you come to the end of the village turn swiftly to the left   83.47401508595955

well said the queen biting her lips whilst her courtiers looked at each other with surprise what is the desire of my people   66.17285197884453
now then in this difficulty a bright idea has flashed across my brain   113.2228925649698
with steady gaze he awaited confidently the moment for administering the restorative   131.27799395265387
d artagnan will give each of us his instructions   165.4517303828947
at present we and these gentlemen are excellent friends   217.02610217320606
my part is taken   14.323225624418114
ah   111.37354957249924
there were four musketeers on the bottom steps amusing themselves with the following exercise while ten or twelve of their comrades waited upon the landing place to take their turn in the sport   140.52002620416374
on my word of honor   112.17156848624836
unhappy girl replied eugénie unhappy girl do you say sir   24.048767576673683
as i before said i thought the whole thing was a joke nothing more   69.8770202268378
athos who still suffered grievously from his wound though it had been dressed anew by m   111.17931105842027
a garden with two acres of land   151.81106272929105
but the inheritance consisted in this only a scrap of paper on which spada had written i bequeath to my beloved nephew my coffers my books and amongst others my breviary with the gold corners which i beg he will preserve in remembrance of his affectionate uncle   94.44260207282235
if not let him become bankrupt for the 250 000 livres and do as all bankrupts do disappear   62.53839325127961
say not so quickly returned monte cristo say not so my friends   179.5469691194975
your three friends the friends of former days   87.66916278613871
monte cristo concealed himself behind a large tomb and awaited the arrival of morrel who by degrees approached the tomb now abandoned by spectators and workmen   129.8273805966438
after which he inquired if lieutenant comminges were not the commanding officer at the outpost   128.02793599775993
but resumed athos i recur to my first proposal   136.2907545982014
the catalans chapter 4   169.77811994690217

i dare not return with those dreadful horses said madame de villefort   131.62135447921463
the king made his way through the crowd without a mask and the ribbons of his doublet scarcely tied   55.66604507633096
immediately one of the men who were waiting slipped down into the moat tied under grimaud s shoulders the end of a cord and the remaining two who held the other end drew grimaud to them   126.87740927449366
hold my stirrup bazin cried aramis   167.9122212456209
and when he again met the calash he raised it to his lips an action which seemed greatly to amuse not only the fair lady who had thrown it but her joyous companions also   104.30858831613845
but the comte de la fere had spoken and he had no thought but to obey   106.53052178748797
well i am sure it is quite transformed since last week   103.3683939181092

but though i can not give my own name not possessing one i can tell them my father s   42.52743442883519
then when he could not possibly entertain any doubt of the matter his eyebrows slightly bent and with an accent of irony and insolence impossible to be described he replied to d artagnan i was not speaking to you sir   103.49601787972175
there he dined heartily and again inquired about the young gentleman who was in advance of them   151.20065294693956
that was my intention   130.5472605844062
one as fresh as if he had come out of a bandbox the other so covered with dust that he looked as if he had but just come off a field of battle   102.06615988493937

his head fell back and the lower extremities of the body began to stiffen   58.57313504659987
i was now safe for i could swim along the ditch without being seen and i reached the canal in safety   131.49096716434423
i leave you alone in your struggle with misfortune alone with that strong winged eagle which god sends to bear aloft the elect to his feet   167.85098359684656

oh let us hope said aramis that with the help of god and of bazin we shall find something better than that in the larder of the worthy jesuit fathers   166.38974735748405
the stranger then perceiving that the matter went beyond raillery drew his sword saluted his adversary and seriously placed himself on guard   111.39851923884557
i too sir was almost dead when you arrived   76.22581056813851

it was a hack conveyance which was elevated to the rank of a private carriage in honor of the occasion but in spite of its humble exterior the young men would have thought themselves happy to have secured it for the last three days of the carnival   45.65757423485749
i have already signed two will you allow me to do the same to the others   69.08920995080862

you do not know your own good fortune   150.61918596844856
i should think so but not without difficulty   139.74733373350324
you have indeed repaid me munificently for my services   145.49093872610842
the violins began to sound with all their might but nobody listened to them   79.69602206986426

oh   113.38398360735378
the house to which d artagnan and porthos conducted athos and aramis was the one assigned to them by general cromwell and of which they had taken possession on the previous evening   185.50857054249133

asked porthos   153.48701158128677

at this instant the favorite attendant of madame danglars entered the boudoir   21.55397961018582
on seeing him the regiment of corinth which the coadjutor had not been able to reorganize in spite of all his efforts threw itself into the midst of the parisian forces put them into confusion and re entered charenton flying   80.0480378739332
mr   51.617992370972274
the count withdrew his foot   21.938773826902747

that is well   142.84978823799815
at ten o clock the king s collation consisting of preserves and other delicacies was prepared in the little room on the side of the church of st   66.8786632137896
athos who imagined that he saw him move was the first to go up to him   113.19741932400377

during this time valentine at once terrified and happy after having embraced and thanked the feeble old man for thus breaking with a single blow the chain which she had been accustomed to consider as irrefragable asked leave to retire to her own room in order to recover her composure   65.43777132266179
he has at least found peace   80.87214610717857
but when he learned that the unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who followed him he breathed again   107.52231484424185

bread and salt madame de morcerf entered an archway of trees with her companion   93.72978686079284
the carriage which had been stopped for a minute resumed its way passed through the crowd threaded the rue st   59.31309763694421
this enemy was milady   61.040617554633826
besides i am an italian and not a frenchman and belong to god and not to man and i shall shortly retire to my convent which i have only quitted to fulfil the last wishes of a dying man   47.112549385401564
the countess left the arm of monte cristo and gathered a bunch of muscatel grapes   111.88442878336679
teresa followed him with her eyes into the darkness as long as she could and when he had quite disappeared she went into the house with a sigh   57.28474196537478
no i think not for he ordered his breakfast at ten o clock   99.931319025168
andrea bit his lips   103.22260667927578
d artagnan thought a moment and then went to the wardrobe in which hung his old clothes   5.506172177092111
let us go then   127.49659652757728
now you are exactly what i dreamt you were the man i always loved   133.27414422578482
yes   31.828461032873975
cried d artagnan and the citizen at the same time each having recognized his man   177.0792974672298
as calm as at parade radiant as at a fete   205.67883589155974
yes appearances were against me and i was about to suffer dishonor   121.8860219575794
porthos went away after having appointed a meeting with the procurator s wife in the cloister of st   56.86187622302583

at this moment athos perceived a man walking on the seashore parallel to the jetty and hastening his steps as if to reach the other side of the port scarcely twenty steps from the place of embarking   104.02309660151182
sir i am ready   156.6948740895449
this noise redoubled when d artagnan with a company of musketeers placed himself at the gates of notre dame to secure the service of the church   190.53933823932826
oh you may make sure of him   130.4252443816011

therefore athos had invented the phrase family affair   21.89779965297886
i have not handled a card or dice box   122.81214259317564
athos smiled when he saw their bare swords   96.442655516146
it led through a grove of lindens to a conservatory   126.36676439956966
all that you tell me of those by whom i am surrounded monsieur d artagnan is doubtless true said the queen but i have confidence in you alone   150.9758718141453

well then to the king your nephew   223.5781793127618
indeed said porthos looking complacently at his old lackey as he went away you are right d artagnan   35.40615170646946
asked franz of his host   86.83651662464719
my son   89.6326979901693
de villefort was the first to give the signal of departure   219.47685669115575
and on my part said d artagnan i wished to speak of you but i find you so completely detached from everything   62.50187024509866

he bestowed the same attention upon the cambric front of a shirt which had considerably changed in color since his entrance into the prison and he polished his varnished boots with the corner of a handkerchief embroidered with initials surmounted by a coronet   79.8286604333974
he hit him but once but as he had foretold that hit was a mortal one   171.93846592133193
as d artagnan had no time to lose on account of the audience of the king which was fixed for midday he cast his eyes around and seeing that the street was empty said to his adversary my faith   126.60199616209567

de tréville entertained good company wholly anticardinalist though   258.25214181331705
the waking when franz returned to himself he seemed still to be in a dream   24.203143504516675
upon my honor said rochefort it takes you my dear countess to perform such miracles   112.59425846721933
where were they taken   193.8259237995482
the plan adopted by d artagnan was soon perfected   183.9243823606593
thank you my dear beauchamp thank you for the excellent feeling which prompts your advice   107.69294903448542
in anticipation of some ambuscade in each of these little woods the tutor placed his two servants at the head of the band thus forming the advance guard   129.91597686812798
felton listened to this dialogue without speaking a word   174.4973359071899
i will consent to share this dreadful secret with you but i will not allow shame and remorse to grow and increase in my conscience as crime and misery will in your house   115.60287552866113
and where did you get so much money   131.905767624455
the name of father is sacred in two senses   136.48664744725727
what do you intend doing   157.06477341222995
but how have you become acquainted with all these details   44.97308543742194
the thing suited him wonderfully well   61.716659100580074
cried d artagnan i can manage so that her majesty will receive me well   14.305740665715987

e   124.25768239189203
what subject of meditation could present itself to the banker so fortunately become bankrupt   23.050216004899468

boisrenard   67.59685144655128
to this question the smugglers replied that although successful in landing their cargo in safety they had scarcely done so when they received intelligence that a guard ship had just quitted the port of toulon and was crowding all sail towards them   145.46999244946934
de villefort has secluded himself   143.86570959528024
he felt his heart beat and taking his mother s hand within his own he said tenderly yes you will live   96.98829822312035
as it drew near he recognized it as the boat he had given to jacopo   37.543444221167434
he had brought but a hundred louis and of these he had not more than fifty left   68.19770251799304
i will prove it to you beyond a doubt   98.12709385476215
everything is ready is it not   131.36118176287573
but doubtless the spot they chose did not suit the smuggler who filled the post of sentinel for he cried out not that way if you please   117.83689178353191
cromwell s house   134.0489880450168
the blaze illumined the sea for a hundred paces around   45.225392424838375
but when you held her in your power why did you not drown her strangle her hang her   140.79062441003217
this niece comes sometimes to see her uncle   26.10518303776891
50035m well said eugénie cheerfully we have then only to pack up our trunks   62.34737901709912

impudent fellow   134.45139520729603
i shall serve under the eye of your eminence and if i have the good fortune to conduct myself at the siege in such a manner as merits your attention then i shall at least leave behind me some brilliant action to justify the protection with which you honor me   120.45228118117576
said morrel as he went away may your new master love you as i loved you and be more fortunate than i have been   166.99270507974256
you marry a money bag label it is true   166.83729265229786
a noise was heard in the hall   145.48147381076998
the captain pointed towards the island up the side of which ascended a volume of smoke increasing as it rose   88.6637277659961
i will teach you how to laugh to morrow but in another manner   185.71068112743444
they used the same precautions in leaving as in entering the house   123.27846150402947
you know athos you never spoke much of such matters   218.70149298586014
this is how you have lived during the last four nights valentine said the count   147.54271261167125
mother said albert with firmness   133.85405298482402
tis you monsieur de chatillon cried the chevalier   75.22950724190129
the musketeers trotted up and at the same time the ten men whom d artagnan had given to comminges appeared   172.4283714623399
d artagnan was well known among the honorable corps of the king s musketeers in which it was known he would one day take his place   86.52604159863331
0257m perhaps said one of the previous speakers as he was a churchman they may go to some expense in his behalf   8.575819795872661
eight men remain constantly in his room   118.20306478188651
murmured the young man too late   15.267352052106318
albert at this moment ran in   122.36170542356479
be content   123.26804865038277
i will take all the blame on myself if you find i have led you into an error   37.43527570523092
well   164.25064427887398
what is he doing   42.432237345942696
he has already proved himself full of resources   129.9614530106505
the valet opened the door and villefort heard someone speak his name   20.370113874091913
you see monsieur that you say it again   83.02899085564006
the wounded man sank upon his knees to again kiss the feet of his preserver   57.39153945900971
i will therefore fight in my doublet like yourself   111.1483758066998
yes you were thinking of it and with justice   167.65280481979613
have you enemies then   122.56020991386754

come laporte said the queen   121.08486048582088
not pardon but a verdict a trial sir i ask only for a trial   136.82975635262835
well said raoul the poor man will get his priest but by heaven the penitent appears to me to have a better conscience than the confessor   185.1499356797075
armed to the teeth   143.9845811508916
she is not my mistress replied the young sailor gravely   42.52407819067308
oh father i exclaimed you are very good   93.22281978979032
in fact the evening before a fever had seized him in the midst of the parliament while he was holding his bed of justice   113.82942684300023
that is extremely kind of you said monte cristo with a tone of perfect indifference   96.69174969945517
cavalcanti with your daughter   153.1991792031329
let us go to the king   148.87475446602426
well i tell you that i come to you from the cardinal   28.518964592584936
leave him to build up the future for you and i venture to say you will confide it to safe hands   99.43797883475771
then continued the host i replied that as from the moment we seemed not likely to come to a good understanding with respect to payment i hoped that he would have at least the kindness to grant the favor of his custom to my brother host of the golden eagle   100.97548979120127
come said he this matter will want a good deal of talking over   80.34795087168195
could you engage to bring him to me to morrow morning at ten o clock on the pont du louvre   26.146745626030466
silence purveyor of gossip do not spread that report   179.15656266949503
and then said aramis pinching his ear to make it red as he rubbed his hands to make them white and then i made a certain rondeau upon it last year which i showed to monsieur voiture and that great man paid me a thousand compliments   42.7336200268996
monsieur de beaufort had said that he had forty ways of getting out of prison   39.35281836898514
mademoiselle mademoiselle   183.00167597559746
i hope that is true said aramis   123.23894386340253
i give you a thousand chances   89.8889765311716
franz thought that he came to hear his dinner praised and began accordingly but at the first words he was interrupted   167.94532795360237
exclaimed d artagnan bounding toward him who says that athos is afraid   126.22490296253831
i have none said athos   211.9735355516838
he had at the same time risen to the rank of cashier and sunk to the rank of a servant   156.42301033837416
he knelt down on the ground raised winter s head and unfastening the order of the saint esprit placed it on his own breast   89.16980092028145
chapter 67   46.21719927882832
in that case said bazin he must be pretty sick   110.52587829808061
said the duke starting in spite of himself   77.75582396120134
at a quarter past a merchant presented himself to insure two ships   232.86149632594933
on the contrary they thought it very timely   176.01501951424797
he was pale and his eyes were red and swollen   90.69512469308745
40086m well baron said he here i am at last   69.5786519621048
in a moment he had passed through them and could see the house distinctly   58.333746678146476
benedetto if still living will become the instrument of divine retribution in some way or other and then be duly punished in his turn   99.29232747563762
and now what is to be done   94.75000347793434
how absurd as if one crown were not as good as another   109.60387677136063
i do   43.68792885627471
the devoted mother felt that she ought not to allow the whole weight of the sacrifice to fall upon her son   33.894787583802895
welcome among us your excellency he said to him   151.1386979232205
god doubtless neither heard nor saw me and i sank upon the floor a prey to a slumber which resembled death   177.86173608980477
you will not have me turned out this time as you did in london you dare not   133.49455584476163
they obeyed   50.700654010734794
and with his lackey he took the road to the governor s country house   164.40233659888526
on the contrary you were in excellent spirits when you arrived at the count s   146.09357059093182
the cardinal would be infinitely pleased with me   95.963317546133
he decided then to tell all   126.65891595993067
monsieur does me wrong said planchet   45.64205628178425
if i live all would be changed   71.05610515569944
these two can not have drunk all the cellar   128.65551935136835
asked beauchamp   5.321442240663885
you received one did you not   27.08753808251774
she loves him devilishly he murmured   30.25975430458611
lazare and gave it to villefort in the meanwhile take this cross   35.097772968669474
inquired the traveller   61.97307028485427
nachrichter as say our neighbors the germans   143.65736481164984
but the agitation of the night was legible in his pale and careworn visage   105.72137358845629
and now gentlemen he continued turning towards m   182.67564793774642
besides you must have something on the panels of your carriage to escape being searched by the custom house officers   125.18020106868626
a single word had reminded her that morrel was expecting her in m   161.2651533919594
yes yes the mortuary deposition   67.70125812186117
tell my lord that i m going to sleep and i advise him as a friend to do the same   215.90778942269452
he confides him to my care   63.79761346017251
lean a little to the left   159.59711219162924
and perhaps perhaps everything is for the best   145.52301295695656
i will go immediately and inform him of your arrival   106.86919292739434
whilst albert proposed this scheme signor pastrini s face assumed an expression impossible to describe   76.86520863200948
that while the writing of different persons done with the right hand varies that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform   77.21369156301205
at the hotel de ville   20.460732166860566
felton i bring misfortune to all who surround me   141.08671149112763
it is war said the prince   206.9305970604778
gracious heavens   105.52582350549557
my dear aramis said d artagnan if these are the prunes that are sent to you from tours i beg you will make my compliments to the gardener who gathers them   99.81240360210445
here are more than 4 000 francs settled on you   96.03811920170867
well then signor aladdin replied the singular amphitryon you heard our repast announced will you now take the trouble to enter the dining room your humble servant going first to show the way   93.26686703763323
yes yes let us fly   19.816478993646896
it consisted as we have said of a small dressing room opening into a bedroom and when the door of communication was shut the inmates were quite alone   44.084262230953996
de villefort had scarcely said this when the door opened and barrois appeared   15.171304645059223
i cried the steward with a strange expression   146.4562054858791
well sir do as you will with me   159.69936992862858
however flattering this compliment the officer made no reply   73.15964869316366
if he were alone in the world he would blow out his brains and there would be an end   135.28923089416637
she wrote two lines sealed the letter with her private seal and gave it to mme   164.34818317177144
he had been known in the circle of the musketeers to win in one night three thousand pistoles   89.51357622000495
besides kitty will tell nothing   106.45508021020271
0045m you mistake fernand   75.68468759654758
he was never seen at the theatres at concerts or in any place of public resort   59.50094737366214
athos smiled but did not reply   180.45566303262137
try and make an effort to do so my good man   74.74364375147451
this was his second interview with richelieu and he afterward confessed that he felt well assured it would be his last   49.15421303902632
my lord said d artagnan i have an appointment in two hours which i can not miss   45.82273775606835
dantès followed him   19.706932942521135
he feared then to see her too often   30.168341698208494
let her believe that we are in search of some conspiracy or other   193.34859510659737
this advice was too reasonable and moreover came from a man who knew the king too well to allow the four young men to dispute it   123.21545221646284
tell him to come to me immediately if he has returned   96.34803265134803
i will go to the queen   94.38788938432276
where did you place it   132.48159192045546
ten men would have found difficulty in moving that tub but by some mechanical contrivance it had turned with the flagstone on which it rested   163.6394590317187
you do not know him   114.15877179246387
i was so situated as to hear and see everything he answered   243.72496924204867
then you disapprove of duelling   115.98202273180007
but as soon as they were gone i found this broken sword blade as i was helping to raise two dead men and five or six wounded ones   184.722623952402
i understand bertuccio has been sent by my protector   97.25270450445478
i do not think he is   110.82312301620685
that does honor to your imagination   134.61358940242883
andrea spoke with perfect composure he had a cigar in his mouth and his hands in the pocket of his top coat   117.95792508640724
that french officer yes   75.70156798836736
this thread like that of ariadne when once unraveled will conduct one through a labyrinth of thought in which one loses one s self in endeavoring to follow that phantom of the past which is called recollection   128.7745417350861
how grateful will m   42.541332386507406
by thus exaggerating to his own mind the anticipated ill fortune of the next day to which he had condemned himself by promising mercédès to spare her son the count at last exclaimed folly folly folly   150.6925161960264
royalty payments must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you prepare or are legally required to prepare your periodic tax returns   103.90191316689389
there only they explained to them the matter in hand   44.85597883480409
now as we are wont to complete ourselves each by all the rest and to depend on one another for assistance as one calls his other hand to aid the first i looked around instinctively to see if porthos was there   169.576162047392
the nasturtiums and other plants which his father had delighted to train before his window had all disappeared from the upper part of the house   171.35263496502134
absolutely monseigneur   125.58234619497881
after a pause which appeared an age to rochefort mazarin took from a bundle of papers a letter and showing it to the count he said i find here a letter in which you sue for liberty monsieur de rochefort   158.51066616341075
de villefort   135.48879182645
he would then have about 5 050 000 francs left   136.57978365855539
and yet that is the most simple thing in the world my dear sister   83.01945851598941
athos then took him by the hand and led him into the drawing room where there were several people   146.15807855750666
de monte cristo you must demand an explanation   5.377394276877325
evening came and still with all the patient solicitude of a mother she watched for his return   156.59547625233637
and remember that i am waiting for you   147.04904471854053
in the midst of all this frightful tumult and these terrific cries two reports fearfully distinct followed by two shrieks more heartrending than all froze me with terror   150.59457586124734
no that is true   207.3050443015453
oh valentine he asks if i love him   83.25628168422332
the sweat rolled from her brow   169.52068382040449
in 2001 the project gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for project gutenberg™ and future generations   135.18359656739938
but where did you get all these details   32.17476651854048
on the 1st morrel returned   69.63202471772664
he did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought me into this scrape   96.99230818046755
never mind   187.28791952874406
ah indeed so much the better   236.40728990070437
then about twenty minutes afterwards the gentleman would also leave buried in his cravat or concealed by his handkerchief   174.0237299894175
she is much changed   29.512366643675705
unable to rest he was among the first to quit the table and as though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such deafening sounds he continued in utter silence to pace the farther end of the salon   112.25708803326309
this belief was changed into certainty when franz saw the bouquet conspicuous by a circle of white camellias in the hand of a charming harlequin dressed in rose colored satin   176.9952734341435
but d artagnan stopped his hand and in a hoarse voice cried wait   35.22332283725207
said d artagnan with some degree of emotion i struck without knowing that it was you   17.42672937233324
come now what are you telling me   143.9634525567385
freed from the usual formalities by the affable smile and gallant manners of an old governor of the port who kissed her hand she only remained long enough at boulogne to put into the post a letter conceived in the following terms to his eminence monseigneur the cardinal richelieu in his camp before la rochelle   97.44994177852703
well really nothing is certain in this world   128.9303928586315
and who had a lackey named grimaud   115.44485776663353
i know it   166.83309107468284
he would care very little about it i think   89.6220123635174
dormice are bad neighbors for us who do not eat them preserved as the romans did   167.36488106654195
dantès made a gesture   89.96616112141962
and why should he not have this   39.256462469843115
would it be impertinent signor sinbad said franz to ask you the particulars of this kindness   189.9154898343397
that s true said porthos   19.904040370071257
how not agreed about   80.3225449158482
the monk s eyes glittered   134.95417782050038
this greatness of spirit in a man who was quite destitute struck even porthos   80.8025258952172
but albert a first rate pugilist sent them rolling in the street one after the other and continued his course towards the church of san giacomo   198.38946130758634
yes borgia has been here a torch in one hand a sword in the other and within twenty paces at the foot of this rock perhaps two guards kept watch on land and sea while their master descended as i am about to descend dispelling the darkness before his awe inspiring progress   133.05289849425762
and m   176.6483578062592
thanks my worthy friend   105.2785304399257
oh said madame de villefort smiling are you courageous enough to sit down upon the very seat perhaps upon which the crime was committed   165.18637389548735
i have replied the duke a way of descending from the ramparts   73.99107981575746
we are now reduced to live at the expense of these daughters of heaven   154.75913925479617
te deum for the victory of lens   116.52029597512606
at eight o clock the march was resumed in the same order as the night before except that d artagnan left his friends and began to renew the acquaintance which he had already struck up with monsieur groslow   163.50718733498925
it need not be said that planchet in resuming his former functions resumed also his former humility and was not ashamed to make his breakfast on what was left by d artagnan   100.95866213423294
but her lips closed again without articulating a word while the color gradually faded from her cheeks   64.30956342413998
the cause of misfortune of religion royalty   137.14726668188632
dantès did not answer   13.828837061780504
d artagnan took charge of it   74.9611438155001
she married the man she loved who remained faithful to us in our fallen fortunes emmanuel herbaut   118.89144948526592
de tréville crying to the rescue musketeers   134.09570055856904
will you go for them yourself or shall you send   257.6833715451031
no said aramis but that fellow is a fiend   73.15947552862727
he s going to play us a trick   147.46581306619098
the deuce he is well guarded then   240.5101932593575
is it broken off   207.85202967178245
send me five hundred pistoles and four or five days after i have received them i shall be in paris   149.43774848793092
but notwithstanding this request notwithstanding the tone of anguish in which it was uttered the door remained closed   114.43318816569837
a second look was exchanged between athos and aramis   160.74491954536268
the men and consequently the women are but shadows and love is a sentiment to which you cry fie   37.355327144784695
milady not seeing me come again would not be able to understand what could cause the interruption of my visits and might suspect something   66.16014827840178
said peppino in italian and taking danglars by the collar of his coat he dragged him to an opening resembling a door through which they entered the apartment which the captain appeared to have made his dwelling place   132.5544183760627
when   62.67054787763993
you must go away immediately   101.165959643989
he has as your majesty has said a ward who is called the vicomte de bragelonne   67.07700020638211
the latter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl absorbed by her affection and he also like morrel followed those traces of inward suffering which was so little perceptible to a common observer that they escaped the notice of everyone but the grandfather and the lover   20.40032926921623
should he demand an explanation from the bandits or should he wait patiently for them to propose it   154.5907474924994
you who never interest yourself in politics   150.12730707890918
a table with two covers bearing a supper ready prepared stood as if by magic in the middle of the apartment   69.28867958575574
so then he no more knew where aramis was than where athos and porthos were and the affair was becoming a matter of great perplexity when he fancied he heard a pane of glass break in his room window   146.84238943147116
will you answer that question   57.2795021034443
and he put his horse to a gallop to announce to the other servants the arrival of monsieur du vallon and his friends   78.88129952642362
the major was about to speak when andrea continued in a low voice nonsense i am going to set you an example of confidence they give me 50 000 francs a year to be your son   137.77006227104152
40124m listen cried he   4.362759428092275
that continued the cardinal arose not only from a feeling of natural equity but likewise from a plan i have marked out with respect to you   68.76976266197795
i am quite ready said d artagnan   111.56832753631089
but as to love there was not a single word about it in all the letter   71.60105234723684
valentine the night light continued to burn on the chimney piece exhausting the last drops of oil which floated on the surface of the water   80.1731917932675
mazarin especially yes do you know i am very glad to hear you give that testimony   47.78802046594613
about half an hour ago while you were at monsieur de tréville s   198.7544269820586
as the religious ceremonies had all been performed at the door and there was no address given the party all separated   138.50346470934196
what is the use of following the alleys   115.24783779880406
but this morning i purchased a very excellent pair of carriage horses and i do not think they were dear   46.2052529538076
m   167.10140126339294
you are joking now replied andrea   60.54963841299702
as for the count of monte cristo he had never for an instant shown any appearance of having been moved   164.9262654257941
on the evening of the twenty fifth as they were entering arras and as d artagnan was dismounting at the inn of the golden harrow to drink a glass of wine a horseman came out of the post yard where he had just had a relay started off at a gallop and with a fresh horse took the road to paris   69.48477571181834
will it be long first   100.7882599661845
no no cried the countess   83.94779344228287
the banker was enthusiastic in his applause   110.1376924228434
you well know edmond that i am no longer a reasoning creature   177.62163454804812
i did not say that the owner was a smuggler replied the sailor   222.03906644527387
said the same voice in the same commanding tone   203.43688049058255
this is a woman of twenty six or twenty eight years   137.63301150002096
go to sleep soon louis said the queen for you must be awakened very early   174.35253324172845
then in that chamber which recalled to him so many royal souvenirs whither had come so many courtiers the scene of so much flattering homage alone with a despairing servant whose feeble soul could afford no support to his own the king at last yielded to sorrow and his courage sank to a level with that feebleness those shadows and that wintry cold   110.64838776721568
ravishingly   107.18973385453675
this skillful turn of the conversation would have seemed a sublime manoeuvre to any one who could have read the gascon s soul   58.56530648436645
de tréville unwilling that it should be thought that he had influenced the wounded man requested m   50.752972526960946
answered d artagnan you are too good   104.80267253168762
there is no compliment in what i say to you then you are attached to me   124.79285625704642
he could like the king touch the greatest of us on the head and touching them make such heads shake on their shoulders   124.90494734383584
bonacieux we shall hear no more   34.188026144838005
i shall beat you   179.51846047723487
my god can you not remember her name   91.04081312118203
the three listeners looked at one another in alarm   146.4893521243568
everyone must live   166.92459494185616
the old man gave no answer   170.8169610360051
an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth as the orientalists say our masters in everything those favored creatures who have formed for themselves a life of dreams and a paradise of realities   81.67562438476611
they opened the door and the four men alighted   46.9061841591823
for you monsieur said planchet presenting the billet to the young man   171.58602747321015
these gentlemen added he pointing to the bodies can not hear us   147.24414903949065
but i must discover who pursues me with this hatred and when i have found him i shall kill him or he will kill me   144.62130686083577
all it seemed to say was it is not only your reserve which afflicts me   77.143335823511
planchet sir   84.7345417791372
dantès drew back and gazed on the abbé with a sensation almost amounting to terror   216.3635151530669
it is the voice of of my husband   100.5502744448231
ordinarily prisoners were interrogated in their cells   48.93329814558449
because answered the gascon we were sent porthos and i by cardinal mazarin to fight for cromwell   81.61675572173444
i only ask a brokerage   84.52255218970006
he was not mistaken   94.27997323635529
dead animosities   227.00997221122637
d artagnan s intention was to go out without speaking to the worthy mercer   110.38126426515362
well then come along   86.77738616002662
the jailer therefore only grumbled   209.98916742117984
the shade of cardinal richelieu   168.8194134197613
what   164.1627251351417
very well   114.28963621296448
he was a berrichon thirty five or forty years old mild peaceable sleek employing the leisure his master left him in the perusal of pious works providing rigorously for two a dinner of few dishes but excellent   55.92829311339407
let all be forgotten as a sorrowful dream said beauchamp   58.54066000583252
this was as we have seen the term which athos applied to d artagnan in his more expansive moods   121.82769256417829
where were you then   84.56868950134921
it is my marriage you mean is it not dear grandpapa   118.62948277202985
and the count pressed her hand in reply as he had done eleven years before on the staircase leading to morrel s study   125.50110757637125
and when i have taught you mathematics physics history and the three or four modern languages with which i am acquainted you will know as much as i do myself   91.64668691801194
said he   124.9266450771692
your spanish wine is excellent   119.18177149921783
would you dare to touch a cardinal   89.16510883514324
but see there is a postscript from aramis   171.32409034524972
i absolve you   195.3820261904386
athos made a sign to the vicomte de bragelonne to remain where he was   123.90447581465094
but said the irritated president you called yourself benedetto declared yourself an orphan and claimed corsica as your country   66.42099067474211
the cries the noise of the shot and the intoxicating smell of powder produced their usual maddening effects   102.13686795639447
true monsieur le comte replied d artagnan who felt that by degrees athos was resuming that great influence which aristocracy had over him   1.8935471037251546
he turned   162.86316045653714
milady then perceived with terror that the uniform of the soldiers who guarded her was changed   164.14249726693484
that s impossible said the gentleman   191.12688411548095
said d artagnan by heaven   144.79306524255435
the question of carrying the city by assault though often debated in the council of the king had been always rejected   150.98623884322984
yes yes i see him well enough said d artagnan   52.40176182778106
and here the look of the abbé becoming more and more fixed seemed to rest with ill concealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was rapidly spreading over the countenance of caderousse   70.35625238388414
yes said the count you are right it is miraculous   20.162427729713144
who is to know   122.4243666391286
many said your father had only to show himself to crush the charge against him   74.55091256179705
mazarin was as fond of fine soldiers as in later times frederick of prussia used to be   28.718842072440623
albert was right   16.574309964517795
what is his name   163.41017566267809
if his excellency will recollect if he will think ah true observed monte cristo   143.06023563454184
dantès ordered the helmsman to put down his helm in order to leave la pianosa to starboard as he knew that he should shorten his course by two or three knots   84.00195472211777
my daughter is only seventeen years old and your son twenty one   144.86579096952477
my friend   109.09797829189658
you have no right to put me to death alone   104.63318805131193
i desire that these horses with completely new harness may be at the door with my carriage   124.12772821762015
but drink some of this   129.54118097309447
at the end of yonder corridor is a door of which i have the key it leads into the park   135.88779153444608
the truth was that the anticipated pleasures of the carnival with the holy week that was to succeed it so filled every fair breast as to prevent the least attention being bestowed even on the business of the stage   170.69270066237513
he inquired   171.71794918687738
the hour of the banquet being come the two guards arrived took their places and the dishes were arranged on the table   147.68319540418176
i was taken to the slave market and was purchased by a rich armenian   93.46268707864532
and if he does not return instead of accusing him of the inconstancy which you insinuate i will tell you that he died loving me and me only   16.23774955276953
read me something m   130.44003556849037
how so   96.68457708358424
furious at being held in check by one whom he had considered a boy he became warm and began to make mistakes   110.79071228636882
but all this may come later when we shall be better known to each other   79.6283670132843
villefort therefore gained nothing save the king s gratitude which was rather likely to injure him at the present time and the cross of the legion of honor which he had the prudence not to wear although m   159.56646243575412
in the evening julie told her mother that although he was apparently so calm she had noticed that her father s heart beat violently   109.86031763150802
i merely wish to overtake one of my friends with whom i am going to hunt tomorrow at chapelle en serval   194.5589334618161
i was rocked when an infant in the arms of old ocean and on the bosom of the beautiful amphitrite   70.97631109073032
take the stairs on your right   163.56760369845628
and you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom have you not   102.21075179576843
count count   5.662096111158377
i will tell you in two words sir   69.8308134800489
dantès touched it and found that it was a beam   59.98596193283209
stop   147.94365584526906
cried aramis transported   119.5000329386279
by this means his future treatment would depend upon his own conduct   115.61684577708306
which is evidently not his real name but a fictitious one   114.62739437978752
the pates were excellent the wine delicious   103.75709866413717
but the old man would not consent   147.71957772028114
i will repeat them then   173.36902047350787
nothing but what you are fond of   143.96222127452788
brought up in paris where raoul had been but once   126.63922791185269
chapter lxxvi   111.40803019770517
you don t love me   84.08133165579916
mme   3.432301810672783
certainly you must give the orders for i intend residing at the house   76.07807131396612
you have at some wicket of the louvre a concierge who is devoted to you and who thanks to a password would mme   180.932878467663
for the rest in the memoirs of this period which has left so many memoirs one does not find this worthy gentleman blamed even by his enemies   57.17951493440776
and it was this young man who brought the monk to you   109.24588330138528
you shall choose the best   168.95499606872917
let you sir   125.5369269162033
they don t have lieutenants in a felucca manned by a crew of four   141.45603672151168
i pardon you said he the ill you have done me   93.06297192779705
is that what you wish for   204.4475569524754
said villefort   213.21582791213103
he made a movement of surprise and said father you are very young   151.78553910137347
our partnership began in the month of april   193.72616648839937
continued he   184.26536959675943
m   57.22171492742008
this time he fell on his knees and clasping his hands convulsively uttered a prayer intelligible to god alone   116.05614923755317
he has a letter of credit on me so i must see him when he requires his money   145.44820503306443
adieu my dear rochefort   182.33724815955827
he who was thus looking without being heard or seen probably heard and saw all that passed in madame de morcerf s apartments   184.92971295847587
what do you wish to say about it   95.02861860792538
according to the count s directions danglars was waited on by vampa who brought him the best wine and fruits of italy   106.91825141577836
athos alone kept away and sat in the furthest corner of the room as if determined to be merely a spectator of the proceedings   130.1252074646411
not even that   133.1651251165013
you may not acknowledge louis xviii   94.99565713603079
it is because you love me   108.49259219574628
asked athos when he had closed the letter   232.2780036677676
oh meddle in nothing which concerns me   188.3607782968488
exclaimed the gascon   103.44121377184702
though you suffer   95.0747518868755
p   143.30141224197135
at the end of an hour she was completely out of sight   165.2430048073507
caderousse was fast sinking   84.68414464628478
and your visit if it should ever be known to the cardinal will thus seem legitimate   84.84279553142858
they will all disappear like the fabrics children build with cards and which fall one by one under the breath of their builder even if there are two hundred of them   126.05625330004544
de villefort entered followed by barrois   28.19385049694209
yes sir   58.740538181477504
that man made a deep impression on me   112.53186628083608
observe the smallest gesture the least bit of song the least sign from any one near you   116.91315703969471
monsieur you insult the majesty of justice   20.394792897760553
so saying he pulled out his own handkerchief likewise a very elegant handkerchief and of fine cambric though cambric was dear at the period but a handkerchief without embroidery and without arms only ornamented with a single cipher that of its proprietor   171.93719688481215
sir   62.40396793218143
as for me i hate the court and have but one desire at this moment vengeance   83.09988590372573
prepare then for your departure and never despair of us   91.97945522827766
said monte cristo extending his hand   213.3230713579307
answer me do not these crimes exist   86.50556119758738
the servants had just disappeared under the trees followed by the tutor and the young men were laughing and talking about a hundred yards off   86.15416574102112
that of bracieux in the soissonais   60.03977835860722
a hundred pistoles   249.8140702529755
de villefort went to the door which he closed behind the child and bolted   199.08813126626234
7 the knife which is shaped like a crescent that cuts with the convex side falls from a less height and that is all the difference   109.3338964152861
he cocked his gun and laid it beside him   99.36685709049996
that man is cromwell said he   157.02806827916487
why did you talk of a regiment athos   153.68975366899969
certainly not   176.19249168026505
he is one of the most well bred young men i know   109.63620274120692
dantès gazed on the man who could thus philosophically resign hopes so long and ardently nourished with an astonishment mingled with admiration   214.34544304338533
he wishes to die alone   168.25465170932864
tis off one of my sheep   184.6779357599006
oh he has been taken to fenestrelles to pignerol or to the sainte marguérite islands   117.0780738231343
that will do said he   36.81400209416243
one of them shorter than the rest remained pertinaciously in the background   59.02738130982493
in private   127.76374996837154
porthos came down at once to the threshold of the hotel   142.88786037367333
repeated i   170.28199502293253
de boville are you not going to the funeral of poor mademoiselle de villefort which i met on my road here   144.94043673034554
exclaimed franz the peasant girl who snatched his mocoletto from him was a lad of fifteen replied peppino   176.10793213171203
what s the dream   133.6348117308008
as they believe that i go in consequence of an order from the cardinal no one will believe you anxious to follow me   88.69368241959955
at last it seemed to him that one part of the wall gave forth a more hollow and deeper echo   78.0005431258252
they turned round and saw diavolaccio bearing the young girl in his arms   88.3615934783359
an instant afterwards the door opened she felt two arms encircle her and a mouth pressed her forehead   237.33956123212545
presently by a change in the atmosphere he knew that they were entering a cave   153.6237168679467
cried athos   130.81663407185854
but availing himself of the doctor s order the old man would not take any sustenance   136.27295031327654
a most affectionate greeting as one can well believe took place between him and lord de winter   83.33524551955652
he continued his walk but he had scarcely gone a hundred paces when a furious fellow leaning between two soldiers spat in the king s face as once an infamous and accursed jew spit in the face of jesus of nazareth   147.2601346744175
which proved that the general measure which drove the english from france did not affect her   135.2221308145468
not exactly it is the wine that was sent by your order   134.98629978594354
we were speaking of a suitable habitation for the count of monte cristo   95.63106966983624
valentine summoned every effort and breathed with that regular respiration which announces tranquil sleep   32.262703062097756
she hastened down and told him what had occurred on the day when the agent of thomson french had come to her father s related the scene on the staircase repeated the promise she had made and showed him the letter   133.74450425084694
yes continued he a charming woman who entertained kind views toward our friend d artagnan who on his part has given her some offense for which she tried to revenge herself a month ago by having him killed by two musket shots a week ago by trying to poison him and yesterday by demanding his head of the cardinal   208.12971075576598
cried raoul   95.7974291165514
sire said villefort the suddenness of this event must prove to your majesty that the issue is in the hands of providence   136.80541148469814
she is not to leave this chamber understand john continued the baron   138.70883084715146
every blow was accompanied with terrible imprecations   140.0290678113753
franz complimented albert who looked at himself in the glass with an unequivocal smile of satisfaction   85.26340696139286
and now said la ramee i must ask your highness s pardon but it seems that monsieur de chavigny is to be away for a few days and he has sent me word that he has certain directions to give me before his departure   88.12150840052736
but when the cowardly insulter spat in the face of the captive monarch athos grasped his dagger   104.6641972392612
but for my part before he could reach the good prelate i would kill vitry at once   32.974217646726956
and besides i think what the comte de la fere said just now is very good   157.81085972736943
courage   129.49615479234376
morcerf appreciated the advice of monte cristo to let things die away of their own accord   138.59813329980636
before questioning me he said reply to my question   62.19793066905387
enough replied the questioner   96.03562691314252
indeed count said madame danglars i am ashamed to own it but all your frightful stories have so upset me that i must beg you to let me sit down   100.72819431366844
happy beyond measure   123.41859298597909
had been distinguished by his white plume at the battle of ivry   184.73507843305424
let us speak of my affairs said mazarin since you will tell me naught of yours   36.45472021632172
perfectly madame   132.5359928030148
the next moment d artagnan was on his way to notre dame   127.28188896514881
and the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter   163.94810927455495
i saw it done   1.8077049550425102
i do and i will tell you why   153.09230602166753
he then inquired how they had fared in their trip   205.2579162230079
could you comprehend how the romans stuffed their pheasants with assafœtida and the chinese eat swallows nests   49.32066497994494
i am going to fight because i am going to fight answered porthos reddening   102.19392564750419
carlini obeyed rejoined his comrades folded himself in his cloak and soon appeared to sleep as soundly as the rest   185.8840119108765
it is my wish that she should marry m   211.0980073670598
oh i obtained or rather claimed that   126.33664826183498
athos cast a glance at his feet hands and hair those three marks of race   153.59456740809486
however he did not yield but calling up all his fortitude said i will not swear   148.08912377442152
this man seems dumb   147.40260502218118
in fact porthos did not appear   193.8089264601704
morrel i am not angry quite the contrary and i do not send you away   102.05136606204326
and that is a great deal it seems to me   115.51586036237758
i am replied the latter gravely   160.04183216292225
that communication had arrived too late   147.01528352815527
the blood had mounted to the head of d artagnan and at that moment he would have drawn his sword against all the musketeers in the kingdom as willingly as he now did against athos porthos and aramis   45.49422128686713
and the wretched family departed leaving a cloud of sadness hanging over the rest of the evening   165.0287376291084
the two friends approached winter who with his head on his hands was gazing at the heavens   67.09715772191402
this address delivered in the presence of ali who not understanding one word of the language in which it was spoken stood wholly unmoved produced an effect on m   100.35263489456412
whence comes that money   154.83514842431552
oh i know this country marvelously   87.70000396079682
why watch me   49.40347546890571
50197m and then he moved farther on and began again to dig   112.78347087317859
it will be too late   80.36320320797779
he might by chance hear the hollow sound of his footsteps and call the attention of his officer to the circumstance   150.68680432289213
i have now the boldness to ask you for an interview of half an hour   15.90227051080086
for nothing frightens old people so much as when death relaxes its vigilance over them for a moment in order to strike some other old person   132.4434079173231
what is it   61.68751356466914
most willingly   171.49108323001533
is it possible whispered franz that you entertain any fear   97.8376434163726
the whole assembly manifested great surprise but andrea appeared quite unmoved   202.01074280519916
said he in a low voice you send us away   94.27689115583627
madame   85.78171220644847
coquenard had ascended   71.23909484314767
yellow boys   62.901276821791534
as ten o clock was striking d artagnan left m   153.9169518043479
as however he did not fall as he did not declare himself conquered but only broke away toward the hôtel of m   113.44490032197062
would not that dress please you   36.36541197887439
i am at home to nobody said milady   140.76334484748975
peste   199.316523797606
his eyes swam like those of a man suddenly dazzled   143.66884082972226
chatillon saw the motion and put his hand to his sword   131.3145631533307
nortier resumed villefort that what he demands is impossible   98.5607819068743
30239m nothing answered the baroness   140.43426170106926
inform this dear friend that he may remain within that i shall go and see him immediately   293.51143710736375
and understanding that was what he wanted again watched his eyes which turned toward an old secretaire which had been neglected for many years and was supposed to contain nothing but useless documents   127.97985669532814
d artagnan breathed as if the whole hostelry had been removed from his breast   99.31746450369204
now i can promise you that a frenchman might show himself in public either in tunis constantinople bagdad or cairo without being treated in that way   93.66373564352716
la ramee went out but in five minutes one of the officers of the guard entered in compliance with the strict orders of the cardinal that the prisoner should never be left alone a moment   119.76068399888996
the story of ganymede maximilian is not a fable but an allegory   61.90593790637329
but we are bound to say to the credit of our hero that the bad opinion entertained by m   82.69645441946318
my daughter continued the banker you have perfectly explained to me the sentiments which influence a girl like you who is determined she will not marry   155.06000854451042
he the man who would be popular can not forgive the count of morcerf for being created a peer   185.0297379640029
the one that is most in use just at this time   122.10536798534126
observed debray   40.017463357014606
asked the beadle   120.96545128621493
50277m let it be then as you wish sweet angel   72.98324673053816
yes i want your chaise   122.7717167598625
the host had not quite so good a bargain as he at first hoped for but he made amends by slipping in two bottles of anjou wine instead of two bottles of champagne   138.77068080894256
let him give in his letter   140.5358563419937
come come said he will the restoration adopt imperial methods so promptly   79.62094977741788
it is quite frightful but deeply interesting said the young lady motionless with attention   156.53492748422474
i have always been an honest man and as far as lay in my power i have done good   136.63796893455626
0325m i did   101.67483313864169
i will then wait until the last moment and when my misery is certain irremediable hopeless i will write a confidential letter to my brother in law another to the prefect of police to acquaint them with my intention and at the corner of some wood on the brink of some abyss on the bank of some river i will put an end to my existence as certainly as i am the son of the most honest man who ever lived in france   165.2295566064043
indeed said the cardinal whatever repugnance i may have to directing my mind to such a treason your majesty compels me to think of it   65.87686265971051
then when they had passed he brought up the rear and on his face was a smile which if they could have understood it would have alarmed them much more than a visit to the room they were about to enter   76.90636407710724
for the major like a prudent man in case of any accident happening to his bank notes had immediately converted them into an available asset   172.93163531756113
they are below sire and with your permission la chesnaye will bid them come up   19.70442001553843
d épinay became very pale   120.03143917989081
and i sire said m   186.46882392917757
so much the better   175.23364725723349
you think   98.98043718358122
thank you   149.50098352170113
franz d épinay   39.961764425709006
horrible   114.37119013655459
for here is the register of my birth signed by my father and his principal officers and that of my baptism my father having consented to my being brought up in my mother s faith this latter has been sealed by the grand primate of macedonia and epirus   107.9108138502406
you have done right lieutenant said the soldier   129.992454924221
well before you leave tell him all   145.03025271751014
no   83.97904141928775
let us wait   115.87564073385651
ah said a gallant old general who in 1809 had sung partant pour la syrie we will not go alone to the garden   85.35390016263938
there was a brief silence   158.96238133522496
she wouldn t believe me saying that she knew anne of austria who was too proud to love such a worthless coxcomb   174.84250643337262
in the shadow of a tent the former was awaiting him   189.45429193429425
because they failed   113.78750849536296
yes indeed   99.25501897662579
is this carriage for me   200.12588899842467
the latter and the coadjutor touched the brush with the tips of their fingers and made the sign of the cross   211.2929174421001
replied she   71.21538822674124
but she could not marry your brother being already married in france and having been d artagnan stopped as if seeking for the word and looked at athos   134.2011143516805
you are adorable madame   201.79689668854388
a lamp placed on a stool illumined the apartment faintly and showed dantès the features of his conductor an under jailer ill clothed and of sullen appearance   16.194471931535887
i hope i have not made you wait too long sir said the duke   128.2168853257449
go to   77.95912410932127
two hours passed thus   145.77615810869432
