no my dear coadjutor said mazarin   11.058675235358344
poor thing said villefort pressing her hand it was too severe for your strength for you were twice overwhelmed and yet well   12.497866152225138
they sent me the order of charles iii   16.582559464488448
to m   5.334251186204562
what queen a servant more ardent   10.925066899517995
sire said villefort i will render a faithful report to your majesty but i must entreat your forgiveness if my anxiety leads to some obscurity in my language   8.623740776671806
the first thing necessary to render an act valid is that the notary should be thoroughly convinced that he has faithfully interpreted the will and wishes of the person dictating the act   13.554352437138135
the child unaccustomed to such treatment arose pale and trembling   13.735704621223952
but out of the regard i have for you i have taken the resolution to tell you so   15.311112291394192
it is a beautiful house or at all events may be made so   5.398020118274994
have you tied the knot   12.49872708094747
you know that you are madame said villefort whose pale cheeks became slightly flushed as he gave her the assurance   18.896675809879202
has he perceived anything   14.08277461897844
albert entered   12.363805322756356
i will take it in the turkish style replied franz   10.765777871154562
what do you intend doing   10.982514437117006
you have today acquired eternal rights to my gratitude   12.65187311156081
the sigh woke the king so lightly did he sleep   13.625393941522523
said planchet with his shrewd air   16.119156979462282
well and it is that my opinion is that all these old podestàs these ancient condottieri for the cavalcanti have commanded armies and governed provinces my opinion i say is that they have buried their millions in corners the secret of which they have transmitted only to their eldest sons who have done the same from generation to generation   9.498108924664288
a violent convulsion attacked the old man   17.630531049335886
while others formed parties and plans to annoy the pages and guards of the cardinal duke all things which appeared to d artagnan monstrous impossibilities   8.237967216310505
which would not prevent me said d artagnan if i knew where the duke of buckingham was from taking him by the hand and conducting him to the queen were it only to enrage the cardinal and if we could find means to play him a sharp turn i vow that i would voluntarily risk my head in doing it   16.52278041500034
at thirty five which was then his age he passed with just title for the handsomest gentleman and the most elegant cavalier of france or england   9.207985770135952
i want all my household at auteuil   17.41959449390012
the light made the two swords appear like flashes of lightning   14.554119075340386
it was time and he sealed his will with three seals   10.26118167133117
during this time madame morrel had told her son everything   5.42996409336041
because they fought against me   7.693163043174542
no count   11.18026905093836
greece only had risen against turkey and had begun her war of independence   10.851980800473502
i did not reckon upon hunger and infidelity   11.573356185923988
it is this answered athos with a trembling voice   9.363498406292202
and what bastion is it   14.561896205750948
on the contrary they thought it very timely   8.876059771565963
no to be sure replied d artagnan   16.406412086880373
at certain conventional moments the spectators would suddenly cease their conversation or rouse themselves from their musings to listen to some brilliant effort of moriani s a well executed recitative by coselli or to join in loud applause at the wonderful powers of la specchia   0.8546075112602693
said porthos brightening that s well as regards my horse   17.20825115474886
m   19.83502772804186
no try this hare which i had killed yesterday in one of my warrens   8.640420771453083
he first kills m   8.24940195466398
take care that no misfortune befalls you when you leave   16.731652967280226
they will no doubt bleed him   19.028911766975895
de tréville went on prosperously   12.909680912402552
but not so the lover who was to have married her   17.886076222709683
chatillon bowed in token of assent and they all went out stopping at the window of a gallery on the ground floor   10.576377397332038
let us load the guns   10.385890730039518
i go away enchanted   12.488465605520245
for as i am in great haste likewise i wish to beg you to render me a service   18.88145652894111
then turning without the least change of countenance to porthos he said looking him full in the face friend porthos listen to this   12.911170322703612
it was the count de rochefort   12.547725913517224
aramis shook his head with a motion of indescribable insolence   9.844183742660025
madame de lannoy whom according to your majesty s command i have frequently interrogated told me this morning that the night before last her majesty sat up very late that this morning she wept much and that she was writing all day   14.11923632676844
yes   8.925111541553164
but since the time milady stabbed herself however short the wound had closed   15.372899478779884
he disappeared by degrees   18.033557953778445
the other was an old one eyed cashier called cocles or cock eye a nickname given him by the young men who used to throng this vast now almost deserted bee hive and which had so completely replaced his real name that he would not in all probability have replied to anyone who addressed him by it   11.719910039423182
i did   8.736801060728594
you will tell him in order that he may not doubt that he came there in the costume of the great mogul which the chevalier de guise was to have worn and that he purchased this exchange for the sum of three thousand pistoles   12.97042681250748
elsewhere the count found everything he required smelling bottles cigars knick knacks   8.461548740853841
he is a coward indeed grumbled the host drawing near to d artagnan and endeavoring by this little flattery to make up matters with the young man as the heron of the fable did with the snail he had despised the evening before   7.484205510597774
i believe he is at this moment in a very complicated one said d artagnan   10.56801462628444
it could no longer be doubted   6.845359237325371
god will help you   15.473829759506977
it is impossible said maximilian that the signing of a contract should occupy so long a time without unexpected interruptions   11.742732835430571
i hid myself in the one nearest to the path villefort must take and scarcely was i there when amidst the gusts of wind i fancied i heard groans   23.6544966299915
so curious that i think you are running a great risk of a prosecution for defamation of character   16.273032172089135
if i were not in such haste and if i were not running after someone said d artagnan   12.692921148768427
and that ghost told me morrel that i had lived long enough   4.865622211631368
for my part i wash my hands of the affair   17.84187000135675
i was compelled at this period to leave corsica on an important expedition   9.733894576042404
on a rustic table made by luigi were spread out the pearl necklace and the diamond pins and on a chair at the side was laid the rest of the costume   14.010539543213058
and why if you knew me do you let me die   11.531352980429547
the castle of yanina rose white and angular from the blue waters of the lake and the immense masses of black vegetation which viewed in the distance gave the idea of lichens clinging to the rocks were in reality gigantic fir trees and myrtles   15.005167983247548
let us say no more on the subject   8.983924525858157
it required all villefort s coolness not to betray the terror with which this declaration of the king inspired him   9.43451857782041
order four men to conduct them to my lodging   12.178892449850009
the mercer had said that he was rich   10.333861105227347
in the king s room   15.439719862949005
danglars dined here   14.42816168264201
monte cristo gave the pen to caderousse who collected all his strength signed it and fell back on his bed saying you will relate all the rest reverend sir   10.554055141260205
the first time he saw d artagnan you have come off well said he to him   12.022005782158653
d artagnan porthos and aramis uttered a cry of joy   5.515358947059484
so you see our papers were quickly written out and certainly do not come very expensive   8.013186865136452
we are ready   6.9294449893876795
they laughed when we swore that we had done our duty in england   7.344609768848035
the remains of poor renée were already deposited there and now after ten years of separation her father and mother were to be reunited with her   18.524032078764183
but i don t want your arm at all   10.482169786346489
danglars surrounded by deputies and men connected with the revenue was explaining a new theory of taxation which he intended to adopt when the course of events had compelled the government to call him into the ministry   12.513042966364555
as i went away a purse fell at my feet it contained five and twenty louis   20.97321599720867
said milady   4.941980147444975
no monsieur returned monte cristo upon the simple condition that they should respect myself and my friends   18.041293487686808
bonacieux but without being able to make a step glued as she was to the spot by terror   3.3946868789158735
it was too late for he had already drunk a glass of excellent wine placed for him expressly by the pope s butler   17.153953333371426
what is offered from a generous heart should be accepted generously   13.342069483630418
do not insult them unless you wish to be held responsible   11.972667250304674
bazin was making with his spare little short arms ridiculous gestures   12.321955148847456
then masters and servants joined in a fervent cry to the crew of that vessel to hear them and to save   14.791676528315156
art thou happy friend   12.629614679468528
nothing   13.197253727277474
monsieur we must not confound prudence with cowardice   1.3657246422140759
give him some more wine fernand   15.556577256585799
you arrive in good time monsieur said the king who when his passions were raised to a certain point could not dissemble   13.954971179026881
the roll call continued   8.03082483761531
you know sir that before receiving the order one must submit proofs   11.785468895893224
have you any letters for me   19.857924122595627
my lord answered comminges he begs to be taken to the place where monsieur d artagnan is confined that is in the hunting lodge opposite the orangery   11.128419833178114
indeed you could not belong to him   13.540285026224096
the misfortune is great   13.064537576319097
and that is a great deal it seems to me   10.45590157051693
so continued franz the hero of this history is only two and twenty   9.112885372103346
how is it that i have never met you at his house   12.525400344463813
younger sons he said who enlisted in the musketeers under feigned names in order not to lower their family names   16.054330217414407
just as ordinarily faces are colored by blood his face seemed dyed by hatred and became livid   6.18459113969679
you see there are two wanting   7.774908262173852
the fact was that emery s son had run a great chance of being suffocated one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him until he gave up all the gold he had swallowed   7.024846577446877
no i feel that i have reached the goal and i will go no farther   14.660527425508004
i am planchet planchet whom you know well   18.76418625748439
there was something so strange in these three words that everybody except the king shuddered   11.622379247020257
she held in her hand a fresh billet from milady   16.455041155666773
never did a gamester whose whole fortune is staked on one cast of the die experience the anguish which edmond felt in his paroxysms of hope   14.489547985835447
yes ungrateful to providence to whom we owe our safety in the most miraculous manner   23.01244780298706
athos made a sign to porthos and aramis also to remain in the rear and advanced alone   12.047691988445981
i have warned m   11.19967706946265
but as villefort saw his father but seldom and then only when absolutely obliged and as he never took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there all the old man s happiness was centred in his granddaughter   9.687331777233078
the house of thomson french is the only one who from humanity or it may be selfishness it is not for me to read men s hearts has had any pity for me   12.440095513938957
by circumstances   11.255813891580798
before he entered the merchant service had he ever served in the marines   14.546614393564912
i was much more really so two hours ago   7.13215789460791
raoul entered at this moment   15.509042891338426
it is well   15.798406112519947
well my dear bertuccio said the count i now advise you to go in quest of the little estate i spoke to you of in normandy   8.073629627852492
no returned the count   6.591756791185472
in the meanwhile the promises of m   12.389190261165103
porthos opened his mouth thinking it a good opportunity to put in a word in his turn   5.623535226709952
may i ask what you were doing there   10.567081460476416
it is useless replied henrietta the queen will not say yes when the cardinal says no   19.715854101244098
yes indeed she is replied cavalcanti in a very modest tone   15.828335599533753
i swear it before heaven   21.286791557606676
return by the same road you came and we will say nothing about you unhappy wretch   11.406460813196576
i think said the beggar i can undertake things more difficult and more important than that   10.294744939443216
de morcerf s murmured mercédès   7.826363780166537
40076m monte cristo poured a little iced water into a glass and presented it to her saying with a mildness in which was also a shade of command courage   11.855970922595697
d artagnan bowed to the duke and was retiring   12.448350755581918
everywhere   9.028345204413526
she can declare to you for example that your father had no hand whatever in the defeat and death of the vizier   9.593572382815971
the bonnes fortunes of de tréville were talked of as those of m   12.615057211760194
which we can resume now without anybody suspecting us for with the help of god we shall henceforth pass for cardinalists   19.520328834103417
he was a simple looking lawyer s clerk elevated to the extraordinary dignity of a provincial scrivener   10.014115503560161
if beaten i am lost   16.96717372860722
be easy on that score m   7.319306924014919
you are old and obstinate i am young and wilful   9.032873923972423
madame replied de winter your majesty will be served by a man devoted to you   8.914449427744799
so you see being in constant fear of being forced from that position i am armed to the teeth   12.293817258202589
dantès instantly turned to meet him   10.602515777893997
silence monsieur   8.55560808127063
such proposals are not to be made to gentlemen such as these   11.668142986559998
he cried   16.923327390164204
the family had all retired to rest but villefort who alone remained up and worked till five o clock in the morning reviewing the last interrogatories made the night before by the examining magistrates compiling the depositions of the witnesses and putting the finishing stroke to the deed of accusation which was one of the most energetic and best conceived of any he had yet delivered   16.699570292066035
oh my god   2.618346629960053
they had had a long ride and were dying with hunger and thirst   9.235105696738273
then as he rolled on the ground his adversary seized him by the hair and struck him a third blow in the chest   6.113523217288602
thus was lady macbeth served by her conscience when she sought to give her son and not her husband whatever shakespeare may say a throne   17.314315043367344
oh am i happy enough for that   4.192029888077089
then i shall place myself at the cardinal s door a door with glass windows   11.984339895939064
stop   18.276604962379928
athos changed color   11.120649934987876
whither would you have me go without friends without money in a part of france with which i am unacquainted and where i have never been before   14.372333364061735
cried d artagnan finishing his friend s sentence   11.523033083414864
chapter xxiv   10.011955369908762
it appeared to d artagnan that he had embraced a statue   8.930012091414081
well my boys said the brigadier the brigand must really have escaped early this morning   13.568681040442117
he then went straight to the door and knocked murmuring i will go myself and be caught in the mousetrap but woe be to the cats that shall pounce upon such a mouse   16.864178502551248
then rising with his head still covered in the tone of a judge rather than a prisoner charles began   12.83071956549699
athos asked uneasily   14.40275209815863
repeated the faithful servant of anne of austria on his knees before the duke s sofa   16.4807932122725
in the meantime dispose of my coachman my carriage and my servants   7.628761875059767
you want valentine do you not   12.689399612322996
but the revolution of july was it seems sufficiently glorious to allow itself to be ungrateful and it was so for all services that did not date from the imperial period   4.865235619953113
m   15.621522657134479
here is monsieur comminges said d artagnan returning to the cardinal   5.122778989780383
exclaimed grimaud   16.966302735308666
but his own private affairs had made no great progress either in love or fortune   14.796837625078176
then having blown out the lights the two fugitives looking and listening eagerly with outstretched necks opened the door of a dressing room which led by a side staircase down to the yard eugénie going first and holding with one arm the portmanteau which by the opposite handle mademoiselle d armilly scarcely raised with both hands   2.504539438177
it will   10.54208163579457
and listening discerned that they were cries of joy   14.191025657082545
how strong and courageous you are   11.932428494026963
her large animated intelligent eyes so often opened by intrigue so often closed by the blindness of love   7.312716439222246
living my best friends would avoid my house   12.190896775127293
start start   19.60022187762655
he wished to lodge the two travelers each in a charming chamber   15.471176155713692
where did you place it   15.000278252280932
but now suppose this poor comte de wardes were less guilty than you think him   7.369152226408784
it is from no personal ill feeling towards the viscount that is all i can say sir replied danglars who resumed his insolent manner as soon as he perceived that morcerf was a little softened and calmed down   13.13614088815882
he asked   16.123513287345183
the poor woman s head and arms fell   11.294416418621537
asked albert in the most sprightly tone   11.204146255914742
madame de villefort would not believe it and valentine was thunderstruck   10.372495619342766
the abbé rose from his chair made two turns round the chamber and pressed his trembling hand against his parched throat   12.166084245684427
winter turned his horse and the two friends rode on   12.77719527996939
fools said charles do they take me for a coward like themselves   12.2256177310815
mordaunt went away with the captain   16.49564933964364
he only felt one uneasiness and that was at not hearing any tidings from his friends   17.53557264188475
what are they   6.960724166919563
and if this person be not a smuggler who is he   15.807216255817803
deposited with the justice   12.44599348450171
email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the foundation s website and official page at www   11.95399053401764
if i were i should do for you at once the most that you deserve   8.564163281492998
pardieu he has come to draw but i don t know how much   11.733903788090835
are the oars in the boat   7.513541403418373
in that case gentlemen have the kindness to retire into the corners so as to give us ample room   19.03486571581011
said lord winter   6.47162615386514
my dear albert said franz leave all to our host   7.886487101332118
the riding horses i entrusted to grimaud and i awaited your coming out which i did not expect till to morrow and i didn t hope to free you without a skirmish   10.218513007134657
easels palettes brushes pencils for music had been succeeded by painting   15.540319585045891
i believe so said the major   10.487493170125967
what she most desires is a letter from her intended   15.285045711415819
you were not of the party m   15.84223509399047

beg her to do you the favor to take your arm in going downstairs and thank her as you descend   9.560301518333691
noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion more than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and shattered frame   12.939237685484922
what an appetite you used to have   14.626356069365242

let me act as i please felton let me act as i please said milady elated   1.7534345787810963

we fear so and our only regret is to die so far from both of you   17.153408582544436
this smile appeared to d artagnan to be of bad augury   14.17823558894717
bertuccio bowed and resumed his story   11.911288809817167

something which will surprise you   8.434342323149682
and the count while pronouncing these latter words accompanied them with one of those ghastly smiles that used to strike terror into poor franz d épinay   8.998627663774315

there is a dupe somewhere   6.012123463110466
the haste which the young woman was in to convey to the queen the excellent news of the happy return of her messenger prevented the two lovers from exchanging more than a few words   7.27846303121519
and in order to spare you all the annoyances of a nocturnal arrival in a port and all the fatigues of landing i send one of my officers to meet you i place a carriage at his orders and he brings you hither to this castle of which i am governor whither i come every day and where in order to satisfy our mutual desire of seeing each other i have prepared you a chamber   14.716771047361418
poor cardinal   15.048948085718422

on his return home albert expressed his wish to franz debray and morrel to see them at the opera that evening   11.511637995790771

then the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an instrument of god s justice   9.22114657140211
this other musketeer formed a perfect contrast to his interrogator who had just designated him by the name of aramis   9.393078563608979
and villefort with his papers under his arm and hat in hand directed his steps toward the apartment of his wife   10.271851266771314
the lives of five men are not safe in my opinion as long as he is on the earth   14.549516401216676

d artagnan returned to help porthos if porthos needed help   8.604666118754029
the host desired himself to serve him   9.179041968761513
nothing but an order from a superior would retain me in paris   15.773270623432907
we must go replied villefort offering his arm   10.365869842379084
and i made you a sign in order that you might hold yourself in readiness   11.316193885370499
a large vase of japan porcelain filled with flowers that loaded the air with their perfume stood in the salon   12.024215985774193

yes certainly   21.883631456156948
noirtier let his head fall upon his chest apparently overwhelmed and thoughtful   16.28249881977505

m   8.987083982960032
the horses were at the place fixed upon and they leaped lightly into their saddles   6.379827952868649
the tie is even more direct it seems to me   10.309323447159551

dantès cried at the top of his voice to warn them of their danger but they saw it themselves   8.843615417194592

as we shall probably meet with him again in the course of our history it may be well for our readers to be made at once acquainted with him   11.99473997118878

he kissed her hand tenderly   9.627408897612051
go to   13.249939537625568
sulpice was announced   14.598434153168096

he is an admirable man said the major   8.315512155646843
burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to the magistrate to hear his words   10.66230896677068
i had an affianced husband a man whom i loved and who loved me a heart like yours felton a man like you   11.852569453189892

the comte de rochefort bowed like a man who acknowledges the superiority of the master as great and retired   10.93465575579503
but either i was deceived or hell has resuscitated you   10.450361653555182
who knows if they will not manage to restore to me my pension   11.84331179177163
cried guitant   15.365075656956686
it is that indefinable charm which is to a woman what perfume is to the flower and flavor to the fruit for the beauty of either is not the only quality we seek   11.189475014393906
don t let us disarrange your eminence   10.143923407578392
if a conqueror he is accused of foul play and want of courage   16.18777007456412

and waving his hand to comminges he rejoined d artagnan who instantly put himself at the head of his troop followed by the cardinal guitant and the rest of the escort   18.53719489753467

morrel extended his hand   11.9898419743818
what   19.357827401819076
i wanted to speak to you   10.04585679493744
his desire for blood returned burning his brain and pervading his frame like a raging fever   7.992594723711923
i quite understand why you ask sir said eugénie making a sign that her father might be seated and in fact your two questions suggest fully the theme of our conversation   13.123197053197678

still further buckingham announced to the mayor that at length the great league was about to declare itself against france and that the kingdom would be at once invaded by the english imperial and spanish armies   10.396123059227639
three cries for help came more distinctly to his ear   9.392467220043674
sire said athos we foresaw this   12.128456453669996

the queen bit her lips and moved impatiently on her chair   15.493926717426382
i leave you alone in your struggle with misfortune alone with that strong winged eagle which god sends to bear aloft the elect to his feet   12.755725065316122

debray lives some distance from here   11.30874487664938
the street was not able to contain the spectators who assembled from every direction   11.391823519552362
we shall soon see said porthos in his tranquil way   16.505970294939193
one expression above all recurred to the mind of the prisoner if i had listened to you lord de winter had said to felton   6.491506974196175
he was attacked with apoplexy and i was called in too late   9.828790414861299
he hastened to descend into the street with a frightful beating at his heart   18.759863022232437
instead of that louise do you understand   17.218076795730738
he was embarrassed whilst speaking to me and yet quite firm in his determination to refuse   6.382263525752103
ah   16.442483732694143
add that the king sleeps and that the queen begs that they will keep silence so as not to awaken him   15.452844686155581
where is he then   9.792283340635626
d artagnan half stupefied without his doublet and with his head bound up in a linen cloth arose then and urged by the host began to descend the stairs   10.679834882737334
i am completely ignorant of it madame said the cardinal accompanying his words with a slight shrug of the shoulders   16.210254663804513
demanded buckingham   19.040525364164985
athos who had not lost a word of the conversation took his two companions by the hand and led them to the other end of the room   10.87295425187728
after mass the young monarch drove to the parliament house where upon the throne he hastily confirmed not only such edicts as he had already passed but issued new ones each one according to cardinal de retz more ruinous than the others a proceeding which drew forth a strong remonstrance from the chief president molé whilst president blancmesnil and councillor broussel raised their voices in indignation against fresh taxes   7.702532512289589

the court itself did not seek to restrain the feelings of the audience   12.203762631608939
did she afterward return   9.62314361501952
but i what have i in the world   15.47937486028845
de villefort when shall i see you again   10.405075127473662
the procurator s wife smiled thinking that it was for her porthos had put himself to this trouble   10.03019165576301
it was upon the cardinal that all the responsibility fell for one is not a despotic minister without responsibility   14.456987791972676
the festa was magnificent   10.506868486379245
never never   9.810529604320752
20312m at the same moment and in the midst of the terrifying silence which usually follows a clap of thunder they heard a knocking at the door   13.448413276588662
at least nothing in good earnest   10.598737548123252
since the first attack i experienced of this malady i have continually reflected on it   9.401230751696325
you kill me   9.102922358804406
the southern districts were ill watched in particular in consequence of the disturbances that were perpetually breaking out in avignon nîmes or uzès   9.06983690173534
i attempted to cry out   19.797673193797632
and so dantès after the hundred days and after waterloo remained in his dungeon forgotten of earth and heaven   14.549237658523651
this time the marshal charged but he was welcomed by musket shots while stones fell like hail from all the windows   12.986653680848592
listen to this dilemma god is god and the world is the devil   10.023703314936414
danglars again became pale and hastened to conduct the count out   12.129204097333275
morrel overpowered turned around in the armchair   21.32955974471046
and if you entertain whether from your family your relations or even from your instincts any of these enmities which we see constantly breaking out against the cardinal bid me adieu and let us separate   15.84697025197304
but by jove   19.52285294902536
you have seen me twenty times   15.910282002076368
island of monte cristo all i poss   10.870637443322318
the young men bowed and quitted the box   15.093042740939788
only seventeen months replied dantès   11.077053498836438
are you not charged with a mission from his eminence cardinal mazarin   7.950103515941406
asked villefort trembling at the new idea inspired by the delirium of morrel   12.644790893444664
to whom   6.249967823808227
while some asserted that they had seen him start for brussels   13.849027606173982
the abbé smiled and proceeding to the disused fireplace raised by the help of his chisel a long stone which had doubtless been the hearth beneath which was a cavity of considerable depth serving as a safe depository of the articles mentioned to dantès   12.869600834969663
well then we ll do our best   10.120831349044085
angelo and i had an immense deal of trouble before i could get a chance to speak to beppo   14.873333364599175
that is what i heard on leaving my prison fourteen years after i had entered it   15.40813024157264
but she was cruelly and promptly undeceived   12.371023100597691
i embrace you   13.39495045262729
what   10.938973710757761
25 the spahis are french cavalry reserved for service in africa   8.172595265106436
but let everything remain as usual only close the shutters of the ground floor   12.02214069185096
for the king   10.451129969781165
and how when he had reached the bars he fastened his ladder   18.942213699548137
and he retired into his room without even asking the cause of so much noise   8.472837022881002
the delay had been occasioned by a visit from madame danglars and eugénie which had been prolonged beyond the time at which valentine was expected   10.91085855323076
the more so as it will be the prelude to a better   15.189609628009904
yes   12.481370761085508
she thought it was best to preserve silence to discreetly set off to accomplish her difficult mission with her usual skill   9.486682602813058
yes replied m   9.784229228958507
you my dear monsieur de rochefort shall have the post of confidence   10.972810490285573
they may tell us to open it   16.67096312223272
an enemy in my house do you say edmond   20.159751489215637
by degrees milady became more communicative   8.419622857404745
indeed they will go so far that we shall be obliged to send them to the bastille   7.95437431723257
interrupted mme   7.266257651434029
at nine o clock then be ready here at the hôtel i will come and take you   7.570571547740474
ah you do well to ask said eugénie laughing   12.577873862178931
pursued the notary   17.028616797557
no no monsieur said monte cristo   15.749406912697962
i am afraid if we offer them double that we shall not procure a carriage   5.957570042030631
if there is a third shot said he to himself i am a lost man   16.963524132777085
they do indeed   12.56055082355848
who were those men   12.966376683420368
ah   11.662100780351587
a tall young man with light hair clear gray eyes and thin and compressed lips dressed in a blue coat with beautifully carved gold buttons a white neckcloth and a tortoiseshell eye glass suspended by a silken thread and which by an effort of the superciliary and zygomatic muscles he fixed in his eye entered with a half official air without smiling or speaking   8.952398270367695
i took then in conformity with the orders of the authorities who sent me a reinforcement of six men such measures as i thought necessary to get possession of the persons of the pretended coiners   2.3667748535966844
ah indeed   10.516293328911711
rita lay between them   15.709393328142031
in a quarter of an hour athos joined them and at the same moment charles brought in a letter for d artagnan which a messenger had just desired might be instantly delivered   7.749094964543786
he stooped down picked up the bag of money and placed it between his teeth   12.782282426947901
the writers sometimes looked up at each other and smiled   8.672884638245897
cried athos   15.19877857812289
1   7.041484708244473
yes replied the young man i ask you in what year   16.441059760804976
i will give you the signal   18.48719339778413
oh cried morrel almost tempted to throw himself on his knees before noirtier and valentine and to adore them as two superior beings what have i ever done in my life to merit such unbounded happiness   15.000274063318049
entirely my dear count   11.297017041992161
and you said truly   2.10907340804207
always tell me everything said maximilian with a smile   12.392760705961711
you are punctual thank you   20.23911286669702
lucien   14.418751389167985
why does not god if he really hates the wicked as he is said to do send down brimstone and fire and consume them altogether   6.760061477535568
well what is the matter my dear   11.130086321931058
bonacieux with a half smile which was not exempt from a tinge of impatience   9.435186152712678
that is not probable   9.33411881446184
on my return vasiliki and her daughter haydée had disappeared   14.503401876072388
the comte de la fere madame replied the young man bowing   14.270400865143277
e   16.593123923963528
while la carconte displayed the charming fashion prevalent among the women of arles a mode of attire borrowed equally from greece and arabia   12.635523482430136
you here sir   16.037326699828164
replied franz   12.605577504659447
to danglars monte cristo also wrote requesting him to excuse the whimsical gift of a capricious millionaire and to beg the baroness to pardon the eastern fashion adopted in the return of the horses   12.5542356350234
most likely said d artagnan   8.868751180145829
oh my god   13.663590548286079
it is an every day occurrence for a gambler to lose not only what he possesses but also what he has not   13.667547362200558
how   16.09811520483015
these words were pronounced with that imperturbable phlegm which distinguished athos in the hour of danger and with that excessive politeness which made of him at certain moments a king more majestic than kings by birth   16.88428007840524
and approaching the desk he removed the sheet of paper which morrel had placed over the letter he had begun and took the latter in his hands   9.690984381188573
it is now eleven answered grimaud   8.584154207260177
you know i always did call you my child   10.405383855834435
oh the heartless treacherous scoundrels   14.05545925059054
come said the king will you swear by my father that athos was at your residence during the event and that he took no part in it   13.772274466127879
stay said mazarin drawing the ring from his finger my dear d artagnan there is a diamond which belonged to you formerly it is but just it should return to you   18.61586253516676
i must leave you at ten o clock   16.764368723925678
you got in very well   3.270833316086577
all my misfortunes arise from my having said nearly what you have said before a woman whom i thought my friend and who betrayed me   13.02672856369623
not an instant to be lost   12.393909140642771
yes   15.28199611043809
it would have been too tedious to acquire the names of the prisoners   12.119474866429234
i have nothing but memory   17.33943236102818
and the valet placed the cup on the table nearest to the sofa which was like all the rest covered with papers   6.788309948463313
your excellency will know when you have read the letter   12.54900333690188
but d artagnan being the more active reached it first and placed his foot upon it   13.480908472012063
and his appearance had nothing extraordinary in it   7.26424799593475
i   12.553315313505488
or s blood my brave athos will die   11.523677741329115
responded caderousse waving his hand in token of adieu to danglars and bending his steps towards the allées de meilhan moving his head to and fro and muttering as he went after the manner of one whose mind was overcharged with one absorbing idea   15.747411818325245
she reflected likewise that the cardinal would be furious at her return and consequently would be more disposed to listen to the complaints brought against her than to the accusations she brought against others   8.909962458213858
my first sentiment was horror the second indifference the third curiosity   10.443789666241118
colonel colonel cried mordaunt you are betrayed   17.7110797031731
tonight after twelve i will come and see you and you shall convince me   19.75348326614639
you see that i can not like you for instance settle on any fixed plan   11.054001189678216
he stopped them to offer his compliments upon their appointments which in an instant drew round them a hundred gapers   18.38602801291142
well my faith   11.250496711689422
to you i will say have you not madame put aside some of the surest deadliest most speedy poison   12.312044689796155
he hoped that the weight of earth would not be so great that he could not overcome it   14.312834071623419
listen said the count   11.169907650356793
well   10.844029352734092
above the room in which debray had been dividing two millions and a half with madame danglars was another inhabited by persons who have played too prominent a part in the incidents we have related for their appearance not to create some interest   12.864850806192015
yellow boys   10.829535974345863
inquired the vicomte de bragelonne   13.730407757218352
in spite of his repugnance to address the guards dantès turned to the nearest gendarme and taking his hand comrade said he i adjure you as a christian and a soldier to tell me where we are going   14.195636942175211
do you hear   8.293222596617476
leaving the village of linas without stopping at the telegraph which flourished its great bony arms as he passed the count reached the tower of montlhéry situated as everyone knows upon the highest point of the plain of that name   9.783732076912433
alas   14.19781868359748
ah diable   12.841249218259943
come fernand won t you return to marseilles with us   11.87331901388526
de morcerf and i have talked about this marriage but madame de morcerf and albert you do not mean to say that it would not be a good match   18.483877621906352
the clerk continued to write for the next five minutes   9.573409461611854
what has he done madame   19.692647464351612
the devil take you said aramis   11.167378564687308
at length i heard the well known noise of the door which opened and shut   19.105197830205675
as i entered nîmes i literally waded in blood   9.414558274836727
since daybreak la ramee had been occupied with the preparations and trusting no one but himself he had visited personally the successor of pere marteau   14.911549297669115
he questioned me concerning captain leclere s death   8.42543465976081
yes albert from whatever source the blow may have proceeded it may be from an enemy but that enemy is only the agent of providence   11.75359322261611
and then dantès countenance became gloomy for the oath of vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory and he reflected how much ill in these times a man with thirteen or fourteen millions could do to his enemies   18.931058792723494
the vulture may not see the fowl or may fall a hundred yards from the fish pond   12.289408739120436
gutenberg   11.377032083025354
is there a window in the dressing room   14.589278766662066
you won t forget the boy sir   8.206928400511352
at the queen s last word d artagnan had dragged porthos into the gallery   18.470523307605234
to be sure   8.446599587030565
this time we risk our blood   10.49889171476949
bonacieux with an energy of which she might not have been believed capable   4.22307802001607
now for the wager   9.557841566801233
now gentlemen said he conduct me where you will   17.021427471955878
do i wish to follow it   10.572447716054548
oh   8.884723150457523
can you have lost them my lord or do you think they have been stolen   6.0333942894377
c   8.005786906472892
interrupted the young man warmly   16.236456292229406
at intervals he listened to learn if the noise had not begun again and grew impatient at the prudence of the prisoner who did not guess he had been disturbed by a captive as anxious for liberty as himself   12.325260385030552
it is then buckingham   13.794261070076583
i was reflecting in the first place replied dantès upon the enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to reach the high perfection to which you have attained   18.419996129769675
why really the thing seems to me simple enough   5.3381259479890435
this was too much for felton   16.727177658455552
are you ambitious   16.67305332023726
said the count with an air of surprise remarkably well counterfeited   11.3391707922781
the young girl had freshness and beauty which many duchesses would have purchased with their coronets   8.702689881170205
exactly   10.001973748982108
i am a daughter of earth i am a sister of thy faith that is all   15.104096665122675
and the cardinal m   9.228438644754927
treat me in the same way   10.552399014865996
not of providence but of fate   15.793515727803602
take your handkerchief   13.319778208149398
no one enters here without an order from m   11.775129165471837
well dear monsieur la ramee replied the cardinal let him prove a true and thankful keeper and we will shut our eyes upon his rural misdeeds and put on his back a uniform to make him respectable and in the pockets of that uniform some pistoles to drink to the king s health   12.943996928421683
no not yet   13.213707686788343
when the hour for his jailer s visit arrived dantès straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could and placed it in its accustomed place   8.330544089002709
cried the pretended monk pardon you   10.348146615841982
the gate is shut said aramis but if these gentlemen like a cool retreat under the trees and perfect seclusion i will get the key from the hotel de rohan and we shall be well suited   21.010280853218894
doubtless albert was about to discuss seriously his right to the academic chair when they were informed that dinner was ready   10.424353820654009
you speak very suddenly of love monsieur said the young woman shaking her head   18.074086872096544
i will keep it for myself   4.445290970313974
but athos might be said to bear a charmed life   13.830454730242971
said porthos but i don t like to abuse your kindness   11.500732479546828
but in this world we must risk something   9.726121158694493
they arrived at the drinking room of the parpaillot   12.017353697079018
yes   14.56283745354037
château renaud and beauchamp looked at each other   15.79196091251844
i believe and i repeat it to your majesty that the queen conspires against the power of the king but i have not said against his honor   8.19750575276381
the man is tired said the captain conduct him to his bed   9.623151813929748
bah   9.784273427413993
come come calm yourself   8.440434584597723
he resolved this time to know with whom he had to deal and fell upon the body of his comrade as if he were dead   17.49250725326455
at these words there was a murmur along the benches and a second voice not that of a woman but a man s stout and furious thundered behind d artagnan   15.403681968128307
morcerf entered and in place of the usual target he saw some playing cards fixed against the wall   10.888728403266668
why replied danglars not entirely so   12.991180465948425
well said d artagnan smiling at the misanthropy of athos which from any other person would have offended him i ride what i can get   11.761932643161746
ah   14.126971585842618
endeavor to remember the names of those faithful servants who crossed the channel in spite of monsieur de richelieu tracking the roads along which they passed by their blood to bring back to your majesty certain jewels given by you to buckingham   13.203917716025451
how should i know what a horse is   13.490556764847888
but with what motive have you learned all this   14.258443520633403
besides the same thing had occurred often before   16.622590494820333
the daughter of ali pasha   13.906487184043367
they have been stolen replied the duke and it is the cardinal who has dealt this blow   11.23545060760455
the cavalcanti are all descended from princes   10.366454768298352
yes   15.26679692969636
nor i nor i chorused the sailors   5.97967262608084
there she made a fresh sign of silence and opened a second door concealed by tapestry   9.053099432909413
what do you demand   16.796197603297735
as he left the queen s presence bernouin summoned him to the cardinal   12.566361988751128
bertuccio   14.219128359276972
you would arrest the duc de beaufort armed in the field   9.620782800256826
ah i recollect replied the count   10.341487368836104
but said the baroness i thought you never put the money out to interest   7.899412390963445
monsieur monsieur cried mazarin you are breaking your word to me   10.561199793159004
i have none and am obliged to prepare my own meals   17.020155727718603
i also i love you   11.202523852578175
i must know what you mean to do   11.014257077530107
well do you know why they die so multitudinously at m   6.095665321611788
yes yes murmured he i have often felt regret for the victim but never the very slightest remorse for the assassin   9.296013624605152
the moment that d artagnan saw that his wish was accomplished and his man would not escape him he recovered his usual tranquillity   15.437693176328837
before an hour has passed you will be discovered arrested obliged to kill me which would be a crime unworthy of loyal gentlemen like you   13.311906729176096
do you talk in your sleep   12.291494629529854
and the queen advanced to meet the messenger whose hand she seized affectionately whilst he knelt down and presented a letter to her contained in a case of gold   11.87191788365717
but there is no need to know danger in order to fear it   9.357093379050447
in an hour   10.560133509651834
confess that it is for the sake of making me talk that you invent this story and create this personage   13.726258532204618
he immediately signalled it   10.974580550984932
ridicule sir why you know not its power in france and yet you ought to know it   18.99349748574144
oh i obtained or rather claimed that   6.354537646163008
caderousse took from his pocket a small case of black shagreen opened and gave it to the jeweller   12.845924109154748
at this very moment my lord he no doubt dreams that he is one already   11.234342403488869
asked the young man anxiously in his turn descending from the table   15.064461344025247
three days passed seventy two long tedious hours which he counted off by minutes   14.933696495027588
and joy the surprise of seeing you so suddenly ah i feel as if i were going to die   5.39938900536934
to a convent   7.3368597981349515
why   15.6861573122981
but when i added to the gun an english cutlass with which i had shivered his highness s yataghan to pieces the bey yielded and agreed to forgive the hand and head but on condition that the poor fellow never again set foot in tunis   11.321085745297566
yes said monte cristo   6.258954772435261
so that but for this marriage she would have been your heir   6.327178846099788
the carriage resumed its course and mazarin who had held his breath ventured to breathe again   11.473769871122085
m   8.802358402705998
he is young it is true but he seems to me a thorough seaman and of full experience   11.486771289427448
but his lips uttered no sound and as though all his strength were centred in that internal emotion he sighed and closed his eyes   15.125744414239422
at length after nine days of despair and fasting the old man died cursing those who had caused his misery and saying to mercédès if you ever see my edmond again tell him i die blessing him   14.992801034868087
his hatred of the king who deprived him of his estates and forbade him to bear the name of de winter   0.06015856526564001
i assure you i shall be very much in the way in that little boat said mousqueton   10.680535558383164
now am i at liberty to retire   15.0023245947901
see here are two similar letters to that you have yourself received   10.021295090713833
he married her   13.678517026922808
now the sight of this chateau had taken raoul back fifty leagues westward and had caused him to review his life from the moment when he had taken leave of little louise to that in which he had seen her for the first time   9.700085336816759
and milady but obscurely perceived the means which could lead to this result   5.991414532141611
but on the other hand there is abundant question of you   17.49203350121956
they were those we rode on   12.331744631187805
you intended to give me a two franc piece and see you gave me a double napoleon   4.721145184731178
he extended a hand to raoul and said my young friend all the praises that are given me should be passed on to the count here   3.8230668346633383
not one man stirred so monsieur de beaufort was obliged to be satisfied with calling them all kinds of rascals underneath the sun   14.716942669804311
the people were shouting and running about with torches   23.02231665563259
he sat down by the side of the moat buried his face in his hands and reflected   5.22031401560402
aramis is your brother as well as mine and aramis has once loved you as i love you now and as i have ever loved you   12.807163682528392
d artagnan threw the dice with a trembling hand and turned up the number three   10.660930504807009
of the handkerchief   10.209599910749208
during the night the undertakers had executed their melancholy office and wrapped the corpse in the winding sheet which whatever may be said about the equality of death is at least a last proof of the luxury so pleasing in life   8.076380981866176
i won t ask anything more of you   16.591274773550666
besides d artagnan has not told us his idea yet   12.370399085561349
the three friends hastened on but in a short time were obliged to slacken the pace   12.928828571667633
ah this time you can not lose ground my fine friend   8.906940364281395
certainly my dear sir   13.064906579612993
you are silent   12.143572077687073
it is you monsieur d artagnan she said fixing a gaze full of melancholy interest on the countenance of the officer and i know you well   12.674194491976959
guilty   17.455009184241398
danglars felt a dreadful spasm dart through his heart   13.067023952663885
chapter xlvii   12.168131845089867
bonacieux   11.833070361767032
will that do   12.178598002396177
it is a magnificent charity   15.78190706364904
she is not my mistress replied the young sailor gravely   13.30101148948912
when he is tired he will perhaps tell us that he has had enough of it   6.854603255235313
he had reflected that in a few minutes the cardinal would be warned by this cursed stranger who appeared to be his agent and he judged with reason he had not a moment to lose   11.360188648218859
d artagnan was still in deep thought when some one touched him on the shoulder   15.646624095814035
i should be delighted to do so was the reply   15.209206286158604
well on the day when your appointment as an officer of the legion of honor was announced in the papers we were all sitting with my grandfather m   8.27316001966551
patience madame i am coming to it   10.150144592931373
it was evident that the execution was in the eyes of the people only the commencement of the carnival   8.812357316871775
but d artagnan stopped his hand and in a hoarse voice cried wait   14.520053699012834
thanks for the comparison said albert with a bow   16.99759017177963
then followed barrois the old servant of m   12.912152687985673
and had he dared he would like lucius brutus have kissed his mother earth   6.588813842381985
as to aramis he dwelt in a little lodging composed of a boudoir an eating room and a bedroom which room situated as the others were on the ground floor looked out upon a little fresh green garden shady and impenetrable to the eyes of his neighbors   17.420050228640807
oh count i shall sleep calmly deliciously in the arms of death   4.8885694922574405
sinbad the sailor   12.586380965626953
chapter lxvii   8.53519207111521
ask m   8.245938764871886
he has done better than that he has made himself understood   8.76018201908184

civil war like a forest flame   10.915850752600795
beauchamp chapter 85   13.303935836464905
she did not know whether the abbess was a royalist or a cardinalist   10.350727877362083
the person whose mysterious arrival had attracted the attention of franz stood in a kind of half light that rendered it impossible to distinguish his features although his dress was easily made out   9.902231861142017
he accustomed himself to speaking to the new jailer although the latter was if possible more taciturn than the old one   5.4100077738423655
if he makes any noise stifle him   9.046664454876803
asked he   13.165550479573962
de wardes our presumptuous hero gave but little heed to that although the marquis was young handsome rich and high in the cardinal s favor   7.988418636485707
this creek was sufficiently wide at its mouth and deep in the centre to admit of the entrance of a small vessel of the lugger class which would be perfectly concealed from observation   9.220401555142246
replied dantès i am not proud but i am happy and happiness blinds i think more than pride   8.549688313746334
that will do   14.87362989719504
cried caderousse raising himself on his elbows   4.938817921704649
the duke of buckingham assassinated   14.402158456746044
no i thank you   12.173476338974416
milady was about to cry out immediately but she reflected that such precipitation would not be very gracious toward d artagnan   12.049810755835718
and you visit him   9.353066276248713
i understand it   5.374414516982402
of madame de chevreuse   13.100864310061962
it is a young girl   13.737448563831798
baptistin left the room   11.339100278833827
d artagnan rapidly drew his seat nearer to milady s   11.576269599881105
fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve in greece still having his name kept on the army roll   9.35686344992305
i feel myself quite in a humor for it   7.136494839770972
and why separate   12.918452075190034
i always accept   18.711582452569328
these important advantages d artagnan found to his own taste in the rue tiquetonne at the sign of the roe   11.08820538685117
but after two or three hours he encountered an obstacle   13.610656542499838
you said you could give me advice what is it   13.676557677607873
it was a very simple natural circumstance and yet it created a profound sensation   12.44186305379954
it was necessary to be as good a horseman as he was to risk such a scheme for no sooner had the animal felt the burning tinder than he uttered a cry of pain and reared and jumped as if he had been mad   12.169100732249726
and the young girl jumped into the britzka which was admirably arranged for sleeping in without scarcely touching the step   20.452751055941
with such a vade mecum d artagnan was morally and physically an exact copy of the hero of cervantes to whom we so happily compared him when our duty of an historian placed us under the necessity of sketching his portrait   11.896524216244442
i am a ruined man lost destroyed   6.951636346030514
or upon my soul i will blow your brains out   5.960786161727377
what planchet is monsieur d artagnan here   10.918966133246535
my dear groslow answered mordaunt you know the french proverb nothing one does not do one s self is ever well done   17.09758909579552
but without words protestations or vows my life has entwined itself with yours   13.432624519164877
they are mistaken   11.251388511231536
explained porthos stepping forward   15.992584346121586
some of your people have committed the strangest mistake they have just arrested edmond dantès mate of my vessel   7.6324760905746025
good day commander   13.703365801591648
i had been warned by the authorities that a celebrated coiner of bad money would arrive at my inn with several of his companions all disguised as guards or musketeers   14.657211374862007
a customs officer was laid low and two sailors wounded   16.68769660383636
you imagine him capable of writing the letter   17.74792949445258
asked the baron rising and going a step backward   13.089164684946752
the rochellais had at last taken possession of the bastion   11.216676570601049
yes and that s all settled   13.631413721562676
we shall pass an agreeable evening   17.85886092806833
of all that passed in that sleep or the time which glided away while it lasted i have no remembrance   15.291787573600523
we shall laugh over all this in five minutes   16.560708783232435
here it is answered the other   7.716727513793342
he exists as certainly as that you may see his small yacht with all her sails spread   9.029442494971683
the sound of a kiss was heard and valentine fled through the avenue   15.137375014166345
however he continued all the same but with increasing warmth yes i can very well understand that after having inherited the fortune of my brother it would be very agreeable to you to be my heir likewise   9.754483474769103
yes i have heard it said replied the coadjutor   7.370673365800386
franz d épinay   13.310470378886796
monte cristo bowed and left the house   12.355800661774891
no sire   10.67550706701525
bertuccio and to a king s attorney at that   12.472821185614519
yes madame replied the coadjutor   9.532882383248985
we may easily understand how eagerly the particulars were asked for given and received   14.10981870666499
i had about a million in their hands but warned in time i withdrew it a month ago   13.55095772949036
besides porthos can not owe you much   15.856325105826118
bonacieux we shall hear no more   15.07267615796411
as to haydée these terrible reminiscences seemed to have overpowered her for a moment for she ceased speaking her head leaning on her hand like a beautiful flower bowing beneath the violence of the storm   9.92508470270175
and you have returned have you not   8.264950324988046
danglars shuddered   17.332647734029713
it is well   15.035052044193236
there are virtues which become crimes by exaggeration   18.848338740056466
ah my dear doctor said the procureur heaven declares itself against my house   13.412019161575248
cried morrel   15.484340024733752
yes madame   16.560071188017076
and seeing that m   8.776045711632772
ah indeed so much the better   3.075555041302751
what   15.642260939615648
and what has happened to you my dear porthos   13.249177579775544
well i am wrong   15.251015652015484
two or three times even to the great astonishment of his friends he had when aramis allowed some rudimental error to escape him replaced a verb in its right tense and a noun in its case   15.000169651797435
she hastened down and told him what had occurred on the day when the agent of thomson french had come to her father s related the scene on the staircase repeated the promise she had made and showed him the letter   10.461918532901224
you ought to be satisfied   19.691893718034297
how fast you go   7.166525256803258
i am sure i have and you shall judge for yourself   11.213664522944923
listen   15.071744545652788
the four friends followed him   14.305482873534018
barrois made some steps towards his master   11.000791089845524
the pain i gave him must have been atrocious   5.729766553033082
said he in a low voice you send us away   10.542907614609149
just heaven what have i read   10.851390052558585
arrest the prime minister of king charles i   9.140814320068538
he is a churchman   3.3086973568522406
i took a week to go another to return four days of quarantine and forty eight hours to stay there   9.731635742057621
a negro   14.860292059706325
what say you morrel   9.670941511654885
bayonne   12.430428302419482
but instead either of calling out or defending himself he placed his forefinger on his lips and said in a low tone hush   7.076435105704082
well then i wish that order of which you are bearer seeing that i have not one of my own and must have one   14.883149003726063
that name sounds strange to you said athos smiling   16.938973905161536
if you ask him he says sinbad the sailor   9.25875704504878
how is that   3.7227385275229903
40070m from where we stood i could see in the middle of the lake a large blank mass   13.035314828427566
for a very serious matter which bids fair to make work for the executioner   11.067055311256242
you command us my lord to do so   10.053977936022216
cried albert   12.172406563504266
said the major   6.775869644867761
humph said the major   18.584349408554942
they saw monsieur de vendome that is to say the son of henry iv   10.555984154381362
the count watched him   15.203142012680534
certainly you must give the orders for i intend residing at the house   10.853398741349343
five minutes after m   9.652266122145456
they would be glad to see me dead but they would not like themselves to die with me   10.559485031749999
barrois reopened his bloodshot eyes   11.433879041442127
he would not take them   14.64084549002678
but you see that the angel whom you hoped for has left this earth she has nothing more to do with the adoration of men   20.241201222733217
surely you ought to be able to tell me better than any other person   12.076296036006354
yes   12.597016971057132
yes thought planchet to treat me as a prince   14.887919790305759
said the queen   10.26048968013944
and without waiting for the answer of the newcomer to this proof of affection m   7.220062580844574
he spoke italian like a tuscan and spanish like a castilian   15.578403183142296
i am glad to be reassured on that point   18.276424011534505
gracious me   9.684887856443522
m   10.890922506346941
i owe you some explanations for my conduct and as you are a woman that can perfectly understand me i will give them   17.545210656987113
he turned and saw a young woman who made him a sign to follow her   9.852463858191594
1   13.31830614347443
previously to which i had been confined for three years in the fortress of fenestrelle   9.130372853262209
is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express himself so favorably of me   4.672622952911385
whilst making this reflection chance seemed as it were to give him the lie direct   15.405172618376263
the two friends as we see were worthy of and understood one another   10.795014552139206
it would be ridiculous in me to regulate my conduct by such caprices   0.8372751892611099
alas   12.66099293949295
i searched the whole thicket   9.534570613969656
and these men were your friends   12.294434389734443
it was the letter written as our readers know to julie and signed sinbad the sailor   4.675269025283566
if they do not bring us peace we will give them war   15.003926204220358
i recognize this hobbema   11.473131034133536
at the second turn a bunch of fresh violets thrown from a carriage filled with harlequins indicated to albert that like himself and his friend the peasants had changed their costume also   17.823678914411566
m   15.510391974293054
the discovery of a completely unknown manuscript at a period in which historical science is carried to such a high degree appeared almost miraculous   21.60470481328872
it is said to have been a congestion of the brain or apoplexy which is the same thing is it not   8.440608515106032
yes it is i my uncle i the son of milady i the monk i the secretary and friend of cromwell i know you now both you and your companions   12.467609609297005
and be assured that you shall be accompanied by one who will blow your brains out at the first attempt you make to return to england or the continent   15.07036709903829
besides you owe me some thanks   17.706533056758403
these were all who were left of the little troop   15.379491009240086
and do you believe he knew you again kitty   6.501798172116777
oh mercy m   10.413079695521477
in that way i discovered that the charming traveler was marie michon   10.71596568366337
you are referring to the demands of the rebels and to the tone in which they stated them   16.001534415889083
ring then if you please for a second knife fork and plate and we will dine together   12.964046647020618
this is the first time i have gone without my dinner for ten years and it is generally my best meal   15.083047647336919
but where can i wait   8.64416616499333
the young man felt her press his hand and comprehended that this was a sentiment not of coquetry but of gratitude because of his departure   16.514769063127005
d artagnan did not believe athos to be capable of a deception but he sought an excuse for not going to the rendezvous   8.188786774600661
the first object that met the eyes of d artagnan on entering the room was brisemont stretched upon the ground and rolling in horrible convulsions   8.438147641125335
take this ring   12.707795471053004
that other ball contains a letter   3.8713981919034044
take compassion on us or like jupiter you will wither us up   8.857473105791076
said beauchamp much surprised   14.183490968853377
and they continued their way crossing the barricades getting the chains about their legs pushed about questioning and questioned   13.653752648678141

the messenger without replying a single word bowed took the letter with the order for the two hundred pistoles and retired   8.782944621797355

milady had listened to all this menacing tirade with a smile of disdain on her lips but rage in her heart   12.445392131427946
without this danglars would have been quite ignorant of the time for daylight did not reach his cell   12.372008387375335
athos paused   7.284307149085381
perhaps you speak the truth aramis   14.257568303694152
she lived in the place royale then the fashionable quarter at number 6 and he undertook to call and take d artagnan with him in order to introduce him   9.846951978058382
let us change the subject   10.354155585833027

let us talk of your happy return my boy   8.727325144874875

if i sought your ruin fool i should drag you to the first guard house   9.790089397978516
dantès made a gesture   6.971921556846002

mother i must go said albert in a firm calm voice   8.003278901609503

her legs failed her and she sank into an armchair   14.288689739168884
for death is the door which leads to perdition or to salvation   16.165941193123768
impossible   9.226578838870566
not i unfortunately   4.571168621054471
the two young men galloped off in the direction mentioned and in ten minutes reached the inn   14.273469096394436
if mousqueton were with us observed athos on reaching the spot where they had had a dispute with the paviers how he would tremble at passing this   14.390436031107424
and pray what was this quarrel about   10.379602772121455
go into your own room and tomorrow endeavor again to get me an answer to the letter i gave you   15.053628851392952
you must go away immediately   4.826740341742433
i shall pass over them   6.773277597581456
i was looking around for porthos when i saw near me a head which had been broken but which for better or worse had been patched with plaster and with black silk   12.221203785145892
but listen at that moment a window opened and a man began to sing a tempest from the fronde did blow to day i think twill blow sieur mazarin away   15.011684616235977
what is to be done   3.7818554498295036
still dressed with sedulous care his hair well arranged and curled his person perfumed he looked owing to his extreme taste in dress only half his age   10.923401560154257
i who had sacrificed for you the baronne de i know it well   6.897868577918128
that is to say whom you do not like returned the queen   5.424188074423539
no she was french but she had married in england   8.80992577115084
of the great cardinal   10.626300207158208
the magistrate trembled convulsively   12.77331973757282
yet its notes so tenderly expressive and fearfully grand as the wretched husband and wife give vent to their different griefs and passions thrilled through the soul of franz with an effect equal to his first emotions upon hearing it   14.43235656015109
they would prefer i should think to breathe in the garden rather than suffocate here since they are not playing   13.706264237658685
he had made his valet cover him with honey   15.195459001040557
as i noticed the significant manner in which the whole party pointed to my blood stained garments i involuntarily surveyed myself and then i discovered that the thick warm drops that had so bedewed me as i lay beneath the staircase must have been the blood of la carconte   15.996702574971719
what have you done   7.662299832308135
not the same thing by any means   12.247411729245988
as he found himself in the quarter in which aramis lived he took it into his head to pay his friend a visit in order to explain the motives which had led him to send planchet with a request that he would come instantly to the mousetrap   14.53625048584406
make no noise sir unless you wish me to consider you as one of the men of whom you spoke just now as cowards who take their weakness for a shield   19.86417458363026
porthos looked at d artagnan with an expression of profound admiration   5.3187176072259295
dantès fell on his knees and prayed earnestly   14.978035528832242
if he had only a comb and hair grease he d take the shine off the gentlemen in white kids   10.33120674651318
said he   15.873252104637976
d artagnan and planchet spurred their steeds and took the road to paris   4.450194260499324
and here we are at the ninth   11.381768470754752
your soul is darkened and consequently the sky of the future appears stormy and unpromising   15.812332463542855
the general doubted my fidelity   12.402405622953392
those who took me from my father and who always intended sooner or later to sell me again to my original proprietor as they have now done calculated that in order to make the most of their bargain it would be politic to leave me in possession of all my personal and hereditary worth and even to increase the value if possible   10.75349947868877
to give ten francs to this honest fellow replied raoul taking a pistole from his pocket   12.55483421760768
said d artagnan embarrassed   10.62024620729332
on the honor of gentlemen said aramis and porthos   13.995731004142776
you have saved my life and i thank you continued dantès   12.398990779234984
the answer to madame s replied kitty all in a tremble   22.920737962595787
he began to reflect upon the events that had passed   13.282184035110129
but tell me does the count of morcerf never visit the opera   11.881484028244552
i shall detain you until this evening in the palais de justice   15.053064743155156
if i could but do as you do and eat pates and drink burgundy at the house of father marteau s successor   16.174749199978233
then through an opening cautiously made the policeman began to watch the length of the rue cocatrix as if he was waiting for some one   10.175252790620155
the duke however was not dead   14.479874037990175
yes yes   16.442277806232532
well said d artagnan rising we have them friend porthos and even something better   14.9906920054559
she had still four days before her   15.480251821307375
patience said athos whose eyes were fixed in the direction of the rue du bac patience   16.055066767096854
i am well furnished with such playthings   8.656243968208642
for if you return home safely then then   13.470940020008793
besides you forget cæsar an indigestion declares itself immediately while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day or two   8.666681017432191
an old acquaintance replied grimaud   13.352559124931743
the executioner opened his eyes turned toward the young man and grasped his arm   13.151016142136877
on saturday at six o clock   15.908664226611016
at these words the public attention became more intense and all eyes were turned towards the door through which benedetto was to enter   11.391021367636775
for their ears closely applied to the door did not lose a syllable of what he said while their mouths repeated as he went on the insulting expressions of the captain to all the people in the antechamber   14.409860838649196
and you are his friends messieurs athos porthos and aramis   10.080236759520117
valentine opened her eyes   12.537191830877541
diavolo   12.697842250709648
and you have no servant   11.916406532396726
come   16.31417366904939
yes the third   5.107345333618981
carmela wished to form a quadrille but there was one lady wanting   7.8098119283935254
athos could not therefore have chosen a more inauspicious moment to speak of his friends poor atoms lost in that raging whirlwind   13.139549715686915
sir said he you are aware that valentine is about to enter her nineteenth year which renders it important that she should lose no time in forming a suitable alliance   9.248055061770893
the second operation was as successful as the first la jeune amélie was in luck   9.279502064872041
yes   11.818849564144575
oh   14.936800174720421
the conduct is infamously violent   7.302711259995159
de tréville that will be unjust to the guardsmen   19.082033242685043
what was that letter you were about to read monsieur aramis and which you so promptly concealed   8.536532079377942
if one has it not one must do without it   16.6613818985006
he is here and here said she touching her eyes and her heart   10.597904638490066
what are you bringing me   11.885093333387413
well said porthos what do you want and why do you not let us listen to the end of the conversation   15.483747747187358
confess how you obtained this animal   8.236773806119087
asked athos   12.543791933902135
do you not know him   18.204720315298335
but you are not one of us said porthos   22.970490266685584
ah said mme   11.354165156144669
edmond felt the trembling of the rock beneath which he lay   11.250404248108302
i thought i recognized him and i was not mistaken   6.33747452278011
what are you doing reverend sir   12.429527126863414
cries of death   13.882706627697512
will that satisfy you   12.622009863862669
ah   9.154549051366565
oh father i exclaimed you are very good   18.685999713259292
the signatures were perfectly legal   9.19313149598467
at the letter s the old man stopped her   12.06507520457086
as to monsieur who had begun the siege he left to the cardinal the task of finishing it   17.55632765687298
here we are without occupation it seems to me   15.798175918496407
these men were shopkeepers who had arms to lend to those who had none   14.346258656507064
oh i can not behold this frightful spectacle   11.965771896207396
and besides said the countess accustomed as he is to burning climates possibly he does not feel the heat as we do   12.759868150173668
in the surrounding plain which more resembled a dusty lake than solid ground were scattered a few miserable stalks of wheat the effect no doubt of a curious desire on the part of the agriculturists of the country to see whether such a thing as the raising of grain in those parched regions was practicable   18.749264232652177
and have i ever since by word or look given you cause of regret for having selected me from the numbers that would willingly have sacrificed their lives for you   9.511206862517263
let us go you mean   9.89896477170707
but it was too far off and there was not light enough to enable selim where he was standing to distinguish and recognize the object presented to his view   15.344547319271168
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law   14.231942142186359
franz resolved to wait for albert as late as possible   14.826276931437459
ed   11.63844072999266
come on come on   17.072751476002992
i should do her justice by sending her to tyburn said buckingham   3.8121180638223784
yes but to be captain one must do a little flattery to one s patrons   10.826145161871494
you must hope for us both maximilian   17.268709499960966
ascribe to men then what is happening and not to god   5.072857742141438
woman   10.288631847133097
the old man uttered a cry and turned round   11.269555300347529
everybody talked at once without waiting for a reply and each one seemed to be contented with expressing his or her own thoughts   11.370600494404172
asked mercédès with an angry glance what do you mean   15.887875085371878
and there again you are wrong   8.923275405454362
i declare said porthos i shall eat nothing if they do not take it away   9.577195571032014
that is to say cried bonacieux who saw he had taken a false step that is to say you have answered that you should recognize him said the commissary   10.459368726132812
relating to him   14.092309942729862
ah   9.02809031191685
the abbé shrugged his shoulders   2.852494404039348
bonacieux and was expressed in these terms there are many thanks to be offered to you and to be transmitted to you   5.614421311266603
but the bourgeois more numerous overwhelmed them with a veritable hurricane of iron   14.806196674166275
sir said she it is superfluous for me to tell you that valentine s marriage is broken off since it was here that the affair was concluded   13.39399211806704
said d artagnan abandoning the attempt to burst open the panel after several ineffectual attempts athos i can not imagine how you can talk to us in that way   15.320150824695977
what are you saying   16.799151509628473
repeated a voice behind the count and why   12.207570007892599
the queen charged me to tell you to watch over yourself for she had advice that your assassination would be attempted   12.718200452903242
and then the past will no longer exist   11.319012304548467
no my lord   7.399589978247152
patience patience   14.066775876861563
let us ride onward   8.68942068096989
and what may it be   12.25620362512251
you appear as unhappy as i am the reverse   15.685508172035817
he passed through several apartments of an elegance of which even the greatest nobles of france had not even an idea and arrived at length in a bedchamber which was at once a miracle of taste and of richness   11.012087216002177
speak monsieur speak at once   9.443256493969411
he was the son of a banker at lyons named particelli who after becoming a bankrupt chose to change his name to emery   17.619535953503334
omer   17.580776329732288
30327m she then turned towards the avenue   11.865400330500336
said morrel what has become of her   12.549251558869077
suppose we warn the masters   10.521214660612102
there it is   5.204651923849977
you haven t the heart to kill me   8.20413139309278
are there any other people in saint germain who sell straw   9.499430374980136
franz entered the hotel   12.818773405824302
dantès heard joyfully the key grate in the lock   12.616165786143588
because replied franz you seem to me like a man who persecuted by society has a fearful account to settle with it   16.221938514281625
for a half league they proceeded thus the cannon shot sounding so near that they expected at each discharge to hear the hum of the balls   12.179600021647902
yes said the queen it is requested   2.407711818661106
rely on me   12.629539938019022
this child for whom my poor sister would go to the town five or six leagues off to purchase the earliest fruits and the most tempting sweetmeats preferred to palma grapes or genoese preserves the chestnuts stolen from a neighbor s orchard or the dried apples in his loft when he could eat as well of the nuts and apples that grew in my garden   6.0892108575525015
all was useless the treasure disappeared and had again reverted to the genii from whom for a moment he had hoped to carry it off   7.780473947974007
i am not one of those tyrants who detain women by force   7.538164567878366
permit me to assure your excellency said bertuccio that the horses you speak of were not to be sold when i purchased yours   8.23709517513429
it s the mistral said caderousse and it will be sure to last till tomorrow morning   11.541752929814217
finally d artagnan had entire faith in the bravery of planchet and reminded them of the manner in which he had conducted himself in the ticklish affair of boulogne   16.836038692488163
and when he has done i will if you like send him to you to brush your shoes   8.043265017305187
what reason   11.828262677469404
the sword pierced his heart   15.731114477419542
well replied the cardinal who could not for an instant suspect the loyalty of tréville and who felt that the victory was escaping him well but athos was taken in the house in the rue des fossoyeurs   16.00733151626075
it may be useful to you one of these days whether you remain here or return to the east   8.188516119495153
the person to whom i addressed my scruples asked me where your father had acquired his property   20.8747425688331
you may depend on my doing so sir said baptistin   12.756239176451665
anne of austria re entered her apartment and came out again almost immediately holding a rosewood casket in her hand with her cipher encrusted with gold   6.799871584338212
two hours passed away without anything fresh happening   10.941230093747537
to the sword sir   13.30137493789329
nothing nothing only shut the window   14.722086617576796
kill a woman   12.200720620786301
he shall die   10.079107426352246
is it to your mind   16.83921084464231
he has simply a mahogany secretaire in which the key is always kept   4.712603217520799
there remained in the banker s house only danglars closeted in his study and making his statement to the officer of gendarmes   15.115028760103165
may i presume to ask whether you have long possessed it   11.162918854482207
of how many persons   8.26857350395007
no replied the two musketeers after a moment s silence no sir we do not   8.739657597135729
chapter 11   6.287502450739732
cried the queen with a broken and trembling voice   12.307038410584695
the proposal was too advantageous to be refused the more so as the person for whom the yacht was intended had gone upon a tour through switzerland and was not expected back in less than three weeks or a month by which time the builder reckoned upon being able to complete another   9.194430418359243
he examined the bullets with which monte cristo performed this dexterous feat and saw that they were no larger than buckshot   12.832748033739211
but aramis and athos were the only ones to obey this command and the king s example   13.336743419953038
which means   15.325970734082686
well answered the old man by closing his eyes   7.275906553839845
as they returned toward the castle d artagnan thought of the miseries of poor human nature always dissatisfied with what it has ever desirous of what it has not   13.037113351085416
each of these mobs was led by a chief one of whom appeared to belong not to the people but to the honorable corporation of mendicants and the other notwithstanding his affected imitation of the people might easily be discerned to be a gentleman   3.518728697949909
he knows her brother in law   5.948938840339422
i am not much of a hand at figures so that i live almost from hand to mouth   7.6774269920425615
but these considerations never occurred to the duke and every day the cardinal received fresh accounts of him which were as unpleasant as possible to the minister   14.967995048024493
and how does m   13.403813982941424
what s the matter at the château d if   9.46567643209766
what do you mean   17.46384322292613
in a fortnight or three weeks time that is to say as fast as i can get there   8.887784368772518
but i do know you have nothing more to fear   12.78870307430851
stop   20.979652911531034
go edward and see   10.131845314974576
i know so many men already   14.126634770700171
the king s   17.277799861231173
but he flew into terrible rage   18.45717830195749
but lord wilmore did not omit to inform me my dear m   15.137868209836707
at the same time she seized that of her son and joined them together   9.971783590494258
pardon me and then tell me how i can risk my life to serve your grace   16.874162822496643
and do you say this wedding is at hand   18.396637140036695
the door was instantly opened and shut   14.75863503447178
it was evident either that he no longer possessed the confidence of his friend or that athos was bound by some invisible chain or that he had been forewarned of the lieutenant s visit   1.3719915306495647
prevent me then   5.164142219659397
but yet detail them to me   14.569142919329103
because i bent my arm and rested my hand on my elbow so   10.374275068432546
i shall have performed a good action and my heart will be lighter   6.431207305261421
which means i suppose that you refuse the service which i asked of you   7.561552565007538
at the palais royal the crowd which had flowed in from the adjacent street was still greater   13.064622529066128
will the petition go soon   9.34922578124211
to wait   19.39748274673263
himself   15.11939351861341
how   18.843096763192605
four or five cloaks had already been lifted with a dexterity without parallel and not one of the victims had dared to say a word when some fool of a fellow less patient than the others took it into his head to cry out guard   19.11973266140078
others filling the coach houses where the equipages encased and numbered appeared to have been installed for the last fifty years   13.99384850637298
de tréville calmly on the contrary i come to demand it of you   6.645993954273229
today her delirium is almost madness   7.28965009828264
how did you come to be dining with that prince whose house you have just left   14.287991022076868
in the midst of all this frightful tumult and these terrific cries two reports fearfully distinct followed by two shrieks more heartrending than all froze me with terror   12.298621124211172
asked d artagnan   11.713052161420183
i should lose myself in the cardinal s opinion   15.612992949401537
d artagnan rushed toward the refreshment room the three musketeers and the two guards following him   7.705022598696711
had he lived mercédès perchance had not become the wife of another for he would have been there to reproach her infidelity   3.1870269189971
at this instant m   17.434863052232565
no   17.460449307954974
at the first sound of the morning trumpet the friends separated   7.038207949138197
the review over the guards set forward alone on their march the musketeers waiting for the king which allowed porthos time to go and take a turn in his superb equipment in the rue aux ours   11.333755408956437
when you come to paris i will return all this   9.880380664656169
it was like a besieged town   12.664234994234752
not before me behind me   8.689652926169718
he has invited me to dine there   9.93519566259275
another nod on the part of grimaud   5.4434906011347834
of course that is perfectly just cried m   9.140587228221108
to tell you my lord that the moment has now arrived when with a single word you may recompense all these services   8.901713901853586
in the service of the four friends grimaud had had so frequent occasion to make lint and bandages that he had become something of a surgeon   12.629595217198696
asked the president   12.529119158936169
valentine and villefort were dumb   8.419453997131018
but as he was about to place his gloves and hat on a table he saw reflected in a glass opposite to him a figure which stood on the threshold of the room   13.336563555032843
the queen s voice   11.113766628648559
at each cross path was an orchestra and tables spread with refreshments   7.345163859718358
thank heaven that you came at noon rather than in the evening or tomorrow morning   6.561890254003583
zounds   5.220372482481859
repeated the agitated mother   17.802463255763673
at this moment he saw a cab at the top of the faubourg poissonnière   18.437937896520914
stay i think i told my steward yesterday to attend to this   10.936933428306368
the goldsmith knew the duke   10.51808480862307
at the noise made by d artagnan in entering aramis lifted up his head and beheld his friend   14.918482399755678
0311m edmond preserved the most admirable self command not suffering the faintest indication of a smile to escape him at the enumeration of all the benefits he would have reaped had he been able to quit the island   10.278369541775035
replied mazarin   13.468945913136842
i want friends   10.925095759841984
i do not deny the influence of which you speak or that i have not myself experienced it but with me it has been productive of evil rather than good   13.328486542342212
say no more about it   8.857379241542395
the decanter was nearly full with the exception of a little which had been already drunk by m   2.8769222428979173
but the rascal is so cunning he might have guessed our project   15.85620972372609
we ought to die together   10.398875991046864
and it was impossible for those who did not know his face to guess in whose presence they were   8.845406386251017
the captain replied by ordering the necessary maneuvers and toward seven o clock in the morning the little vessel cast anchor in the bay that had been named   10.494674185138912
dragoons swiss guardsmen musketeers light horsemen succeeded one another with a rapidity which might answer the purpose of the host very well but agreed badly with the views of the four friends   10.867685707085412
now what would you say to an ensign s commission in my guards and a company after the campaign   12.666348468087818
yes replied the stranger   15.824520991504698
general information about project gutenberg™ electronic works professor michael s   17.73302862452542
replied milady   12.937502601861091
said aramis on seeing them arrive   11.446552485117627
but he knew not how to account for the mysterious disappearance of mercédès   13.086469280654192
the delighted recipients of these munificent gifts would gladly have poured out their thanks to their generous benefactor but they had seen him upon quitting the hut merely give some orders to a sailor and then springing lightly on horseback leave marseilles by the porte d aix   13.680290720326026
you may be overheard   8.306775220631339
d artagnan on his return sent the twelve bottles of wine to the refreshment room of the guards with strict orders that great care should be taken of it   6.5265086952840745
but once started he could not stop   5.535286062804815
and remember moreover that it is often he who comes off victorious from the strife absolved of all crime in the eyes of the world   5.84160277655975
it is not their fault that they are bandits but that of the authorities   9.861838859653822
but what is the meaning of this change   14.031025349191875
the bell and bottle tavern and now let us leave mademoiselle danglars and her friend pursuing their way to brussels and return to poor andrea cavalcanti so inopportunely interrupted in his rise to fortune   19.116868843570032
oh no   8.657937944799682
cried madame de chevreuse clapping her hands   11.959934286092256
you must be satan   16.208304966755932
they told me it was 4 500 francs   16.982663558787184
said he raising himself on his elbow is it you comte de la fere   15.725177354165645
but when he learned that the unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who followed him he breathed again   3.5414139995664478
at the close of the act he therefore went to the baroness   9.677242185068478
i m afraid we are prisoners whispered d artagnan to his friend   11.27737875748791
exclaimed d artagnan bounding toward him who says that athos is afraid   14.923739930694943
chapter viii   13.703931366174738
asked athos   10.169639016243215
at length a fresh discharge was heard and this time the balls came rattling among the stones around the four friends and whistling sharply in their ears   14.32209014644791
i will tell you morrel said the count that i do not need entreating to spare the life of m   4.13177916542347
you have one second to decide said he   4.973091062436044
so that this strain of the knee continued d artagnan my dear porthos keeps you in bed   15.11780447909261
are you still actuated by the regret which drags the living to the pursuit of death   9.507241903887952
50189m oh   16.346753982722802
he resumed   8.66792828887059
franz added that his companion deeply grieved at having been prevented the honor of being presented to the countess during her sojourn in paris was most anxious to make up for it and had requested him franz to remedy the past misfortune by conducting him to her box and concluded by asking pardon for his presumption in having taken it upon himself to do so   7.100071181116513
here it is said aramis taking a small key from his breast and opening a little ebony box inlaid with mother of pearl here it is   14.014681089835932
he made a last effort to extend his hand but it fell powerless beside him   13.909723168443522
that is true said porthos echoing d artagnan s sigh   13.882356535197562
it is his voice   13.549221072541812
she has neither son money nor friends   14.417684212585332
yes   15.597947005637332
he proceeded towards the quay by the rue saint laurent and advanced to the consigne   14.75692992213487
and they went out together   11.670310279915302
asked athos   16.964227534504538
merciful heaven   11.680104131222334
the duke has had many affairs of gallantry   9.431348653721397
three or four shots were fired but with no other result than to show the four fugitives turning the corner of the street safe and sound   8.332997037343487
and executed in our presence   7.83672589423257
cromwell observed the young man a moment in silence then with that profound melancholy shakespeare describes so well mordaunt he said you are a terrible servant   15.675861551226092
then i must make a journey to see my family in the lower part of brittany to obtain the sum necessary for my departure   14.818493910286227
then caderousse feeling that he was leaving him raised himself on his elbow and with a dying voice cried with great effort murder   13.520956967103634
while you at least are sure of the credence of half your audience   5.518183245786567
then they departed without knowing whether they would ever see each other again   13.906942018395323
his name was carlini   9.575786440765413
the road is never very safe during fair time   13.743406694980514
his attention was engrossed with what was passing at the count s and his only aim appeared to be to discern every movement in the dressing room   22.0449870809989
enervated prostrate and breathless he became unconscious of outward objects   2.661530608206279
asked villefort   14.74777313180124
i know nothing about it myself   22.88049803098799
this will be added noirtier with a smile one means by which you may a second time save me if the political balance should some day take another turn and cast you aloft while hurling me down   11.185220595633432
the shot told   11.186308863026689
notwithstanding his youth master andrea was a very skilful and intelligent boy   5.346728507102209
well i am sure that in less than three days this balsam would cure you   8.447304784279352
at charenton in the second house on the right on entering from the direction of paris   17.11211722239802
my faith   11.86685982625105
but really no matter go on   15.2959984827606
yes sir and i think i have the honor of addressing count andrea cavalcanti   18.15360336569689
ha ha said château renaud here come some friends of yours viscount   12.074690702151866
at this moment the door of the guardhouse was opened and one of the soldiers was summoned away   15.006976059935166
franz approached the chief advancing several steps to meet him   11.070350988648267
i shall expect you returned morrel   6.532641189291484
because these horses are not to be sold was the reply   12.436798744753055
proud toward an old friend   14.962261950609218
take the diamond then and sell it   16.831723511414385
then said albert this pious pilgrimage in behalf of the prisoners was your first remembrance   12.222764603566967
that shows that the eastern nations have too much good sense to waste their time and attention on objects undeserving of either   19.301066452850538
by your brilliant and almost sublime conversation you have elevated me above the ordinary level   15.202162407892668
he sent one of his servants to m   11.869566731560766
well done planchet   15.296866168487252
i was saying it was very interesting   11.116328056806013
oh   12.52566630138048
do not let that disturb you i have enough for two   6.861170433751118
and my poor grimaud here was obliged to dress those you had inflicted on him   13.483376909072646
now look here i want something to eat   13.700232592359967
bonacieux he could obtain no intelligence of her   24.711744396511254
did he not conduct you to the ruins of the colosseum and suck your blood   15.319395963173838
i render a service i do not sell it   14.708361088338933
ma foi   12.442134487213062
no embellishments no embroidery no arabesques   9.80457501046309
it was five o clock in the afternoon   13.011797049214039
and drawing a poniard from beneath his robe he thrust it into the breast of the wounded man saying here is my absolution   14.846717245743264
shall i tell you what you ought to do morcerf   10.034339654610548
who then urged you to write   9.066435907096038
all three then sat down with their heads together and their ears on the alert   10.52727157757895
as dantès his eyes turned in the direction of the château d if uttered this prayer he saw off the farther point of the island of pomègue a small vessel with lateen sail skimming the sea like a gull in search of prey   8.262770052599066
said she   10.474499544012609
said caderousse stroking his arm all bruised by the fleshy pincers which had held it   2.159943018177543
in the middle of the lid he saw engraved on a silver plate which was still untarnished the arms of the spada family viz   9.848497100552299
i consult them when doubtful and if i ever do any good it is due to their beneficent counsels   8.53272840082331
the waking chapter 33   6.759712462160928
he advanced slowly toward milady who had seated herself and taking an end of the murderous rope which by neglect or perhaps by design she allowed to be seen what is this madame   9.319411833792694
that was a superb throw so i left off there   12.252095606434676
athos mounted more slowly after speaking in a low voice to the lackey who instead of following them immediately returned to their rooms   3.236234114953149
cocles had detected an overbalance of fourteen sous in his cash and the same evening he had brought them to m   11.748023644239966
now replied monte cristo there is only one source of uneasiness left in your father s mind which is this he is anxious to know how you have been employed during your long absence from him how you have been treated by your persecutors and if they have conducted themselves towards you with all the deference due to your rank   11.55065116179798
at last after traveling two days and a night they arrived at boulogne toward the evening favored by magnificent weather   12.066076383554506
come you are accounted for you are here but where are your friends   19.52221784446978
a night is soon passed   17.811922088006185
then the inconvenience became distress   18.716481979266472
murmured d artagnan   4.385886691692737
but the report did not prevent the new occupant establishing himself there with his modest furniture the same day at five o clock   15.949504376034469
ah indeed   9.756343911576552
where   11.332187220935474
but strange to say this portrait seemed to displease my father and the value of the picture which is as you see one of the best works of léopold robert could not overcome his dislike to it   16.36134155318652
felton no doubt felt within himself that his strength was abandoning him and he made several steps toward the door   16.755849814743947
then i felt that i was lost   4.102768868250351
the sight of such royal misery exasperated him and his eyes examined every new trace of poverty that presented itself   7.362627318286126
d artagnan cast a glance around him   12.339365122763548
it is not just that he should despise me so without any reason   23.183892873709706
the point of the sword had touched a rib and glanced along the bone   10.82165180721523
meanwhile let us dine suggested porthos   11.76284634708298
that reply led to several questions about the king s capture and athos gave details so precise and positive that if the gatekeepers had any suspicions they vanished completely   7.786382422931418
well what is the matter   10.851963059016306
and he concluded his speech with a deep sigh   10.793180197927406
s   12.446404239438486
well yes pretty well replied d artagnan   12.122114935223989
what do you mean by the pure parliament   11.940644045006902
when you please said d artagnan   12.408175942114221
in those times of disturbance he went about with numerous followers and often disguised himself   15.380175492201298
not with us sir replied dantès   6.471359904791894
this assurance determined the two friends to accept it   10.338289114877393
very good   13.18471555023402
look yonder   7.532986440099112
25th april 1498   10.493742505151172
the corridor through which you have bored your way from the cell you occupy here extends in the same direction as the outer gallery does it not   11.789319997032655
dantès told them that all hands might turn in and he would take the helm   10.620560185978121
five seconds afterwards he was at the door of the room   12.119375310891419
nearly a year   13.128213019969738
andrea made no resistance although he protested against it   15.853433591821986
after continuing some time in profound meditation the young man suddenly exclaimed i have found what you were in search of   12.564607099635872
i should be ashamed for anyone to know your baseness   12.222834488704251
and why among us four   18.05594608525721
he said as to your friend tell him he may sleep in peace   15.930427350057617
chapter xliii   18.49577521018501
we must never look for discretion in first love   8.711608409947626
fernand saw this and when he learned of the old man s death he returned   17.843180165350756
i hate you and on my word you shall pay for this   17.570355347782318
will we not pay for our liberty with a single promise of silence   11.23715035325155
noirtier s apartment   12.10820259539678
grimaud had made himself a kind of sentry box out of a hollow willow and as they drew near he put his head out and gave a low whistle   15.964230180682943
some insisted she was making for corsica others the island of elba   16.82725338871652
ah you are there said she at length turning towards fernand   3.245236769520652
then the duke said openly that his dog had been killed by a drug with which they meant to poison him   16.956748076773774
something better still mouston   15.294551877263892
i desire that a statement contained in it should be rectified   14.94917901079057
neither am i said porthos   12.130540039351624
cried the cardinal astonished   17.520796273757245
formerly his paper at any date was taken with confidence and was even in request   10.926980573736222
yes but it is too late said danglars i have honored their bills   12.885518556852315
panther skins from the cape spotted beautifully like those that appeared to dante   16.65831018640084
young people are such braggarts   13.707255320192605
oh good lord monsieur chevalier said she what are you doing   16.99885950447351
for this envious person is a real enemy   13.561900656503436
tis indeed they   9.405643800368633
you have done a little of everything in your life   1.4715108209592422
if he persists his eminence made a pause and resumed if he persists well then i shall hope for one of those events which change the destinies of states   9.518768473601376
beware of giving anyone the clue to your griefs   15.392616106654852
said aramis there are questions between them at this very moment   12.01788827946745
yes   14.184718364670072
come do you really think you have anything to say against me   14.308324454651903
two open   14.265490230579088
d artagnan was too grand to promise anything   11.343689050094053
what is it   7.683872519934281
who knows but that in order to please madame de villefort and my father he may not persecute me by every means in his power   12.994065881558429
a second look was exchanged between athos and aramis   9.410808940874606
but where shall we go   13.12338333894532
let him give in his letter   6.164484474855245
stop there   15.389217288530018
planchet d artagnan s valet supported his good fortune nobly   12.912914118743421
eleven o clock sounded   13.015810276085567
your philosophy convinces me on my honor   9.635145191827757
on the contrary i request it   15.197227718840065
luigi vampa   7.875093432815549
well then i will buy it of you   12.221115123675286
bonacieux who waited for him and who with the same precautions and the same good luck conducted him out of the louvre   9.133532397298524
ay but said aramis that young fellow is decidedly a spy   12.20045495553034
replied i allowing myself to fall and biting the carpet with rage   8.291936156411749
either they respect or they fear me which is more likely but they let me trample down the clover with my dogs insult and obstruct every one and i come back still more weary and low spirited that s all   11.757068807766485
as long as your brother was with me he kept me up   5.192839936716718
cried he   10.128419444641889
no   17.531219943665782
to be kept in strict solitary confinement and to be closely watched and guarded   19.950292087452343
but as if to contradict his statement at that instant a violent clap of thunder seemed to shake the house to its very foundation while a sudden gust of wind mingled with rain extinguished the lamp he held in his hand   2.2207467859700394
oh do not do that excellency   5.787713747735742
he is a little stiff and pompous in his manner and he is disfigured by his uniform   4.949332979749524
we have already wasted too much   17.598049818202885
it is the count s reply   4.4446269593977785
i know nothing about it but i have heard say that he s not only an astrologer but a magician   9.779171066414595
we shall not interfere with each other your object is a title   9.269885957560007

accustomed formerly to ride on horseback or in the carriage to the four corners of europe the monotonous walk around that armchair has killed him his blood has thickened   14.204819230787361
and when i have taught you mathematics physics history and the three or four modern languages with which i am acquainted you will know as much as i do myself   7.334719255874051
but shutters   6.787881033629195
well i shall see   9.712907922165595
yes sir returned julie   9.395947201242578
i have had some   17.14368743446074

unfortunately as he advanced his anger increased at every step   14.263705176078675
no mother capital 3 000 francs   13.761678411166614
so much the better so much the better said caderousse   21.01557856467329
but after the death of valentine there has been no doubt in my mind madame and not only in mine but in those of others   11.902744971731805
but said he whom d artagnan thus provoked it appears to me that this place is badly chosen and that we should be better behind the abbey st   18.45624623085979
inquired cromwell   6.925933122996223
he called them food for cannon which was precisely all they were good for   12.704894652992412
not at all said d artagnan   12.183482069714923
have you not let it go out of your hands   15.504575006238102
what is his name   10.91669598897168
it is intolerable always to be in a coat and boots   10.102431433850441
so much the better said athos   13.47622346976052
in a month you will find on the table at which we shall be then sitting good pistols and a delicious draught   8.309251962717001
and unless a man be endowed with that admirable instinct which causes louis xiii   14.099960660939542
laporte burst into tears   7.00263578062895
monte cristo uttered a cry which those only can conceive who have heard the roar of a wounded lion   12.273363402009416
as little sensitive as was the heart of d artagnan he was touched by this mute sorrow   12.999635838347885
he occupies the second floor when he works and descends to the first to take his meals   14.335331996206634
do you know what we are eating here   8.627623322296735
he pressed the count s hand and left   10.011531319101778
but this time again his hopes were disappointed and although he listened with all his ears he heard nothing amid the oaths coarse jokes and abuse which passed between the laborers servants and carters who comprised the honorable society of which he formed a part which could put him upon the least track of her who had been stolen from him   12.80450471039086
besides it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at paris that you should not see one anywhere else   9.602386654446596
i will not say without trouble for if i did i should tell a lie   14.412259915981862
still further in spite of sword thrusts which weaken and painful exercises which fatigue he had become one of the most gallant frequenters of revels one of the most insinuating lady s men one of the softest whisperers of interesting nothings of his day   19.669270296479585
then he began to kiss one after the other those dear studs with which he was about to part   18.348111825312145
the goldsmith cast a glance at the elegant manner in which they were set calculated one with another what the diamonds were worth and without hesitation said fifteen hundred pistoles each my lord   15.495564953111314
mercédès drew near and plucked the fruit   14.044789108614923
this event had hastened the resolutions of the cardinal   10.428146108404158
broussel was seated at the table with his family having his wife opposite to him his two daughters by his side and his son louvieres whom we have already seen when the accident happened to the councillor an accident from which he had quite recovered at the bottom of the table   12.02118514895861
albert s lips scarcely whispered good bye but his look was more explicit   10.331603468574075
i know it said château renaud   12.614123226618139
what is it to me who have passed twenty years between life and death   19.807748762242838
m   11.710271033292685
and i am sure that he came for quite another purpose monsieur cardinal   4.608439116030007
is it heaven that opens before me   11.741561259565868
rue de la fontaine   21.29653329960269
if victorious i shall continue the struggle   7.5412620780142
de tréville entered bringing a sealed packet   17.42544258133651
but the visit of porthos soon enlightened her   11.273053807261128
as to the soldier he only smiled   12.165403984618724
ah   9.575671244935872
and added he biting off with his large white teeth an enormous mouthful of bread i have formed a plan   12.482751677246208
as i told you it is an old family jewel   13.594905489483052
this very instant   5.3716947310346015
for myself i am content to say to you that i have studied chemistry and the natural sciences somewhat deeply but still only as an amateur you understand   16.551041927930253
he moved his bed drew up the stone rushed into the passage and reached the opposite extremity   10.641404662705913
you will know presently my friend   11.197492560855617
mr   19.05387462286503
there were large bottles filled with serpents ticketed according to their species   10.208775135199481
there is constancy   15.986879582461636
to call for monsieur le coadjuteur   11.29017771909099
i foresee in it the aid of powerful princes   13.34045452406124
oh yes very gloomy my friend   17.40002505343417
i should think so a horse that cost 5 000 francs   12.886775053861918
the two friends made an appointment for ten o clock on the following day   10.96718797667906
they sent him a magnificent supper and took his million   7.906898859780181
and i have been wrong in seeing in the mission with which you honor me anything but that which it really is that is to announce to his grace on the part of your eminence that you are acquainted with the different disguises by means of which he succeeded in approaching the queen during the fête given by madame the constable   16.418906414475774
did i not tell you i wished for one   18.16598635144941
d artagnan and porthos then found themselves in the centre of a large circle   16.58384976355599
i have but one promise and but one heart to give   11.114330123505752
cried athos are not those fellows poachers they have arrested yonder   11.641771913610311
we parted at hyères   13.730281038727185
it is my soul that must be saved   4.496369164382244
said he who appeared to be the leader of the party   16.00810606653054
you do not wish to hear it perhaps   9.266964098135357
said porthos   13.0934631318209
it was useless to search at night and dantès therefore delayed all investigation until the morning   16.117516022360142
he said very good muttered the major then sir replied he   14.935592543589703
important ones   17.690178101393155
12 rue des fossoyeurs   13.462460616677497
but i make war in my own way   10.691284834094457
my brother killed him   15.135718656899083
if you do not take great heed they will destroy you   16.28757696078793
yes replied franz here i am and he in his turn left the caves   11.041059510153115
you will speak first and tell him that i am gone on the lookout because certain expressions of our host have given me reason to think the road is not safe   10.25475814917176
leave the saucepan said dantès   10.496600365867733
no nothing at all   10.929071387986836
it only remains for me to know whether i also suit you   13.058493863092604
aramis blushed   5.9743168290513955
we will each take a thousand livres to be employed as seems good and we will leave a fund of a thousand livres under the guardianship of monsieur abbé here for extraordinary occasions or common wants   4.430095893557834
40272m and do you know said valentine what reason grandpapa gives for leaving this house   7.833437876527551
louise pressed with all the strength of her little hands on the top of the portmanteau   14.870445554118469
arrested at compiegne they have been carried to rueil   19.08768753200018
these words of felton s passed like ice through her veins   9.191425582556588
i have replied d artagnan pulling out his treasure from his pocket and placing it on the table   5.209193592550643
now let us lay down the plan of campaign said porthos   9.694968256697532
why said aramis one half were hanged and the other half were shot   14.168014919545822
the cardinal smiled   19.929456355425344
if i have been your friend morcerf your present manner of speaking would almost lead me to forget that i ever bore that title   8.418538029335672
then said d artagnan your eminence must expect the consequences of a refusal   11.827858566480877
i can not tell you   5.648058513295626
but would you ruin me   8.257755101675343
he tore his hair   17.075216078612634
the mendicant hesitated at first but at the sight of the piece of silver which shone in the darkness he consented and walked on before athos   8.496016621823411
there crouched against the side of the wall which attracts and retains the most heat they may be seen sometimes talking to one another but more frequently alone watching the door which sometimes opens to call forth one from the gloomy assemblage or to throw in another outcast from society   6.1898984686103455
adieu then sir and do not forget the prescription   11.776996655084861
my faith my dear aramis said d artagnan who detested verses almost as much as he did latin add to the merit of the difficulty that of the brevity and you are sure that your poem will at least have two merits   18.95081529161483
asked the musketeer   16.310256431276546
asked raoul in a soft and coaxing voice   13.924712599318763
d artagnan was on guard at the louvre   4.901139800717458
her mouth was small and rosy   15.764660011041505
i ask for mme   12.792374569559536
most people start at our website which has the main pg search facility www   18.805565413362352
the king turned quickly around with tears in his eyes and heart   11.602194362175933
so that since that time replied d artagnan totally unable to refrain from laughing at the pitiable face of the host   17.029533866570173
bertuccio   15.168180482449932
cried planchet as soon as he perceived his master here is more trouble   9.152560352714659
0123m but how can i sell out here   11.233444420073855
do not forget that i have been five years in the bastile and that no medium of viewing things is so deceptive as the grating of a prison   11.18055357127207
then count i admire you said villefort who for the first time in this strange conversation used the aristocratic form to the unknown personage whom until now he had only called monsieur   9.490036926597094
the baron was to sign first then the representative of m   3.897836068449232
although athos was scarcely thirty years old and was of great personal beauty and intelligence of mind no one knew whether he had ever had a mistress   12.7853151050444
at eight o clock all were in their places and m   15.720693037584544
valentine uttered a cry of horror   13.776096977791598
and one may draw fifty or sixty pistoles from this good man   21.266484165262796
you do not know him   3.219321921980944
i have already forbidden that man he said to come in here without my permission   14.837786963827371
quite contrite and repentant   11.850202015002527
the throng was terrific and it was not till after much pushing and some fighting that our friends reached their destination   12.3467759096869
it was a continual scratching as if made by a huge claw a powerful tooth or some iron instrument attacking the stones   9.374766343669595
as an italian he is superstitious   9.453383867517342
come monsieur he said you are good in council as we have already discovered   15.511547431571152
he approached her and said in a low voice has your majesty still confidence in me   20.412743767596634
he was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber but grated and barred and its appearance therefore did not greatly alarm him   9.773899265028314
said athos   12.5237480492638
cromwell s letter   14.099916581330517
d artagnan in order that there might be no time lost had saddled his horse himself   14.59483863851932
he remarked however in the course of conversation that the lieutenant of musketeers spoke with a gascon accent   11.882115591062739
six arabs came up full gallop to cut off my head   15.385802795262567
and as i had known since morning the reason of my abduction with the help of the sheets i let myself down from the window   14.316705269032518
we have supplicated heaven in vain to grant us this favor but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we can not comprehend we have been guided by an invisible hand a hand as powerful as that of an enchanter   10.619825367583319
yes   10.67222396213251
the room of the retired baker chapter 82   9.275962004270603
the chancellor sequier who twenty years previously had persecuted her so ruthlessly stood before her relating how his carriage had been smashed how he had been pursued and had rushed into the hotel d o that the hotel was immediately invaded pillaged and devastated   8.675313889549967
you have despoiled me of my fortune   8.733154637402368
you owe me no thanks   16.005365224490156
the duc d angoulême on the east from dompierre to perigny   13.888121987777717
and it is now too late for in a year the king will be of age   10.917485600296992
earth has become distasteful to me and human voices distract me   10.424593468177305
we are going then we two with our swords you with daggers   15.325986859636027
that we may be more at our ease la ramee removes the guards keeping only grimaud to wait on us   7.402198597075378
i swear it by our god   11.320975204789299
afar off he saw the wild goats bounding from crag to crag   8.789034187894249
then let us draw on the spot   4.676674481810404
the cornices were gilt the mouldings were gilt the legs and arms of the chairs were gilt   7.5868540288503485
and who is to pursue him   15.956322160828307
i will see the queen   15.997446557951072
oh   8.822753183325627
athos had desired blaisois to try to speak to aramis himself   6.057454070901122
you will not interfere in anything   10.571219474954587
he found the five horses saddled his own amongst the rest   13.813711771441834
i must beg your eminence to observe said milady that since the affair of the diamond studs about which the duke always suspected me his grace distrusts me   11.286235347109258
i have only kept this secret so long from you continued faria that i might test your character and then surprise you   10.81472300566806
but this proved useless for though he knocked ten or twelve times in succession no one answered and some of the neighbors who put their noses out of their windows or were brought to their doors by the noise had assured him that that house all the openings of which were tightly closed had not been inhabited for six months   11.895743819340845
i shall look like some retired baker   6.734177884162291
what is this rent   7.7194441434774
but give us your word that you will come too d artagnan said athos   16.479529426132245
but said aramis if they dare to condemn their king it can only be to exile or imprisonment   2.7296741335652435
and yet notwithstanding this want of respect he felt an uncontrollable passion for this woman boiling in his veins passion drunk with contempt   13.934930507773354
yes was the reply in a low voice   14.380902821736749
asked the gascon   12.877907755137194
undeceive yourself comrade you are not monsieur de tréville   11.121172443358038
anxiously inquired albert   13.359371100318393
want of fortune perhaps   11.970603427368896
they proceeded then on their course   9.115408654251969
then my lord does not know that there are eight guards about him four in his chamber four in the antechamber and that they never leave him   13.228814521083468
and it so happened albert was not mistaken in his opinion   14.844650123403875
morrel here is the pharaon without a captain   9.536070115505554
a carriage waits your orders and ali and myrtho will accompany you whithersoever you desire to go   10.543513995237104
nothing   8.020814272872157
at length athos after serious reflection and becoming more pale than usual made a sign of assent to d artagnan who by it understood he was at liberty to speak   12.804620202927026
there   17.085404873991916
said anne of austria   15.30238854718885
i have not handled a card or dice box   11.73712196440328
according to the laws of dueling at that period d artagnan was at liberty to assist whom he pleased   4.972495789651686
yes sir a fearful misfortune   10.36778227846597
were you then permitted the use of pens ink and paper   14.078686036126753
with these words the young man went out and descended the stairs with sufficient calmness to pass unobserved   6.617582932997136
if my lord suspects they have been stolen perhaps the person who stole them still has them in his hands   17.681048316877494
raoul looked surprised and his eyes met those of the young lady who smiled   8.67615027442032
come that is something   20.09235046762319
i will do my best to obey you madame said the youthful king but i have no inclination to sleep   15.213316142624688
villefort becoming somewhat reassured perceived that to avert the maternal storm gathering over his head he must inspire madame danglars with the terror he felt   15.32732615854229
between these sickly shrubs grew a scanty supply of garlic tomatoes and eschalots   12.812472293822927
i know it perfectly although i am astonished that you know it   6.702166914859878
the affair was not long i assure you   10.7732521433227
you are really suffering and these ladies will excuse you   5.751270852917992
besides we are sent here by cardinal mazarin and at this moment represent both the king and the cardinal and are therefore as ambassadors able to act with impunity a thing that general oliver cromwell who is assuredly as great a politician as he is a general is quite the man to understand   11.646905637411875
as complete as that of the bridge of ce   12.97928374612436
as for monte cristo his head was bent down his arms were powerless   13.81184506010072
well i must allow as you say your father was a very intelligent fellow   5.706608868835581
he wishes also to have faith in his queen   12.657554690105954
save me   8.41607921532289
his host here was a good fellow from picardy who gave him all the information he needed   12.48821302382902
never had flora the fresh and smiling goddess of gardeners been honored with a purer or more scrupulous worship than that which was paid to her in this little enclosure   6.244917829019206
i call on you where are you   6.042878144835485
then with that money he speculated in the funds and trebled or quadrupled his capital   13.185677128052022
they get their information on war from warriors   8.088985632165706
said andrea we must overtake him soon   5.059238290877615
madame danglars who although past the first bloom of youth was still strikingly handsome was now seated at the piano a most elaborate piece of cabinet and inlaid work while lucien debray standing before a small work table was turning over the pages of an album   3.464094581248876
meanwhile his misgivings in regard to mousqueton recurred to his mind and with greater force because mousqueton though he did not himself wait on the table which would have been beneath him in his new position appeared at the door from time to time and evinced his gratitude to d artagnan by the quality of the wine he directed to be served   15.989572279543516
he will perhaps hold me in greater esteem than the money itself seeing that i sacrifice everything in order to keep my word with him   6.06917005135383
was carelessly listening to a man of fifty or fifty two years of age with gray hair aristocratic bearing and exceedingly gentlemanly attire and meanwhile making a marginal note in a volume of gryphius s rather inaccurate but much sought after edition of horace a work which was much indebted to the sagacious observations of the philosophical monarch   4.77318611747965
fine vengeance that on my faith   10.200714200953795

pardon my eagerness for my life depends on your answer   8.211272246842206
d artagnan who never turned his head did not perceive it   14.343477332763007
all crossed themselves   11.992621805333854
le blanc was not a fast animal but he kept up an easy steady pace   11.072709416101375
cried caderousse   13.823804482849338
he then walked slowly towards the allées de meilhan to seek out a small house with which our readers were made familiar at the beginning of this story   12.110055824032786
i think he is a delightful fellow who does the honors of his table admirably   10.173224491969169
if the second copy is also defective you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem   17.43290916839185

you say she is only a slave   14.132481027633979
the three windows were still untenanted   12.920048232322527
the fit lasted two hours   8.059028211427835
poor edmond he was cruelly deceived   6.755111698129748
you will bring the priest with you and will oblige me by introducing him into my child s room   15.480181953507385

said porthos sobbing i believe i m crying   19.557305557751747
it was as we have said the 1st of march and the prisoner was soon buried in darkness   16.279082647052594
hark said she we have been overheard   14.697575408433224
the brief space had however been sufficient for a man followed by a number of servants to rush from the house before which the accident had occurred and as the coachman opened the door of the carriage to take from it a lady who was convulsively grasping the cushions with one hand while with the other she pressed to her bosom the young boy who had lost consciousness   13.124628051340782
we redouble our precautions   16.595144581484423
we have no time now for suspicions said athos   12.21411534535524
noirtier and returned to the sick man   14.085304556842207
the last spy that was taken was the bearer of a letter   16.984476876538224
he knows how as you must have observed to obey an order for you did not i am sure come from portsmouth hither without endeavoring to make him speak   9.0073406523393
leave off i command you   10.753257792780385
but his father a sun pluribus impar left his personal splendor to each of his favorites his individual value to each of his courtiers   12.328012573121393
five hundred paces   15.477518004383402
but we are not superstitious   10.855246448293439
d artagnan went toward a very small low window just large enough to let a man through   18.561655897891857
the third of my friends although my rival was much attached to me his name was fernand   5.3131169157616025
good heavens   6.034093169862017
you confess it   14.924841250858554
and you porthos   11.549809288801484
he had therefore set off at a furious rate from the rue meslay and was hastening with rapid strides in the direction of the faubourg saint honoré   11.875475028316083
ah   10.23547740412837
replied athos   8.64955215493821
i do not know that   5.5871843719365275
were her fears realized   8.249676943569856
upon my soul i am ready to die for your majesty   21.408160914174722
it was easy to do so and as i had my boat and a lading to take in at sea everything favored my project   4.820448665324158

to be sure yes   10.687906839096833
i feel myself drawn toward you i who have never loved anyone but my benefactor i who have met with nothing but traitors and impious men   12.346721774614982
it was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since the house was built so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt   6.803149932697616
it is important that he should receive it before eleven o clock   10.772548545846183
well said he was i mistaken   15.996666642660522
petersburg calm countries where the point of honor is better understood than among our hot headed parisians   15.309195601492844
the second that we still have some very important things to say   6.75574897394949
so serious that i must take leave of you for a few days   14.332010227992674
they used the same precautions in leaving as in entering the house   10.158278569495604
at the appointed hour i shall be ready   10.257362941851767
ah gentlemen you want battle   5.6257699371557734
whether porthos understood him or did not understand him giving way to his anger monsieur said he you stand a chance of getting chastised if you rub musketeers in this fashion   10.991598979365712
cried the duke spurring on his horse and rushing upon him with his drawn sword   15.335421285970448
danglars however while possessing a great admiration for the antique as it was understood during the time of the directory entertained the most sovereign contempt for the simple elegance of his wife s favorite sitting room where by the way he was never permitted to intrude unless indeed he excused his own appearance by ushering in some more agreeable visitor than himself   11.16250195822483
athos availed himself of the permission ascended the stairs with his lightest step gained the landing and through the open door perceived milady putting on her hat   8.906125384005124
d artagnan returned   9.129878583252848
benedetto   15.640647292841528
am i indeed so happy   15.233371554866679
it is true the letter of the cardinal spada was singularly circumstantial and dantès repeated it to himself from one end to the other for he had not forgotten a word   17.080784821069123
i have already told you it was impossible   15.385694484353433
yes monsieur it is here he lives the servant replied to planchet who was not in livery   3.7659883636544063
said the young girl   13.513569416071158
yes   15.132810821381858
and if you come another fathom nearer i ll stave your wicked head in with this oar   13.276179397859519
replied d artagnan   7.9173028325298755
said my mother   13.5216126707589
fifty thousand francs   10.102789760894835
as they had long been acquainted with the king they were not much excited   7.241779755745048
the duke left the royal presence with the speed of a young man   14.05079854786182
his friends   18.219555203285903
you have life before you my dear albert for you are yet scarcely twenty two years old   14.1550910825345
there you will find hay and straw for them   5.071031667060879
the king don carlos has not left bourges and the peninsula is in the enjoyment of profound peace   15.447097583711296
eh it was that that did the business   10.336221437100583
besides what did i ask of you   14.216377926055305
said the young woman clasping her hands and weeping herself at the queen s sorrows   8.082682159929028
i will put another case to you continued the count   9.229561630501536
i am acquainted with it   13.408117524716493
did you see poor barrois die   7.790304784332516
a little said mazarin trembling lest anne should ask to draw upon his purse   9.216191744358166
my faith said d artagnan   4.6458822181050365
since i have the good fortune to meet you i beg you to receive them and to hold me always as one of your friends   6.930289612956189
cried porthos this butcher of unarmed farmers   14.02851740980743
no indeed replied madame de villefort   15.19362381421364
i promise my lord replied mordaunt   11.803041689566786
is it possible to insult you madame   15.179436460198872
i shall have something of the greatest importance to communicate to you   9.56811692366592
therefore i only purchased two said aramis   14.065733519440426
now if i die say to d artagnan that i love him as a son and embrace him for me   7.514574895690281
not in the least   20.318036757008983
porthos   9.28918535715893
he spent fourteen years to arrive at that muttered the count   9.7195287091432
yes they are wrong said d artagnan   5.4833868981295
you must set out for boulogne   11.041329233458915
hallo fernand   12.905886486355701
i know how happy my master always is to receive the vicomte said baptistin   12.013405659915277
during the recital mazarin entered and glided noiselessly up to the queen to listen   14.312580634351146
i do not know only he has followed your grace from the palais royal stopped at the louvre to wait for you and now leaves the louvre with you   11.741535369082557
come now recall the four cardinals that at the head of armies have equalled monsieur de guebriant and monsieur de gassion   2.9567679116502052
we must relieve each other in mounting guard over my lord and each of us must watch three hours at a time   9.62652993172738
for a long time a gun had been the young man s greatest ambition   15.760676001749033
his energetic spirit that would have exalted in thus revisiting the past was imprisoned like an eagle in a cage   6.8217962008569675
the moment of your deliverance is at hand   16.6652597930646
a little troop of men on horseback were waiting on the edge of the stream ready to embark   9.479279509431274
i have almost killed myself by my needless haste   14.721541146186954
the young and high spirited officer required all his strength of mind to resist breaking his oath   14.215548826160308
as he was about to pass the wind blew out porthos s long cloak and d artagnan rushed straight into the middle of it   10.099984444112113
he has besides a son a lieutenant in the army   15.235936706809966
the two musketeers were already there and were playing together   11.106946522466172
mercy   10.197440477304646
examine the past and the present and endeavor to dive into futurity and then say whether i am not a divine instrument   14.826058678955679
the windows in the palazzo rospoli alone decided me   8.394058946565046
well if you should be restored to favor don t forget me   9.873180512489414
and you say he is dressed as a monk grimaud   14.019639986199847
you appear to think much of your horse   12.906642077118343
be calm exclaimed athos for heaven s sake   10.215897875879882
i believe that the spirit of god led my steps to thee and that he also enables me to quit thee in triumph   13.093777044772882
of course i have   13.221282589859133
said she   16.409389119427082
precisely said the count   10.963036538082033
cried grimaud and i will remain beside him here   12.97945089288462
yes but in exchange said porthos covered with perspiration and soiled by dust in exchange i have torn many skins   11.42387903588008
i am commissioned to find out my companions and i began by you who were the very soul of our society   14.089316090008172
halloo major   13.267636676910591
and you reply i do not know   9.93664480007091
then the effort having exhausted her strength she fell not asleep this time but fainting on the floor   3.9752567017192675
what have you done   10.607034292896667
yes and up to this point i know all said the priest   14.753771187762482
with a full heart and burning head he desired olivain to lead on the horses to a wayside inn which he observed within gunshot range a little in advance of the place they had reached   17.494755869313334
it is over aramis had said   14.360909860046302
why it seems to me replied morrel that in delivering m   16.9509842067463
i could not tell you before others said he in a low tone the reason of my parting with the horses   16.633219465466805
i am going on a mission   18.66843040031504
it is because i confide in that justice that i shall wait patiently and quietly the good pleasure of your majesty   11.703204680616405
let us decamp first and you will understand afterward   13.10281313775559
guard her   14.992682526063248
ah added the turnkey there was no occasion for watching him   15.08785951786361
i have but little influence now but all that i have shall most assuredly be his   15.491192831350087
athos understood all now   14.51250238049451
this evening   15.53458800008157
and since your return to england   10.334205708525705
ah   10.219109851110227
i am sure of it   14.678825322025842
yes madame chatillon stammered out   8.885052163932642
the true difficulty of being admitted was not to be found at the first door and even the second was passed easily enough   11.779104340567839
do not hurry yourself monsieur lest it be observed that we go out together   10.242241006987147
how fortunate that eugénie is possessed of that strange character which has so often made me tremble   17.18103325568067
said monte cristo in the tone which a father would use towards a son   10.074124973567457
i have just had the pleasure replied the count   14.212721357710109
said the young man looking fearfully around him   14.798283097005612
mazarin endeavored to circulate among the people a report that troops had only been stationed on the quays and on the pont neuf on account of the ceremonial of the day and that they would soon withdraw   19.3837122003001
and with his eyes fixed upon the glass which athos held in his hand he ground the paper well between his teeth and then swallowed it   12.0486084084261
tell your coachman to stop at the door   13.390655803670953
meanwhile ali had procured the arms the count required namely a short carbine and a pair of double barrelled pistols with which as sure an aim might be taken as with a single barrelled one   7.480132408954465
ah yes he said as if awaking from a dream   12.943424728290049
for i doubt whether her pride will ever allow her to return to france   11.023832478186812
see what an exordium   14.108272573016762
but do not fear it   5.9877878966881575
do not charge a fee for access to viewing displaying performing copying or distributing any project gutenberg™ works unless you comply with paragraph 1   8.744870187694913
what s the knot for   19.514780703103593
but what were you to do with that woman   14.44030644070482
it looks more like bankruptcy   14.960297452283278
there could not possibly be any other difference between them   9.187014392579526
you suppose then that there are some   6.442267964140429
is that what you wish for   17.158349750047382
you may now retire   9.11739085467819
ah my dear count said albert   10.194762645835391
well you can throw out the draft   4.072031862221475
de tréville that s all very well   17.940163117575977
my good friend i can only repeat the words addressed to you by the abbé busoni   9.222349067207897
if i did not fear to fatigue you said the general evidently charmed with the count s manners i would have taken you to the chamber   4.71867085090542
his disposition always inclined to exact concessions rather than to make them kept him aloof from all friendships   8.583915313334069
ah you have seen aramis   13.751889930506774
this precipitation this unusual appointment   11.691531486007856
asked franz of the count   21.322109286069235
do you fancy because you have heard monsieur de tréville speak to us a little cavalierly today that other people are to treat us as he speaks to us   15.33806350860909
so that in spite of edicts ordinances and decrees there he is captain of the musketeers   7.533240869567411
cried athos   18.463909242149963
the prince was said to be in person at bethune   12.056663035862671
the king s closet at the tuileries we will leave villefort on the road to paris travelling thanks to trebled fees with all speed and passing through two or three apartments enter at the tuileries the little room with the arched window so well known as having been the favorite closet of napoleon and louis xviii   17.32783516832935
of the two persons who composed this group one was a man and the other a woman   17.842412562843087
at the barrière du trône they met bertuccio who was waiting there motionless as a sentinel at his post   13.028375931972809
at half past ten an hour after the event   14.807909754919223
and yet here are two culprits   7.740908837250494
and that cavalier that guest that nobleman who arrived before she came   15.318911544222685
and porthos heaved another sigh   13.722413327194191
he is old covered with wounds and suffers dreadfully he says in travelling   12.77262043422115
to come back and besiege rueil   11.294129681586922
england needs tranquillity at home in order to consummate the expulsion of her king   14.866559415777619
said she   14.743434404868367
old enough to be ambitious but too young to be corrupt   6.912389868187719
and though i have been through twelve pitched battles and i can not count how many charges and skirmishes i own for the third time in my life i was afraid   16.019714041402622
ali bowed and left the room   10.801693021580672
i mean spinach replied aramis   12.717632994670842
a large stone had served as a wedge   9.732056831265858
she is at the piano with m   8.159627344464162
i know not where i have left my hat and in all probability i should have been left with my hat had the coadjutor not arrived in time to rescue me   6.539869696891322
are you mad to talk to me thus   11.69980379219485
absolutely   3.8986144636491566
at that moment d avrigny s glance met noirtier s eye   13.306418201272363
as to athos he remained unmoved   5.915248006655033
madame de longueville was one of the highest ladies in the realm   11.377142751773727
this force was therefore wholly insufficient and from time to time the line was broken through by the people and was formed again with difficulty   12.5387449924393
repeated the president   15.612197672947874
sure enough   11.886886705974854
no no cried maximilian quite unable to restrain his feelings   10.617262144757277
danglars made no reply   17.91524441660728
there was but one tavern the post   9.54565599448194
it was then observable that the substance was greenish   17.435019772107736
i rose and again began digging and enlarging the hole   14.925468505105684
bonacieux had the sweetest smile in the world   1.5069351251721663
whenever your majesty pleases   18.625752293095566
this is capital   9.178449050926316
oh good lord   18.134937995493452
an assassination they will unhesitatingly commit but an act of cowardice never   12.622966442084577
if he detested her it would be all the better replied athos   8.041695741815243
and you will seek in vain to evade it   9.347586802602816
ah you will tell all i have said will you not reverend sir   12.726399623004626
your mother can be of no use to you in this world henrietta said the lady turning around   13.449402258930048
the three companions advanced rather humbly for all were now convinced that they had to do with someone more powerful than themselves leaving athos the post of speaker   9.64338054084543
having escaped these dangers they returned by the main road to boulogne at abbeville and followed it step by step examining every track   9.34990547449237
the conviction that they came from m   5.842446657965612
perhaps there are four said d artagnan   12.362673379029024
said porthos let us hear what he says   13.84167269953069
athos therefore commanded bazin to fasten up his horse and that of aramis in the same manner   15.826639193823162
with all his millions he will not have enough to pay for his shroud   9.998997531630495
well then sleep in peace and put your trust in the lord   21.45606744294471
inquired the owner   11.121035834412709
demanded d artagnan   8.404437214091935
bonacieux into the little apartment of which we have given a description   4.666762080941188
you give away horses worth a thousand louis   10.669507141201999
yes by a blow of your fist if you can   12.917075149222912
you say so with an accent stay you shall be convinced   15.586555109910588
m   10.016098760732088
yes sir you shall see them   10.727054574332291
this beam crossed or rather blocked up the hole dantès had made   16.36785859141458
and if tomorrow your curiosity still continues as great pursue your researches if you will   13.51554234341056
yet perchance tomorrow deception will so act on me that i shall on compulsion consider such a contemptible possession as the utmost happiness   10.372626918469733
i asked after you and came up as soon as i could   12.036264647231842
nogent beautin the fool of the court exclaimed that the queen was very happy to have the succor of religion at such a moment   12.404503221545362
you heard cavalcanti   12.756064608745987
oh yes said she smiling but we won t tell him   7.7967321066556865
d artagnan related to athos all that had passed at the church between porthos and the procurator s wife and how their comrade was probably by that time in a fair way to be equipped   12.449218300506342
she bent forwards as though to assure herself of the reality of what she saw then uttering a faint cry threw herself back in her seat   22.454092665097853
stop i want to remember his exact words   12.428960784270624
villefort immediately rose from table and quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business   12.785923856768697
adieu dear sister till your next swoon   7.032015302577563
sir you are tempting me   12.373752133989406
michael   9.589291770890089
exclaimed d artagnan this proves to me that not till to day has your majesty had a just idea of us   8.844845403218308
you will guard him well for me   11.127731123998029
dantès whirled the stool round his head   10.783770676332
but i have sworn to kill that man   7.3772889864497095
the hostess as she entered saw d artagnan and uttered a little cry whereupon d artagnan judging that he had been recognized rose ran to her and embraced her tenderly   15.131940819795759
if they do not bring life we will give them death   10.655939676097478
upon my word you would make caesar afraid   14.18959801995604
he walked straight into the midst of the guards who on seeing him were silent   15.034480573477534
what have you done with that gentleman against whom you had the audacity about twelve days ago to make an accusation of passing false money   12.787998106012374
the tower of st   9.208226772030445
as for patience you have abundantly proved yours you shall now see me prove mine   13.19610354917681
but the honest servant could say no more so much was he overcome by this unexpected interview   12.941678067623508
come quick quick   11.712915208784334
impudent fellow   8.997580912838174
i thought i saw said one of the servants horsemen dressed in yellow creeping along the bed of the stream   7.46312343322777
it was from caderousse that i intended demanding shelter and as we never entered by the door that opened onto the road i resolved not to break through the rule so climbing over the garden hedge i crept amongst the olive and wild fig trees and fearing that caderousse might have some guest i entered a kind of shed in which i had often passed the night and which was only separated from the inn by a partition in which holes had been made in order to enable us to watch an opportunity of announcing our presence   9.752346173640838
de tréville alone remaining with the wounded   6.583661104232636
of course not   11.648893734997035
zounds   10.694287133062215
mordaunt   15.394519835002683
the people were in an excited mood but like a swarm of frightened bees seemed not to know at what point to concentrate   8.95542768673503
and this time it must be confessed that contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on albert s side   13.275823764445963
but at least tell me where he is that i may know whether he is alive or dead said she   12.009541932779337
go on go on   8.574649417493266
how misfortune humbles a man   8.074128337764954
ideas were but the germ the plan was reality   14.550978401551635
be sure i shall not fail to do so returned the count bowing   4.769697050769883
chapter xxxviii   16.419138975745213
come in exclaimed d artagnan   13.948166518039208
if they knew anything they would not question people in this manner said d artagnan to himself   9.013640375822867
the tutor cried halt   12.498311603707249
but you are sure you will promise me this   12.077875577812202
hush   15.755863114583432
yes i understand that   16.52136983199068
there grief might freely expend itself without being disturbed by the trifling loungers who came from a picnic party to visit père lachaise or by lovers who make it their rendezvous   11.632784330870965
my brother   19.371286087593024
she looked around for help and would have gone down to her grandfather s room but on the stairs she met m   13.295184679772905
and we must trust to the vigilance of m   14.48575099951404
he then closed his eyes as children do in order that they may see in the resplendent night of their own imagination more stars than are visible in the firmament   13.467016351784293
but i must not forget one grand point   12.823557694732175
she cried   18.001699409394213
and at the very moment when the wheels of that coach crossed the gateway a report was heard and a thick smoke escaped through one of the panes of the window which was broken by the explosion   11.474797664165433
muttered albert   18.453701006620467
indeed almost before the door opened the scene changed   11.800107457580225
he had turned round to play with milady s favorite monkey which had pulled him by the doublet   14.458794971656552
three days afterwards this poor vulture which has been very much indisposed since that dinner suddenly feels very giddy while flying aloft in the clouds and falls heavily into a fish pond   12.729694452317254
yes yes continued morrel   7.077269519862103
i never lie madame   10.477045425313037
every folly you committed would embroil you with the court and they would put you into the bastile instead of vincennes   11.526850533303296
and by the lifting of a finger all these were busied in my service   8.648044656290912
if my vote and interest can obtain it for him i will readily give him the one and promise the other   11.997059749965624
when he came home he formed his handkerchief into a loop   8.860317469803412
your name is popular and does honor to the title they have adorned it with   11.684566670157821
d artagnan shuddered at the noise of the keys   12.449548308972366
said he rising you come in the nick of time gentlemen   16.925956720811573
the weather was dull and stormy a cold wind shook the few remaining yellow leaves from the boughs of the trees and scattered them among the crowd which filled the boulevards   15.5896158753632
but as soon as i let go he will howl again   16.8887335299586
you are discreet so much the better   12.52415138846308
asked the young woman with a coquettish smile whose somewhat bantering character resumed its influence and with whom all fear had disappeared from the moment in which she recognized a friend in one she had taken for an enemy   5.915084004084213
why you know it is quite impossible to procure a carriage   12.66010108256812
chapter 29   14.720019242644987
do   7.749914537353326
on hearing those two names the queen uttered a cry of joy which the two gentlemen heard   10.050635755827752
we hear from yanina if valentine could have seen the trembling step and agitated countenance of franz when he quitted the chamber of m   7.122156127271289
it is but natural   14.404156809969354
at this moment the garden was only occupied by about ten servants who had just received orders from their mistress to prepare the supper the serenity of the weather continuing to increase   7.185328264069727
moreover do not alarm yourself morrel   21.705661989259475
it was easy to call his jailer s attention to the noise and watch his countenance as he listened   17.13979175880553
the young man overwhelmed by the weight of his anguish fell heavily on his knees before the bed which his fingers grasped with convulsive energy   3.6773923891759637
the pope and cæsar borgia first found the two future cardinals   17.249285982856374
said athos   6.539704751070167
at the sound of the gold aramis raised his eyes and porthos started   13.53072029884077
chapter xxxiii   13.08721547949235
oh yes indeed madame continued monte cristo the secret dramas of the east begin with a love philtre and end with a death potion begin with paradise and end with hell   8.156323744700206
but perhaps you have been wrong   8.582937143262317
is supper ready signor pastrini   7.258105817529563
i took the trouble this morning to call on the pretended count if he were a real count he wouldn t be so rich   18.184558091803034
stop   10.1411359901493
he is certain to reach the other   13.78519362454632
the quick eye of albert caught the involuntary start with which his friend beheld the new arrival and turning to him he said hastily do you know the woman who has just entered that box   13.834758886501225
and i tell you sir that you are mistaken   9.101323979115271
the dish of beans had disappeared   18.971049415532498
madame these are my orders   13.917232159687488
d artagnan then cast an anxious and rapid glance over the field of battle   17.229171397974497
but she would not spare him a single pang   7.734173001631428
they will not dare to refuse me then   15.843020867543858
conspiracy chapter 5   13.460072885055506
ah very well very well said the major clutching the buttons of his coat at each exclamation   19.047697511728092
there was so much serenity coolness mildness even in the voice of the young man that milady felt reassured   10.809027636471303
for a man is above that sort of thing   15.936809515039725
monte cristo bowed and went to madame de villefort   8.71775909589352
they were rapidly leaving the château d if behind   11.299492176328819
sir my right hand correspondent redoubles his signals   6.721045108205838
yes said harrison laughing and looking over at one of the officers seated at his table   16.397021694160934
hurry hurry   14.016259362562026
yet man will never be perfect until he learns to create and destroy   17.61000698595223
and now to table said athos   13.417895414459934
that is why i have uttered the words for which you blame me   12.777359842963556
d artagnan said athos with a maniacal burst of laughter guess what she had on her shoulder   6.942229876112116

and as there was no species of violence or pillage it did not commit the poor people on the frontier quitted their isolated dwellings and fled for refuge into the strong cities which held out a shelter to them   9.318094547321598
the dull driver smoking his pipe was plodding along toward the limits of the faubourg saint denis where no doubt he ordinarily had his station   8.50901153766322
he rushed headlong to the street and like the greek from marathon who fell in the square at athens with his laurel in his hand friquet reached councillor broussel s threshold and then fell exhausted scattering on the floor the louis disgorged by his leather bag   9.00770979722773
come in come in said morrel for i presume you are all at the door   17.68329204485784
de la trémouille in whose service he had a relative d artagnan was ignorant of the seriousness of the last wound his adversary had received and pressing him warmly without doubt would soon have completed his work with a third blow when the noise which arose from the street being heard in the tennis court two of the friends of the guardsman who had seen him go out after exchanging some words with d artagnan rushed sword in hand from the court and fell upon the conqueror   16.257305655287688
he did not even give himself the trouble to dissemble and displayed it with affectation before the queen   12.270334336665341
i feel extremely grateful for this mark of friendship   7.203090148905692
inquired dantès   7.104080353274718
why the music you have been listening to   11.257887299345777
i also looked at him   8.523888926466494
as you pass the lodge wake the porter and send him for a surgeon   7.884511922801959
the carriage drove round and stopped at the steps followed by the horsemen   9.531688088025371
we are carrying too much canvas   20.85936250294066
the maréchale d ancre was no more than the maréchale d ancre   16.977303878679052
do not fly then   14.983611477696384
valentine and morrel were exchanging their adieux in the presence of noirtier when a ring was heard at the door bell   9.479996459171764
if he did not return by ten o clock she was to sail   13.088890774770574
the island was familiar to the crew of la jeune amélie it was one of her regular haunts   16.619777530142617
no doubt   9.528951734573024
a little nervous perhaps but upon the whole he appeared tolerable   8.209050569312856
and then some son in law or relation some prince of orange a stadtholder who becomes a king   12.739024675161756
no   11.852678385424243
you understand it signifies nothing to me so long as you pay for your lessons out of your own cash box   12.621660063751257
so saying he stretched out his hand but the other pretended not to see it and he let it drop again slowly by his side   19.459308120988954
de villefort attracted by the noise appeared on the threshold   13.327434683502963
alas   18.208990558718767
milady wished to please the abbess   9.783529780558881
tis a long time since i saw thee   16.787123822965086
it was the sword of the comte de wardes which made that hole when he gave me a good thrust in the breast   14.021857322169982
all that was visible within the bronze gates was a gloomy looking room separated by a wall from the vault itself   14.541934233144996
asked the man in the cloak   16.016869130202373
and i am ready to offer you all i possess on loan   14.029609437613452
my faith said athos i have nothing to say against a retreat   5.156375802693446
nevertheless at that voice that accent and those gestures they felt a chill access of terror cramp their veins   14.00770231172863
he said raising his fine eyes to d artagnan moist with tears the count has left paris without seeing me   20.42681093678966
the priest having all confidence in his guest who besides was a nobleman had left to him his house his supper and his chamber   13.23555687144597
in five minutes it will be too late   13.763423186980349
the queen who was scarcely less afraid of monsieur de beaufort than the cardinal himself and who was almost as superstitious as he was made him repeat word for word all la ramee s praises of his deputy   11.130074845543318
but the duel will not take place edmond since you forgive   15.78577394602645
ah yes   16.916946403159727
although it was impossible that valentine should see him hidden as he was he thought he heard the shadow at the window call him   11.381114799050335
my love my blood my life   11.943464333758465
no   5.36346213392081
what are your commands lieutenant   17.800738600967083

i will answer that question as well as the rest mr   13.07061106493901
then placing herself in the full light of the lamp which lit the yard gate   17.976678952979007
and bowing to all the astonished persons present the young men took the road to the bastion st   8.859282739672656
the look which m   14.748286865247067

13 paris   10.711808875497752
and who said albert with a forced smile is to marry mademoiselle danglars instead of me which grieves me cruelly   16.055125865435617
what do you say   12.726339596810671
we very nearly succeeded in saving it   15.399193710750808
bertuccio   13.288748452768637
four men surrounded him besides the postilion   11.396538170486044

monseigneur said athos haughtily we are gentlemen and to save our heads we would not be guilty of a falsehood   6.384417607013208
as the envoy of the prefect of police arrived ten minutes before ten he was told that lord wilmore who was precision and punctuality personified was not yet come in but that he would be sure to return as the clock struck   11.397027566321519
the king perceived it and enjoyed it with that cold cruelty which was one of the worst sides of his character   18.535597152057946
m   15.710151561339636
asked athos   8.317481786762073
saint denis   5.109251834507244
it became necessary therefore to destroy this last bulwark of calvinism a dangerous leaven with which the ferments of civil revolt and foreign war were constantly mingling   7.598258696945233

that you found me sad but resigned   8.628854935362437
cried anne of austria with an accent of terror which proved how much greater an interest she took in the duke than she ventured to tell   11.861288509962955
there was an impressive silence   11.94952583881006
said the englishman   5.510262121933108
oh heaven exclaimed julie clasping her hands in what did he believe then   10.4910240378773
hear me athos said d artagnan   5.354510776271698
those who are indifferent to one another become friends and those who are friends become brothers   12.880504575949864
what s the matter   13.055944650499635
i have a despatch from the prince to his eminence   9.440764455368354
the donjon of vincennes was considered very unhealthy and madame de rambouillet had said that the room in which the marechal ornano and the grand prior de vendome had died was worth its weight in arsenic a bon mot which had great success   16.162260714786182
not quite twenty six   9.757585640827953
the brand of england   8.249612019933902

his reflections were not very cheerful   10.669962168496223
yes   12.151486054425444
then embarrassed how to continue such a conversation he opened cromwell s letter   16.17874267576485
well tempter what more do you want with me   11.621124126442822
oh i entreat you my son if you had entertained such an idea dispel it   9.849115690136934
this is the fourth which you have let fall and i have picked up   13.33799577080828

the battle soon became general and the coadjutor performed miracles of valor   12.089637893017121
pressing his lips close to the planks he exclaimed don t be alarmed valentine it is i   16.751644179612637
this saucepan contained soup for both prisoners for dantès had noticed that it was either quite full or half empty according as the turnkey gave it to him or to his companion first   11.166964533654111

it anticipates through a sentiment which your eminence will appreciate measures to be taken after the events   15.748347260148911
a mournful answer awaited each of edmond s eager inquiries as to the information jacopo had obtained   10.456674154047208
i thought there were four of you   10.810322447030249
ah cursed basilisk it will be a happy day for me when i can cross something more than a look with you   17.68255906848954
he therefore placed his tankard under it and turned the spout   6.17290737833396
m   10.324951817534517
asked emmanuel   9.445383127462776
but since you say nothing remains but for m   8.342846209664842
said lord de winter with contempt   14.332545802113614
well let us be sure of that   16.8187546560845
that then is your opinion   13.552430422715727
by the aid of the lightning they perceived the village of erquinheim   10.441851979887687
at one o clock this morning she had not returned   9.057975386872197
and is there no means of making him revoke his decision   16.453692011753986
he is a cardinal likewise   11.83073987877633
at midnight great cries and loud acclamations were heard   10.530013876251907
pardieu   15.156955425200678
he knew the king of old and he knew that all these complaints were but a preface a sort of excitation to encourage himself and that he had now come to his point at last   10.602808183908145
ah   10.689857728774657
they had taken some refreshment on the road and hastened on that they might not fail at the appointed place   16.421948030020566
d artagnan resumed immediately the attitude of distrust that was habitual with him   9.321022247747075
said the inspector   15.650882498666942
go away as quick as you can maximilian said valentine and stay till i send for you   10.060683800876573
i say that it is too soon after declaring myself for louis xviii   10.862180117507418
you must have much to tell me since you have come to seek me   9.46063419521057
it is then understood that tomorrow you will be irrevocably promised to m   6.764161073957618
with the aid of his pickaxe dantès after the manner of a labor saving pioneer dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported it filled it with powder then made a match by rolling his handkerchief in saltpetre   10.787625983025585
i would have saved madame de saint méran if science could have done it   5.804382090314875
this new eruption was more dangerous than the others being composed of armed men   4.0551533348964774
but you my dear athos you who so generously distributed the englishman s pistoles which were our legitimate property what do you mean to do   8.64781538927973
said the king i was unjust   18.97741241578765
no one in truth   6.1929941513933615
that is all i had to say to you   6.649150733040182
he exclaimed   11.92575480724074
however when morrel went down to his dinner he appeared very calm   12.586830682554856
the same day he told his wife emmanuel and his daughter all that had occurred   12.568174509203589
athos and aramis charged at the head of their squadrons   18.457283672393586
and you appear satisfied with the explanation   14.061047749357574
i was worn out with fatigue   5.449945657284269
and that your husband can incur no risk provided he answers me candidly   18.925681805094364
bertuccio who understands hiring windows so well   13.949372465573225
replied villefort   12.206796251319497
benedetto the count s son   4.942759733154753
insisted the count   7.3055947456851165
stand aside   8.508240800258449
she exclaimed   10.75465205816436
but his sleep was a nightmare which might be guessed by the incoherent manner in which he sometimes snored and sometimes snorted   9.724364176045556
that of rouen   13.817887780169158
we shall meet again master d artagnan continued the leader raising his voice   12.510892773064892
the fowl was tender the wine old the fire clear and sparkling and andrea was surprised to find himself eating with as good an appetite as though nothing had happened   14.35252493617482
taste this and in an hour you will be a king not a king of a petty kingdom hidden in some corner of europe like france spain or england but king of the world king of the universe king of creation   10.966459666397785
what do you think of this   15.858178517830085
franz followed albert with his eyes and saw him mount the first step   10.955986027573045
but i thought he said that your eminence knew that circumstance better than any one i   16.005774620717354
the very paper was different while the articles of antiquated furniture with which the rooms had been filled in edmond s time had all disappeared   16.853519615395484
40142m high walls   9.36705220913181
you are going to see something curious added the gascon   17.88089097805428
tell m   19.833382721356642
halloo grimaud   6.796513584313701

your guardian   7.879539561585821
had i such a uniform as your eminence possesses i protest i should be mightily content and i would take an oath never to wear any other costume yes but for to night s adventure i don t suppose my dress would have been a very safe one   11.52105915043759
you are today free as air come and dine with me   4.262582781002622
te deum for the victory of lens   14.62012527992629
nothing can be said   7.418692716729831
bravo bravo   9.582735351402627
they may not be so very great   6.605789131793124
it is miraculous   2.7113484040653475
he found his horse and that of porthos fastened to the manger but to an empty manger   13.91282901986343
albert returned safely then the count was revenged   9.150728551510941
i also know that her name is valentine and i have already prayed for her   3.4341715389494194
resounded on all sides   17.342939058864445
the ante rooms were still full of soldiers the passages still lined by guards   4.841207432348482
athos smiled   8.118498746055359
i want a hundred pounds and as for my own and he emptied them inside out   10.107579080635919
say the devil   14.244614295464665
during these hours of profound meditation which to him had seemed only minutes he had formed a fearful resolution and bound himself to its fulfilment by a solemn oath   15.415393800739823
all right   13.5169987477359
it is that next to you bertuccio must be the richest gentleman in europe   11.603731456349227
as he was about to leave the presence the cardinal gave him a friendly smile and said a perfect harmony reigns sire between the leaders and the soldiers of your musketeers which must be profitable for the service and honorable to all   10.111853215576115
he bowed respectfully to the king who gave him a somewhat cavalier reception but a look from his mother reproved him for the hatred which from his infancy louis xiv   7.660011968484858
you are fifty five years old   18.213426416022862
asked d artagnan   18.020503431592036
my dear athos i shall no longer count the number of times i am indebted to you for my life   12.807143351251266
in matters of speculation however though man proposes yet money disposes   9.149569893964012
d artagnan uttered a slight cry of joy   13.564083727441846
they then took tea together after which they desired me to leave saying that they needed me no longer   12.204749427221921
and with us no other escort but you two   10.234544659009934
madame will await my return   15.87647951929559
inured as men may be to danger forewarned as they may be of peril they understand by the fluttering of the heart and the shuddering of the frame the enormous difference between a dream and a reality between the project and the execution   12.00510540218266
thank you i understand   6.901817603423103
the only moments of sadness i had known since the assassination of the procureur were caused by the recollection that i had abandoned this child   14.317590787209676
what is the matter my lord   19.5627105799076
what the devil   10.923099189982441
the duke opened the purse and wanted to empty it into grimaud s hands but grimaud shook his head   14.416797529323283
the woman you poisoned at béthune was still younger than you madame and yet she is dead said d artagnan   10.99455495797493
well sirs   3.3806427692814687
this then continued aramis was my first opinion   23.276592628121364
d artagnan shrugged his shoulders made a sign to his escort and started   8.576063412164531
cried milady looking at lord de winter with eyes almost starting from their sockets   12.427483142702384
he shrugged his shoulders when people spoke of the future   9.716327802087722
they are aiming they are going to fire   10.375431556351364
porthos turned his head to the right and to the left and drew himself up with a movement full of dignity   19.724946551176195
i am glad to see you are of my opinion   11.654960620554991
de montmorency and lafayette   11.248333528485261
two monseigneur   6.869265040495466
it was d artagnan who was waiting for him   2.490493155614029
the ballet lasted an hour and had sixteen entrées   15.452126088986946
she is a slave whom i bought at constantinople madame the daughter of a prince   12.24720913132204
a letter   12.775460967017183
the marquis took his arm and they left the salon   12.952397168207565
we have made our calculations with spartan economy and we each require fifteen hundred livres   13.330956237956984
the secret entrance was open   10.865457764122706
it was the same through which twenty four years ago he had been conducted by a silent and nocturnal guard   12.222795958985916
morrel and mercédès came to see him but his door was closed   18.141232509292095
it concerns me much said d artagnan since you can not marry madame without my consent and since and since   9.67450136159809
two aces   13.368745314445635
and how   15.804946319097205
yes sir replied franz   10.940349773051702
50105m who is he   12.29686770199644
asked de guiche   13.228019632028007
you have purchased it dearly enough   15.46282515136488
raoul had offered some opposition at first   10.695592863831553
yes my lord   9.26322048995248
it led through a grove of lindens to a conservatory   12.88403835100186
only this time it was no longer from affectation but from terror   15.460078212781914
chapter vi   8.508452424544695
his glance was keen but showed cunning rather than intelligence   9.687175548777603
so you see in what a situation i am   10.070146958162317
it seemed to all three that they knew him   13.446438646612847
my poor mother   24.315423878129423
we have already at the station three gentlemen whose passports are under examination who are on their way to her majesty   12.889958653384266
one last spur instead of making him advance made him fall   17.481097953957672
villefort closely watching his countenance and his lips awaited the result of the examination   16.612249420305176
it is you who with that mandate obtained the pasha s ring which gave you authority over selim the fire keeper   14.809722067272027
i perhaps may leave my life in it for although it may be strange i have for some time had a presentiment that i should shortly die   14.828687079882393
never fear these people owe us no grudge   12.422446120968003
he turned around and mordaunt stood before him   2.449834342504605
at the sight of his friend porthos uttered a loud cry of joy   18.13739410757755
i think not replied château renaud   14.354724352510727
had just granted to him with his estate of épinay   19.27320355068099
my son   7.940399820064231
asked the queen   10.708044511520956
noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort because she is going to marry m   12.536450169275884
but at this sort of work many doublets must be slashed and many swords broken   13.876420891492316
i call those first rate which are composed of treasures one possesses under one s hand such as mines lands and funded property in such states as france austria and england provided these treasures and property form a total of about a hundred millions   14.352973263888972
either you are a demon continued felton or the baron my benefactor my father is a monster   15.102525109459284
you went to sleep full of thoughts of vengeance   14.922989657053801
a thousand francs sir   11.251854344650686
she inquired if the baron was still at the castle   12.263573111005112
noirtier poison madame de saint méran   9.929707268609668
the prince procured for marie michon the dress of a cavalier and for kitty that of a lackey   15.454166239428034
athos according to his system neither encouraged nor dissuaded him   8.56227786804157
and the door keeper appearing called out with that shrill voice peculiar to his order ever since the days of beaumarchais the court gentlemen   19.83216016821531
possibly madame   9.396134432701302
fernand cried he of my hundred names i need only tell you one to overwhelm you   17.993348954149788
the count bowed while mademoiselle danglars bent her head slightly   13.931385451231868
alas said hermine doubtless it is chance   10.758789963657463
just as the tutor and his escort disappeared in their turn a new traveler stopped on the threshold of the inn   17.920894915102643
there are pirates like the bandits who were believed to have been exterminated by pope leo xii   12.536262880511067
various rumors were afloat to the effect that the owners of the pharaon had promised to attend the nuptial feast   8.525876215760098
what has become of him   11.246611206912059
the boat is waiting for us   11.49037923141286
but why must you leave me so soon   13.070419964158917
but as they were preparing to escape together they were both arrested   7.186364357950877
base coward   11.900528886686885
20081m oh they are simple enough replied the host   8.060283072323923
do you love me still   19.987158337955606
all without had heard as we have said athos porthos and aramis called and had guessed from m   4.774457219174418
albert stood pale and motionless to hear what his mother would decide after she had finished reading this letter   13.668286537465361
everything in its proper time and all comes right to those who know how to wait patiently   10.079268856747195
cromwell   12.634545258544339
at this moment the bell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain for the second act   16.186157753744073
everything depends on you   10.955118573402151
his eye seemed to burn with a devouring fire   12.446287356878283
he remembered that before they were buried their heads were generally cut off and he felt that his head was still on his shoulders   15.227517422781709
doubtless   15.044735504815112
i once possessed piety innocence and love the three ingredients of the happiness of angels and now what am i   11.894558639034138
he had a remarkably fine garden full of vegetables flowers and fruit   13.714497803946012
have you not enjoyed the pleasures of the chase today   6.940100117701934
under any circumstances he resumed you are welcome my dear friend   8.549245232656219
yes   3.172412973315982
gutenberg   9.379075885488449
if she had been a great lady she would have fainted   7.487768250718789
bertuccio   11.728939940235419
welcome to ye   9.663883763089874
valentine will you permit me to make a confidant of a friend and reveal to him the love i bear you   7.401933551580598
besides had natural humidity been wanting it could have been immediately supplied by artificial means thanks to a tank of water sunk in one of the corners of the garden and upon which were stationed a frog and a toad who from antipathy no doubt always remained on the two opposite sides of the basin   13.508510912272454
only tell us where we shall find a house at which we can demand aid and a village from which we can fetch a priest   9.746228902794856
and he advanced to the window   18.467582592753423
d épinay and his family   10.339167403820639
over head and ears   12.638757722400353
said morcerf   7.19037617271479
i do not think it likely sir   9.0160604138744
and people are wrong d artagnan   6.074790752838123
but as after all excepting some few acts of economy which porthos had always found very unseasonable the procurator s wife had been tolerably liberal that is be it understood for a procurator s wife he hoped to see a household of a highly comfortable kind   10.809403070616348
i am ready to marry m   10.604484483928267
he is right said porthos   8.322252571711152
the stranger whom as yet dantès knew only by the number of his cell sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a person of his years and light and steady on his feet as a cat or a lizard climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of dantès and from them to his shoulders   18.561099803263566
now said the steward what have you to tell me   12.870358321574056
in this ledger was made out an exact balance sheet of his affairs   14.370041898598458
what do you mean   11.361372960904017
only he is not quite sure about the women for they did not come in until after he had taken hashish so that what he took for women might have been simply a row of statues   8.645777125846227
athos and his friends again mingling with the throng were taking a last look at the martyr king   11.398434580143409
i have been in ill luck for several days said danglars and i have heard nothing but bad news   13.138815443314886
d artagnan obeyed   7.67939943875427
indeed   14.0603368948866
a second after he saw it again approaching with frightful rapidity   8.724279391200147
resumed the procurator s wife hesitatingly   14.290528774560801
this drunken caderousse has made me lose the thread of my sentence   13.261564071555782
hem   9.88390167794909
asked franz   14.958593669952258
said d artagnan taking his friend by the hand   5.289641836235249
then let us sit down said villefort impatiently for it will take some time   13.21001571703979
and without waiting for her reply he threw himself into the arms of the helvetian who received him with great coldness   16.403246512462978
danglars opened his bewildered eyes   13.559079256633401
i possess a share of wit and a certain relative sensibility which enables me to draw from life in general for the support of mine all i meet with that is good like the monkey who cracks the nut to get at its contents   9.653210661887671
you are right my dear monsieur bonacieux my friends and i have been on a little journey   15.744462329453519
but why do you pity instead of blaming me   11.80078549413601
and how   8.686601636596516
no sir but i am severely   11.680288681026754
and who is this cerberus   6.253612310303519
monte cristo smiled imperceptibly   13.087046563959621
therefore after the connection had continued three years carefully fostered by d artagnan who found his bed and his mistress more agreeable every year each doing credit to the other the mistress conceived the extraordinary desire of becoming a wife and proposed to d artagnan that he should marry her   8.871139830598796
but this time the affair is serious for here is a lady compromised by you   11.545506284949203
danglars had however protested against showing himself in a ministerial box declaring that his political principles and his parliamentary position as member of the opposition party would not permit him so to commit himself   10.528794132273367
she was sent by her mistress to the false de wardes   14.822064297755853
general terms of use and redistributing project gutenberg™ electronic works 1   3.9416113846838954
well madame it proved to be as we had supposed   12.7670457732231
no d artagnan considered that things are never well done when they are not reserved to their proper time   6.828918679371095
porthos impatient at his continued losses kept up a vigorous play with his knee   15.05181903030004
keep that ring for love of me   13.148337150351026
information about the mission of project gutenberg™ project gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete old middle aged and new computers   9.105586479903522
he only groaned   16.04333786560711
let us act in freedom that we may act well and quickly   13.160284183966732
the trial at eight o clock in the morning albert had arrived at beauchamp s door   12.957602174117898
i will deny it   15.975134263287638
are you sure of that   16.92449428955083
then outrages were heaped upon me and as my soul was not subdued they wished to defile my body forever   15.388568932774948
he became curious to solve the problem   5.825942196560675
if you see him coming on one side of the street pass by on the other   13.576784863473002
a little before they came to fromelles the storm burst   9.626863173918448
if i bore my proper title i should be a lord   14.78662028031603
you still confide then in sinbad the sailor   15.389536955422964
edmond being consulted was of opinion that the island afforded every possible security and that great enterprises to be well done should be done quickly   18.73165899467216
what do you want sir   12.824392594605062
in the middle of the choir the body of the victim clothed in her novitiate dress was exposed   6.598693701653655
that it seems is where he meditates on state affairs   16.629897195134497
porthos followed chatting with aramis   15.50670371283327
in 43 he said just before the death of the late cardinal i received a letter from athos   5.58746707916846
then we shall never be masters of three hundred pistoles to redeem it so that we really should lose two hundred pistoles by the bargain   9.88826596863317
it would be fatal to his interests   6.444193810891214
they carried valentine away   10.56139829338608
at the same moment the guardhouse was opened and a voice called out la bruyere and du barthois   12.49933435380237
and the young man went to the gangway   17.758642248012706
to mademoiselle de la valliere   4.669748118948272
your age   9.537531565251138
a town house and a country house   9.274216265842728
you aramis why the devil did you ask me for a uniform when you would have been so much better in a cassock   6.0634172608044725
haydée whose soul seemed centred in the business of the stage like all unsophisticated natures delighted in whatever addressed itself to the eye or ear   10.763880034302023
she read it is important that you should fulfil this mission in person and alone   8.539675165396682
look rather monsieur said d artagnan the clock shows it   8.010533642752922
i shall still take precautions   5.322045473983617
monte cristo motioned him to be silent   15.001034713558997
the count of monte cristo had just entered   12.029057908246289
one thing only puzzles me namely how franz d épinay will like a grandfather who can not be separated from his wife   16.653476906751294
and there were in the plan which our lover had devised for milady he was sure certain things that would not obtain the assent of this puritan   7.008295062644963
asked the count   11.841622639371318
your engagement was for breakfast then   15.804371352434295
and he arranged mentally while dantès awaited further questions the antithesis by which orators often create a reputation for eloquence   15.736458816214025
the musketeer could not forget the evil reports which then prevailed and which indeed have survived them of the procurators of the period meanness stinginess fasts   7.822450519892268
in that case i will forgive him   13.290209283080518
the glance was of sublime eloquence   11.51480323420336
teresa was endowed with all those wild graces which are so much more potent than our affected and studied elegancies   14.021996548906086
the authority of the king was to be maintained   11.969811995438686
my friends monsieur   9.78231922934076
on the contrary i think they are poor sir   7.403891063312463
his father was also a shepherd who owned a small flock and lived by the wool and the milk which he sold at rome   14.289971778388555
he found the wharf too completely deserted the night too dark the captain too accommodating   13.189238168875445
me   21.749001790696184
why did you not have him arrested while in paris   9.422263226952293
for he knew that all the soldiers of the french emperor were naturally noble and generous   9.851749807459496
maximilian who was paying them a visit listened to their conversation or rather was present at it plunged in his accustomed state of apathy   13.799812225168365
ah you are a cardinalist then monsieur are you   6.4963929685258375
de château renaud in pleasing a woman   5.542747994911239
he opened his eyes upon utter darkness   12.868547351730603
and where does he reside   9.067571175131416
they questioned each other with vague and stupid glances   10.848325164482533
when i live at auteuil you must come there as you belong to my service   9.527080318967688
i say i want to know why they should put dantès in prison   12.010583812860228
his opinion of me is altered for the better then   16.585808354067094
yes   10.231354213663089
no noise from without by which i could measure the time reached me   7.750351781045669
let me take refuge in martyrdom   15.192347161988186
monte cristo had endeavored completely to overturn the parisian ideas and to feed the curiosity as much as the appetite of his guests   11.292448239206642
what   5.044881989699082
why all these precautions   14.005707781807564
yes much said d artagnan who did not well know how to answer   15.16982264227196
milady could not at all comprehend the silence of the comte de wardes and she ordered kitty to come at nine o clock in the morning to take a third letter   9.244705936088828
but she was absorbed by jealousy   17.875598795155526
this was a matter of dispute between the holy father and his son   15.482333967367978
he called out his name and cried for help   10.943582506334536
you have it already for it was taken from me with some others which i see in that packet   11.047181742004035
oh not a word said she in a concentrated voice not a word of all that i have said to you to this man or i am lost and it would be you you then as the steps drew near she became silent for fear of being heard applying with a gesture of infinite terror her beautiful hand to felton s mouth   7.881056162096441
take out the horses quickly and come up to me said andrea to his groom   19.990083573188404
oh my god my god   9.367488801704166
groslow   5.284252603007692
40278m chapter 94   11.402255815022054
e   9.948518453556758
that will insure his confidence   8.805779085002106
in the hands of the devil you mean   14.366302286842757
oh you do quite right monsieur   13.404362491500821
but peppino did not answer   10.46238958293429
are you quite impervious to good advice   9.41446263624769
the bastion was guarded   15.338136709067308
one thing only perplexed edmond and destroyed his theory   2.2906905807192963
the rencontre   3.783645538506857
50195m he descended the little staircase with which we are acquainted and entered noirtier s room   19.06724455352836
oh it concerns you very closely my uncle i am sure and you will soon be of my opinion added he with a smile which sent a shudder through the veins of him he thus addressed   13.607433808242112
instead of taking the waters of forges i go and take sea waters   12.265388615925099
noirtier s weakness of mind sufficiently explains it   13.581611153614709
but his son   11.628897946320414
yes   12.21099627085901
meanwhile danglars who had cared little for curiosities was mechanically tearing off the blossoms of a splendid orange tree one after another   10.875020324979474
he was compelled then after having swallowed the contents of his bottle to pass the time as well as to evade suspicion to fall into the easiest position in his corner and to sleep whether well or ill   10.84235701473268
m   12.473118663059083
asked monte cristo in the same tone that louis xiv   9.684652410374511
cried aramis with an emotion very rare in him   15.952311041263888
he had found himself so strictly guarded that he soon perceived the fruitlessness of any attempt at escape   14.567054513998848
said d artagnan to himself   3.5029368584727703
the unknown would not name anybody and pretended that it was to the duke alone he would make himself known   12.948890472171191
noirtier would have left her all his money   10.115404308611282
well my dear replied athos you know well that the balls most to be dreaded are not from the enemy   10.14264547634554
why did you not say so at once my dear sir   9.438304900680961
how soon can he be here   14.059371374349634
i will therefore proceed   12.796319570781932
above you there is the king   10.326644722372572
come fanny we will put her to bed   10.016090416023651
that he had under his cloak a large white robe dotted with black tears death s heads and crossbones for in case of a surprise he was to pass for the phantom of the white lady who as all the world knows appears at the louvre every time any great event is impending   10.497231228296068
i am dying   10.47096418950564
if he knew anything about horses he would dispute the price   18.600838779711047
what do you decide on sir   16.456409213728293
i have long wished it   8.954820805136514
de la trémouille with a letter in which he begged of him to eject the cardinal s guardsmen from his house and to reprimand his people for their audacity in making sortie against the king s musketeers   15.759078679182393
i have no greater regard for the bastille than you   7.839488986540116
well said he in a voice perfectly calm and no muscle of his countenance disturbed well my dear vampa it appears to me that you receive a friend with a great deal of ceremony   15.397941909852275
if indeed you feel any curiosity respecting one now alas powerless to aid you in any way   11.050480307378336
cried the executioner all   7.227186362249098
you shall see said eugénie   5.9369143529794695
oh my god   13.289835302092348
then you have thought that barrois was poisoned   10.57440409818719
besides he had no relations nearer than an uncle and aunt his mother having died at his birth and his father having been assassinated in 1815 that is to say when he was but two years old   15.28214515734276
the piercing eye of peppino had noticed all   12.070605883271051
e   15.428424419438477
on foot yes in a carriage no   13.26027654822019
but i forgot added the gascon smiling pardon i forgot you are no longer athos   10.621278924582484
come gentlemen cried harrison regardless of his illustrious captive let us be off   10.02289414574133
oh i know what that is   14.500398904962314
charles wiped his face and said with a sad smile poor wretch for half a crown he would do as much to his own father   10.95758504367605
only by the count s orders in the centre of each rosette that adorned either side of their heads had been fastened a large diamond   14.242978220776699
he only girded on his sword wrapped himself in his cloak and went straight to buckingham palace   12.67697419205141
a second afterwards monte cristo appeared on the threshold   8.309088447318938
de villefort   13.421257125316748
de guitaut mme   8.493635662017978
upon my return home i sent for him and i then explained to him what i wished to procure   16.14800018938174
de villefort saw it open before him   12.62044540598669
felton walked into the sea up to his middle being unwilling to trust his precious burden to anybody   13.122454194018738
he named to guiche the people whom he had seen there   21.422588253334386
noirtier   13.31945414544264
no doubt you could only there is one misfortune and that is that monsieur bonacieux is known at the louvre and would be allowed to pass   13.901896880193464
at the end of an instant they heard a furious fusillade   15.6858203264853
true as day   12.912435236424853
the one m   10.6556607777696
benedetto will be punished   12.644442112372584
you are not wrong after all and life is sweet   15.34282787149617
but to day you have not fought for the king you have fought for mazarin   15.991157379309854
porthos foamed with rage and made a movement to rush after d artagnan   7.2539099823241235
the president read mr   9.094813178757756
i am not unhappy while i possess my son   10.300242063381111
i shall then have no more friends said the young man   22.41142337036787
and if i make a promise i must keep it   13.899760428223182
why then doesn t he attend to it himself as at chantilly   14.658148177284652
it is probable that the succor of the english fleet will never even arrive in sight of the place   7.6332164543822945
asked danglars   14.059906327342338
oh i am dying   16.5763957738413
what is his bearing   7.814609390432236
speak speak   16.121722231054253
dispose of me then as a friend   11.796764771260142
no indeed   12.709352132347865
spaniards englishmen and italian malcontents adventurers of all nations and soldiers of fortune of every sect flocked at the first summons under the standard of the protestants and organized themselves like a vast association whose branches diverged freely over all parts of europe   13.183831056138063
be assured gentlemen we shall do you honor in our dying   12.245072761946654
against whom   11.124148196918354
him to whom your excellency pays that little annuity   12.765275193896287
gone never to return   7.173445084711105
noirtier who sometimes rebuffed this little wretch he therefore received the same quantity of the elixir   11.370225823763016
in the same way on retiring from business you have nothing but your real principal of about five or six millions at the most   15.883761464948627
said d artagnan as he drew the letter from his pocket   7.41362431615664
well   9.826066027872892
gutenberg   15.807783587534555
cried the bandit throwing himself upon his knees and leaning upon his hand for he began to lose his strength with his blood   18.01176395394544
he continued to press the raising of the famous dyke which was to starve la rochelle   15.298159638248128
i passed the day without experiencing anything of the kind i dreaded   14.561826217662869
by its side on her knees and with her head buried in the cushion of an easy chair was valentine trembling and sobbing her hands extended above her head clasped and stiff   21.93538390195173
to which you attach more value it seems than i do to mine   10.232556814259192
and desirous of putting an end to the interview he pushed by her and closed the door as if to exclude the pain he felt   2.834448505364339
the devil   17.41262294874988
we hope that the reader has not quite forgotten the young traveler whom we left on the road to flanders   14.723325722168092
said the young man laughing i confess it and so much more the readily my dear bonacieux as i see there is no concealing anything from you   11.331151703349821
with folded arms he gazed for some time upon the great city   3.6283455694630575
did you know that i am at liberty   6.588915946355396
they have eyes cried milady but they see not   9.889397387424047
i should like to have seen you in my place   15.548493436309766
what devotion does she deserve from him for whom she has sacrificed everything   10.630457504385165
on the contrary i gave you to understand i think that i adhered to the princes   11.855765067251822
a quarter of an hour afterwards the postilion having been put in the right road passed with a crack of his whip through the gateway of the barrière saint martin   5.76568469608165
deuce take it friend if he s one of thy friends thou wilt ruin him in saying so   13.596184679266806
but this woman is a friend of aramis i know nothing of that   17.176636529102137
you see i am perfectly composed said albert   10.416126476176068
it happens well that we are going there this evening said athos to the vicomte   18.945418331080376
for me   4.855020813997169
he is at constantinople   11.506612077233678
3 and while warming his feet and chatting about the last races at chantilly he waited until they announced his room to be ready   17.01295376585313
they cried   6.368194901793236
bonacieux prophesied   0.22353519094204266
at your return i will give you a surprise   22.239467780211065
ask her said morrel translating noirtier s thought this time by his look   15.442981627894106
said the young man   13.934739429506177
it is thus that human weakness fails from its debilitated and imperfect organs   7.787495423908803
he had wept all night long but would not show his grief before the people   13.15796989573601
the nearest frontier is sixty leagues distant   9.499879884098693
it is perhaps needless to add that morrel departed almost at the same time   10.381759669825653
monte cristo shuddered   8.163049302157672
who has travelled much read much is like brutus of the stoic school and moreover added he sending a volume of smoke up towards the ceiling that he has excellent cigars   11.154199494547413
then the coronation of the queen of england took place followed by the theft of mademoiselle mars s diamonds   6.331148187519028

here are forty double pistoles my dear friend said d artagnan taking the sum from his pocket   16.31975319127897
some sentiment of this kind must have been cherished by each one of these two friends for each of them almost immediately sat down by himself at an end of the tent and began to write   12.808679604938193
is this then a campaign upon which we are now entering   8.809881700940501
but now that we have come to so clear an understanding and that all distrust and suspicion are laid at rest we may as well fix a sum as the probable expenditure of the first year suppose we say six millions to six millions   5.500189791481148
no said the count with an imperceptible smile of contempt for he had no wish to be seen in the young man s society no   15.150479689164886
morrel i am not angry quite the contrary and i do not send you away   15.422943842026468
said danglars   14.854873428824497
asked morrel   14.590210355983968
d artagnan retired to bed not to sleep but to think over all he had heard that evening   7.994626988675356
it was not the executioner but the surgeon who wished to withdraw the honor of danglars from ignominious association with the disgraced young man they had presented to the world as their son in law   14.770312857055973
and d artagnan pushed the half stupefied mercer among the guards saying to him you are a shabby old fellow my dear   10.013917978956624
inquired winter   8.308520017355704
did not you sentimentally inform me with that pretty mouth of yours so cruel to me today that you came to england solely for the pleasure of seeing me at your ease an enjoyment of which you told me you so sensibly felt the deprivation that you had risked everything for it seasickness tempest captivity   10.30311221850688
adieu my dear gérard and at your next journey alight at my door   11.634331053631403
he was certainly the tall young man with light hair red beard black eyes and brilliant complexion whom his master had so particularly described to him   8.064745437263726
formerly i was your junior by two or three years and if i am not mistaken i am turned forty years old   15.739877888086845
it advanced swiftly and gracefully leaving behind it a glittering stretch of foam   10.213968525890833
oh m   15.20978513612243
but how could you charge a nubian to purchase a house and a mute to furnish it   8.607767652869857
0285m evening came and edmond saw the island tinged with the shades of twilight and then disappear in the darkness from all eyes but his own for he with vision accustomed to the gloom of a prison continued to behold it last of all for he remained alone upon deck   10.194109404970085
he was not mistaken   9.722429281334765
and that other gentleman   5.712327180881163
whilst enchanted at being all together again the friends awaited his return   13.418311928798694
the hand moved on with incredible rapidity he seemed to see its motion   0.37006516998505923
several strokes resounded on the door   14.351141445418087
he knew so well that from that moment he shut himself in his house and never went out unattended seeking me high and low   13.539461578228648
sooner said aramis   11.259177390885686
cried d artagnan   13.884116861871439
and yet i was not aware that you had married fernand my calumniator and that my father had died of hunger   14.17464674029344

one went to support d artagnan the other porthos   21.03324481952712
what is this   4.8246655118755974
as long as i live   8.80285896751633
he was not insensible to such a proof of courage   15.522152340704618
on the contrary we think of announcing very soon that we have you here   14.288881140041802
you are then angry with us   11.93309503105266
villefort rushed upstairs to fetch him   13.842180026689002
then as we have said the young girl left the bedside to see m   18.69458711439566
the queen untied from around her throat a small golden key which hung there and presented it to the cardinal   14.640726298708554
why watch me   15.120265923853065
de villefort must either give his consent to this plan or his refusal   17.160917022234166
asked the count   6.923598060644075
i am incredulous   13.78391714031429
compared with such things what is the letter you have just read   13.237710786784756
cried porthos   8.627731938996977
there is nothing truer than that said porthos   13.578811863864502
it will be time to think about it when we next halt   11.895761584992437
fatality meantime milady drunk with passion roaring on the deck like a lioness that has been embarked had been tempted to throw herself into the sea that she might regain the coast for she could not get rid of the thought that she had been insulted by d artagnan threatened by athos and that she had quit france without being revenged on them   4.079065968498184
morrel i shall have his place   11.375839695355063
if he closed his eyes he saw cardinal spada s letter written on the wall in characters of flame if he slept for a moment the wildest dreams haunted his brain   8.835739963759535
because a fortnight since i was questioned on the same subject   16.304039412195756
scoundrel   13.819822206203732

said albert entering   8.670191878074906
the cemetery of père lachaise m   12.505856106789102
but this time as i yielded to fatigue or as if i had become familiarized with danger i dragged myself toward my bed let my robe fall and lay down   9.460059184427834
for soon perhaps i shall not hear and i shall die without knowing what she has written to me   12.792980253319303
speak to the master madame said felton   15.42094815819243
this is where the mad abbé was kept sir and that is where the young man entered   11.567402924622849
if i call come said he   15.374635573582268
it will do replied the man in a tremulous voice if you separate them across the neck   14.065570899943735
and let him be no longer king cried the queen   9.828443267765866
and did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination   8.005223013853811
noirtier did not lose a word of what valentine said   10.659888324277517
indeed i did   11.774543748726211
he has been guilty of certain escapades and fears he may be disturbed   6.6690892959804495
we are friends are we not   13.20903477302349
and i charmed it away   8.497700260360816
he was an intelligent lad and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people amongst whom with dilating eyes he saw the king s attorney   13.124151430494472
but we have forgotten to mention one circumstance which nevertheless ought not to be omitted   12.929245933169812
your song is as dismal as a de profundis   13.735137479282418
my brother s carriage will be here first   13.899085140520855
i will tell you replied the young girl for it is but right you should know   18.422977477438813
well said he let her come with your consent and that of the baron and we will try and give her an engagement though we are very poor to pay such talent as hers   11.801369552974547
at other times in spite of maternal endearments or threats i had with a child s caprice been accustomed to indulge my feelings of sorrow or anger by crying as much as i felt inclined   18.430261390799142
yes the priest   13.810900864089863
if we reach compiegne we shall stop at the peacock   3.2914375767083808
asked anne of austria   10.652908316793651
ejaculated caderousse almost suffocated by the contending passions which assailed him the poor old man did die   18.432985731368653
it appeared to me such women as i never weep said milady   13.730173442768264
villequier said guitant   17.75230949145529
bernouin bowed and retired   9.117535470106292
and he laid the request of number 34 before the governor   12.807208744570735
inquired the abbé   9.690341804790839
that s my advice   9.926114414007145
do you not know what became of him and the share he had in edmond s misfortunes   13.889473107928756
his deep set eyes were hollow and the gold spectacles shielding his eyes seemed to be an integral portion of his face   10.007636817644443
de tréville s spread themselves about in the cabarets in the public walks and the public sports shouting twisting their mustaches clanking their swords and taking great pleasure in annoying the guards of the cardinal whenever they could fall in with them   12.433732786997693
here is a ring that will obtain audience of him and remove every difficulty said the captain   14.008314173908078
what though payable at rome   9.34904665620173

the count wished to speak but a gush of blood stifled him   12.89756435805142
chapter ii   18.37942750131291
you have to know me yet   13.758492318457634
yes i have seen aramis   8.911289962072619
a plague on t   9.839173851274676
we are under mazarin s orders   13.127957589619841
asked charles   9.49666563743537
are we then going to travel my lord   14.085440597078417
he had reported to aramis what had taken place and aramis not less distrustful than he had increased his suspicions   15.695213555236151
she is not guilty   13.856093567380029
at length felton who had not yet looked at milady turned toward her   11.7089567041195
why he is a second ariosto   17.20785739334184
yes indeed   6.352813821100363
you persist in your incredulity edmond continued faria   14.59868624045998
la ramee sent away the guards desiring them to drink to the duke s health and as soon as they were gone shut all the doors put the keys in his pocket and showed the table to the prince with an air that signified whenever my lord pleases   13.898413834338395
75   7.64660790636913
that we only write to him to entreat that as soon as milady arrives in london he will put it out of her power to injure us   11.078213952733156
beauchamp told the truth when he said that on his way to the funeral he had met monte cristo who was directing his steps towards the rue de la chaussée d antin to m   6.62356867931562
you don t think of holding out against a whole regiment do you   7.729280649675609
you will in turn enter it my dear d épinay for you will soon be numbered as one of the family   12.237828008779623
this bird darts on the dead fowl and carries it away to a rock where it dines off its prey   4.623519676750107
cried d artagnan beside himself with joy   11.40157512255838
for an instant he leaned his head in his hands as if to prevent his senses from leaving him and then rushed madly about the rocks of monte cristo terrifying the wild goats and scaring the sea fowls with his wild cries and gestures   12.49241542649251
monsieur porthos gave us a note for his duchess ordering us to put it in the post   14.83065686658883
i have promised you the truth   14.842284496621257
well sir said the queen what is your opinion of this riot   9.698745137732613
said la ramee   3.4930574398789425
and how dressed   7.274397691076811
and should any misfortune occur to you dear edmond she continued with the same calmness which proved to fernand that the young girl had read the very innermost depths of his sinister thought if misfortune should occur to you i would ascend the highest point of the cape de morgiou and cast myself headlong from it   12.390975384253728
moreover he is but a child said aramis   16.34303127631932
it appears that i had made a mistake monsieur that i had arrested the wrong person and that he whom i ought to have arrested had escaped   9.390129874933763
you think this house pretty do you not   15.404495062293929
nothing has happened to him i hope said the count frowningly   13.498405450292921
i could not defer my pleasure so i took a cabriolet and drove to the horse dealer s   11.398354965450428
nothing more simple returned the count   11.709948100561597
we shall find him extended on some lawn whence he will look at us with a languid eye and peradventure will not recognize us   13.410002019562606
this demanded new effort but nothing compared to the first   7.52765782911807
athos turned red with rage   16.85390360638282
m   14.218717977812357
the young man stopped suddenly looked around him and perceived caderousse sitting at table with danglars under an arbor   13.300325425853263
the world is a sepulcher   16.14370230474008
0023m alas sir in the most unexpected manner   13.356941897121715
touching sympathy   10.961753997840882
pardieu cried d artagnan it will be a double amusing affair to save the queen with the cardinal s money   19.102067920828517
you sir know how necessary subordination is in any large establishment of servants   6.613782177181104
by the scorn i will throw upon her   13.638640256468861
ah to be sure replied château renaud   6.62575014175407
our family although still rich for my father s income amounts to half a million has experienced many misfortunes and i myself was at the age of five years taken away by the treachery of my tutor so that for fifteen years i have not seen the author of my existence   16.145941124769806
permit me madame to express my surprise said the abbess   7.842593286065603
it was on thursday the abbé s reception day   13.255316973690086
what is there then behind this wall   14.386661484672011
ah valentine i assure you you are mistaken   11.140808860460345
in the hour of rest between noon and one o clock galley slaves having a nap after dinner   19.843075782536946
permit me to inform you count said he bowing that i have received a letter of advice from thomson french of rome   16.853873822827456
it was a tolerably fine winter s day and a ray of that pale english sun which lights but does not warm came through the bars of her prison   11.361256030513156
hitherto the excitement of fulfilling a duty had sustained them   11.338742529076374
as to the bastile they are not there though the bastile is especially for the frondeurs   14.335315790363264
albert turned   11.291341347720522
indeed   13.174652228946803
there remains the valise added porthos   12.866801572477707
but said d artagnan in the ear of athos you are going to get us all killed without mercy   9.904872326410377
if once discovered he knew he would be lost for the roof afforded no chance of escape   12.597216513480975
but tell me valentine is there no other sorrow in your heart   18.924943780355516
for i criticise him without knowing what he does   13.598405312696988
why to be sure he promised to rejoin us and we have seen nothing of him   14.915455553290965
silence   17.689644869147163
your excellency said the captain that was the land signal will you answer yourself   14.823838652687144
ah assunta cried i you are an excellent woman and heaven will bless you   15.41646517279171
messrs   10.126728383431423

pray continue   8.119768846717479
no one could have said what caused the count s voice to vibrate so deeply and what made his eye flash which was in general so clear lustrous and limpid when he pleased   11.974806785307209
oh no edmond it is myself that i blame myself that i hate   11.158253508837566

it is unnecessary to say that from the day i saw raoul i loved him   16.339797648926055
the spadas remained in doubtful ease a mystery hung over this dark affair and the public rumor was that cæsar a better politician than his father had carried off from the pope the fortune of the two cardinals   10.761577014543684
monsieur continued the prisoner i am the abbé faria born at rome   11.792915172490833

when they spoke although teresa listened timidly and with downcast eyes to the conversation of her cavalier as luigi could read in the ardent looks of the good looking young man that his language was that of praise it seemed as if the whole world was turning round with him and all the voices of hell were whispering in his ears ideas of murder and assassination   8.525303096516986
monsieur de scudery the author of clelie and of le grand cyrus which were composed partly by him and partly by his sister who is now talking to that pretty person yonder near monsieur scarron   8.972181131869222

the master and servant rode side by side conversing as they went for d artagnan had by degrees thrown off the master and planchet had entirely ceased to assume the manners of a servant   15.015391533157228
they have killed them i think and taken flight carrying off their booty   10.06957733670119

the word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength to surmount passed over his head   16.757679323448798
it is but you will not look will you   14.459962269818385

now do you know baron i have a great mind to pick a quarrel with you for asking it   10.169349871752537
villefort drawn by an irresistible attraction like that of the bird to the serpent walked towards the house   8.68487722813452
at that moment a hand touched his shoulder   14.056734659306938

you spent it as you pleased   13.683548808185668
he had instructed porthos to profit by this opportunity to see the ceremony   14.188410234410568
well said the count what are you doing   17.434449065581873

bring me a million such as that said danglars i shall be well pleased putting the draft in his pocket   14.34499080646885

aramis had killed one of his adversaries but the other pressed him warmly   18.255808313334317
d artagnan bent low and following the cardinal up the secret staircase soon found himself in the study whence they had first set out   19.621090237152174
said he there are two of them   9.486227877456038

how do you do madame dantès   13.339921256343587
if de wardes has related all our affair to the cardinal which is not to be doubted and if he has recognized me as is probable i may consider myself almost as a condemned man said d artagnan shaking his head   14.6796167382208
like an impetuous mob a wave of human beings came to meet the carriage and rolled tumultuously into the rue saint honore   14.768772636743288
yes i do so bid you answered morrel it is your duty   8.268860491125142
does monsieur le comte de la fere live here   12.618861258875766

d artagnan being the bearer of the letter is naturally the head of the enterprise   9.600253499294226
you have no more the appearance of coming from thence than you have of going there   9.718867902207506
there s another brave and excellent young man   12.817986326527306
i uttered a cry of joy   7.071434465335096
30029m above us all sir was monte cristo s response in a tone and with an emphasis so deep that villefort involuntarily shuddered   8.566844594792013
how can it be   6.8351825788585225
our young men had been waiting about half an hour amid a crowd of courtiers when all the doors were thrown open and his majesty was announced   13.853686127425481
then in spite of my cries in spite of my resistance for i began to comprehend that there was a question of something worse than death the executioner seized me threw me on the floor fastened me with his bonds and suffocated by sobs almost without sense invoking god who did not listen to me i uttered all at once a frightful cry of pain and shame   6.400053608417795

the sight of this instead of exciting the anguish experienced by the count in the dungeon filled his heart with a soft and grateful sentiment and tears fell from his eyes   7.559901840574462
at length m   10.577019191721032

but will you be able to follow me   6.988695588781794
from behind the door a human figure appeared but the girl was too familiar with such apparitions to be alarmed and therefore only stared hoping to recognize morrel   12.857353034551746
should a hardy sailor an experienced diver like himself shrink from a similar task   13.072343572676445

the latter seemed to be maturing in her mind some great stroke a fact which increased the uneasiness of the cardinal who knew the proud princess and dreaded much the determination of anne of austria   8.482499818101443
yes my prince   11.383171094590942
this time i have merely come from cadiz   12.34606175640056
this miserable strain confines me to my bed   15.41434501655672

athos bowed and obeyed   12.372956862098107

ah ah said the chief i now understand why carlini stayed behind   15.972385523605167
a gleam like a flash of lightning illumined the road and with the flash was heard the whistling of balls which were fired wildly in the air   12.098568158459015
a hundred pistoles   12.544055400323947
and what is become of this benedetto   9.756140122096173
de villefort had the reputation of being the least curious and the least wearisome man in france   12.531814089885804

the journey had seemed very long to dantès but monte cristo found it equally short   15.230126048293034
there s what you want on that table said the waiter   10.503026125712404
the latter had surpassed himself   8.758906257976586
they had found the grasp of porthos pretty powerful and that it was no joke to fight against it   12.733135200610429

when he was quite a child and only a shepherd i gave him a few gold pieces for showing me my way and he in order to repay me gave me a poniard the hilt of which he had carved with his own hand and which you may have seen in my collection of arms   7.845407236025949
and as i am a connoisseur in such things having had a few of my own once i estimated it at a thousand pistoles   15.216960967962954
but instead of going to her own room valentine having once gained her liberty entered the gallery and opening a small door at the end of it found herself at once in the garden   20.446388871258634
it seemed to him that if porthos and aramis deemed him superior to them in the arts of diplomacy they would like him all the better for it   10.735428785655602
your fingers are stained with ink   11.361399914719156

signor pastrini did as he was desired and returning five minutes after he said the count awaits your excellency   7.304795282436688
she rose   4.990099749708788
he cried out and staggered against the wall like a drunken man then he hurried to the opening that led from the abbé s cell to his own and said i must be alone to think over all this   8.215598329094426
olivain dared offer no opposition to this determination but he followed his master grumbling   18.206316707788265
they were approaching the scene of war   13.599564624903396

what a delicious abbé you would have made   16.066300631760278
she looked marvellously beautiful in her deep mourning dress and morrel experienced such intense delight in gazing upon her that he felt as if he could almost have dispensed with the conversation of her grandfather   13.117588445393514
he took the key which was customarily given him as one of the family ascended the stairs and introduced mme   9.467283673348856
in a quarter of an hour the porter returned with a post boy and horses which were harnessed and put in the post chaise in a minute while the porter fastened the portmanteau on with the assistance of a cord and strap   7.440612780963649
but since that terrible night when i became an instrument of private vengeance and when with personal hatred i raised the sword over one of god s creatures since that day the executioner paused and shook his head with an expression of despair   7.451205983091526
ah that gives me more confidence   14.09450374172053
that instant the arm of porthos fell   7.761567874414486
cried aramis from whose usually mild eye a flash passed like lightning   9.450457866938356
but before it was out of the scabbard porthos with the hilt of his had struck him such a terrible blow on the head that he fell like an ox beneath the butcher s knife   16.96709812958555
d artagnan would fain have declared that he was not fatigued but athos insisted on his retiring to his chamber conducted thither by raoul   13.817831295796575

he escapes us growled porthos pushing his huge shoulder against the hinges but in vain   14.431753749923582
you wrong me my boy   8.70469000755949

this way   13.441889899426519
it was late   14.379294756021922
the stranger went out   8.723623749040874
this instant duke   13.176241714068043
noirtier i resolved to try one last means and for three months i have been giving him brucine   15.94292250643781
the police think that they have disposed of the whole matter when they say a murder has been committed and especially so when they can add and we are on the track of the guilty persons   14.848460600698154
nothing   10.612926549619987
the file on the corso broke the line and in a second all the carriages had disappeared   10.055228143502251
well let us as you say go and ask a dinner from the master of that house   12.483820972219506
albert related it to his mother   11.922233371994205
and letting fall his cloak and raising his hat he advanced toward milady   14.630076110770068
at ten o clock the next day they met again   16.91769419738412
because it is a grievous thing for me to meet again those two men who caused the failure of our enterprise   10.93999938242007
the bell summoned him to his seat and he entered the orchestra with château renaud and beauchamp   8.337177727129326
they continued to threaten but they began to disperse   14.284858185826469
he had only been back an hour or two   10.106717970184663
said the procurator rising yet supporting his weight upon the arms of his cane chair   19.32740584132617
now sir i have but one question more to ask and i charge you in the name of honor of humanity and of religion to answer me candidly   10.751671606526838
and now my lord will you obtain for me an audience with the queen   20.725915227400108
no one commits crimes here   10.901672380481633
i faith colonel said d artagnan we are very grateful for your gracious invitation   10.697005094992429
d artagnan tried to gather from the expression of his eyes whether porthos understood the importance of that visit but porthos did not even look toward him   16.605357498745747
but he added in a despairing tone perhaps no one will dare to come for it is known that the spaniards are ranging through the country and i shall die without absolution   5.408768748435407
he reflected smiled and replied to me by a sicilian proverb which i believe is also a french proverb my son the world was not made in a day but in seven   10.468926701146083
cried d artagnan beside himself with joy   16.421607165488467
how can that be   6.199454648104428
monte cristo approached him and said in a low voice with an expression almost humble sir you have indeed lost a son   7.140148076550358
next morning d artagnan was the first to rise   13.28273207121995
he was supercargo   17.54776560295288
god wills it that man whom he has created and in whose heart he has so profoundly rooted the love of life should do all in his power to preserve that existence which however painful it may be is yet always so dear   3.346105991737982
you have deceived me   11.292624536769036
then an invincible and extreme terror seized upon him and he dared not again press the hand that hung out of bed he dared no longer to gaze on those fixed and vacant eyes which he tried many times to close but in vain they opened again as soon as shut   10.516803012841336
asked m   9.996409019139497
i am too fond of art to attempt anything of that sort   19.964878117599042
it was directed to monsieur oliver cromwell general of the army of the english nation   12.73289197571796
i have nothing but what my sword brings me in that is to say more blows than banknotes   18.599321058417438
he then bent his body and by a desperate effort severed the cord that bound his legs at the moment when it seemed as if he were actually strangled   6.6166704969619845
a murder do you call it   11.828564397007309
father your coolness makes me shudder   16.06321692462598
the smugglers left with edmond what he had requested and set sail but not without turning about several times and each time making signs of a cordial farewell to which edmond replied with his hand only as if he could not move the rest of his body   12.083324462697615
so that we are like those misers who are unable to absent themselves from their treasures   8.633930682668396
as for benedetto he gracefully wiped his lips with a fine cambric pocket handkerchief   8.078148140021712
said mazarin looking with astonishment at those two men   12.942396293934312
as for that benedetto who so grossly belied his name have you never made any effort to trace out whither he has gone or what has become of him   14.361426693219764
for in case of failure heads are in question not for our lackeys speak lower aramis said athos   18.56186506672194
i will not detain you monsieur continued the countess   20.202064835390097
the two men approaching the ends of the bed took the sack by its extremities   6.984214886944583
exclaimed the executioner you use that word which sounds ever in my ears assassinated   18.666525651880995
and you say that you are ignorant of the contents of this letter   12.927347208526093
you were saying signora said albert who was paying the most implicit attention to the recital that the garrison of yanina fatigued with long service had treated with the seraskier15 kourchid who had been sent by the sultan to gain possession of the person of my father   16.536603282191543
what then   11.498268580143638
inquired d artagnan   2.7822391634623234
scarcely however had they gone a quarter of a league when having killed a kid he begged jacopo to take it to his comrades and request them to cook it and when ready to let him know by firing a gun   13.043262019545656
the spada family was one of the oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century   9.582079164640463
what for   8.303480023832904
well what are you doing count to a former lackey   5.95417484467759
you would like very well either on land or on the ocean to lay for me one of those nice little ambuscades you are so skillful in planning   10.788235819508897
bonacieux kissed his wife s hand and set off at a quick pace   9.479713044048355
a few minutes afterwards a flash of light which was extinguished instantly was seen on the land and the sound of firearms reached the yacht   17.759734367885642
according to the count s directions danglars was waited on by vampa who brought him the best wine and fruits of italy   15.887815991368871
why so   11.043102142653087
asked the president   13.868528409769453
and the two young girls whom everyone might have thought plunged in grief the one on her own account the other from interest in her friend burst out laughing as they cleared away every visible trace of the disorder which had naturally accompanied the preparations for their escape   11.694801645642247
then on the honor of a mazarin as i am and ever shall be i hope said the cardinal   9.590595930556887
but that is doing things in lordly style my friend   11.834985652874053
my father advised me to stoop to nobody but the king the cardinal and yourself whom he considered the first three personages in france   0.5224696762215508
let the prisoner be brought in   20.125991844758232
andrea was short and fat   9.110106032290169
at this moment the expiring embers threw up a fresh flame from the kindling of a piece of wood that lay near and a bright light flashed over the room   9.83469529262406
no my friend i was wrong to caution you   16.649547199703733
s   3.4784110139463174
you may not only hope said danglars but consider it a settled thing if no obstacle arises on your part   10.466662464685422
every time i see you is a fresh diamond which i enclose in the casket of my heart   11.255153860591017
on what occasion   12.085587015645588
will you allow me captain   16.632660736009832
in fact they saw the soldiers running to their arms   8.535893153997552
he was of pale complexion with clear blue eyes rather deeply set   6.042032876675679
it was chance that threw me in your way   14.225511345158278
in july we added 1 700 000 francs it was you know the month of the spanish bonds   10.384135940330907
he looked around for some corner to hide in some way of escape   6.6703227528738775
he sees us on the road which leads him to a bishopric and perhaps will not be sorry to get us out of his way   7.404580911974336
you are taking a poetical tone and the comedy of yesterday turns to a tragedy this evening   20.877843691658278
40068m speak speak signora said albert i am listening with the most intense delight and interest to all you say   19.202352313060807
the english are almost of one mind in contending against the tyranny of charles and his adherents   14.204027410641954
others besides you have undergone such monsieur athos and have replied thereto   15.072830796127768
and francis the first who was as i have heard say as good as other folks nevertheless lost the battle of pavia   10.035766558774306
excellency cried the cicerone seeing franz approach the window shall i bring the carriage nearer to the palace   19.97954035972999
but it can not be   10.177363134907395
how acts the judge   9.841809053244322
but not for you my dear viscount who are one of my most intimate friends and on whose silence i feel i may rely if i consider it necessary to enjoin it may i not do so   10.372722131534001
that may be done if they can separate the king from his mother   13.142519811531615
approaching her mistress she spoke some words in an undertone   15.568915403358801
cried the unfortunate woman   12.268462902595891
she knew she had only two days left   15.219365952321855
he entered the chamber and closed the door behind him   8.342171027610748
i only beg leave to observe to monsieur that the night will be very cold that chills bring on rheumatism and that a lackey who has the rheumatism makes but a poor servant particularly to a master as active as monsieur   9.325753416899046
the moon which had shone for a short time disappeared behind the clouds   13.075972066273073
will you accept my offering   9.695769848942781
you do not know what felicity from heaven what joys from paradise are comprised in a moment like that   17.726760883388614
the captain was only waiting for his passengers   8.244976546676787
the man made no reply   10.503479622252481
you are right a mute from the east   11.955341415923236
for everything   16.145226101630755
cavalcanti the company of mademoiselle louise d armilly her singing teacher   9.163775085840365
but he did not appear to notice that he was the object of general attention but began to arrange with so much cleverness nicety and gayety his straw bed that the mouths of all these poor creatures who could not go to sleep began to water   14.294382923377093
yes but after you had fired off your thirty thousand guns they would take the donjon   9.656526340536875
i did   14.426675933190817
but unfortunately a recipe excellent for a man like myself would be very dangerous applied to an army which might not awake when it was needed   4.198621331241716
the decanter and the glass were completely empty   18.600828001892083
edmond felt a sort of stupor creeping over him which brought with it a feeling almost of content   11.031918814946682
f   10.081940981178711
you are placed on high my lord but tremble   8.338099694446445
de tréville recommended everyone to return home and wait for news   23.46471325684035
he cried   20.759227256960028
in consequence after having traveled all night at seven o clock she was at the fort of the point   10.867368239169286
then milady collected all her energies murmuring in the depths of her soul the name of felton the only beam of light that penetrated to her in the hell into which she had fallen   13.082672588521602
you have a recipe for it   15.551144703424804
aramis awaited him with that terrible smile which was peculiar to him on such occasions and athos who saw the duke advancing toward aramis with the rapidity of lightning was just going to cry out fire   9.583702694045455
ah   15.667158458692981
the coadjutor bowed   13.71924621870048
how farewell   13.974714892120371
in the first place gentlemen you know that i was the means of monsieur de rochefort s escape   17.659050363594453
because we dare not speak aloud in one or the other   15.851394259766543
asked d artagnan   15.759198540502865
in passing by the house where the scene which we have related took place he remarked that the window was again lighted up and he was convinced that aramis had not yet returned to his own apartment and that when he did it would not be alone   10.329711869761075
the blow had struck home and danglars was entirely vanquished   13.07306633182692
seven or eight hundred thousand francs   18.582695158184116
to london gentlemen said d artagnan   8.498662278454288
la chesnaye go and see if by rummaging all my pockets you can find forty pistoles   10.081087311181456
three hundred pistoles   8.867153751492141
but when i came to the paragraph about you although i had done nothing else but read it over to myself all the morning you know you had told me all about it the previous evening i felt so happy and yet so nervous at the idea of speaking your name aloud and before so many people that i really think i should have passed it over but for the fear that my doing so might create suspicions as to the cause of my silence   6.879811948909537
indeed count you are the most polished man in the world   6.272714293965112
sixteen years ago she was deemed not only the prettiest but the most graceful woman in france   14.760108668710284
then seeing the young man was about to relapse into melancholy let us go out albert said he   8.421993761967384
then he drew from his waistcoat pocket the little emerald box raised the golden lid and took from it a pastille about the size of a pea which he placed in her hand   11.98915597546599
oh no certainly not on my own account said the major with a smile and a shake of the head   6.8677334094634945
yes said monte cristo i have heard that   17.443457227043588
allow me to ask you a question where are the plenipotentiaries   12.710871201438493
albert rose   9.245304374284999
but as no time was to be lost in gaining the king m   15.345516189794143
i mean on my left yes there   13.630338438872716
alas alas   8.881142983450417
he remained motionless and pensive his eyes fixed on the gloomy aperture that was open at his feet   6.333335129026712
but this simplicity was according to the will of its master who positively ordered nothing to be altered outside   13.747714428843507
cried d artagnan i can manage so that her majesty will receive me well   10.899374676977143
how very singular cried monte cristo with well feigned astonishment   15.723202864018528
and five minutes after i left without having heard one word that had passed   19.835559569666387
yes that is my name   11.894619432505163
la ramee ran in haste to obey the call   12.821734390636152
what day do you fix   14.932244182973555
loved his friend   4.220806107492284
do me that honor my queen and i will find a messenger   6.539794088037029
cried athos   12.896246361223422
you are my adopted father   11.080413170336143
meanwhile the duke hung the crawfish up by a thread   13.672199443570875
hold   10.487042881705452
but nevertheless i retain the privilege of laughing when i please   13.974246410560921
i shall be with mine under the third   12.586694725191851
tell me what is the matter   9.648908209882352
each was accompanied by two priests   13.381365408696883
i i fence as well as you did in the old time better still perhaps   16.38201249939642
sir he responded you are a stranger and i believe you say yourself that a portion of your life has been spent in oriental countries so you are not aware how human justice so expeditious in barbarous countries takes with us a prudent and well studied course   8.150164946979126
then she threw herself upon her knees and began to pray   11.850079234740502
ah then i suppose you heard haydée s guzla   12.200805793290597
and taking barrois under the arms he dragged him into an adjoining room   12.963019923989895
well sir said d arminges it is the common lot   16.4990851353012
she uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of a stranger and maximilian began to laugh   16.30410896168556
at all events here i am   8.186709448743091
it may be seen by these disastrous details that desolation reigned in the community   9.513185344099487
i advise you to complain   13.63552401196365
then collecting all her remaining strength she forced herself to close her eyes   15.163601071351533
our dear count   11.224512764578023
excuse me sir said franz since m   10.144497369676674
well since you will grant me no more i must be content with what you give me   15.60399091843848
well take your hat and gloves returned monte cristo   11.913104653763963
so you may plainly perceive that you have no mercy to expect if you do not tell me the whole truth   11.035633158077065
he s posted there   10.117310452440181
i set out three days ago passing miraculously through the puritan army and i took post horses with my servant tony   15.44562424255028
close the door said la carconte   12.436406831136738
besides sir said villefort addressing himself to his future son in law excepting the loss of a portion of your hopes this unexpected will need not personally wound you   13.2797367733851
why having recognized you and i the only one to do so why was i able to save my son alone   12.945841724009417
had his majesty asked he any intention of holding this hunting party yesterday   8.490347937553949
aramis contented himself by making a sign with his head   5.8839689654615634
stopped terrified at what he was about to say while richelieu stretching out his neck waited uselessly for the word which had died on the lips of the king   7.337174195277913
there s something promising said d artagnan   13.716284907078839
yes said monte cristo and god i can not say in justice for his justice would have slain you but god in his mercy spared your life   13.015584643527296
500 000   17.91423560249192
the three musketeers bowed to the necks of their horses   21.281393972751438
but the masks were visible behind the windows the carriages and the doors   6.495963512826763
the clock struck nine as the door opened and a coachman appeared   12.029180224731494
in politics we do not kill a man we only remove an obstacle that is all   14.031568611210075
the library was divided into two parts on either side of the wall and contained upwards of two thousand volumes   14.571827186692671
villefort drew back and clasping his hands together exclaimed dead   8.498667667485494
well what of that   5.588233369774693
on two occasions her fortune has failed her on two occasions she has found herself discovered and betrayed   10.013532172191443
let him find it out if he can   7.040248045125554
but you will see him then   16.796909704944213
i no longer understand anything   9.787907169803052
where is her stepmother   18.02417593276533
then disguised in the clothes of the marquis d o he had left the hotel stumbling over the bodies of an officer and two guards who had been killed whilst defending the street door   10.856442250435656
why what in the world cried aramis is that animal bazin doing   17.571269572586008
not at all   14.698107369702143
we are not in the time of malatesta and castruccio castracani   16.835413480408622
porthos kill every one who stands in your way   9.292173876166336
then sitting down by the fire my supper said he   17.26597494150367
i know it will serve me as it did when we came over   7.1208939960856
when he arrives i will not fail to do so   6.4615978917296415
here he said take this pocket book   19.260090322720874
have you been long in the orangery   6.889474240167698
at least i hope so said the novice with an expression of joy which she made no effort to disguise   6.318200922683768
but if i had pocketed his pistoles they would have weighed me down like a remorse   9.134188195644217
possibly monsieur   9.786776859714672
they can not understand it   11.701611150421623
i neither know nor wish to know him   2.5604249908567507
you shall be free to defend yourself   19.507320893396475
but there were three races were there not   11.775838852421074
demanded the irresistible voice of monte cristo   10.581770615127938
his eminence entered the chamber which served him as a study and made a sign to rochefort to bring in the young musketeer   9.660507476713583
we were obliged to keep silent upon the dreadful catastrophe   2.723572459217257
he fancied monsieur le coadjuteur had sent them back and without dropping the reins he sprang from his box to open the door   13.029107521506967
to morrow i am on guard   10.325911562499991
the grave and harmonious tones of that beloved voice seemed to have still its ancient influence whilst that of aramis which had become harsh and tuneless in his moments of ill humor irritated him   12.079114814278613
it was a bold step and one that showed some courage remarked the englishman   13.417087131377835
lucien looked at her for a moment in silence   13.20614085380819
let me look at that sapphire again   20.308326994688937
at every noise he heard the simple puritan fancied he recognized the step and voice of milady coming to throw herself into his arms to accuse herself and die with him   8.237424786821455
why i did not expect to see you before tomorrow   10.56359231294311
do not refuse this little service   11.327884004014614
dantès raised himself up and began to talk about everything   15.992157507643824
now we are pigmies in comparison   10.247452407663152
and he swallowed another glass of wine   8.329446028709041
two o clock has just struck and you know we are expected in a quarter of an hour   19.900976670881633
the countess left the arm of monte cristo and gathered a bunch of muscatel grapes   7.89621026356515
it is certainly the king said the man rising again   13.604956807673746
pardieu   15.82652386543981
he seemed to see before him the salvation of his administration and of the kingdom sculptured in flesh and bone   17.573171213384782
i shall call you presently   14.517095243866956
i have said what i have said   15.274244291456789
50077m it is impossible to describe the sensations experienced by valentine during the minute and a half madame de villefort remained in the room   10.565856642936986
replied caderousse   7.8108509725032285
i asked you if you knew him   11.627336860737694
it took some time for d artagnan to resume this little dialogue   2.8510724267529657
you talk very comfortably a hundred and eighty leagues   6.874355669435228
they are three frondists who are gone to rejoin the duc de longueville   11.65544497738818
morrel had in reality no hope but the return of the pharaon of whose departure he had learnt from a vessel which had weighed anchor at the same time and which had already arrived in harbor   12.883178535178667
yes madame   6.812780596270599

he saw the eyes of the old man dilate and become round his cheeks turn pale and tremble   9.73736432574064
why do you sing thus and with such a voice   18.606749442958105
well i am convinced they are all charming women   10.545266544427589
indeed said porthos looking complacently at his old lackey as he went away you are right d artagnan   12.022646463964493
they will pass as slowly as three centuries when i am all the time suffering dishonor   11.308433694403002
d artagnan trembled lest planchet seduced like the crow in the fable should tell his name and that the queen knowing his name would discover that planchet had belonged to him   12.272030697798574
i see answered dantès   12.62890323995829
about that   13.455971510768624
28   18.405241398466455
as to franz he had no letter of credit as he lived at florence and had only come to rome to pass seven or eight days   5.452012564151402
and going near the rampart himself and looking over he saw a man working in one of the numerous little gardens cleared out by the peasants on the opposite side of the moat   12.843590215812156
chapter lxix   14.22503543207375
then father said raoul forcing himself to convey a respect by speech that did not come from his heart if you are a priest you have an opportunity as my friend has told you of exercising your vocation   15.708779309376279
at that moment the door opened   7.036557068195186
he crossed the sea and brought back the set of ornaments to the great queen who was able to wear them on her shoulder on the appointed day   10.634986214771772
how d artagnan and porthos earned by selling straw   16.435316599540506
in an instant i shall be dressed   14.706993546420705
then his admirable nature underwent a complete and sudden revulsion   16.234847103222137
he sent us word this morning replied château renaud that he would meet us on the ground   6.822210171962068
but what is going on in this accursed paris   9.306717971154475
i shall never forget his countenance   15.004737573175696
yes   10.59493905933307
general d épinay died five minutes after   6.743352258435358
for it is not so well filled as that of monsieur d emery   11.997202586021164
porthos had found nothing and with him fatigue had prevailed over hunger   12.144165630845936
exactly so said the young men   7.770661111835553
can we do anything for you   10.110173780630326
the comte de la fere   9.27535042164391
they directed their horses to the city   15.562664454670239
it was a night of joy and terror such as this man of stupendous emotions had already experienced twice or thrice in his lifetime   11.620878399993988
you think   12.55642923356436
march   13.178257036172212
it seems to me said the host that this is not the first time i have had the honor of seeing monsieur   19.447152006734605
an old gentleman continued the concierge a staunch follower of the bourbons   14.671400799388461
it was the evening before when i had fallen asleep   12.619385518920234
i am going away the day after tomorrow   21.3922824903163
do they not seem to say with their pale lips and staring eyes we have seen   8.002523284595387
be it understood we are speaking of athos   8.541476604093019
now where are you going   14.82942673002736
i can scarcely contain myself at the bare idea   13.509590526835881
the prince immediately sent fifty thousand francs to mazarin begging him never to write to him again and offered twenty thousand francs more on condition that he would never speak to him   17.152918010987925
40050m the two young ladies were seen seated on the same chair at the piano accompanying themselves each with one hand a fancy to which they had accustomed themselves and performed admirably   3.2183164505669613
here is the passport said the postilion which way are we going young gentleman   9.432790424587106
they passed into the next drawing room where tea was prepared   5.5507620093554255
it was there wilmore had first met him and fought against him   8.983405029324027
laughingly he said to the councillor restored to his family do you think father that if now i should ask for a company the queen would give it to me   9.499498632344206
she said you would have to speak a great deal in the murder case and that you should take something to keep up your strength   21.91901405314205
dantès was on his bed   15.645282267048751
d artagnan read the letter with apparent calmness and said shaking his head see dear friend what it is to belong to the army   10.787972420549275
the papers had related his various adventures both as the man of fashion and the galley slave   13.922562951109123
bonacieux had just attained that happy period of life   0.6582562110955195
said de winter   14.747412636483695
take care of yourself monsieur d artagnan for from the moment i withdraw my hand from behind you i would not give an obolus for your life   9.92350364804255
you will see it approach after having struck your father your wife perhaps your son   9.071874909923126
this mournful appeal pierced the darkness   9.88581420496241
and for the rest stiff and proud   7.3690614655501285
then all at once he replied with that logic which the reader has doubtless remarked in him there is nothing astonishing in seeing a gendarme at an inn   6.736302031139279
said athos   3.2197673986935538
it is a very cold one my dear friend said aramis   7.843111403893421
so let us speak no more of it   12.823943575093388
he was notwithstanding anxious to set out   8.90701258485184
the abbé did not know the island of monte cristo   8.963683126180626
m   8.41834775856381
i yesterday took the place of another   13.5584465032281
50071m hush my child said monte cristo again placing his finger upon her lips i did say poison and death   10.583035216681955
there must have been in his life some strange secret that no one knows   17.396044249721218
but remember signor pastrini that both my friend and myself attach the greatest importance to having tomorrow the costumes we have asked for   10.580690457297639
and i even think he recognizes me   7.350675800935924
i shall want you this evening he said return in two hours   8.393831753359025
why   9.141333536837928
ah madame said villefort you forget that i was obliged to give a mother to my child   13.364606410724384
athos not only failed to reply he even changed the subject of conversation   8.097608091280417
with him then you must have seen some of his musketeers   5.536599361036779
cried the jesuit   12.72561169710525
i should have cried i should   10.275494693760317
you are then doubtless the count of monte cristo of whom hermine has talked to me so much   9.734754156198292
the burglary the day following that on which the conversation we have related took place the count of monte cristo set out for auteuil accompanied by ali and several attendants and also taking with him some horses whose qualities he was desirous of ascertaining   16.95450011606762
and he began his story   9.261662497641582
if my mother could know of this attention on your part and i will venture to tell her i am sure that she will be most grateful to you   11.822030201562777
no on my honor said maximilian   14.913042273453655
0045m you mistake fernand   13.367082429088
but do you not fear to find him a bully   12.712734319705548
it seemed like the fête of jack o lanterns   8.012335675046781
ried in a place he knows   8.802065973662854
as for raoul he avoided the monk by the whole width of the road and passed him turning his head away in repulsion   5.113372749880484
and this double order which the young lieutenant gave to the same individuals proved to milady that her servants were the same men as her guards   14.950517347051324
at that moment mme   10.174668696702343
well resumed athos swear on this cross which in spite of its magnificent material is still a cross   12.580894217130288
repeat it   9.198808431367901
the patron was so strict that this was the first time they had ever seen him give up an enterprise or even delay in its execution   12.924455174638467
notwithstanding your father s wishes to the contrary   10.260723238740551
chance   9.472314805394229
and caderousse bowed his head with every sign of real repentance   18.879967222678165
spada turned pale as cæsar looked at him with an ironical air which proved that he had anticipated all and that the snare was well spread   10.556244997270671
valentine arose placed a chair for morrel requested barrois not to admit anyone and having tenderly embraced her grandfather and sorrowfully taken leave of morrel she went away   12.069311758715783
he is one of the most extraordinary men i ever saw in my life   14.073059568813903
said he   8.84226021613667
in an instant they found themselves in a little harbor formed in a natural creek   5.4607224285243605
god has supported me through all   12.51734383188419
madame danglars asked me for letters of recommendation for the impresari   10.217953273572414
unfortunately edmond s brain was still so feeble that he could not bend his thoughts to anything in particular   4.698187904446053
give her that poison recommending her soul to god and save your honor and your life for it is yours she aims at   13.878453207298982
i fear that when the torrent has broken its embankment it will cause fearful destruction   7.737130272062594
at the sight of the diamond which was as large as a hazel nut la carconte s eyes sparkled with cupidity   13.626417592260164
sir said the queen to him thinking he was the leader of the band you wished to see the king and therefore i determined to show him to you myself   16.401144380456113
d artagnan became very pale   10.203744021407461
on the evening of the twenty fifth as they were entering arras and as d artagnan was dismounting at the inn of the golden harrow to drink a glass of wine a horseman came out of the post yard where he had just had a relay started off at a gallop and with a fresh horse took the road to paris   15.931626440489842
i hope my coming will not put you to any inconvenience   7.741717351285617
but his confidence in grimaud whose petty persecutions he now perceived were only a blind increased and he conceived the highest opinion of his intellect and resolved to trust entirely to his guidance   13.947157078192856
omer without drawing bit   17.380603335458225
that is what i call talking to some purpose   16.95033399940766
as he entered his bedroom a man was getting in by the window   12.513294915014328
we will be with you at that time said the major   10.856471521077403
said milady smiling   12.270522494678207
thanks sir   13.650127482370893
monsieur de richelieu would have said five hundred crowns for the councillor   18.27059500555352
i am going to take my patient into the next room to bleed him   15.956163681949329
really how very amusing   15.182011989466966
and i shall be at the convent of jesuits   8.402300601016952
this is my story then   11.67534004908041
felton cast his eyes round for means of escape and seeing the door free he rushed into the next chamber in which as we have said the deputies from la rochelle were waiting crossed it as quickly as possible and rushed toward the staircase   12.526029288334469
you are a precious creature my pretty hostess and i am much obliged to you   10.52682849837036
was killed   7.495185904310611
yes his father replied the abbé   17.20002035280912
indeed sire i did not   11.95866411532061
it is not here   20.875478400561256
but dantès was so honorable and true in his own nature that he believed everybody s professions of friendship   12.062900312575623
we are and have been these ten years connected with the house of morrel son of marseilles   14.290414347980436
replied athos whilst mounting also seeing he was used so long to brush your hats   8.019484365262542
i have brought you another said d artagnan   8.139032047009486
grimaud shook his head negatively   15.564892407506242
morrel only then recollected the letter he had received from the viscount in which without assigning any reason he begged him to go to the opera but he understood that something terrible was brooding   21.05251213581
but tell me what interest madame de villefort can have in your remaining unmarried   16.432716125379297
40112m when did you first feel that   25.131839156651672
the bedclothes were thrown back exposing the king s bed linen which was so worn that here and there holes could be seen   19.40159609543505
dantès was almost glad of this affray and almost pleased at being wounded for they were rude lessons which taught him with what eye he could view danger and with what endurance he could bear suffering   12.843086951167415
thence introduced into a half subterranean gallery he became on the part of those who had brought him the object of the grossest insults and the harshest treatment   19.554030042710462
we will not fire but at the last extremity   11.188963575133172
1   11.263493786268027
you have seen nothing that resembles him because he works by secret springs and moves by hidden ways   10.098387530457527
aramis not wishing to part with his sword selected a dark blue cloak of a military cut   11.765153434150879
by its light between the island of lemaire and cape croiselle a quarter of a league distant dantès saw a fishing boat driven rapidly like a spectre before the power of winds and waves   16.0499352791935
but for my own part i shall ever even if you do hate me retain esteem and friendship for you   9.229281744413473
and that means replied monte cristo laughing that you had probably just dined together   11.246855175677029
20027m but some official document was drawn up as to this affair i suppose   14.984911485777513
i neither hate nor blame the cardinal and your opinions will be held ever sacred by me   10.175676061198878
cried the king whose face was lighted up in spite of himself by a flash of joy   7.361503347973021
he is as well as you and i   15.041997625305507
oh is this true what you say   16.23222595363524
sir said beauchamp who had not yet spoken you appear to accuse the count who is absent from paris at this moment and can not justify himself   16.546856672614872
the gascon is full of ideas said porthos with admiration   8.919882781921586
still what i admire the most i confess is the marvellous promptitude with which your orders are executed   7.173573437195287
there they are   8.394796220549038
but when the cowardly insulter spat in the face of the captive monarch athos grasped his dagger   8.53061332254874
the bishop affected to speak in a loud voice before every one of their previous interview   17.801956559896116
perhaps when all is considered you are right   12.27458420911406
i do not know her but a sort of intuition tells me she is a lost creature and that there is something fatal about her   17.489843419950716
loose half drunk imposing the king s musketeers or rather m   10.397786895236782
albert had followed the footman and hearing the order given forced the door open and followed by beauchamp found himself in the banker s study   16.068528615415083
as for myself i neither have nor desire to have a mistress following in that respect the very judicious example of athos who has none any more than i have   8.902406889741176
i know not   12.632149982625288
five thousand francs per month   15.193547912161716
amen   10.423233918050979
and it is you you whom i make responsible before god and before men for my shame and my infamy   13.09825489512813
on chairs were laid elegant masquerade costumes of blue and white satin   13.70986165351849
ah you are a good and an excellent friend said albert   8.253816088046396
and what shall you do   16.666567685298322
the project gutenberg ebook of the count of monte cristo illustrated this ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the united states and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever   16.677819889278943
i m no thief but an honest citizen well off in the world with a house of my own   12.237516894077185
and milady saw him appear pale as usual but with his eye inflamed and almost wild   5.8575564435208936
i have taken the whim into my head   12.952381678763338
the man in the mantle advanced towards me but as he drew near i saw that he had a weapon in his hand   12.769159119005256
he is saved   16.788465470372163
noirtier has evinced you say a kind feeling towards me   10.181623396772038
shall i take out any more of them   14.019376223204908
porthos had six occasions and contrived in the same manner that his friends should partake of them   21.67248436815353
he found him as he had found him six weeks before calm firm and full of that glacial politeness that most insurmountable barrier which separates the well bred from the vulgar man   8.758083707432966
caderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand and swallowed the contents at a gulp   10.5976603873816
and villefort without seeking any further explanation and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws us towards those who have loved the people for whom we mourn extended his hand towards the young man   9.572312945824704
sir said comminges declare yourself at once   11.25313560206385
villefort suffocating pressed the doctor s arm   11.910961030431308
in vain did franz endeavor to forget the many perplexing thoughts which assailed him   12.640989505068449
oh the wretched hours i have endured the torture to which i have submitted when i saw the deadly poison poured into your glass and how i trembled lest you should drink it before i could find time to throw it away   11.597109346393315
yes   6.825738608112272
with a little more heart he might have been contented with this new conquest   16.372202154171106
you understand me perfectly on the contrary said danglars but if you will persist i will tell you that i have just lost 700 000 francs upon the spanish loan   7.892319028446523
valentine imperceptibly thanked him while two silent tears rolled down her cheeks   6.502144357802255
madame said he the count and yourself recompense too generously a simple action   15.30979347815441
what you ask is merely an affair of discipline and does not concern me said the queen   8.842732798842308
your wife in going to rue de vaugirard and rue de la harpe did not go to find linen drapers   17.19296197582245
there are people who laugh at the horse that would not dare to laugh at the master cried the young emulator of the furious tréville   14.659479530514467
the pretty landlady was desolate   9.896150026962987
you have been in my service a year your fund has already begun to accumulate let it continue to do so   15.618197555049253
exclaimed franz   7.759194430943243
save the king and although you care not for the price that is placed upon a good action in this world leave me the hope that we shall meet again when i may be able to thank you myself   15.56756899842357
you know what is agreed upon between you athos and me   18.613522324536756
the young woman and the young man without taking the trouble to shut the door after them descended the rue des fossoyeurs rapidly turned into the rue des fossés monsieur le prince and did not stop till they came to the place st   12.977451565084898
milady remained still in bed petrified by surprise   11.137411234890557
fight my dear captain fight   7.924933446845518
and that is injurious to you among the women   14.605626885769794
my poor mother   9.30657872657314
if your eminence is disguised it will be almost easy   9.732919444451356
aramis shook his head   7.569490585102417
no one then longer needs my useless life   8.983330495262607
some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages   11.242415025167066
and seriously do you wish to break off your engagement   19.07380503100395
what is it   7.2847700742427355
eh   7.312252361288397
because monsieur replied kitty my mistress loves you not at all   2.0245386149397504
but if they refuse can i count on you   12.796966038495496
and when women of genius wish anything they always succeed in attaining it   3.1820958319626182
but at the same time you are one of the most mysterious women   5.540464143560082
what are we going to do i faith   13.317816875012324
his hands gracefully placed one upon his hat the other in the opening of his white waistcoat were not at all tremulous   9.985460416997423
he asked   7.744534402105454
• you comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of project gutenberg™ works   15.764154640583055
he to whom you have confided your destiny he from whom death would have separated you calls you to him   13.14822741628868
he would care very little about it i think   11.144956199637479
he is a man of strong and elevated understanding ambitious too and pardieu   10.093891125255034
sir said broussel i am in bad health and can not give myself up a prisoner in this state   9.080373440856182
he would not however yield immediately to the young man s request but made a few conscientious objections   22.046706700081902
are you going to rejoin your cardinal   16.46222957827268
i feel as though it would kill me to remain long near that dreadful man   10.29364554131196
but do you stay   10.125114638670745
the injured man had recovered his senses   15.777984400930618
the love with which his young wife had inspired him was a secondary sentiment and was not strong enough to contend with the primitive feelings we have just enumerated   19.450541338749243
what if her last moments were approaching and she should never again see morrel   9.553140609280707
the cold gains upon me   12.28599290431097
and he extended his hands toward grimaud who merely thrust the guard out and shut the door behind him   14.903542280802617
monsieur i said my brother was assassinated yesterday in the streets of nîmes i know not by whom but it is your duty to find out   13.984992947453946
the abbess who was the daughter of a noble house took particular delight in stories of the court which so seldom travel to the extremities of the kingdom and which above all have so much difficulty in penetrating the walls of convents at whose threshold the noise of the world dies away   11.575911934374787
it seems then reserved for me said monte cristo coldly to be the first to do so   16.114827274592823
d artagnan did not draw his sword   13.154126767032576
oh no sir said madame danglars   6.261251811871178
this niece comes sometimes to see her uncle   8.976435131041601
our gascon knew by the first glance of his eye that his billet had been delivered and that this billet had had its effect   9.451759754933953
peppino glanced anxiously at franz   12.796697697922626
you see in me such as i am a person sentenced to be hung   17.689970005974644
we enroll no one against his conscience but we will compel you to act generously even if you are not disposed to do so   16.646547067438462
well m   15.972732649336496
what do you mean to say   15.746516405683785
de tréville   16.980470518024884
asked m   9.966862250318954
you are on the contrary adorable   14.989279094379938
how   9.309782984213031
and the queen had even the indiscretion to give him certain ornaments so rare that they could never be replaced by any like them   12.590362452498795
in fact the blood was rushing to the young girl s head already her cheeks were becoming red   15.651757780997267
you were asking then   8.270626271983922
and yet he had not gained the goal for there were still the landing place and the antechamber   10.255708012653548
to day aramis and i are beaten in our turn   8.333770980237963
pshaw   15.377349645250497
said richelieu surprised   21.743528488483342
such for instance as the escape of the duc de beaufort from the château de vincennes that of the abbé dubuquoi from for l evêque   16.156186363945846
and turning off he entered the drawing room by another door   9.032980473000558
he asked himself trembling more than the wind swayed cloth he was holding back   22.01940187032639
you speak as though you had loved this young dantès observed the abbé without taking any notice of his companion s vehemence   18.163153501727972
with these words he held out to the queen the two studs the cardinal had given him   20.293353406531885
it is a bad sign   9.886227383746462
but a serious minded man deserving all my confidence and charged by me to watch over the south the duke hesitated as he pronounced these words has arrived by post to tell me that a great peril threatens the king and so i hastened to you sire   16.980721811643328
bonacieux away and convey her to a place of safety and there if matters required make her a hostage   10.17612964562404
in addition to the sword there was a portrait representing a nobleman of the time of henry iii   11.659068002104648
i like the means well enough said d artagnan but where and how to meet with her   9.437906581296591
athos has been arrested   7.672198872662889
coquenard gently advised him to be patient   10.342516320516744
i am precisely of the contrary opinion   20.403239593169708
but what detains her   11.00424799732736
ah ha said albert i see you were preparing for a game of cards   10.192372776673666
the door had remained open so strong was the excitement produced by the arrival of athos whose wound though kept as a secret was known to all   14.140148684775971
as for porthos s coat a blow from a halberd had cut it open on the flank and a pistol shot had cut his feather in two   5.216408317821792
and so the poor fools believe that the whole thing is as easy as lying   14.863614946195176
a conjugal scene at the place louis xv   14.135664065147127
he will speak to me of god and death as he has spoken to many another dying man not understanding that this one leaves his throne to an usurper his children to the cold contempt of public charity   10.740194409253496
but as to free will aramis   18.167506095598437
i believe said raoul that i have got something like a scratch on the arm   8.697036094823218
there they are   16.900444548051446
franz only succeeded in killing a few partridges and like every unsuccessful sportsman he returned to the boat very much out of temper   15.897875779067146
come said the count mildly do not entertain the prejudices of ordinary men morrel   13.340060218841458
besides make yourselves easy   12.259237213182676
grimaud thinking that they had come as he had to try the port wine effaced himself behind his cask and consoled himself with the reflection that if he were discovered the crime was not a great one   17.64258598725739
your thesis   9.51807330913062
my child said monte cristo coloring allow me to take back that purse   12.122633323862367
he offered his hand to the baroness who descending took it with a peculiarity of manner imperceptible to everyone but monte cristo   14.172666240097218
that we may be discovered   9.254997831862202
well said villefort what is it   18.449366321753242
ali bowed his head in token of assent   8.507684288047248
not i   10.051490407170684
what did your excellency say   3.433977792566367
he will not desert monsieur the cardinal be assured of that   8.763368850478972
and the letter he had received from the young woman and her passage along the road of chaillot like an apparition were now explained   6.679801751234085
dantès first impulse was to escape but fortunately he did not attempt it   0.6100058124571976
the continual silence of the spot oppressed her   13.32306102488008
and faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to the young man who threw himself upon his neck and wept   6.7382173442734254
he lives at the end of the yard on the left on the third story   12.651989655993562
many also who were not aware of the circumstances attending his withdrawal from paris were struck with the worthy appearance the gentlemanly bearing and the knowledge of the world displayed by the old patrician who certainly played the nobleman very well so long as he said nothing and made no arithmetical calculations   11.859335236565997
then he exclaimed turning to his men let them pass   9.0451152599546
if on the contrary i die remember maximilian my corpse is that of an honest but unfortunate man   18.429925122128484
the pistol is blind   12.671290487091275
oh my god   14.51692593283001
he who was thus looking without being heard or seen probably heard and saw all that passed in madame de morcerf s apartments   10.714865519063743
no monsieur returned the count   10.134509463776102
and this time at any rate valentine will not die   14.561933086952852
is it possible that you do not know of whom you purchased it   8.581273731313933
but that which astonished him most was that the cardinal so deeply interested in preventing this young man from setting his foot in england had not succeeded in arresting him on the road   11.035380805546929
the idea came into your mind to avenge yourself on this man did it not   15.346292927627156
and how much does he give you monthly   23.991669381408194
first one gun l goes under then the other   11.833351107101253
he is going to the opera   14.50085199802778
said albert whose brow reddened   9.8833978045675
the count advanced smiling into the centre of the room and approached albert who hastened towards him holding out his hand in a ceremonial manner   9.744915735804488
on my side i have two sure men who have been in action with my father   11.935295726663249
what is thy name   7.690553484961879
no one had entered the house since i had left it   9.036496589294659
at the least noise he imagined himself about to be arrested and that planchet was being brought back to be confronted with himself and his friends   3.745857638544898
it is he who raised your father s head on the point of a spear   10.523033292414473
it shows you have a tendency for an oriental life   11.74293453234863
bah   7.635499818430535
arrest the duke   9.182884402160157
besides according to all probability they will wait at the door   16.50530704089305
and i foresee plainly that if we don t kill each other i shall hereafter have much pleasure in your conversation   15.063858291873492
i have been here six months without the shadow of recreation   8.320330902444333
inquired pastrini   10.842443899263493
is it known why   14.663351478751757
there is the other replied the queen   8.879603466052576
our good d artagnan said aramis represents among us the opposition in parliament which always says no and always does aye   5.856827729241842
never to leave the prisoner alone   8.380504961880748
morrel farewell and a thousand thanks   8.72643436864573
monte cristo although apparently indifferent had not lost one word of this conversation and his penetrating eye had even read a hidden secret in the embarrassed manner of the secretary   11.854517958936448
but today the vow expires   8.459880444666783
in all well organized brains the predominating idea and there always is one is sure to be the last thought before sleeping and the first upon waking in the morning   16.661128436694487
and i know one down there behind the saint nicolas citadel who will not be sorry to hear it   5.041660665909606
five minutes later the carriage stopped having reached cours la reine   7.0807907444715505
oh that is very good indeed it is very good   12.283917993338024
because an astrologer had predicted that you would escape   15.031181147949338
journeys you know appear much shorter when we travel two in company   13.205470695309593
i will profit by them to tell you something about my guest   13.021063264499483
the place named by bonacieux as that which had been the object of his journey was a fresh proof in support of the suspicions d artagnan had conceived   16.03794058732399
a most active search was still prosecuted in the house near the hotel de la chevrette for the discovery of planchet   13.868302828093487
that was his favorite word   8.102624194604845
the cardinal threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire   10.575289364092143
his costume of guardsman in the company of m   7.858250703836976
we were speaking of hanging   15.078163402748226
you wish to see blois again   14.051179106514553
ali was on the box in whom franz recognized the dumb slave of the grotto of monte cristo   15.830023912650732
to find such a wife as my father found   17.13434674118153
he doesn t wish to speak   14.94186881505007
my son replied the bishop with firmness you see him not because the passions of the world conceal him   12.257050058821285
my journeys became more and more extensive and more productive   8.766667149435024
do you observe said the countess g to albert who had returned to her side that man does nothing like other people   9.035460827747551
but by the smallness of the form the hesitation of the walk and the indecision of the step he soon discovered that it was a woman   13.859109769920545
morrel closed the ledger arose and offered a seat to the stranger   9.311520714797927
to good principles   13.175309033209361
then he entreated peppino as he would a guardian angel to give him food   9.852784039423216
morrel in his turn took monte cristo s hand in both of his and he shuddered to feel how cold and steady it was   12.668498165054782
after the execution   7.437237570833121
well did anybody ever dream of calling aramis a coward   8.216759543394662
with such things   17.787119063084962
they will not touch a hair of your head   12.823569940583475
i do   9.183486375872397
de morcerf   8.999309475174899
d artagnan had appointed six o clock in the morning for his lackey and wherever he might be he was right   8.143999055184931
oh no no said the general smiling faintly i did not come for that purpose   18.355286225573625
that completes the 250 000 francs we had fixed as the limits of our gains   9.438829782307527
i am not so proud as you   12.571474914790162
you m   13.98060273968404
tomorrow at the hôtel field of the cloth of gold a lackey in black and red will wait for your reply   18.273348120048823
you will sell this diamond   14.071980896210297
i narrowly escaped catching a fever there   11.744301758478652
the count is very temperate   9.81291609827277
the most urgent thing now is to learn where the enemy is and what he is doing   10.36327127133023
a high wall at the angle of which was the pavilion ran along one side of this lane and on the other was a little garden connected with a poor cottage which was protected by a hedge from passers by   9.384483806188076
you are a woman at once full of spirit and resignation   11.530592641172506
valentine sends many affectionate remembrances to your dear eugénie   12.686843762845491
monsieur le comte said the duchess giving him a letter here is what i promised you   12.288611805330227
felton has not told him said milady to herself   10.469251642408642
they reached the rue st   9.004257802742016
so am i delighted to see you said d artagnan although i am not yet sure that it is aramis i am speaking to   13.843905701717148
murmured d artagnan our honor as soldiers is lost to us forever   11.018593035756181
five days are more than i require   16.269697315280713
suddenly vampa turned toward his mistress ah said he good good   7.9080561224173405
this was what vampa longed for   9.735706904176453
morrel looked around him and then drawing dantès on one side he said suddenly and how is the emperor   8.826179443799667
from my mother who inherited it from her mother   9.448537872407993
30341m then morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was not illuminated   8.871883751534842
no said caderousse we are not rich enough to lose 5 000 francs   9.879912227566122
you know that   9.342108156501382
monsieur mordaunt   12.70167143979366
but this time a fresh inmate was left with dantès hope   5.458569259100702
villefort shook his head   10.71341920771435
you insist   14.099780347163856
married   10.629902128215868
so be it then replied the count and extending his hand towards a calendar suspended near the chimney piece he said today is the 21st of february   19.717296622650665
what you find in your trunks   4.589762266542285
and without caring whether he were followed or not he set off   2.9920586327224257
he said it only depended on myself to have it and i had only one word to say   18.414849029604667
indeed   9.756619362401608
ah said the captain we have still too much canvas set   11.57902798322365
half an hour an hour an hour and a half elapsed and during this period of anguish edmond leaned over his friend his hand applied to his heart and felt the body gradually grow cold and the heart s pulsation become more and more deep and dull until at length it stopped   17.228912882621543
the vendetta at what point shall i begin my story your excellency   12.721831843751641
something whispers me so continued porthos becoming more and more melancholy   11.192473142430945
two men wrapped in their cloaks appeared   12.487040207834673
albert had often heard not from his father for he never spoke on the subject but from strangers the description of the last moments of the vizier of yanina   12.808371003232567
then she looks upon you as a stranger   13.000638118377669
but he will not wish for only one harness   13.813602321719259
what then are you   8.435646430782587
with which you are at war is it not so   11.774251768691494
come then on another occasion you can be firm and strong   8.478985259708669
morrel now tried to negotiate bills at ninety days only and none of the banks would give him credit   11.296781831393014
comminges seized the servant around the waist and would have dragged her from her post   14.438501038636696
that is very annoying said the brigadier   11.428937663730277
cried the duke will you not accept any money from me   11.47442769262802
and monte cristo took the letter which he opened and read   10.286720950083506
one day when oppressed with a mortal weariness of mind without hope in the negotiations with the city without news from england the cardinal went out without any other aim than to be out of doors and accompanied only by cahusac and la houdinière strolled along the beach   15.930479277034836
but although in the eyes of the world she appeared calm she nearly fainted as she passed la réserve where eighteen months before the betrothal had been celebrated with him whom she might have known she still loved had she looked to the bottom of her heart   8.180631653046984
well that is precisely the feeling which i experienced when i first saw that extraordinary man   17.068874923554446
we will take possession of it and cut the cable   13.907712186506668
she has spoken to them   13.110078588126047
without passports said planchet   7.305545577718143
it was rumored that she was an object of almost paternal interest to one of the principal composers of the day who excited her to spare no pains in the cultivation of her voice which might hereafter prove a source of wealth and independence   14.512909017542611
asked valentine   13.384330649335588
it surprises me that two such heroes as porthos and d artagnan should have allowed themselves to be arrested by eight men   16.847413300925083
but how foolish all this is   9.201902513621006
twisted his mustache proudly placing his hand upon his hip   13.727487481165825
the cell was clean though empty and dry though situated at an immeasurable distance under the earth   12.299081202070811
27 in the rue du helder on the 21st of may at half past ten in the morning and your word of honor passed for your punctuality   13.438664931035852
well my poor friend replied beauchamp i expected you   19.728125584548096
dancers players talkers all uttered an exclamation of joy everyone inhaled with delight the breeze that floated in   12.595441881377912
the other grave is that of the man who met his death from the hand of edmond dantès   9.879950620664358
he touched him on the shoulder   13.747622237089764
every blow was accompanied with terrible imprecations   15.894095328755437
scarcely had he gone ten steps when his ears began to tingle a faintness seized him a cloud of blood passed over his eyes and he fell in the middle of the street crying still coward   15.373529266589745
a last discharge welcomed them but did not stop them   6.249632264072068
i thought you wished them to forget you   15.630724215835025
while he was yet at the door of the study he heard the bedroom door open turned and saw his father   12.192916134449574
just so   9.793756394058251
i shall know about that soon for i shall soon speak out to athos   10.476966455992311
comminges had arrested one of the ringleaders and had ordered him to be hanged near the cross of du trahoir   15.814908702625825
he shall not come in before i am gone said he   11.19527100942556
groslow is the man who broke parry s head and is now getting ready to break ours   17.773082266535457

the sheep will bleat for pleasure the ox will bellow with joy   4.640924155915054
i know and admire the corsican nature too well to fear you   11.312382919293814
he shall be both blind and deaf replied the young man with an air of determination that made his companion shudder   9.546940006173653
the frenchman asked for a rendezvous   14.541862481460061
then he turned to the officer   14.035310978562704
saved   13.369997410144705
after shutting the gate behind them i pretended to return to the house but i immediately went out a back door and stealing along in the shade of the hedge i gained yonder clump of elder from which i could hear and see everything   12.617733629375504
i did not look on caderousse as a bad man and i thought him incapable of committing a crime or even a theft   13.701287284018502
de tréville stopping him   6.902996825350857
the devoted mother felt that she ought not to allow the whole weight of the sacrifice to fall upon her son   6.655364743658565
the wonder was increased though the doubt continued to exist   12.836737942169334
at nine o clock lord de winter made his customary visit examined the window and the bars sounded the floor and the walls looked to the chimney and the doors without during this long and minute examination he or milady pronouncing a single word   6.773511477623052
let those who have ears hear and those who have eyes see   12.414523251484805
at the same moment that he quitted the room villefort and the doctor entered by an opposite door   1.3204997685448827
but i am here to do you justice   15.537187659949286
a horse for planchet that s all   17.5585952717924
go to england join the king be his friends protectors march to battle at his side and be near him in his house where conspiracies more dangerous than the perils of war are hatching every day   9.826668087422231
monsieur the duke said m   11.190231546768864
immediately m   9.704009464175233
that is well said the king retiring that is well   11.772155077819228
he bowed to him then full of gratitude for the past and for the future   21.010313147129516
as for monte cristo after this ebullition he closed his eyes as if dazzled by internal light   9.587696768832162
grimaud in fact was not only the accountant but the armorer of the party   9.990474649681158
caderousse stammered out something while he wiped away the sweat that started to his brow   7.58386539246998
i shall need all my strength to struggle with myself and support my grief in secret as you say   19.153655661468157
what was your deputy called   19.70676998048772
it appears that our journey was a remounting journey then   4.337833269033375
what   13.771960959384511
it is well understood that he did not breathe a word about the other   15.42292033090972
that is he that is he   13.602224528643003
are there any more slaves to be had who bear this beautiful name   9.87161116102217
you would have believed yourself about to meet friends   6.558087469120455
take pity on me then and go   13.442073551828027
but fortunately you are not mine   13.06633585089984
asked another   12.05038399708946
well then how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of information   9.34355983234113
dead all marseilles will follow me in tears to my last home   11.521492566652265
endeavor not to make me wait   15.715556015798755
my servants are examining the bodies   7.403355212394134
grimaud saluted in his politest manner and withdrew as was his custom on the entrance of his superior   11.972040485699182
if anyone seeks a quarrel with you shun it were it with a child of ten years old   12.611983938791376
which of you gentlemen asked the magistrate without replying to the count answers to the name of andrea cavalcanti   9.726024311426514
then i will add two words about the young greek girl   16.477564799550088
well done   8.299829509582327
franz could not we will not say see him but even think of him without imagining his stern head upon manfred s shoulders or beneath lara s helmet   10.92361272617213
i will sit facing stuart whom i like so much to see especially where he now is and you monsieur d artagnan opposite to me   14.441721734091816
d artagnan resolved to try and enter the louvre   10.45289075920907
d artagnan went down and found the carriage at its post and the musketeer on the box   9.674023091591648
you know said the abbé that i was the secretary and intimate friend of cardinal spada the last of the princes of that name   10.507551576504014
i have my full power   9.284819241303351
the eyes of noirtier seemed as though they would start from their sockets   14.285416344839899
the deuce   10.017595793832312
oh come gentlemen my master is ill   8.910752985070129
read the examination and saw that the name of noirtier was not mentioned in it   5.191093277632973
it means madame that the report has spread that the queen has left the palais royal carrying off the king and the people ask to have proof to the contrary or threaten to demolish the palais royal   15.660812795556753
yes   10.95544111685402
said villefort   14.75884175998055
but i warn you i shall defend myself even against you   12.449369222580058
monte cristo took the glass drank half its contents and then presented it to valentine who smiled and swallowed the rest   8.877202354351075
we are the poor succored by god   4.663877710922097
do not deceive yourself   15.193089350734319
30197m calm yourself my friend said the count with the smile which he made at will either terrible or benevolent and which now expressed only the kindliest feeling   15.85649061125299
one gets to like without knowing it all those beautiful objects that god causes to spring from the earth which are despised in cities   1.9501863945030067
edmond stiffened himself in order to play the part of a dead man and then the party lighted by the man with the torch who went first ascended the stairs   11.727726441515877
devil take him   8.558854572494802
and was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed   10.637427722910568
the gendarme looked irresolutely at his companion who returned for answer a sign that said i see no great harm in telling him now and the gendarme replied you are a native of marseilles and a sailor and yet you do not know where you are going   13.476030727061046
edmond was intensely interested   12.141830393714125
d artagnan after asking the man the right way continued his route agitated in spite of himself at the idea of seeing once more that singular man whom he had so truly loved and who had contributed so much by advice and example to his education as a gentleman   10.389432155422242
twas a thrust from a sword but his cuirass turned aside the blow   17.48736508277431
and you think she would be angry   12.705616617452591
will you speak   16.700171118997076
but the count completely baffled the procureur and prevented him from discovering anything beneath the never varying smile he was so constantly in the habit of assuming   11.815951360193074
but pray call emmanuel   13.478155216843026
i madame   12.979158488430816
i know all these things   15.063621192374605
that is to say with our enemies   16.189806262488474
not only on account of my own interest but for your safety   8.903041659002264
shall we go together   11.023909898506266
you understand my dear girl continued d artagnan she is the wife of that frightful baboon you saw at the door as you came in   12.580655649181484
dantès struck with the beauty and capability of the little vessel applied to its owner to transfer it to him offering sixty thousand francs upon condition that he should be allowed to take immediate possession   15.466738358884772
what horses   6.362777632794143
i understand said morrel   10.21865394512105
you said before that you were obliged to leave us monsieur said madame de villefort and you were about to tell us why when your attention was called to some other subject   8.538291534536004
madame de chevreuse evidently went from surprise to astonishment and from astonishment to stupefaction   10.939755792628246
and finally he disappeared in the midst of the tall red herbage which seemed like the bristling mane of an enormous lion   10.821266704974823
he will be delivered to the parliament members of which can of course be bought but even monsieur de mazarin is not rich enough to buy the whole body   10.13790698172384
he is said to be of good family and rich but i never trust to vague assertions   5.7993925484224995
but scarcely had she perceived him then she reseated herself in her armchair and made a sign to her women to resume their cushions and stools and with an air of supreme hauteur said what do you desire monsieur and with what object do you present yourself here   20.773491477792195
if anyone wishes to stop us i will show monsieur de tréville s letter and you will show your leaves of absence   9.48170270333929
nay indeed your excellency   10.921868457741368
no sing it please   11.741893866836726
i do not know   12.925215031781908
yes my lord replied the young man confused   12.536943522219705
and this very nearly ruined the minister   12.855983770651223
but one day the count broke the stock and had then cast the gun aside   13.44960133623668
andrea reached the anteroom beyond the little drawing room   9.93086024895342
yes yes when the campaign is over replied the gascon   18.964846744799118
but whither shall we fly whither escape   17.429798633995617
when   6.406783150534061
murmured mme   10.405686907908784
but as regards myself i can find no merit i possess save that as a millionaire i might have become a partner in the speculations of m   10.960293011343454
but as she withdrew she still held aside the curtain absorbed in the irresistible attraction always exerted by the picture of death so long as it is merely mysterious and does not excite disgust   13.986525219022601
speak then   17.497528131089044
that will not prevent me replied d artagnan if ever i find him   15.719940642098067
and she came back without this casket   5.848403718810811
three months passed and still she wept no news of edmond no news of fernand no companionship save that of an old man who was dying with despair   9.30785528050424
as athos and aramis proceeded and passed different companies on the road they became aware that they were arriving near the field of battle   10.769399459574576
make preparations for departure   18.286620614463217
he is here   11.101853436234022
you confuse me replied athos with his gentlemanly air   14.431983614266558
we have said that athos loved d artagnan like a child and this somber and inflexible personage felt the anxiety of a parent for the young man   8.896953429097714
oh you need not be alarmed you will only have lost him as you have lost your daughter   13.91220761277558
why you killed him   6.074995611474788
then our gascon extending his arms drew to him the heads of his three friends till they almost touched one another   17.194963477231575
said porthos   9.189164658249314
monte cristo rang   8.044644461243344
the same silence and then ere the host could oppose his design grimaud seized a pair of pincers he perceived in a corner and forced the bolt   9.419647394162533
like the rats that one by one forsake the doomed ship even before the vessel weighs anchor so all the numerous clerks had by degrees deserted the office and the warehouse   17.481898238483705
the cardinal folded and sealed his letter   15.387548694783272
but has one ever seen such a wild fellow continued he making himself a mazarinist and helping to arrest broussel   16.148055608018
he saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law and perfectly well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate decked with his official scarf as to address a petition to some cold marble effigy   15.019573531842717
de saint méran wished to sell it   15.282646088330432
yes said monte cristo   11.071416906822273
well   18.9858172844593
i promise you not to persuade them to stay   9.23312256199218
and when is this to be consummated   8.29759403513764
the people were infuriated   13.353042388241722
i am come sir to ask your advice   11.995508011637044
have you not taken a bastion   12.05553986015709
the messenger was unmoved   7.206419257859422
three hundred francs   9.818049293694111
franz had already made seven or eight similar excursions to the colosseum while his less favored companion trod for the first time in his life the classic ground forming the monument of flavius vespasian   6.671584051449597
and yet notwithstanding he could still hear her cry and threaten   8.543094984314724
athos and aramis looked at him inquiringly   13.17662353928857
chapter xxvi   16.509032108532818
this is what had taken place we have seen that it was not of his own free will but on the contrary very reluctantly that the monk attended the wounded man who had been recommended to him in so strange a manner   15.869319255242916
almost all the armed pilgrims that went to the holy land took for their arms either a cross in honor of their mission or birds of passage in sign of the long voyage they were about to undertake and which they hoped to accomplish on the wings of faith   14.851192829176515
they have some business with you i think from what they told me the day before yesterday   5.874734813869654
and what is that proof   14.390713080679502
repeated monte cristo   16.482853599373577
cæsar gave way before such cogent reasoning and the cardinals were consequently invited to dinner   13.91108286616338
a tailor said the host   13.947370384344616
see what confidence i have in you   8.810190361094971
you have lived three years in paris   12.473845691073883
because i sigh when thinking of someone i am leaving   5.942424254295612
i know that he is in high favor with charles i   10.718611996711578
the opinion of athos was that d artagnan had lost his letter in the skirmish   13.206798459879955
how many men does your eminence wish to escort you   17.381765222415204
he can turn his coat inside out   14.191388442881962
a woman of mark   14.802785319424078
at ten o clock the guns of the louvre announced the departure of the king and then a movement similar to that of trees in a stormy wind that bend and writhe with agitated tops ran though the multitude which was compressed behind the immovable muskets of the guard   3.937913210862204
as soon as she heard the cannon which announced the fatal event she had ordered the anchor to be weighed   14.408612217456536
no tomorrow   26.525392920377087
bertuccio will show me a light   21.673653903714353
chapter v   5.363522016095091
on a word from the man who rode at the side of the carriage it stopped   13.834815129773268
ah   13.755528371758768
but outside your orders there is a service you can render me   13.494884936439274
it seemed to me that i was in a dream and as it always happens in a dream i felt myself riveted to the spot   2.928308835762154
carlini s teeth clenched convulsively   9.27945985953767
i shall beat you   8.204220821333209
both got into albert s coupé   12.884698760570101
how so   14.508361300410673
oh yes exclaimed raoul fixing his glance on one point in the stream splendidly illumined by the setting sun a horse a rider   16.368918919167164
and she slipped a ring from her finger onto d artagnan s   8.982217821259555
mother replied the young man you have special reasons for telling me to conciliate that man   16.142086124962468
you have done right lieutenant said the soldier   8.589646499625646
danglars smiled and seemed to say it is of no consequence   15.549461525160758
tis true madame answered he that my father was a girondin but he was not among the number of those who voted for the king s death   6.58001779959149
oh father father   13.363065825761032
let us examine the enemy s army   6.290224805711594
no replied mousqueton parry kept it   14.013614301136808
if the letter must be written under your censure my faith i renounce the task   10.201890712104143
and twice or three times he even saw the shadow of a person intercept the light   11.148264706180239
cried d artagnan quite bewildered at this unexpected announcement   7.68465227283094
and fear much that he finds our home but a dull one   16.546725318057522
listen said he   13.068760649620364
peppino was a handsome young man of four or five and twenty bronzed by the sun   10.99183376705617
well   11.998741099907
adieu   13.067236078026518
and till the king and he could take the command of the siege of la rochelle which was determined he had sent monsieur to direct the first operations and had ordered all the troops he could dispose of to march toward the theater of war   17.771417008523557
bravo   14.529575059971751
there was a great murmur of voices which continued to draw near amid which she seemed to hear her own name pronounced   12.170250036018935
he is badly off very badly   16.222717451299285
sir   15.28450361288997

coquenard did not seem to observe it   19.62999208254987
then he ran to one of the cupboards in valentine s room which had been transformed into a medicine closet and taking from its silver case a small bottle of nitric acid dropped a little of it into the liquor which immediately changed to a blood red color   6.3140536014176

the wife of athos we have now to search for athos said d artagnan to the vivacious aramis when he had informed him of all that had passed since their departure from the capital and an excellent dinner had made one of them forget his thesis and the other his fatigue   16.662303634879507

cried mademoiselle paulet bitterly he   15.367751320020819
a cloud passed over his brow as he said no monsieur i do not know the writing and yet it is tolerably plain   8.242885398504642
i had risked my life and favor to see you but for a second   10.960952148490279
he is asleep   14.86390327331788
he seemed eager to put a question which yet he dared not ask   6.613934105647597
today you serve napoleon and you ought to protect him it is equally your duty   15.426255956080984
villefort stood with his mouth half open quite stupefied   15.118871854084592
coquenard rose and took from a buffet a piece of cheese some preserved quinces and a cake which she had herself made of almonds and honey   16.42895031988126
and then you ungrateful being you are not pleased to see an old friend   11.587082358519448

was faria deceived as to his treasure or was all the world deceived as to faria   17.8184430069705
that is not in listening to the music but in paying visits and conversing   13.180510843275371
d artagnan said nothing but after having gnawed the flower stalk he began to bite his nails   13.348273549900215
it is a family affair   12.532565532689267
his voice was stifled by sobs   12.34618320694114
probably not   8.426027455893617
that s it   11.855137935973039
i think i may venture to ask you this favor   12.311817205860054
in his impatience he arrived before the beginning of the performance   18.754327710125494
and i du barthois added porthos   10.161228376232645
d artagnan pursued his way   7.454324691818052
cried the cardinal with astonishment   9.536496294752535
well now that will do wonderfully well said athos   21.265752862318855
i am happy to see m   15.067291824610077

you will not be pitiless   15.488771960477969
my friend she is a woman   12.033408728422229
now especially did he find the description valentine had given of the interior of the house useful to him   14.48653092413753
said he   8.80251043347327
because answered the gascon we were sent porthos and i by cardinal mazarin to fight for cromwell   11.894576037929474
that admiration is on the contrary so great so real madame returned mazarin without noticing the change of language offered to him by the queen that if the king charles i   10.966116482044937
d artagnan passed the day in exhibiting his musketeer s uniform in every street of the camp   20.048699425597235
i have been waiting for a long time to tell him what i think of him   11.778299464699344
bertuccio slightly started   10.509975820958669
you suspect me monsieur de rochefort   4.694872151112309
nevertheless he died of indigestion in spite of his grace said d artagnan   18.203516869332965
he has gone on his road as inexorable as fate and we must seek him somewhere else   13.720672868848412
well then try   16.921834535637917
and now said the duke raising it still six inches higher jump for the king   21.400452209347648
when he closed his eyes he saw myriads of lights dancing before them like the will o the wisps that play about the marshes   9.214052829822213
not the least in the world   15.597768915467306
you are a capital companion d artagnan said he   10.09961181101821
because over this king watched the spirit of another man even as this lamp keeps vigil over this coffin and illumines it   21.75385196998733
go monsieur duke and return often   10.960522537098322
the jeweller smiled   15.232549875082675
said porthos to d artagnan   12.472235962482722
from the apartments on the ground floor might be heard the sound of music with the whirl of the waltz and galop while brilliant streams of light shone through the openings of the venetian blinds   3.009649008603585
what   17.23472031087827
i speak as one who admires you mademoiselle   8.588283306205078
i was no longer in the house where i had dwelt   4.6861065372063875
the monk   10.127007840338736
what do you mean   13.675330092193786
i want a letter that will enable me to reach the king s presence without all the formalities of demanding an audience   12.87142397191132
remember your oath   9.4368734694265
all that the prudent planchet had said to him the preceding evening about the sinister character of the old man recurred to the mind of d artagnan who looked at him with more attention than he had done before   13.960190516237482
he had no longer any doubts as to the nature of the conference   4.9528898542745585
said madame de chevreuse eagerly   21.66421515233172
speak on said aramis   13.41055351977482
a peculiar smile passed over dantès lips   14.80977902856196
cried felton   15.30470271069959
i expected this letter   9.496205264069161
certainly   17.046709760575673
he sent us one of his angels   12.521462395510397
what   13.524270740727916
indeed said the receiver   9.12111268967214
cried d artagnan to him   18.95299158415194
the duke had thrown himself as he was wont to do in moments of dullness and vexation on his bed   13.238667489899257
the beautiful catalane and noble countess had lost both her proud glance and charming smile because she saw nothing but misery around her   16.040647571902266
but what struck everybody was his extreme resemblance to the portrait debray had drawn   12.600184689134398
no other than your friend monte cristo   8.005911562223503
they carried a banner on which could be read this strange device we are seeking our king   13.473207748119217
and he did tell her so much and so well that the poor girl who asked nothing better than to believe him did believe him   10.882169156033672
in a game of tennis for example   18.831996601657167
but unfortunately i must wait   11.385800520372044
come upstairs with me and i will give it to you   9.246308348005503
by the light of a lantern the coadjutor recognized planchet   12.661076721976649
must i let things take their course   17.5422615311356
he stationed himself in a room commanding a view of the street pacing the chamber with restless steps stopping merely to listen from time to time for the sound of approaching wheels then to cast an anxious glance on ali   10.623601723456655
if not as priest then as son   8.959568366557559
i will embrace your knees   12.574563865191381
de tréville s office   20.180232300186738
the young man directed him   10.830358365772977
these faithful guardians seemed unwilling to surrender their trust   11.916199531812953
they looked for m   7.422341628525846
do you know signor pastrini said albert lighting a second cigar at the first that this practice is very convenient for bandits and that it seems to be due to an arrangement of their own   12.32787712762712
this lady was the daughter of nicholas de camus who arrived in paris with twenty francs in his pocket became secretary of state and accumulated wealth enough to divide nine millions of francs among his children and to keep an income of forty thousand for himself   11.806087114371513
asked d artagnan   20.05812691522368
the first is that you will never tell anyone that i have granted the interview   15.417137688333812
sir said he to danglars understand that i do not take a final leave of you   20.67031289222926
but the sound was repeated distinctly enough to convince him of its reality   14.944512697835613
i have killed your chief cucumetto whose dress i now wear   16.408497006333107
yes your excellency   14.841246550306048
oh death death   14.28592952467388
stop said d artagnan   16.169111231583045
asked milady   14.904401348413932
0279m under pretence of being fatigued dantès asked to take the helm   14.28027503983899
then he rang   10.469164802054634
no no oh no   13.564811565842437
they will certainly ask me why i did not invite you   5.973527466693649
mazarin made no reply   10.58254016974555
why does he take my comb   11.96696372085046
well for my part i a bloodthirsty ruffian who can go and stand close to a scaffold in order to have a better view of the king s execution i remain   12.05685708140707
as for her husband he was a strapping fellow of forty or five and forty who had more than once in time of danger given ample proof of his presence of mind and courage   10.215504157414056
he felt almost inclined to cross himself when one of these beings happened to approach him   13.478277212194566
at this moment the door opened and in walked the coadjutor   13.46122231629122
it is noon   14.047430832728477
how great is the power of a woman who has made so courageous a resolution   12.111954656475156
well said the cardinal everybody seems to have passed the evening with you   12.582668889141459
the count looked attentively through every opening in the crowd   10.6942970185182
humph murmured athos it is certainly she   14.388286940380613
where then are you going   16.191316505082227
garters of deerskin worked with a thousand arabesques and a hat whereon hung ribbons of all colors   11.61049734582658
murmured the queen looking uneasily at the cardinal   13.706898848736362
well we shall see   10.618310583925997
debray stretched himself upon a large couch and madame danglars passed into her dressing room with mademoiselle cornélie   10.467008237443206
if the king had desired that the letter should be given to him madame he would have demanded it of you himself   17.029236531643807
franz stopped   15.732512479669143
yes monsieur a most excellent sister   11.50703644334369
you appear to consider this a point of honor and it may be for this reason that you have delayed acknowledging your name   21.095030368844537
the receiver started back   17.488529336214654
bonacieux expected to see milady but she did not return   5.055652359873765
and to all these questions poor kitty forced to put on a pleasant face responded in a stifled voice whose dolorous accent her mistress did not however remark solely because happiness is egotistical   13.440243097508027
listening to the relation of those emotions so fresh and pure the fine noble face of athos betrayed indescribable pleasure   19.295956945780706
said d artagnan who had no doubt the accusation came from milady a woman branded by the justice of the country   13.74275895584793
asked albert   9.50801789097923
if i give you time   4.407523181984624
i hate him   17.44589787198422
attention porthos   10.146084008194215
and the latter begged for two days time to ascertain exactly who would be most likely to give him full particulars   12.085972100701577
you know the marquis of saint méran died a few days after he had set out on his journey to paris and the marchioness a few days after her arrival   13.83093270787767
let us set off   12.53357102144636
and why so   8.492894688013843
are there any others   10.787505847452806
you are decidedly right and we may reach the palazzo by two o clock   9.31483478661291
the young woman extended her stiff white hands towards him   16.886448614090302
and you athos you know something of everything and can be our captain   4.170161825870018
and besides we have a prisoner said athos pointing to raoul   9.220954292523198
she could not get out and had heard all   10.63028377410647
the servant entered just as he had finished   10.500081994013918
oh my dear friend if this be the case if you can no longer weep if your frozen heart be dead if you put all your trust in god then maximilian you are consoled do not complain   7.052773721505232
the nostrils of the horse were no longer above water and the rider who had lost the reins in struggling fell with his head back and his arms extended   10.43695566217896
noirtier s room was opened like all the rest   18.889467629263823
as to conditions you would soon see how moderate and reasonable we are   10.541804946038713
when they were seated in the carriage the president reminded the general of his promise to allow his eyes to be bandaged to which he made no opposition   13.534220097184072
than if i had taken queen mab or titania as my companion   16.80288000993063
yes he has not much to complain of   13.512077371584388
at dessert d artagnan reposed in his chair crossed one leg over the other and lounged about like a man perfectly at his ease   7.790394766239682
it was thus that pinelli the famous sculptor had commenced   10.946446150134527
this time the musketeers had an adversary who was worthy of them   16.30632115768987
begone then   13.458176530067934
don t deny it   7.824817687369551
you may believe me if you will   17.637953101022276
the agitation of caderousse became extreme and large drops of perspiration rolled from his heated brow   12.455228338187737
here is his letter said d artagnan and he presented the note to his comrades   14.73745118994215
albert rose and took his hat   12.742632697537202
madame de villefort now took her part in the conversation and added we thought this news would possess an interest for you sir who have always entertained a great affection for valentine   12.708537736570147
asked the baroness   9.982510559929992
you can never have so much as i wish you   10.926599813626241
certain replied grimaud   7.940800517144979
blind fools   9.261630851643828
and certainly he must have had a most wonderful escape   9.506374808709385
tall and well proportioned as an ancient gladiator and muscular as a spartan he walked for a quarter of an hour without knowing where to direct his steps actuated by the sole idea of getting away from the spot where if he lingered he knew that he would surely be taken   15.840753427297338
he made a sign which i understood but the king s guards must have noticed it and held themselves on guard   14.344851691425827
in fact the evening before a fever had seized him in the midst of the parliament while he was holding his bed of justice   11.070756353815579
said the prisoner sitting down in her armchair with a smile of disdain   12.19592885348826
save the queen   13.233882303023108
are you going   14.88813374644166
one is weak   13.080599764311518
may we inquire what is this recipe   10.336087982097144
early on the following morning he commenced the removal of his riches and ere nightfall the whole of his immense wealth was safely deposited in the compartments of the secret locker   11.24795738118367
then he carried haydée to her room resigned her to the care of her attendants and returning to his study which he shut quickly this time he again copied the destroyed will   14.439974539373672
this dungeon said the concierge was it appears some time ago occupied by a very dangerous prisoner the more so since he was full of industry   6.397487415031232
it would frighten you too much   9.525469996124597
simply the fact that the idea never occurred to me answered dantès   14.299016693518
at length he went to bed fell asleep and had golden dreams   14.834273230780749
one may readily conceive that during these jokes which were intended chiefly to divert athos from the scene which had just taken place the servants with the exception of grimaud were not silent   8.98089555632003
porthos went to the window took a bar in his hands clung to it and bent it like a bow   5.370588764823038
the two combatants had been seen in a position which left no doubt of their intentions   3.842588881296926
having then a keeper like la ramee i should try also to have introduced to him by some friend or other a man who would be devoted to me who would assist me in my flight   6.44615109617739
if they recognize you you are lost   13.700082298923837
eh   21.6502596717866
close by here monsieur replied the notary a little beyond passy   7.282374511568292
i am glad they please you   13.47066319233482
undoubtedly madame said d artagnan taking the document and bowing this is a noble reward   14.148963580871714
some nabob from india was his comment   12.336718499293962
do you believe in apparitions   11.657795875155625
well like all paris i shall be there too said the count   5.397741491625762
and now gentlemen i wish you good morning said monte cristo   3.3445463253801826
they are only four   19.534074785755788
do you know said porthos that to twist that damned milady s neck would be a smaller sin than to twist those of these poor devils of huguenots who have committed no other crime than singing in french the psalms we sing in latin   9.756877700639187
he knew he must call assistance   13.085379937800608
it was the date of that strange adventure interrupted madame de chevreuse   14.55724041749065
morrel who did not know his crime as cashier into a spanish bank   15.107230929220336
viscount said athos to raoul as he entered you will conduct my lord as far as his hotel and permit no one to approach him   8.688399086994163
and you porthos do you only wear such a fine golden baldric to suspend a sword of straw from it   8.706344321934669
the host approached with hesitation   14.520544364026417
walk back and forth till some news of our friends reaches us or till we are visited by a good idea   16.478613522618442
i speak to you when i can catch you   12.68653534626148
then he destroyed the second portion assured that if the first were seized no one would be able to discover its real meaning   14.75348688077996
andrea arose   13.49236306031236
let the man go d artagnan   15.116800008589767
my ship is ready and had you not come i must have set off without you for general cromwell expects my return impatiently   12.850923178407074
and so as we have said the iron gate leading into the kitchen garden had been closed up and left to the rust which bade fair before long to eat off its hinges while to prevent the ignoble glances of the diggers and delvers of the ground from presuming to sully the aristocratic enclosure belonging to the mansion the gate had been boarded up to a height of six feet   11.990676312384455
he s in the bastile   13.407617353397425
asked blaisois   6.841431421644647
we are about to leave this evening continued mazarin   14.657942287495116
the young officer preserved silence   17.50013681256477
she went to the palais replied the steward   7.997849322329789
when the transports of the two lovers were calmer milady who had not the same motives for forgetfulness that d artagnan had was the first to return to reality and asked the young man if the means which were on the morrow to bring on the encounter between him and de wardes were already arranged in his mind   8.142542080900508

at the moment he re entered the sentinel who guarded the door put his head through the opening curious as to what the king was doing   12.212728594842186
ordinarily prisoners were interrogated in their cells   14.2909236670121
i am all that is left to her belonging to my poor renée whom you have so soon forgotten sir   17.90386130268469
the law chapter 100   17.952588502368688
what do you say athos to that proposition   23.130430558798594
replied the young officer   7.729073607980066
bertuccio interrupted the count   16.829827127896298
of madame d aiguillon   20.842291190630768
after having failed in poetry monsieur de beaufort tried drawing   13.024752519133415
one of these belonged to the archbishop of paris and was at that time the abode of his niece the duchess of longueville   6.917589723913056
and any person who considered her attentively might have observed the traces of recent tears in her eyes   7.043441136239968
athos who was very expert in all bodily exercises passed with d artagnan to the opposite side and challenged them   13.984873762224908
there he dined heartily and again inquired about the young gentleman who was in advance of them   6.771163338572819
de tréville who held out his hand to him   16.889146447435216
do you wish to play the braggart with an unarmed man   10.397193247554789
and prince cavalcanti sang with mademoiselle eugénie yesterday   6.1250855471493075
you have found that out have you my lord   15.862634233235035
and la ramee found him so pale and fatigued that he inquired whether he was ill   13.096690461558456
towards the house the chestnut trees we have before mentioned rose high above the wall without in any way affecting the growth of other luxuriant shrubs and flowers that eagerly dressed forward to fill up the vacant spaces as though asserting their right to enjoy the boon of light and air   12.362318104552482
and they both set out for paris   7.347727605019738
one plan occurred to me continued albert   9.765936515890516
this advice appeared good to the future chancellor   12.921459617092376
revenge for instance   13.632325944281206
you have been served as you desire monsieur for you were warned just now and i now again warn you   13.66310195416116
dantès inserted the sharp end of the pickaxe between the coffer and the lid and pressing with all his force on the handle burst open the fastenings   14.357879191178444
monte cristo stepped into it with his two friends   6.255499187112959
you have all the appearance of being cowardly enough to lift your hand against a woman   9.272545890723752
do you understand me   6.515498431247977
the count who perceived that m   7.910119773475964
by what sign to morrow shall we be able to distinguish friends from foes   7.302769470947777
then paused with hand in mid air   7.638035027717044
asked the queen well madame replied the valet i followed them as far as the gates   13.51276937394191
well all that was useless   16.680166469675218
since he had been taken he had not uttered a word so that it was not known to what country he belonged   8.221413457015473
will you give me a lesson the day after to morrow   4.497362485850644
follow me then said the abbé as he re entered the subterranean passage in which he soon disappeared followed by dantès   9.360956478342912
but these friends themselves tremble before the cardinal   13.001716898730617
noble natures never lose courage nor good stomachs their appetites   9.303299825272285
the duc de beaufort   18.10011724537635
yes a small declivity to the south yonder on my hill gives me twenty hogsheads   11.417899235842647
1   16.700174902455245
she is in the prison of nantes   10.10914899027752
de busigny was the first to come and shake athos by the hand and acknowledge that the wager was lost   10.617549020018817
the morcerfs are depending on this union   8.723560615016858
asked athos   11.414686381467995
50261m i am he whom you sold and dishonored i am he whose betrothed you prostituted i am he upon whom you trampled that you might raise yourself to fortune i am he whose father you condemned to die of hunger i am he whom you also condemned to starvation and who yet forgives you because he hopes to be forgiven i am edmond dantès   10.311242607204575
we have given ourselves to you   12.832226862510472
the assassin finding that he no longer cried out lifted his head up by the hair   14.202399101122126
go and promote digestion by working said the procurator gravely   12.980011917808657
d artagnan rattled the gold in his pockets   13.304994373584114
bonacieux   12.243236537751535
as soon as the noise of the hoofs was lost in the distance d artagnan remounted the bank of the stream and scoured the plain followed by his three friends directing their course as well as they could guess toward london   16.293274947587157
said debray advancing towards the back staircase   16.362856233518283
i make no doubt a glass of good wine would be acceptable this dreadfully hot day   14.940341187668752
carmela looked all around her but not one of the guests had a costume similar to her own or those of her companions   11.409542177555407
oh you encourage me and something tells me there placing his hand on his heart that i ought to have no secret from you   11.992161330638403
yes but girls tell each other secrets without being particularly intimate   7.970794158990868
just now   16.350474468950516
arrived at the end of the lane d artagnan turned to the left   11.281488040636484
my dear d artagnan said aramis don t be too angry with me i beg   6.9260864893103
long live the queen   12.505926918306555
m   14.507177039783384
monte cristo resumed the perusal of the letter and who only needs one thing more to make him happy   11.595524158408555
therefore athos had invented the phrase family affair   7.014509329433646
listen   13.355664391117054
asked d artagnan seeing a look of vexation on the face of the youth   14.801877470810474
clear sky swift flitting boats and brilliant sunshine disappeared   19.257521444369395
and then resumed d artagnan to this decrepitude is probably added poverty for he must have neglected the little that he had and the dirty scoundrel grimaud more taciturn than ever and still more drunken than his master stay planchet it breaks my heart to merely think of it   10.490866491611433
ah yes said a light horseman with a glass of brandy in his hand which he sipped slowly   5.736681502152679
cried villefort then i was not deceived   14.146611109352023
art thou a messenger from god   11.305921823055868
it is there you are to take up your quarters   12.633495323790994
but no one on board saw him and the vessel stood on another tack   11.35039068539121
he bowed politely to the baroness familiarly to danglars and affectionately to monte cristo   9.94669177964326
chapter lxvii   7.865320433030554
speak to your mother open your dear eyes and look on me once again   6.62672118748816
the unknown fixed on the young man one of those looks which penetrate into the depth of the heart and thoughts   11.276511061494409
to return when d artagnan and his friends happy and triumphant should have received from the queen the reward they had well acquired by the services they had rendered her these were devouring ideas that a woman like milady could not endure   11.160570928130083
cried the young man why should you not live   17.567000861244388
no signature   19.114671069628756
the baron finding himself disarmed took two or three steps back but in this movement his foot slipped and he fell backward   11.133948697409053
perhaps said anne   7.877868165438605
the dark space frightened her   12.062357550421863
president i can furnish the committee of inquiry into the conduct of the lieutenant general the count of morcerf in epirus and in macedonia with important particulars   14.349774576592264
m   11.558286029122579
d artagnan his eye moist with gratitude though beaming with joy went back to athos whom he found still at table contemplating the charms of his last glass of malaga by the light of his lamp   15.048197629250712
but with our four horses we may bring back our three friends if we should have the good fortune to find them living   15.792229547336001
no replied athos   12.570783879023187
ah   10.073599019061328
inquired the young man who was in command in the chief s absence   13.573013955255167
aramis reflected for a minute and then said coloring will it be really rendering you a service d artagnan   20.88153621397981
that is the name of a mountain cried the poor questioner who began to lose his head   13.018319409493019
i thought you did   10.832087724133762
what is that   14.810380206936715
for what   6.854029888091209
this horrible place contained fifty cells   5.424069873589706
but only as no   13.575069230513762
asked the king   20.375929059921972
that s agreed   11.630438404745362
as bertuccio with a respectful bow was moving away the count called him back   16.034575278991277
felton quite bewildered almost mad stood speechless   13.849089514660514
demanded d artagnan   13.423672628587568
still more he has lifted the corner of her mask that shield with which she covered herself and which rendered her so strong   6.119301435686674
ah you call yourself oriental a levantine maltese indian chinese   11.558291368952048
what the truly guilty   10.275894033758421
the stranger waved his hand and continued to descend   9.53692153574992
no my guardian replied raoul blushing   13.149312930674604
this promise completed poor kitty s consolation   12.38199203401215
therefore instead of condemning him for his intimacy with outlaws you must give me leave to excuse any little irregularity there may be in such a connection   13.321941127249115
said bonacieux protruding his lip   14.05598671148012
meanwhile albert had revived and continuing to read he threw back his head saying florentin is your horse fit to return immediately   13.841649798701381
i wish i could say as much for i do conceal myself   6.712354198232055
tell them said morrel in a hoarse voice tell them that i am her betrothed   17.908881496671334
1   10.904567483286453
the one who gave me being and the other who conferred knowledge and intelligence on me   3.6360152375837753
you can not beat me said he   11.99710760629168
you are acquainted with the scriptures   10.980471836597571
parbleu   14.32934623836014
however ill the king might sleep m   6.749256309827409
mercédès came again and she found him so altered that she was even more anxious than before to have him taken to her own home   11.76561652745747
ah sir said the minister of police to villefort as they left the tuileries you entered by luck s door your fortune is made   9.919041586140176
well sir resumed danglars after a brief silence i will endeavor to make myself understood by requesting you to inform me for what sum you propose to draw upon me   12.481764930820226
that nobleman was you   15.606978864500542
charles was perceived through the door lying dressed upon his bed at the head of which parry was seated reading in a low voice a chapter from the bible   10.618752693006012
destroy him utterly and quit him not until he is dead   10.703810794169703
the word is rather hard   12.566343509891196
yes   10.134328555480657
they arrived thus screened by the lining of the trench till they came within a hundred paces of the bastion   13.64100178980944
de tréville s tone of voice that he was very angry about something   18.32497324089228
never commit such an imprudence as to try to escape except in your dreams   7.512121497043044
danglars wishes and at the same time to pay all due deference to his position in society donned his uniform of lieutenant general which he ornamented with all his crosses and thus attired ordered his finest horses and drove to the rue de la chaussée d antin   7.947353995249382
why not sir   8.490333498180124
thinking this one of importance he sent for me but not finding me took upon himself to give the necessary orders for arresting the accused party   9.420282229267965
but only relate the fact that he shuddered and stepped back suddenly   8.6242964710565
he looked to see if the dish of beans was still there   9.50478055813294
exclaimed m   5.533400819104272
i yet feel his warm tears on my face and his were not the only tears shed for many who witnessed our meeting wept also   13.143268468228351
do you think so   15.66251699955023
then continued milady then i collected all my strength   11.630160137184172
indeed   15.080679955106795
cried porthos   12.016957836448887
i can not hear such things said as that   15.98018704035053
then he added aloud did he make any resistance   5.2170270618940044
do you not recognize me unhappy child   14.923530775411104
you look to the one below   11.26302714405184
he saw nothing unless that by traces of smoke others had before him attempted the same thing and like him in vain   10.422828161795852
but however distant from the court we may be however remote from the interests of the world we may be placed we have very sad examples of what you have related   12.36293147179154
heaven grant that this may not be visited upon him   7.79443158632621
he spoke in a voice of the procureur general with the rigid inflexibility of neck and shoulders which caused his flatterers to say as we have before observed that he was the living statue of the law   11.240736867356235
i recognize monsieur de flamarens   17.361298890916714
by good luck it had not been extinguished   15.858461591260198
de villefort staggered and buried his head in the bed   12.370074987269732
there is no mule cried he to whom this question was addressed   8.845630389380442
and what is your business   15.195581673871
i have seen the bastille   15.498319156580866
philosophers may well say and practical men will always support the opinion that money mitigates many trials   19.59491146349107
i could not see the expression of his countenance but i felt the arm tremble upon which my hand was placed   19.159525188878142
she desired me to give them to you   8.01812402900378
obey laporte do you not see i have no time to lose   14.499310268338661
tis you then my dear count cried gondy offering his hand   14.629302845348414
and he went out   10.892520598166415
danglars acquitted himself like a man placed between two dangerous positions and who is rendered brave by fear   7.8939090190060135
he checked by degrees the speed of his horse and went on his head drooping as if in deep thought   13.16802475734345
the former dantès proposed to augment the latter to remedy   7.658987619692696
how thankfully will he acknowledge that to you alone he owes the existence of his wife and child   12.804962939357106
armentières on the banks of the lys   9.696611179098078
parry had not quitted his master and since his condemnation had not ceased to weep   17.519060267792216
go away now mouston   10.546007906204366
true said porthos   14.183702832277486
how kind you are exclaimed the young man pressing his guardian s hand   13.635755856951137
villefort also rang   7.3338818540929855
meanwhile the queen every hour had been sending for d artagnan   16.37422402957118
why your excellency returned the landlord chuckling and rubbing his hands with infinite complacency i think i may take upon myself to say i neglect nothing to deserve the support and patronage of the noble visitors to this poor hotel   9.10381518464206
sky blue velvet breeches fastened above the knee with diamond buckles   7.984569648137555
it was time   12.76808563665637
three of them stopped after an hour s gallop and one fell down   15.258505144629098
asked julie   18.611738558577983
in about the space of a second a private door opened and ali appeared bringing two chibouques filled with excellent latakia   15.476725052167723
i am not condemning you for this monsieur baptistin   11.128567799607833
asked d épinay   12.767654768292998
then listen said he   14.182705244391876
place a hundred around the king and with the remainder sweep away this mob for me   10.048850673798805
we have that sir replied bernouin   12.936639901018506
franz replied that he had left him at the moment they were about to extinguish the moccoli and that he had lost sight of him in the via macello   16.336337429934453
but i do not precisely recollect the date of the day   15.082835699586742
14 besides the rowers the boat contained only the women my father mother selim and myself   14.79661720789311
i will answer for nothing   11.344351964440943
but my reverend replied aramis a little amazed by the shower of arguments that poured upon his head   17.331479071662095
exactly sir   10.213328287311002
what are the wishes of his eminence   13.461817000737543
it is magnificent   12.939082729566817
at this moment a shriek was heard that seemed to come from the river   14.66368697433032
there s no court now   10.446738156679583
and at this word the smile on the cardinal s lips assumed an expression of hatred of which his mild countenance seemed incapable   12.054846720385012
but less preoccupied by that pretty face than d artagnan he had fancied he saw a second head a man s head inside the carriage   13.031119874980252
full of this idea villefort s face became so joyous that when he turned to dantès the latter who had watched the change on his physiognomy was smiling also   9.831870689446248
well my lord four men resolved to save her   18.34216530043019
they are looking at us   3.174718374321621
no you will lose it for you are going to alter your correspondent s message   6.554533699448928
chapter lxv   11.35819383880574
come then   10.750753401772878
i taught my arm to slay my eyes to behold excruciating sufferings and my mouth to smile at the most horrid spectacles   11.401350288047936
well i acknowledge it annoys me knowing your connection with the morcerf family to see him throw himself in the way   6.5859281970979
none of her women accompanied her   14.14331571884095
said the englishman with an expression of curiosity which a close observer would have been astonished at discovering in his phlegmatic countenance   13.927673297357872
and with these words he disappeared behind one of the tapestried portières   17.978224753482667
oh mine replied d artagnan was not a man   11.590322049244959
and as we are in haste to rejoin the prince s army we must continue our journey   10.068312438773424
exceedingly replied franz   13.882249350922866
bonacieux dead and d artagnan in a swoon   15.728961870263753
then resuming the subject of their previous conversation she said and so you really believe it was your mysterious count of monte cristo that gained the prize   16.53319555144414
who could intercept us on such a night as this pitch dark when one does not see more than twenty yards before one   11.466427477704057
one of them was called the chevalier d artagnan   5.789920852757586
besides the harness of your bucephalus and mine   8.260983223292506
de tréville calling him back   13.777303464074762
i thank thee i thank thee   21.612396591704332
you are wrong morrel   13.901182243690466
but they had all been pensioned or had passed on to some other employment   13.653441438084897
d avrigny   4.514526823720948
but the count was too curious to let bertuccio off from this little journey   5.888788745654637
therefore i shall not get into a passion with them   10.968209947394007
said danglars   16.731071478674973
30145m oh very simply   11.012600319510742
so my dear aramis say no more about it and let us prepare to submit to destiny   8.686508926804247
and of what did he die   12.05670425792198
but let me hear this second proof which you yourself own to be absurd   17.0232692371764
but this sufficed for jacopo who instinctively felt that edmond had a right to superiority of position a superiority which edmond had concealed from all others   6.941200165524038
i say that he doesn t suit me at all said porthos and that i feel a strong itching to follow aramis s advice   10.761742975916649
you will be assassinated   14.949653184148085
my friend here monsieur du vallon shares my gratitude for he was particularly hungry   14.0860621148681
m   12.365573944374582
but then all the ideas of vengeance which he had brought with him had completely vanished   14.296367624413216
ah madame said monte cristo you should not talk thus   5.861042714602087
he rode on convinced that in this direction he would gain intelligence of the fugitive   15.439042746220029
is it not amusing to see them both on the same table   8.268408118526002
in three days m   10.719112382494298
come in my dear john said lord de winter come in and shut the door   12.400128882636306
he exclaimed   12.940872489458746
the father of m   10.326979586052968
planchet dismounted and went straight up to lubin who did not at all remember him and the two lackeys began to chat with the best understanding possible   10.25804196920927
hush   12.60750248359113
the count was seated between madame de villefort and danglars   11.815654452365285
oh as to his name i know nothing about it   11.647418315753075
after this little scene charles threw himself into the saddle and turning to athos aramis and winter said now gentlemen i am at your service   12.229118972687422
do you recognize me   10.487000527891889
it is now my turn to dress myself   11.969792238575224
murmured d artagnan and to think that we are compelled to leave him   7.661264516388844
oh how beautiful you are thus   15.131602984926015
sir said the notary whose interest had been greatly excited and who had resolved on publishing far and wide the account of this extraordinary and picturesque scene what appeared so impossible to me an hour ago has now become quite easy and practicable and this may be a perfectly valid will provided it be read in the presence of seven witnesses approved by the testator and sealed by the notary in the presence of the witnesses   12.90761948581567
twice a day he cast out through the barred aperture the provisions his jailer brought him at first gayly then with deliberation and at last with regret   5.8240365258001034
as for raoul he remained bewildered with what he had seen having been forbidden by d artagnan to leave the room until the tumult was over   17.090029053493538
yes since you have such a good memory   7.892727142626186
having crossed paris it passed through the faubourg du temple then leaving the exterior boulevards it reached the cemetery   7.624865518273521
comminges glanced at d artagnan with the envious look with which every courtier sees a new favorite spring up   14.659636172013602
the prisoner started and bit his lips   14.622666004293793
since then monsieur de beaufort has become an enemy of the state   9.662915134699292
and what sort of revenge would you take   15.830223497716835
have you had another fall at the bourse   19.212014895762657
you have promised him that i shall live   11.365067056423033
i promise it   8.875691487735695

in five minutes three were slightly wounded one on the hand another on the ear by the defender of the stair who himself remained intact a piece of skill which was worth to him according to the rules agreed upon three turns of favor   10.861598569097621
pardieu   16.53926226731697
the cabman joyfully pocketed the sum and turned back on his road to paris   19.558699968838884
but the brand of france   20.15508031706633
athos and aramis were beginning to close their eyes which they half opened when their companion came in again   15.356208981984173
but perhaps you have never loved   18.772159964632507
and what cares he for that replied gaetano with a laugh or any authorities   13.790604923473015
i shall not find amongst them such great hearts as yours   12.747300267170269
but such as we are we have experienced bitter sorrows   12.920792717656248
no my lord   15.412160306031186
my good friend said albert i beg pardon for my intrusion but i was anxious to know from your own mouth if your master was really out or not   11.004337622407977
since you left toulon what have you lived on   12.63620189531836
i am grateful to you for the sacrifice said aramis   17.296431572844025
the next morn broke off the coast of aleria   8.815511667971437

well said milady i have not seen our gascon this evening   12.420803555965357
as he approached he seemed to recognize the features of this individual   5.075943148285288
he recalled a bit of advice which athos had once given him and made his horse rear   11.70085736416407
we have a hundred thousand francs or thereabouts loaned on their securities and we are a little uneasy at reports that have reached us that the firm is on the brink of ruin   13.555773104896446
but who perpetrated that joke let me ask   14.426856860547105
have i not told you so gentlemen   11.226974275640696
this person walked along the terrace which was ornamented with flowers   9.226220516376209
ah   11.065215933825625
yes   11.346362025291711
there is no providence all comes by chance   11.443582001045147
i needed nothing less than that consideration my dear d artagnan to persuade myself to adopt the role of jailer   4.204375000870272
perhaps you would contest his right to that title madame   17.25080285112186
this is the name of the lower class   10.256592934286767
blaisois was in a state of great excitement   11.83515283800452
exclaimed the man in the cloak suddenly expressing himself in french   8.195256742249303
well   13.228054797981093
why then cried milady with an incredible tone of truthfulness you are not his accomplice   15.437381380679014
mordaunt darted to the steps understood all uttered a cry as if his very heart was pierced and fell fainting on the stone steps   10.522431845809217
porthos turned rather pale and drank off a large glass of wine   13.082137089806295
i am much attached to that horse athos   11.565248919311955
the shade of richelieu was mazarin   9.54999684618545
the count told everyone that this adventure had happened during his absence at auteuil and that he only knew what was related by the abbé busoni who that evening by mere chance had requested to pass the night in his house to examine some valuable books in his library   10.311506579091562
i should have taken four reefs in the topsails and furled the spanker   13.271779125900546
oh do not give me credit for this madame   14.98628026398754
de morcerf   14.217205567247392
he asked   11.75601920583012
40160m oh reverend sir   13.910388926754832
it is well as it is   12.433066909990272
my chamber was filled with darkness and obscurity but i made a strong effort to penetrate this darkness and obscurity   14.832961998108473
if there s any fighting where i m going must i fight   15.13148032185969
besides the words of villefort who seemed to interest himself so much resounded still in his ears like a promise of freedom   9.731326102319816
it is said that the doomed wretch in the deserts of america thus feels the approach of the serpent   6.9308393568944835
so you will say nothing   19.215782914890625
but you will find terrible charges   9.6999374616323
the joy she felt at this discovery was so great she could not conceal it   13.840009282600434
in fact it required all the courage which he concealed beneath his elegant form and polished manners to bear him so far   13.631397225646293
org   13.730568121781152
then his eyes lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused him so long and wretched a captivity   7.360798153870993
the poor girl ventured a glance at d artagnan which said see how i suffer on your account   20.004649878580683
yes   13.019117017312416
i should think a fowl is worth about twelve sous at rome   12.245759357520116
so much the worse for her if she is found   13.967950901267445
at that moment patrick entered the room crying a letter from france my lord   10.236180222820824
he warms me with his rays and it is by his light that i see you nothing more   19.565196844324692
but during my visit to you the day before yesterday sir which you appear to recollect so well replied eugénie i saw you arranging a deposit is not that the term   13.557703591668819
they were innumerable   7.44104214696192
do you remember your father haydée   6.172424055511112
during this time the jeweller made the diamond play and sparkle in the lamplight and the gem threw out jets of light which made him unmindful of those which precursors of the storm began to play in at the windows   13.16263681248357
it is at this moment replied barrois with the same firmness that m   8.429471870295611
take these flowers into the anteroom or dressing room said the viscount   16.032818002519182
external existence then resembles a sleep of which this thought is the dream   14.652897585988427
how sirrah   8.979619828534872
said porthos   5.008779199843656
in something else in something else   1.7409874100462606

let us talk a little said she   8.245083363694704
he had no doubt that it was the messenger from albert   11.391797700977614
said la ramee scratching his head   5.297781462980889
said carlini   10.154595010361646
adieu sir   21.347544326913095
then after a moment of reverie he remembered where he had left d artagnan and porthos and that they must have overheard everything   12.1646714726374
why you are like no   17.91802088646913
that does not prevent replied milady softening her smile so as to give it an angelic expression my being alone or being persecuted   10.902867533816737
the road to picardy   4.500519690130431
still more he talks seriously about the matter puts on a white tie and speaks of his family   14.689388502285528
i went on first fortunately   13.850612798108894
why then didn t you reply   9.580241766716647
m   8.731283661560742
this young man was alarmed by the appearance of every new face for every new face might be that of a new creditor come in anxiety to question the head of the house   9.427084633092017
the first he comes to   10.692015359806808
just so   8.025924005811087
in the bosom of this corpse was plunged a poniard the gold hilt of which shone in the moonbeams   13.60022200563969
m   12.363500858896721
felton did not enter   9.460165090365711
at your ball   11.613672075461277
this is a very unhoped for conclusion of a very disagreeable affair   6.650895409034677
as happy as possible   11.214689755123677
m   12.316317592206868
ah ah   9.066202631263703
adieu paris adieu   14.326955522625102
who   20.964471779838476
and mounting his horse mousqueton rode off down the avenue on the grass at a hand gallop   13.331241157370565
said mordaunt with a terrible smile   16.025546412506003
i will do nothing of the kind   20.23043294119274
de winter fell back in a chair as though struck by a thunderbolt and in vain attempted a reply   13.98910628640672
oh i remember   18.748766295046995
porthos   10.608015586086788
besides this time my visit has a motive   7.070801714239166
on his return to the cathedral d artagnan saw bazin who was conversing with the sacristan   11.207785590868363
murmured the girl leave me my mother   10.3842827096464
close to the hedge the steps stopped   9.621432293821885
quiet was at length restored   7.9616522361470405
the blaze illumined the sea for a hundred paces around   12.259814310000017
danglars however who now made his appearance accompanied by caderousse effectually confirmed the report stating that he had recently conversed with m   9.738660929472603
take the hundred pistoles   9.650193348705818
he knew me that man did and did not doubt an instant   14.558866039315387
her words were rapid incoherent unintelligible for the burning weight of grief almost stopped her utterance   15.303655791947751
what monsieur   8.638374644347891
as franz spoke he heard the sound of a door turning on its hinges and almost immediately afterwards the tapestry was drawn aside and the owner of all these riches stood before the two young men   10.825671233952658
marseilles resounded with their well earned praises   3.9689216273144847
he will allow you an income of 50 000 livres per annum during the whole time of your stay in paris   6.774506495052705
my commands are ordinarily short clear and precise   14.656857593446514
one of the windows was broken the door of the chamber had been beaten in and hung split in two on its hinges   9.339419711406444
they like to unite their fortunes   9.417355835810055
the floors were covered with the richest carpets turkey could produce   15.092130449074528
but just think there are paltry country squires who have all some title or another and pretend to go back as far as charlemagne or at least to hugh capet   14.28266299073049
but two or three scratches made by the gascon s blade terrified them   11.61991357478494
it was too insignificant an occurrence to delay people so eager to get on   9.755086375428291
you cursed host   16.89893504713774
yes go   21.563104161188974
noirtier left the room when he had finished with the same calmness that had characterized him during the whole of this remarkable and trying conversation   11.272533038326632
oh you do not mean that said he   11.80154022211008
no said she i do not remember it just at this moment   17.43635971590116
while she seemed to experience an almost childlike delight in watching it her eager animated looks contrasting strongly with the utter indifference of her companion who during the whole time the piece lasted never even moved not even when the furious crashing din produced by the trumpets cymbals and chinese bells sounded their loudest from the orchestra   12.397472670783243
i said porthos i am entirely of d artagnan s opinion   18.206500075570723
poor fellow   12.257709750001265
yes said porthos that is a duchess of my acquaintance whom i have great trouble to meet on account of the jealousy of her husband and who sent me word that she should come today to this poor church buried in this vile quarter solely for the sake of seeing me   12.47608857164158
very good   9.724027084289688
do not be alarmed said beauchamp   3.829121461809793
maximilian leaped at one bound into his crop of lucern which he began to pull up in the most ruthless way under the pretext of being occupied in weeding it   9.056473063883157
in fact the sack of la rochelle and the assassination of three of four thousand huguenots who allowed themselves to be killed would resemble too closely in 1628 the massacre of st   15.089201714388057
monsieur du vallon yonder is rich and has forty thousand francs yearly so he does not care about money   13.753615334865085
that of the patrol going their rounds   22.44335288470812
a knot of straw in the hat   8.02618692442604
the sound of his voice was at once penetrating and melodious   10.000577502324093
and he threw himself weeping on his knees by the side of the bed   10.742213515878255
make the requisite inquiries for a place of this description and when you have met with an eligible spot visit it and if it possess the advantages desired purchase it at once in your own name   11.968001347900723

oh valentine you who have so much influence over your grandpapa try to make him answer soon   4.7277306645861215
an instant after the boat rowed by two men advanced rapidly towards him   4.3366758369168945
at twenty minutes to twelve madame danglars tired of waiting returned home   9.601112896308866
if he were alone in the world he would blow out his brains and there would be an end   8.40976986506097
make the campaign like a handsome true gentleman and think of me who kisses tenderly your black eyes   12.863667249918798
seizing a pen he drew a paper from a secret drawer in his desk and wrote at the bottom of the document which was no other than his will made since his arrival in paris a sort of codicil clearly explaining the nature of his death   17.142550669551447
as for me he added with one of those singular smiles which did not escape the young man when i have completed my affairs in paris i shall go and die in the east   14.836607576586154
grimaud remained with his hand extended   9.787878680392614
he again fainted   10.836100885705733
you live in a manner far superior to many clerks who work ten times harder than you do for their money   11.142713895207953
then as it was difficult to suggest a more reasonable proposal he agreed to it   16.639080794354136
at this moment the clock struck   14.5496092184251
i swear to you i protest oh but god is above   14.328699629892915
lend it to us and go into your house again   20.57865692589055
monte cristo opened the tortoise shell box which the lady presented to him and inhaled the odor of the lozenges with the air of an amateur who thoroughly appreciated their composition   14.047413209792055
he gained a village knocked at the door of the finest house and was received as the wounded are always and everywhere received in france   7.843447719519987
we grow according to our race and our species and we pursue the same lines and often the same uselessness all our lives   11.5064450285213
and yet they refused to buy it   12.761611623176167
ten would have destroyed him   3.8680406294984415
20155m oh i am quite sure   6.50676103320751
his features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he already knew and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them for the first time   15.274838278366296
at length after occupying about an hour in these preparations he opened the door of the room in which the vicomte slept and entered   19.11983230356749
i was going to ask you replied the baroness with a beating heart   10.46888969744331
armentières   10.105958156622226
this evening you said   11.16414967605929
tell her some fine morning an unheard of piece of intelligence some telegraphic despatch of which you alone are in possession   16.010633602666985
so that once in my life i have been as powerful as if heaven had brought me into the world on the steps of a throne   13.742969759216459
here take this purse of a hundred pistoles and pardon me   12.259271377699914
albert recognized the bearer   10.280980307523208
besides as m   16.21197628798794

but as soon as the road began to be more lonely and dark he drew softly nearer so that when they entered the bois de boulogne he found himself riding quite naturally side by side with his master   12.548915260205398
but we can not swim to the shore   5.9754549199345215
unfortunately whether through envy or stupidity all morrel s correspondents did not take this view   14.36847881009089
madame de saint méran whom i once saw was short of slender form and of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament   12.883906601953425
although said villefort it will be a serious thing for valentine to lose her grandfather s fortune i do not think that m   14.904217162493747
remember this tissue of horrors must be supported by the clearest proofs   16.467124755635194

upon this promise d artagnan withdrew and the next day he began service   9.66445593448917
he rose however as they approached   9.998579070200172
and running to a table on which were paper pens and ink she hastily began to write   11.894806930912651

the general drew himself up clinging to the curtain   13.111511755922878
i did so but he excused himself on account of madame de morcerf being obliged to go to dieppe for the benefit of sea air   11.944645347817819
franz d épinay   5.5472665594700254

is he still in a fit   6.787222518532372

our readers will follow us along the only street of this little village and enter with us one of the houses which is sunburned to the beautiful dead leaf color peculiar to the buildings of the country and within coated with whitewash like a spanish posada   15.087826465069766
the cardinal accompanied his majesty from surgères to mauzes   12.626266325827737

behind the head of the bed and concealed by a stone fitting in so closely as to defy all suspicion was a hollow space and in this space a ladder of cords between twenty five and thirty feet in length   18.003321111608827
peeping out from the drapery he could see the rows of halberdiers and musketeers around the scaffold and the first ranks of the populace swaying and groaning like the sea   12.784812331085332
he then recollected that he had not eaten or drunk for four and twenty hours   8.444140896244646
sketch me the plan of that floor as you have done of the ground floor my boy   5.277006637098472

they carried the man to his bed and called grimaud to dress the wound   11.135699894621975
but what are you about there   8.961455700510639
and see here it is said the count   6.9789246668598945
and as i am just now excessively annoyed i shall go from home   8.29380250639387
the count s cheeks became scarlet and he coughed in order to have an excuse for putting his handkerchief to his mouth   11.04293239412957
the concierge therefore heard for the first time that the lodger s name was lucien   17.002788074909333
done   10.344715820432523
the woman kneels on a prie dieu of painted wood and at a short distance from her stands the young girl leaning against a chair weeping   8.149270582213719
he then took peppino aside gave him an order in a low voice and peppino went away taking with him a torch brought with them in the carriage   12.949045468735426
well it is true   8.425007818725945
it cried   10.381596869942452
as to d artagnan afraid of some feint he still stood on the defensive   10.897052803978395
your wounds are so far mortal that without the three drops i gave you you would now be dead   7.775794020153519
f   12.345139731159287

lucien had found time preparatory to the count s arrival to relate many particulars respecting him to madame danglars   4.451774068829197
my wife is at durham and may return at any moment   9.403424979629701
and now said la ramee i must ask your highness s pardon but it seems that monsieur de chavigny is to be away for a few days and he has sent me word that he has certain directions to give me before his departure   12.641954614467394
they ascended five or six more steps and then dantès felt that they took him one by the head and the other by the heels and swung him to and fro   12.847468073793072
do you think then madame replied felton in the same serious voice but with a milder tone do you think i assume the right of preventing a creature from prostrating herself before her creator   16.236029674626025
cried she hastening away with the young man   6.6035140550953235
it is the longest road but certainly the most amusing   15.189467049728767
he who at the moment occupied the upper step kept his adversaries marvelously in check   12.657782508138055
who are you   9.120618591951029
scarcely had they entered when she motioned to franz to assume the seat of honor   9.455788371514624
oh very well replied aramis   18.784245087986527
ah ha   10.872511005676134
morrel seized their hands and opening the door exclaimed in a voice choked with sobs on your knees on your knees he is our benefactor the saviour of our father   14.980138112933899
the marshal was ordinarily very adventurous and was wont to hesitate at nothing   13.133516302395666
they were obliged to stuff at least twenty pounds weight of shot in the small rider s pockets to make him weight   15.104424858642675
d artagnan who for an hour past had been gnawing his nails with impatience was beginning to attack the quick   3.874542675418903
why has she not written to me then   17.39906128221395
they were going to marry their daughter to m   9.700770090035801
the sentinel wanted to repulse him   14.416602828545264
i my lord said the latter i know a man who has rendered great services to a very popular prince and who would make an excellent leader of revolt   16.081498647742592

you will then assume your proper position in society for i will not allow my destiny to overshadow yours   8.447239596946815
perhaps i can render you this slight service also   3.3297598185914836
as the steward had said the notary awaited him in the small salon   12.289477416920734
what you do not know   5.213506851134265
asked porthos   3.758217886927927
50141m mercédès had never known misery   8.10058601194036
in the midst of all this a mask is lifted and as in callot s temptation of st   7.231633544051673
look at england madame   14.49870775901936
but i lay aside that pride before god who has taken me from nothing to make me what i am   12.518595619771771
truly the parisians are idiots   12.306955400656372
he cried you have your promotion and i my barony   3.6933985515909864
a noise was heard in the hall   19.258727055080435
a benefit reproached is an offense committed   6.5028981753704755
shouted the duke   10.098713811262133
a moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawing room and went to open the door himself   9.32034262007658
this appeared to be a favorable opportunity to repair his intrusion   11.83469610645409
your excellency does not require a permit for the island is uninhabited   9.979427492653079
no but somebody has gone in   12.607957356389646
they were scarcely four years old and they made me extremely uneasy on your account   12.88313463487418
the abbé d herblay   15.268113161539844
oh   14.436975348717217
it was a mistake   15.201310119362223
he said nothing   18.632261234587823
oh nothing but that he might get me out of this if he were favorably inclined to me   7.142006912016974
my god   7.714466449970745
cried d artagnan   11.143847805963514
have my valise carried to the muid d amour rue des bourdonnais   9.84667607902985
make way for us planchet said d artagnan in a whisper to him or he will not arrive alive   12.130203922890786
i am then your prisoner   9.117227892188765
young edward   13.254116768164977
he sent for me answered the mercer proudly   19.677847066216778
arrived at the foot of the back stairs he desired them to wait   10.67717331216614
turn chartreux or trappist and relate your secrets but as for me i do not like anyone who is alarmed by such phantasms and i do not choose that my servants should be afraid to walk in the garden of an evening   17.164678742500207
now said the king give the word and let us start   15.019815325714642
but where the devil do you get such horses   13.068645675689941
it is almost dinner time and i had to use no little diplomacy to get rid of my watchful stepmother my too devoted maid and my troublesome brother who is always teasing me about coming to work at my embroidery which i am in a fair way never to get done   14.437209234453125
30251m then you do not speculate   10.338500260081084
all is not then over   12.397611425166543
ay that smells good   11.304970576961617
asked the prince   9.92263458235005
he then heard a noise of something falling and all was silent   15.454436135820131
it was the second time he had been worsted and this time on his own ground   13.586224258905705
as to the man to be depended upon i have him under my hand monsieur said m   13.535034585986352
wait a little   16.824716400676635
he understood that they had described a circle and were bringing him back to rome   9.518416821345546
and you who have seen the whole world will relate your adventures you shall tell us the history of the beautiful greek who was with you the other night at the opera and whom you call your slave and yet treat like a princess   14.100446484435338
d artagnan took off the ring giving it again to athos   14.176522826017651
you pity me little one   11.905938306277974
really you should relate all this aloud you would have the greatest success   13.80772159253669
you   8.571205327070194
really i do not know what i have been thinking of i have positively kept you standing for the last quarter of an hour   7.57944254097606
an expression of intense joy illumined the old man s eyes   20.571107354827497
then if he should forget that visit you would find no inconvenience in reminding him of it   13.51880765632324
therefore i think of sending him away from here   14.171238385612309
and she followed her husband upstairs   7.838081804981002
he had been contented for the convenience of the house to lodge in the fourth story   13.456646104248978
and of what religion are you then madame   10.968957469306888
my father who is a merchant placed me with his correspondent who in turn sent his son to join our house in london   14.846283342627714
it was mordaunt with the order in his hand   9.105925205056922
life is so uncertain that we ought to secure happiness while it is within our reach   12.2803816260483
the man he addressed recoiled with terror and only answered the few words of the musketeer by pointing   8.019209378686831
the carriage rolled rapidly onward   12.7330886104615
and if i deceive you bring me here again i ask no more   6.439824683516656
at the door of the chapel d artagnan felt his courage fall anew and returned to look for athos   17.990747189334435
and that i am authorized to seek for the suspected paper even on the person of your majesty   14.821001972218603
ho   9.73595405732193
gently gently said the old man with a smile   13.835497190109333
he proposed to fernand to accompany him   11.327924512570155
it was there that my father ruined by the revolution and m   10.972823085729269
is it possible whispered franz that you entertain any fear   14.826240386397764
d épinay saw him enter afterwards go out and then re enter with albert and château renaud   7.128197043042945
what we want replied one is to communicate to you the will of his highness   17.53088905260544
is there no merit in repentance   11.448347041735829
the whole of the second story was set apart for maximilian   13.192687128439253
the queen then gave her orders spoke of a banquet which the marquis de villequier was to give to her on the day after the morrow indicated the persons she would admit to the honor of partaking of it announced another visit on the following day to val de grace where she intended to pay her devotions and gave her commands to her senior valet to accompany her   14.191565931193496
a deep silence reigned for a long time in the boat after the fearful scene described   14.059885747839163
cried morrel   11.697929308663802
the punishment   5.847373601878853
but we must first learn what convent she is in   12.49383089611384
on the contrary we shall meet again said mercédès pointing to heaven with solemnity   12.902253259660718
which means that my count of monte cristo is one of those fishermen   11.486139139550918
when he thought the matter over he could by no means account for this generous conduct on the part of thomson french towards him   13.774092980657953
franz assured me replied albert that she was sixty six years old   14.346472452563788
he has already dug up all the garden two or three times to find the famous spring and being unsuccessful he will soon purchase all the contiguous houses   7.456323693488204
i should take the hundred pistoles   10.710224220107815
here he is   19.023053993854493
good heavens   10.019796528891277
by the tower of montlhéry you mean   10.69473046385776
here i am my lord   6.330160706065628
here said caderousse draw me all that on the paper my boy   8.272059743748866
olivain managed in his turn to land after crossing himself repeatedly   8.879114144392375
lord de winter advanced in his turn   6.258426766536842
he called successively at the abodes of athos porthos and aramis   12.075969750206944
i feared it maximilian said she   13.64687043690013
he spoke with so much simplicity that it was evident he spoke the truth or that he was mad   18.21579800052266
what do i think captain   12.701398643777518
what does your chamber open on   10.74169050130107
said caderousse   20.854307912391327
at this instant a bright light shot through the mind of dantès and cleared up all that had been dark and obscure before   7.443503640284508
they are here   12.935409745167783
then remembering the narcotic mixed with the water i had drunk i would not touch that which was placed on the table but filled my glass at a marble fountain fixed in the wall over my dressing table   14.137232321224246
did they speak of me   10.446258893219495
oh but this time perhaps she will follow your advice   16.30432688184139
50253m peppino made a sign and the youth hastily removed the fowl   11.731002605178562
the young man stored in his mind the admonition whilst he admired the delicate tenderness with which it was bestowed   11.043704381230054
his apartment consisted of two small chambers very nicely fitted up in a furnished house the hostess of which still young and still really handsome cast tender glances uselessly at him   14.30944870755587
women   13.225628930855754
leave me i pray you   19.11316538525817
chapter lxviii   15.854182445915663
and that being led to the scaffold he had been saved by an indignant people   17.015318783517202
what is the matter maximilian   15.161129351077857
not one hour of peaceful calm was mine   8.154031445795468
yes yes   18.243587850446783
d artagnan turned around and plainly saw two human forms on planchet s horse   17.60612100060029
now then said the duke and as he spoke lowered the cane almost level with the ground   5.97937466347827
which he did with the conscientiousness that d artagnan carried into everything   9.20417063151775
adieu then until five o clock   16.792850566339965
sire interposed the minister of police i came a moment ago to give your majesty fresh information which i had obtained on this head when your majesty s attention was attracted by the terrible event that has occurred in the gulf and now these facts will cease to interest your majesty   13.26520152875327
but m   3.910033698249441
but of clement vii   8.347366377017758
but do you understand   21.076193654939203
she said at length   13.528481347179463
cried the host if the lackey has drunk only half as much as the master i am a ruined man   10.101680416034494
but i repeat it again to you replied felton in great emotion no danger threatens you   16.508750188505772
she escaped the cruisers of both nations and arrived at boulogne without accident   13.27336207023456
the wise man my child has said it is good to think of death   8.359361443140683
m   11.533112257467405
when once more alone gondy sent to summon all the curates with whom he had any connection to his house   12.96084276925952
but i whom the strange fashion in which that letter came into the house had placed on my guard i did not lose a movement of his features   11.865517834800778
i ought to ask your majesty s pardon but i wished to receive your commands from your own mouth   6.932399376586739
the mendicant continued to rip his garments   15.46069929922854
once again silence   11.29968108118766
more than two thousand persons had assisted as at a spectacle in this fortunate but wild undertaking of the four friends an undertaking of which they were far from suspecting the real motive   6.097492137083608
those who remain in paris in july must be true parisians   15.345384993310695
barrois said the doctor can you speak   9.800185946532338
while africa was positively reported by many persons as her intended course   17.29228328480769
but how did you become concerned in this villainous affair   9.273344229784367
said the king   13.346880872788294
shall i draw back my forehead from his embrace or withhold my hand from his   10.408682440564316
perhaps i am wrong in speaking thus to you who have evidently a leaning to mazarin   10.74085438728438
beyond the fortifications through which athos had made a breach in order to get out and which were composed of fagots planks and empty casks heaped up according to all the rules of the strategic art they found swimming in puddles of oil and wine the bones and fragments of all the hams they had eaten   17.724888539394478
exclaimed the monarch   14.099037817418536
yes said d artagnan   10.766801053552978
one of the good blades of his kingdom was accustomed to say that if he had a friend who was about to fight he would advise him to choose as a second himself first and tréville next or even perhaps before himself   18.252824711509255
trembling his hair erect his brow bathed with perspiration he counted the seconds by the beating of his heart   10.506487902234728
and after this reasoning she slept easily   14.606458706333715
murmured charles   13.954278750182642
quite certain   14.371578930398263
no one better   6.256688710638702
how will you have them protect you   12.569739191997146
under this head also bragelonne had much more to hear than to tell   21.23300980822284
well mother i yesterday engaged myself as substitute in the spahis 25 added the young man lowering his eyes with a certain feeling of shame for even he was unconscious of the sublimity of his self abasement   8.435736602362004
peppino is a lad of sense who unlike most men who are happy in proportion as they are noticed was delighted to see that the general attention was directed towards his companion   14.674909370136245
said the procurator s wife slowly and sadly   13.263213113281408
bertuccio and go first   8.731189895933555
sign my lord and he gave him a pen   4.571619321768497
and d artagnan heard the door of communication opened violently   13.596992920218273
so after a thousand questions which met with only a word in reply la ramee fascinated by this sobriety in speech rubbed his hands and engaged grimaud   19.083911884227376
thought d artagnan in this direction i am satisfied   8.121735945433024
a large cloak was spread at the stern   13.305694486084665
yes brigadier   18.815761102991445
it is all in beginning   14.740832582110825
she appeared like a pythoness evoking a spectre as she recalled to his mind the remembrance of the fearful death of this man to the news of which all europe had listened with horror   13.147839269787625
i fancied that i still heard faint moans and imagining that the unfortunate jeweller might not be quite dead i determined to go to his relief by way of atoning in some slight degree not for the crime i had committed but for that which i had not endeavored to prevent   12.310133570195907
andrea gave the innkeeper twenty francs and in taking them from his pocket dropped a visiting card   14.260242503206026
i had three similar ones returned monte cristo   11.331391403225135
those who have died of hunger   10.58635115866839
yesterday i said this mass again   12.722877355382728
valentine i have always regarded our love in the light of something sacred   11.289963294005576
a short gallop brought them to the road of chaillot   9.030421927827094
i would however beg your majesty to observe do you then also join in betraying me monsieur cardinal by thus always opposing my will   12.975021675795954
he then withdrew and as he passed into the courtyard he stopped near a lamp and dived eagerly into the bag of money   11.401355797215075
he is scarcely five feet high   13.063222079512656
then sleep here my dear count   21.484315176441356
the impression was the same on both of them and the tone in which morcerf had just expressed his thanks was so determined that the position would have become embarrassing for all if the conversation had continued   12.112261042866312
but if such persons are among my acquaintances i prefer not to know it because then i should be forced to hate them   10.04926451514024
nothing i was speaking to myself   13.92059717011421
arrived here only yesterday morning and married today at three o clock   10.816446302814654
this obliged them to make all the speed they could to evade the enemy when they could but lament the absence of dantès whose superior skill in the management of a vessel would have availed them so materially   13.61215368345249
two months passed away in hopeless expectation on my part while i must do the magistrate the justice to say that he used every means to obtain information of the person i declared could exculpate me if he would   7.617862830961136
this night i have had a fearful sleep   8.260432141013274
it was therefore easy in the midst of this confusion to remain as unobserved as any one might wish   21.090488789079018
listen   13.618318605745822
said planchet is it you   16.963498058310254
the secret has been well kept   9.4298980785956
having assassinated a man   10.76004553450737
but god our courage and the remembrance of our friendship sustain us   9.501442915966177
i bring him to you madame said athos withdrawing his hand hoping that in your turn you will do something for him   12.190491384914033
take care for i warn you that the first man that comes within the length of my sword and my sword is long i rip him up   13.975588886551067
but if he had escaped   13.859385433085617
for fear the letter might be some day lost or stolen he compelled dantès to learn it by heart   14.41490970669301
how so   0.41442611740219526
we shall take to ourselves the poniards and the rope replied the duke   16.190352489150193
what   10.769780173345122
and as i am going to the red dovecot myself i shall know if you have told me the truth   10.572872262988769
i   9.277333034060423
i have seen nothing of him the last three or four days   12.656468982737994
they will be ten times worse off in a week   10.816404507353901
fetch the nearest   16.034786584084188
edmond replied who knows   16.85890147524374
continued morrel answering his own thoughts   16.956942876779323
you know his business here then   17.43142435987464
sire we have all been blind and the minister of police has shared the general blindness that is all   15.847457826027759
how can you remember what monsieur de richelieu did   15.445829622995936
the nurse was engaged in watching the chemical analysis and villefort was still absorbed in grief   6.053450595771947
he was quite prepared for any such encounter   16.900025493045124
just our number so that if they prove troublesome we shall be able to hold them in check   10.280109999219892
does madame de lannoy know what was in that casket   9.192771421564697
every transport of a daughter finding a father all the delight of a mistress seeing an adored lover were felt by haydée during the first moments of this meeting which she had so eagerly expected   7.722387135113997
yes yes replied mazarin   5.6765776908445025
buckingham heard by some means no doubt of my return   14.209941173126479
you have said nothing have you   18.403808376891764
the traveller descended and instead of sitting down at the stern of the boat which had been decorated with a blue carpet for his accommodation stood up with his arms crossed   11.903078612758547
go into the cavern with haydée   13.706369741005059
i fear the cardinal   15.462398704625711
renée was with all the rest of the company anxiously awaiting him and his entrance was followed by a general exclamation   17.66510203753297
on   10.698112670371358
his visitor appeared slightly uneasy   7.641047104689849
what cried all the guests you have not eaten for four and twenty hours   14.202661238122323
one doesn t descend here by the marble steps of a peristyle but by the branches of a lime tree   15.611073167588074
then said felton who became impatient say yourself madame what treatment you wish followed   12.749752917341626
these last words produced a prodigious effect on the seaman   21.86510485271199
lord de winter continued the officer who commands here in my absence you have already seen and therefore know him   12.298174073081562
help   6.400280402217569
milady smiled   8.041126582009312
proceed   17.103035611035505
suddenly a voice was heard at the wicket   13.189571558545122
alas cried monte cristo striving to repress his emotion if lord wilmore was your unknown benefactor i fear you will never see him again   11.639664034807566
sir   9.309624276209805
but at a tremendous discount of course   6.953325187734506
just at that moment voices were heard hailing the concierge   19.358888653588515
cried the commissary   13.710147103839788
the coachman took care of his horses the lackey held the saddlehorses   12.658434143895743
cried d artagnan to the coachman   8.61495847385403
and this operation ended he took his place beside milady and shut the door   11.365773569783771
ah   18.051804809079773
but to you i shall be merciful   9.778408974446908
d artagnan remained silent   14.87112682884832
morrel went out called baptistin and whispered a few words to him   13.35875110586278
my letter is private and confidential and for that reason i send it to you by a man who shares my most intimate counsels   9.07317963687417
then that will make only 4 998 louis more said peppino with the same indifference   9.322346404153631
chapter xxx   11.78295680478627
they use force the scoundrels   15.0794570950457
he did not therefore allow her any hope that he would flinch   18.413356693140457
if it was mme   10.462114848353018
at what o clock please your majesty   9.080495615599023
on my part i will go out with my hands in my pockets that nothing may be suspected   16.06721831654469
i know it but in asking for news i mean have you done anything for me   11.933255006898912
it appears that messieurs the musketeers keep guard said he   11.471966312103595
maximilian crossed the canal and entered the rue meslay by the boulevards   9.289395346513203
exclaimed she   13.27695065974707
let us follow him said de guiche   7.959787732172498
if he were to lose them well and if he were to lose them   13.931366214282638
what   6.043232420393213
his conversation was a matter of fact without a single romance   10.98920076367211
the voices soon ceased and it seemed to him as if everyone had left the cell   8.128322824965768
all this was achieved in much less time than is occupied in the recital   3.8524646672801577
return to paris said he   7.848957613018336
and that you alone amongst the men whom you do not recognize as your brothers for you have said so observed villefort in a tone that faltered somewhat you alone are perfect   14.16471864032396
madame coquenard said porthos remember the first letter you wrote me and which i preserve engraved in my memory   15.431013590400251
we   16.689855561682315
chapter l   9.780899646072555
but they will not be content with that   11.85997734439479
e   9.642058606249169
well monseigneur   11.712609185465952
your devotion does not commit you too far monsieur de rochefort   14.407290998468172
danglars looked at the two men one after the other the one brutalized by liquor the other overwhelmed with love   17.96619519893495
he squeezed jacopo s hand warmly but nothing could shake his determination to remain and remain alone   18.561429712879843
i recollect now   10.468488657087965
this parallel disturbed his usual politeness the philosophy he witnessed appalled him he muttered a few words of general civility and ran downstairs   3.5557841340624137
then taking a passport from his drawer he said good it is available for two months longer   8.397060854176376
i do not ask you for liberty as a guilty one would nor for vengeance as would a pagan   4.998331881646923
chapter xliv   5.210715249358032
you understand my dear baron that legal methods are the safest in criminal cases   8.409474061844657
d artagnan rushed out of the room   15.106375328948424
it vexes me greatly continued athos that you attach so much importance to these animals for i am not yet at the end of my story   4.394210333290521
if he did not come the painful sensation became most intense   6.430918551785466
my son   9.032681470577339
contributions to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by u   19.628045234396833
said athos   13.062407729851225
no you are right said athos   11.238626080062694
of course not   10.841410428797191
your majesty has none but submissive and respectful subjects   18.440676148807324
noirtier possessed this peculiarity he never projected any utopian schemes which could never be realized but strove for possibilities and he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of the mountain theories that never shrank from any means that were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result   9.112360894291134
cried athos   14.961594362852754
here i am my friends replied d artagnan   16.133468240781514
one of the seconds went for a lantern in a coal barge near and by its light they examined the weapons   6.06527701323086
yes your excellency   7.317921039651385
well i take you with me   11.382150540741923
noirtier de villefort must see the utter impossibility of any alliance being formed between his family and that of m   10.347672338841798
then you shall not leave this place said he   9.606258114831991
you told me so just now   9.760520949933888
i have   4.847045141243403
friend porthos said d artagnan handing the letter to him this time at least you are sure of your title of baron and i of my captaincy   16.16802753026366
what was passing in that brain so loaded with dreadful secrets   12.91118652644736
that s true said m   9.185293490572091
but said madame danglars resolving to make a last effort this young man though a murderer is an orphan abandoned by everybody   13.66704718897074
then going around the house i placed grimaud at the other exit and here i am   10.595679918537758
after this i will think of nothing but eating and drinking   14.751018894408618
the sepulchral depths of the descent were dimly lighted by a silver lamp on the lowest step   21.337579660771127
what would your excellency like   8.032152090368626
but i have seen things so extraordinary that what you tell me seems less astonishing than it otherwise might   13.66815331836558
you have heard what i said   23.443225909997384
not morcerf   12.732929094587004
in what part of the house   11.90058243309761
but is there anything impossible for my d artagnan the noble and loyal gentleman   8.551873604273164
i set out five hours after her from portsmouth said lord de winter   16.384816462278415
faria bent on him his penetrating eye   8.999046923066704
as he alighted he thought he saw his father s pale face behind the curtain of the count s bedroom   9.352963305882236
fifty cavaliers   7.166588548916846
one of them passed around to the right of the carriage the other to the left   10.31250607437722
but what an awkward inelegant fellow he is   9.991815403932183
a tent was erected for them near that of the marshal   7.198735110924971
absent kings are very soon forgotten   13.402508350718666
i have given you all i have and i beg leave to tell you that this is the bottom of my sack   6.139656513455477
therefore i apply to you   10.374370499832969
if his mistress abandons him he will find friends i will answer for it   9.2719616974985
tréville said to himself if the cardinal has set this young fox upon me he will certainly not have failed he who knows how bitterly i execrate him to tell his spy that the best means of making his court to me is to rail at him   8.919841315329677
you know that very well as i gave my order to saddle my horse   13.834070042777661
grimaud fell precipitated into the moat   10.66804841535825
said porthos i have heard that he had adopted a young man who resembles him greatly   15.301842648750252
charles also had recognized the four frenchmen   9.979125664150988
i made a sign to grimaud and the scotchman and we all three retired into a corner of the square   13.137636254024136
and you porthos continued the count as if in consideration for d artagnan s embarrassment you the best heart the best friend the best soldier that i know you with a soul that makes you worthy of a birth on the steps of a throne and who sooner or later must receive your reward from an intelligent king you my dear porthos you a gentleman in manners in tastes and in courage you are as culpable as d artagnan   15.02370237811341
but for me who engraved it myself it is hardly worth a piastre   15.078673807412912
who is he   9.392325531553764
we are mistaken said d artagnan   9.283659693398427
through the closely fastened windows the prisoner could perceive the houses and the pavement that was all   14.40002296075198
if you do not charge anything for copies of this ebook complying with the trademark license is very easy   5.637059341469041
said athos smiling if it be not a secret   8.543351198092214
have i not a single friend in the world who will aid me either to live or to die   12.409123449798933
cried the procureur from the door of his chamber which apparently he scarcely dared to leave   9.161200331166883
he entertains a very high opinion of m   2.6809396992995556
he lost it the day before yesterday   20.944264202272706
all his limbs have become completely paralysed he has lost his voice also and we ourselves find much trouble in endeavoring to catch some fragments of his meaning   14.588979397568378
but the lady   15.155736461358947
the bills signed by morrel were presented at his office with scrupulous exactitude and thanks to the delay granted by the englishman were paid by cocles with equal punctuality   17.453267584874084
there is no doubt but that one of the chief accomplishments of a courtier is to know when to forget   5.243572079315263
prove it danglars   3.447377951629271
d artagnan it is for you to accuse her first   14.413571024694313
arrived at leghorn he repaired to the house of a jew a dealer in precious stones to whom he disposed of four of his smallest diamonds for five thousand francs each   13.15572985811167
you know the axiom non bis in idem   12.538975931966288
but no voice broke the stillness of the chamber and the door was opened only by villefort s valet who came to tell him that the travelling carriage was in readiness   6.2531715241262
but what is that to me provided i see you again   19.469013440141744
the young men rode up to the wounded man to announce that they were followed by the priest   13.707933560794189
i am a royalist replied the general   13.643390761081543
morrel bringing a doctor and the doctor said it was inflammation of the bowels and ordered him a limited diet   7.558774382429018
and you go into that house   16.540663640411644
he saw that he was no match for monte cristo in an argument of this sort and he therefore hastened to turn to subjects more congenial   16.923174188960065
more than once she thought of revealing all to her grandmother and she would not have hesitated a moment if maximilian morrel had been named albert de morcerf or raoul de château renaud   15.705712647068214
but then you understand madame coquenard a mule with feathers and bells   9.091380612513207
henceforth we have nothing to fear   5.753682711182145
no monsieur jester replied d artagnan   7.901922380428446
no i am pleased so pleased that i wished to congratulate you   13.04390466497686
28   18.316514195170477
someone is talking in the street   6.263226779900531

asked penelon   16.034013054998724
your friends will be proud of you and m   12.10395195617644
until then he had been sustained by rage by his strength of mind by despair by the supreme agony which led the titans to scale the heavens and ajax to defy the gods   15.2189800166236
ah   10.963664875660694
asked the steward whose roses began to change into lilies   18.01171055029807
i have worn it in my turn and it has sometimes not been disgraced when the hilt was in my hand and the sheath at my side   7.673452622686542

monsieur d artagnan said athos what is the penalty you demand against this woman   18.410115019951196
you were wishing just now said villefort addressing her that i were a doctor instead of a lawyer   7.214139925665254

augustine which he was forced to write in latin for the following week and which preoccupied him a good deal   13.00904554948134
then turning to ali she directed him to bring coffee and pipes and when he had left the room to execute the orders of his young mistress she beckoned albert to approach nearer to her   17.50153746633276
listen d artagnan   22.382993914329134
fernand s mind was made up   6.354432842640258
but beyond this he was ignorant   5.272022823806673
asked danglars   12.164016943496879
in the midst of this chamber were four stones which had formerly served as an altar as was evident from the cross which still surmounted them   5.641328691574382
then said morrel i understand it all and this scene was premeditated   15.202413782299907
cried the duchess seizing athos s hands tell me this moment how you know all these details or i will send to the convent of the vieux augustins for a monk to come and exorcise you   10.36072359442985

and what are these corsican bandits doing here with spanish smugglers   22.425500671082393
bonacieux was known to belong to the queen   9.8327214717627
explain it athos   16.54744072426981
valentine trembled and looked at him with amazement   10.606937112362615
he grew more pale every minute and they were obliged to support him on his horse   14.013273883924583
you know he sent for you after the action   14.5331023734884
he rapidly devoured his food and after waiting an hour lest the jailer should change his mind and return he removed his bed took the handle of the saucepan inserted the point between the hewn stone and rough stones of the wall and employed it as a lever   7.230265722365973
anne dropped her head and fell into one of those reveries so habitual with her   6.879312703488416

yes replied the angry look   2.845012475037448
caderousse went to the window touched the glass with it and found it would cut   5.1121714925281765
the two young persons exchanged looks   15.466694085404804
if then i should learn that you had taken upon yourself to speak of me to anyone favorably or unfavorably to comment on my actions or watch my conduct that very instant you would quit my service   19.865590346328844
make inquiries albert but do not be angry without reason   7.109641556412628
very well you can retire m   15.046573266226691
now i don t set sufficient store on the cut of my jerkin to risk being hung at tyburn or sent for change of scene to the indies   11.932423781963704
oh this is too much cried hermine choking you are worse than despicable   10.283526362238423
and now my dear athos said he do me the kindness to tell me where we are going   15.756095774975643
i trust to him from my heart   14.197687987069672
sdeath   9.999753971994267
where you please returned monte cristo since i know nothing at all of it   14.945643590405547
you will perhaps smile at me when i tell you that ever since i have known this man i have involuntarily entertained the idea that all the good fortune which has befallen me originated from him   13.958695312079602
there is half past ten striking albert   14.801927825265011
poverty may make a man beg steal a loaf of bread at a baker s door but not cause him to open a secretaire in a house supposed to be inhabited   12.637816197125876
what   10.94963905942647
my dear count if you tell me many more marvellous things i warn you i shall not believe them   16.83000104509446
here is my pass countersigned said the latter   16.69787291937031
he said to himself if i only had for a confessor one of those lights of the church whose soul has sounded all the mysteries of life all the littlenesses of greatness perhaps his utterance would overawe the voice that wails within my soul   14.298450979741126

lord de winter perceived nothing of this   12.929417426031799
milady was handsome enough not to find much resistance on the part of the flesh and she was sufficiently skillful to prevail over all the obstacles of the mind   16.31001074841598
the pale light of the first rays of day gave to her clear eyes a strangely frightful expression   15.619626508125828
but it happened that someone in the house called lubin so that planchet remained alone looking in all directions for the road where d artagnan had disappeared   9.517143198024087
ah count he esteems you so highly tell him that he has spoken amiss   14.852627331042205
your majesty s mind may be quite at ease replied the officer   13.910162134009838
aramis   10.672373981389711
you spoke of a mission   7.747609064662565
said porthos why separate since we are all together   15.676625961380262
that here you exercise unlimited sway and are at liberty to lay aside or continue the costume of your country as it may suit your inclination   4.2084047565899505
how not having been able to sleep for the joy he felt in the expectation of seeing his majesty he had gone to his three friends three hours before the hour of audience   6.081590114228426
the driver was paid as the door opened and stepping lightly up the stairs madame danglars soon reached the salle des pas perdus   12.847801372810958
the bible said aramis makes our belief in them a law   9.816817714829195
ah ah   9.941157070324522
what might be the consequences   9.635406874200122
he carried the strictness of this order so far as to detain in england the ambassadors of denmark who had taken their leave and the regular ambassador of holland who was to take back to the port of flushing the indian merchantmen of which charles i   5.24431168502436
what   11.8811697937524

i shall kneel down to pray   10.15704778134064
m   10.78141923919943
ah murmured athos kissing her hand had i only sooner known that marie michon was so charming a creature   6.684794175908531
very true said monte cristo   10.58793309959884
certainly   12.72373819276814
there was little change in the cardinal   11.612228389782457
and kourchid pointed out one who had more than any contributed to the death of my father said haydée in a tone of chastened anger   13.57217480269414
how can i tell   14.268207165728862
friquet seeing this fine officer thus walk away followed by two guards amused himself by pursuing them and did this so much the more gladly as the ceremony ended at that instant and the king remounted his carriage   3.917961167172013
there is but little reason why i should delay you   12.59979202774665
but as for us it is only to gratify a whim and it would be ridiculous to risk our lives for so foolish a motive   10.253360618771715
cavalcanti had done half an hour before   18.641596932543532
the baron walked triumphantly through the crowd who for the sake of gain styled him your excellency   13.453793024508101
at the same moment the count seized with his left hand the assassin s wrist and wrung it with such strength that the knife fell from his stiffened fingers and caderousse uttered a cry of pain   8.948765397524193
let me see what it is   8.100872629215907
did you see her after her return from brussels after the king s death   15.71302090325947
i think nothing my friend   9.120923990678444
pardieu beauchamp mine shall be a splendid funeral   8.939895902801906
mademoiselle was walking in the shade of the garden and your son disappeared in pursuit of the peacock   12.632041852194948
he was dressed in violet tinted velvet trimmed with silk of the same color   9.179309011843618
athos and aramis were more and more astonished   11.684525901228442
franz and the countess exchanged a smile and then the latter resumed her conversation with albert while franz returned to his previous survey of the house and company   9.700911252331505
that is also possible   11.49139256977021
how pale you are   23.146890845422753
it is quite frightful but deeply interesting said the young lady motionless with attention   18.34202224351914
these two men had only followed for the purpose of assassinating him hoping that the young man s death would be placed to the account of the enemy   8.451907247107854
really madame he said did i alarm you much   16.694839405543522
there exist no imprecations she did not pour out against you   16.725608715192028
i declare my friend said he that there is not a creature under the sky who equals you in prowess and in courage   12.71750256790108
soon i heard steps on the staircase which terrified me as much as the footsteps of the commander did don juan   7.656022596390353
yes forever   12.734972349040092
monte cristo had promised him that valentine should live and so far he had always fulfilled his word   12.32326936147045
i restrain myself   5.428060622432908
what he did during these ten years god only knows   12.336230186708189
vampa put the two sequins haughtily into his pocket and slowly returned by the way he had gone   18.284521504733945
i shall retire and die tranquilly at home   10.088016109658703
the drawing rooms were decorated with the rarest pictures by the old masters the boudoirs hung with draperies from china of fanciful colors fantastic design and wonderful texture   9.177439882643739
the pallor and anguish expressed on his countenance momentarily increased   14.194154435398378
d artagnan desired planchet to be summoned but he had disappeared   12.813318129988085
madame de villefort was slowly ascending the steps which led to her room   6.119761791947987
athos s horse where is that   10.455523415104171
mousqueton s horse which had traveled for five or six hours without a rider the day before might have been able to pursue the journey   12.344743367413129
i believe i saw him mount a gray horse and leave the palace court   11.8487582046691
not yet   13.734781723621929
pray have compassion upon me and do not take up every word i say   18.803235152634347
but marrying as i am about to do before all paris i ought to be supported by an illustrious name and in the absence of the paternal hand some powerful one ought to lead me to the altar   16.237259913305174
gentlemen said he in a tone strangely firm for a servant speaking to his masters under such solemn circumstances gentlemen m   9.784291542638847
now said athos that we can not even recognize one another and have therefore no fear of others recognizing us let us go and see the king s entrance   13.605152158921156
certainly these are questions that in your place i should like to have answered   10.179156903565296
be at ease my girl   11.662007213462175
come in said a voice which he recognized as that of the mendicant whom he found lying on a kind of truckle bed   12.655534745318398
as for peppino he examined the paper attentively put it into his pocket and continued eating his peas   14.121908020606355
at each shot morrel turned pale   5.033518566348028
true said madame danglars   12.922370987176247
that s unpardonable in a man of your age and who besides has such a pretty wife as yours   19.593364008253936
he had reserved from his annuity his family papers his library composed of five thousand volumes and his famous breviary   15.51550248150008
now for my idea   14.239347437998612
mistaken   6.457735405841739
said madame de villefort   17.046978212709895
yes i know there are traditions of that sort said comminges   12.503109916251626
she is at the ball as you know since she came to say good bye to you in full dress   9.29283205148469
the baroness became pale   14.897915764171984

the other leaned against a tree supported there by the two valets and was praying fervently with clasped hands and eyes raised to heaven   8.717155931929991
here was the officer d artagnan was seeking   23.828410931262354

i did not wish to contradict them   8.600874977856957
monsieur mordaunt   16.076934331920075
he inquired   3.245946857140524

at the expiration of ten minutes aramis arrived accompanied by grimaud and eight or ten followers   18.160210871764534

what is it you edmond back again   14.474722434306077
from my childhood i have seen too much and understood too much of what has passed around me for misfortune to have an undue power over me   15.344209718794135
it was the most simple thing in the world   17.9132939128833

the young lady rushed out of the apartment but on the first step of the staircase she found a man holding a letter in his hand   21.825137925662382
because sir said the president you have insulted a man and that man will not go one step farther without demanding honorable reparation   15.419504938254697
it is mine and i am at liberty to dispose of it   7.179946456172619
perceiving that he was alone he rose and making a little circuit passed close to the cavalier who was speaking to the sentinel   15.054269291500345

grimaud and i got behind a tree and the scotchman having nowhere to hide himself threw himself on his face in the road   14.590384949621921
it was a lovely starlight night they had just reached the top of the hill villejuif from whence paris appears like a sombre sea tossing its millions of phosphoric waves into light waves indeed more noisy more passionate more changeable more furious more greedy than those of the tempestuous ocean waves which never rest as those of the sea sometimes do waves ever dashing ever foaming ever ingulfing what falls within their grasp   16.310967142615944

the sea continued to get calmer   7.3653152229753065
it appears to me said d artagnan with that prudence which allied itself in him so naturally with excessive bravery that we could have found some retired place on the downs or the seashore   17.137395610480112
but arriving at four crossroads he stopped again visibly embarrassed   13.477316114744722
the dinner it was evident that one sentiment affected all the guests on entering the dining room   17.22592080848518
cried he guardian of the fire do your duty   12.74811719754421

the woman of the garden   14.383085378442253
athos said d artagnan getting rid of his female garments and appearing in his shirt prepare yourself to hear an incredible an unheard of story   13.597732698601483
and yet as you come from dax or pau from tarbes said d artagnan   10.520608226948736

the same evening the following was read in le messager by telegraph   20.704036314577923
my father the comte de morcerf although of spanish origin possesses considerable influence both at the court of france and madrid and i unhesitatingly place the best services of myself and all to whom my life is dear at your disposal   5.211150765860304

nor i either   11.278726248422474
cried d artagnan becoming more pale than the white veil of his mistress   15.859249366593918

he examined it to see if its hilt was well guarded and if the blade was firmly attached to the hilt   16.594109113889928
willingly answered the soldier   16.277028208670387
but what will be reported of the sudden death of the poor old servant   9.83395039738626
that is it replied the cardinal dryly   10.868242870942819
he   11.316995568815512
they wished to carry him to the shore   7.830367903026446
that is true monsieur cardinal said the king and you were right as you always are   9.587754775993726
de tréville s recommendation recurred this animal will end by making me afraid   18.125814392022235
he said   13.60173904622651
his majesty will then take refuge in holland where i hear his highness the prince of wales now is   14.906596958382465
desirous of seeing how far the discretion of the good abbess would go she began to tell a story obscure at first but very circumstantial afterward about the cardinal relating the amours of the minister with mme   13.679359884722025
nevertheless reserve my old room on the fifth story for me   14.949719683065638
you see i am more candid than you   19.29308369081769
bravo   15.11184544527436
but he soon saw that she would pass like most vessels bound for italy between the islands of jaros and calaseraigne   9.815325762249346
the beggar of st   13.892099212890454

i forewarn you signor pastrini that i shall not believe one word of what you are going to tell us   11.396834636219733
no objection was raised but they pointed out the asylum which was situated at the upper end of the rue d enfer and after having taken the precaution of cutting the linen in two pieces so that one of the two letters which marked it was on the piece wrapped around the child while the other remained in my possession i rang the bell and fled with all speed   11.810672021730133
athos cast a cold and indifferent glance upon the objects we have described and at the invitation of him whom he came to seek sat down near him   10.2574253125332
oh sir twenty five years   15.592431764105015
our host   20.653495318823076
d avrigny had communicated in his nocturnal walk to m   15.216958884780603
and you come   9.755058872150988
oh if she betrayed your majesty on the side of your honor it would be quite another thing and i should be the first to say no grace sire no grace for the guilty   10.38001330658823
she took the risk upon herself   21.971214801330227
exclaimed dantès in grief stricken tones   12.233785269154597
inquired valentine uneasily   10.806194959933078
and the royal father of the princess isabella taking his daughter by the hand swept round the stage with majestic strides the better to display the rich folds of his velvet robe and mantle   14.221544185251041
i took the wall you are mining for the outer wall of the fortress   14.646427255121344
but not with men   12.986504683648825
are you not the lieutenant fernand who served as guide and spy to the french army in spain   13.567914137864975
morrel himself the pearl of the honest men of marseilles flattered him more than a present of fifty crowns   12.38231227729491
you will meanwhile proceed on foot to the harbor   8.010058199537813
the anger which fired the eyes of the musketeer in spite of his efforts to suppress it terrified his sensitive inamorata   8.629888397238993
so suiting the action to the word d artagnan thrust the remnant of his sword into its scabbard picked up his hat and ran down the stairs followed by the others   10.692668787550364
said porthos it is very pleasant to be able to say the late monsieur mordaunt   9.748685079842513
what do you want with a notary   13.25918097994536
the poisoner was terrified at the contemplation of her own work   8.599594013161877
she had raised her veil and with her face hidden by her hands was giving free scope to the sighs and tears which had been so long restrained by the presence of her son   9.809157496768728
she passed an hour without breathing panting with a cold sweat upon her brow and her heart oppressed by frightful agony at every movement she heard in the corridor   13.82609503275935
what ho   6.188298749955737
for if we meet by night without seeking each other much more shall we meet by day when wishing it   5.802613870931791
said danglars laughing in his turn   8.903596129425093
precept something but example more   8.606860820851713
in what way   9.946108675236173
you are probably nearer freedom than he is so it will be your business to get him out   8.253482623946606
it is a large sum of money but it is not a fortune   6.5815769940689615
how so   20.347442660763257
madame say that you would love me then   18.35241621704487
yes said aramis athos is right animadvertuntur in desertis   21.439908459061293
you mean to say then my dear monsieur la ramee that unless monsieur de beaufort can contrive to metamorphose himself into a little bird i will continue answerable for him   6.5860204641476106
madame morrel looked again through the keyhole morrel was writing   19.902700393462176
also a letter of introduction to the count of monte cristo on whom i give you a draft of 48 000 francs   18.59867173449811
ed   14.18243022355538
at that moment the countenance of mme   16.16898529580351
morrel in demanding justice for crime   13.317528305300055
her lips were cold   9.41279213659137
did he give you any details   12.736759391242334
said the queen never   11.980305998761345
i   8.98458008104448
laporte placed the king dressed as he was in the bed and then covered him as far as the shoulders with the sheet   10.912109167988858
and will you undertake to deliver it   12.034996477807182
night came and with it the preparation for departure and these preparations served to conceal dantès agitation   19.241320509922485
de monte cristo knows everybody   13.788612330674459
on whom then   19.69142934385717
i say you wished to avenge yourself on me and i say that it is horrible   14.111212635346696
i don t know english athos said d artagnan   17.547536516399788
but send me word should you be arrested for then i will return directly   22.18178756886237
sometimes she stood mute and motionless as a statue looking towards marseilles at other times gazing on the sea and debating as to whether it were not better to cast herself into the abyss of the ocean and thus end her woes   15.051376711848652
athos will set out two hours after by that of amiens   6.824655600407737
she speculated and lost   10.616761558800059
oh gentlemen said the host i have been wrong   11.188210124341303
in fact said the cardinal placing his hand upon a bundle of papers i have here a whole pile which concerns you   17.750955155808157
yes   11.632674645606137
well i reply that you shall be served to the height of your wishes and that we shall see each other every day   12.350088521916755
he looked well around him to see if olivain and the host might not be watching him whilst he impressed a kiss upon the paper a mute and touching caress which the heart of athos might well divine on opening the letter   11.634655285768547
that we couldn t go a hundred steps without being recaptured because we were without clothes to disguise ourselves and arms to defend ourselves   12.337785540930417
only return again at eleven o clock   17.545373403301834
demanded d artagnan   9.520777010367762
27 said the inspector   7.125053577290773
i asked to be excused in case i should not be able to discharge my debt to all three   17.86166773209212
she is not to leave this chamber understand john continued the baron   15.677316787259848
said beauchamp   7.062072534780114
come now said athos you are joking   6.570005841750554
this was all the visitor wished to ascertain or rather all the englishman appeared to know   14.89389090826857
not nearly indeed   22.598120499433726
you leave me and you are right in doing so i repeat it you are right   15.441878285323297
send at twelve said danglars smiling   8.095087076972744
d artagnan was waiting for a reply to his remark and said nothing   18.597159100279516
well then what do you say to la specchia   11.11696937926282
what monsieur   6.170396061108029
said porthos almost burying his large feet in the sands   12.946759460878518
are you also in accord with spain and england with madame de chevreuse and the queen   14.342663089687164
exclaimed a voice   8.1890020848616
why in the first place his yacht is not a ship but a bird and he would beat any frigate three knots in every nine   19.097466425103427
said aramis   11.354200727932522
jussac one of the first swordsmen in the kingdom   11.657415659969576
half the escort were exhausted and several horses fell down   16.440713602273355
excuse me sir replied the notary   20.6641909318678
you can not think of going out in such weather as this   11.961267082750258
when i am happy i wish all the world to be so   6.213022765613752
the air was soft and clear as it generally is at that early hour of the morning   19.42794733315228
i am one of his most faithful servants   12.407921295224726
d artagnan passed through the very midst of this discontented mob just as if his horse and he had been made of iron   15.565616850661993
never a mistake or delay a fellow who paid like a prince   13.06200720135391
the musketeers set off and d artagnan was left alone with raoul   5.1463992758617465
one of the two guardsmen was engaged that evening and another the next so the meeting was fixed for the day after that   17.710777759724074
only imagine what happiness that would afford me   10.130654739839237
d artagnan already wore his uniform for being nearly of the same size as aramis and as aramis was so liberally paid by the publisher who purchased his poem as to allow him to buy everything double he sold his friend a complete outfit   8.549033629090568
grief does not stun me   8.373294013301273
i can not be mistaken   8.214248251650103
exclaimed julie   12.410913654222963
then after a slight hesitation she resumed   12.30330459377679
why you strike like a blind or a deaf man   14.182253004357175
then he began to search   14.535525269062294
he said   8.22981424270008
ah i knew well said the gascon that you were a man of talent   16.103213376275253
we are saved   8.220140902682191
i stood in the same attitude and threw myself down   7.6254169056223375
certainly   13.034609524329932
50073m no said valentine   14.984098410295784
he was my friend he had no secrets from me and if this had been so he would have confided in me   12.975878957509446
fortunately nothing is lost by this delay and you are now about to hear it   11.12212823382855
is it your decision athos   17.801124651567115
the jailer brought him his breakfast   10.441379371073593
he knew that it was barren and without shelter   0.37267967114485323
the album said edward sulkily   14.406726989406248
a bargain was therefore struck   10.002083135960548
after a long talk with the harbor master captain leclere left naples greatly disturbed in mind   9.406951842132901
but at the sight of the young man who detached himself from the wall like a statue walking from its niche and at the noise of the steps which she heard resound behind her mme   16.497006908446455
the footman opened the door and announced monsieur le comte de la fere   13.424218529611974
the soil was humid and glittering with the rain which had recently fallen and the refreshed herbs sent forth their perfume with additional energy   3.072742960594679
inquired the young girl trembling with apprehension   16.430562726918808
we shall meet soon i trust in paris where you shall have your revenge   8.351449613972475
meant   10.738294126897749
athos then said to aramis   4.19017309621093
but ye shall know i am no ordinary favorite   11.964991055508893
and besides an idea had struck me   9.833616061730567

half past seven   11.514443643179968
when i am insulted i do not faint   11.835508309684954
and strong in the multiplication table which he had at his fingers ends no matter what scheme or what trap was laid to catch him   14.108447717082651
well what do you want with me   10.269789655233005
and you can not deny it   11.843581837343272
monte cristo only answered by extending his hand to the young man   10.075871124232549
he himself   10.954104329947357
fernand wiped away the perspiration steaming from his brow and slowly entered the arbor whose shade seemed to restore somewhat of calmness to his senses and whose coolness somewhat of refreshment to his exhausted body   6.65768999759032
and can you find him   16.83579859552742
at length the hour drew near   11.629406496204272
with a word d artagnan reassured them   10.408183508408955
said d artagnan   12.81240819542857
said d artagnan half rising and bowing   6.3398604882397835
she turned pale and her eye passed quickly from the servant and rested on the master   12.71950034206881
she made a violent effort to reply to this last attack but she fell upon a chair thinking of villefort of the dinner scene of the strange series of misfortunes which had taken place in her house during the last few days and changed the usual calm of her establishment to a scene of scandalous debate   12.511990893978856
but without doubt m   11.55948095557496
she is gone said he   10.882806086284901
the lions den one division of la force in which the most dangerous and desperate prisoners are confined is called the court of saint bernard   7.078612358930984
i will be responsible for the barony   13.203741158215168
another recollection contributed also to sadden raoul on their arrival at sonores he had perceived hidden behind a screen of poplars a little chateau which so vividly recalled that of la valliere to his mind that he halted for nearly ten minutes to gaze at it and resumed his journey with a sigh too abstracted even to reply to olivain s respectful inquiry about the cause of so much fixed attention   14.263592762586317
allow me time just to kill this gentleman and i will return and finish the last couplet   13.453405212641751
carlini fetched two pickaxes   10.66004846567097
so much the better   8.653849384513865
gentlemen said d artagnan you shall have your turn   14.962136066782715
you are not mistaken   11.594663576167031
does your excellency wish me to accompany him   9.624314718133965
valentine the hand which now threatens you will pursue you everywhere   9.41514541447714
i take them said d artagnan for myself   2.5412807265223325
3 knocked on the head   11.649307977922858
all this must be prepared against   8.655972211721329
let us try and overtake this gentleman said raoul to olivain   20.344200483541066
your voice is that of a young man   13.385285730010876
but one   14.522797238033617
not without my defending it said groslow   17.984664212733346
well   11.406232493904024
beneath these lines was written in another hand see note above nothing can be done   7.717385813211175
we shall be beaten again and must die on the spot for on my part i declare i will never appear again before the captain as a conquered man   7.965392933320989
no no madame there is no such thing as chance   13.001826603722117
this calmness of busoni combined with his irony and boldness staggered caderousse   19.428589327420887
at this moment villefort returned   8.108486719762876
the son of that good merchant of marseilles whom you doubtless recollect   6.792529547119098
said mazarin breathing more freely   13.731376886106899
in the space of half an hour we shall know the emperor s answer   7.9367908180829785
here   8.620078819081659
exclaimed guitant with a burst of laughter   12.020134865312997
are you then come from m   12.762519219592226
morrel   9.472466210856348
valentine hid her head between her hands   13.327683538781269
he returned to mercédès with tears in his eyes and heaving breast and without uttering a word he gave her the letter   9.158084635406905
mousqueton instantly assumed a jovial countenance saddled the horses quickly and mounted his own without making faces over it   9.15999726717702
yes   18.53059025708732
you wish me then to relate the history of my past sorrows   11.439646168347572
i have never before been at paris and it is the first time i have ever even set my foot in france   10.403462604646878
he was received by baptistin   18.20904124892647
i shall be baron   16.276354403161672
he took the arm of château renaud and turned towards the vault where the attendants had already placed the two coffins   1.9131704728880425
without thinking what it is he calls it a crime   12.10026121969941
attention then   13.970095850766747
i was at the louvre on the day when he scattered his pearls   10.869993241781899
you forget my dear you forget that these gentlemen are not initiated into my family affairs like yourself   9.50186620348275
he might go out by one gate and return by another   5.6691111518819195
the man retired but not before examining the supposed juxon with an attention which did not escape the king   12.092603187331237
i am sent here by government to visit the prison and hear the requests of the prisoners   13.753700041797906
father and son m   8.998594122356025
sir replied he if you came to me with the idea of demanding satisfaction you should have gone at once to the point and not have entertained me with the idle conversation to which i have been patiently listening for the last half hour   16.074085872923092
and what will he promise us   7.321217176612818
friquet heard perfectly but he pretended not to do so and tried to continue his road   3.3327670717407276
she herself was not exempt from internal emotion and without having done anything wrong yet fully comprehended that luigi was right in reproaching her   14.931502640064966
and i expected to see him leave rueil in the same way as samson left gaza   7.261947585547508
she will ruin us   18.79695740366072
then that which spurred her on additionally in the midst of all this was the remembrance of the cardinal   10.129986184998806
like benefactors in romances i should have left you without seeing you again but that would have been a virtue beyond my strength because i am a weak and vain man fond of the tender kind and thankful glances of my fellow creatures   8.428140458537559
de villefort to come but have not much hope of seeing him   9.228909347031077
someone had just died in the house to which that garden belonged   12.822334182057926
besides let me own something to you   12.056443377156933
m   11.0202145368477
by a man of from forty to forty five years with black hair a dark complexion and a scar on his left temple   8.412882077061198
you procure your mistresses from the opera the vaudeville or the variétés   13.153884687856086
milady was not mistaken   15.611945567147876
your excellency has not stated the number of guests   14.858809185796932
that is right cried the marquise   5.495120812027123
he continued so i was going away but he called me back   12.654345071005192
thank you and god reward you   13.84929388336218
lemonade was a very bad thing for him   13.430763812314558
danglars waited a moment expecting the postilion to come and demand payment with the termination of his stage   13.147760515147068
these apparently simple words pierced morrel to the heart   13.948544545871442
what is the matter   11.79361359682796
she spoke some words to lord de winter in english who thereupon requested d artagnan s permission to retire excusing himself on account of the urgency of the business that had called him away and charging his sister to obtain his pardon   17.406288229999266
monsieur de bouillon had the gout but notwithstanding his illness which had prevented his mounting on horseback for the last month that is since paris had been besieged he was ready to receive the comte de la fere and the chevalier d herblay   8.407610454408172
toward the end of the fourth day of the journey athos and aramis reached nanterre which place they cautiously passed by on the outskirts fearing that they might encounter some troop from the queen s army   9.454046357520088
he has opened an account with my house for his son   9.663235776317503
you have done your duty and your conscience will be at rest   13.575991241883782
my king said aramis they well may raise a scaffold but they can not make an executioner   11.546568460010198
that time you had nothing to say to me   13.603837078603956
absolutely monseigneur   7.95449152911033
cried monsieur de bouillon evidently ill at ease   14.457723044824633
we ought to witness this great tragedy even to its last scene said athos   3.235677062775192
dantès as we have said had traced the marks along the rocks and he had noticed that they led to a small creek which was hidden like the bath of some ancient nymph   12.16744110692804
d artagnan was perhaps about to reply when a blow similar to that of a mallet falling on the head of an ox was heard   11.661903418897554
it is like that turkish phrase of molière s that so astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of things implied in its utterance   11.207367058893025
the count understood him   15.46657046617609
a pleasure boat with striped awning was going by   17.09680927658264
it is not natural that a man like you should possess such a diamond   11.681027917059414
you always come back to that   14.925890328418184
and perhaps when they have taken it they will leave me in peace and quietness   10.081832612407638
or have you forgotten them   14.11248250930672
yes   7.330910840499185
she had in her first marriage i don t think d artagnan i am telling you anything new married a lawyer   12.65062568113043
ah   15.56103612350012
now we have in a dungeon about twenty feet distant and to which you descend by another stair an old abbé formerly leader of a party in italy who has been here since 1811 and in 1813 he went mad and the change is astonishing   11.27747009908886
de tréville   14.02439292802653
my dear landlady said d artagnan i beg to introduce to you your brother who is arrived from flanders and whom i am going to take into my service   1.6594897835666416
at nine o clock next morning she arose and without ringing for her maid or giving the least sign of her activity she dressed herself in the same simple style as on the previous night   11.030146450511806
they trust to fortune and rely upon some unexpected event in some way to justify their predictions   11.073528306913419
thirty five minutes after seven said athos by which you perceive i am five minutes faster than you   18.48178585501799
recollect what i told you when you asked me to propose you   15.306539091531995
now see here will that be all   0.45627295173720306
cocles thus remained in his accustomed tranquillity   17.526194670052952
ah   9.535174802976485
everything that savors of mystery charms them   11.359995844829893
cried the four companions with one voice we would allow ourselves to be cut to pieces in your majesty s service   6.624415341460765
as a matter of fact said monte cristo approaching i am much afraid that i am the involuntary cause of his absence   9.464253354847674
d artagnan and athos looked at each other for some time in silence   8.858968925088849
the door of their cabin was opened   13.449378461325221
diable   3.491892947140242
tis a bad example   10.62519866727967
but also said mazarin you must understand that if i ask this service from you it is with the intention of being grateful   7.238889672701348
well let us go then where the fighting is for that is the most likely place to meet with d artagnan porthos and possibly even raoul   17.243574440721947
ten minutes passed thus and he was convinced that no one was watching him   11.537860831445073
it is the best thing to do   13.471144042169362
athos s idea   20.664623349542964
i do   9.550953892661825
7   16.756363044532005
he no doubt thought that prisoners who died in the château d if were interred in an ordinary burial ground and he conveyed the dead man into his own cell took his place in the sack in which they had sewed up the corpse and awaited the moment of interment   14.538390255137971
the duke frowned the officer felt the point of the poniard which having penetrated through his clothes was close to his heart   7.4130624521246276
during the drive night had set in and darkness gave the surroundings the artificial appearance of a scene on the stage   19.676313151574377
it was because you loved me well enough to give me one of those sweet means of death of which we were speaking   7.118270166637056
half an hour s rest is enough replied the gascon   7.979665480825033
cries of live the king   10.04126975196693
doubtless said aramis for we not only require to be well served in order to succeed but moreover not to fail   16.41855760168567
m   8.581888015085145
he sat up in bed and a cold sweat broke out upon his brow   10.416699679562363
would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills   11.85211421797075
it would be very easy if you much wished it   12.26825345230401
suggested porthos incessantly thinking how his greatness must be irksome to inferior people   7.239087509676703
oh let them come in   6.260759573507305
villefort stepped forward two or three paces and beheld his child lying no doubt asleep on the sofa   11.087746713953386
the prisoner followed his guide who led him into a room almost under ground whose bare and reeking walls seemed as though impregnated with tears   8.401371888687827
he entreated to be allowed to walk about to have fresh air books and writing materials   19.306004322996028
which implies that we may die of hunger said aramis   15.234361625148017
i purchased mine at constantinople   12.821349044178358
athos turned pale   10.799022358510207
but on that indeed he was intractable   9.663801960174812
and then all things being accomplished to the satisfaction of the cardinal to come to him and claim her vengeance   17.493141345124318
but we want something else replied the gascon   2.87321994072329
but can he understand you   10.888352620983403
30203m how do you know   7.237603801665216
i say that i have reflected   17.89691344414373
then you would have killed monsieur de marsillac if he had come alone to attack you instead of at the head of twenty men   12.165260086109177
but when they had finished their harangues not one of them could say so calm remained her face whether or no she had heard them   18.69915531875796
now let us everyone retire to his own home said d artagnan as if he had done nothing but command all his life   9.60048714288824
keep the commission d artagnan   12.388835315545691
so serious sire that when the circumstance surprised me in the midst of a family festival on the very day of my betrothal i left my bride and friends postponing everything that i might hasten to lay at your majesty s feet the fears which impressed me and the assurance of my devotion   10.37893422025531
asked debray   2.3457482561063436
attracted by the sound of voices she had feebly dragged herself down the stairs and seated on the lower step head on knees she had listened to the foregoing conversation   11.971302816086297
it must be worth one s while to stoop andrea when that good m   2.285246510418638
they questioned   14.235574470143103
two hours and a quarter that is nothing   12.77823016433881
you see i destroy it   5.9853290302979545
morrel listened to catch the last sound of her dress brushing the branches and of her footstep on the gravel then raised his eyes with an ineffable smile of thankfulness to heaven for being permitted to be thus loved and then also disappeared   15.69603528860881
that is not an answer replied athos   13.970192071343236
d artagnan knows that terrible secret which she has sworn no one shall know without dying   17.19170514504468
he recollected the prayers his mother had taught him and discovered a new meaning in every word   8.42510692070664
oh their heads are soon cut off said danglars   15.593574652442667
the letter of madame de chevreuse   6.0976329484566225
de tréville was informed by d artagnan and porthos of the circumstance   14.823783211524436
what an abyss   15.754349903996355
ah every one seems to be going to see the queen of england   13.47554836721645
i therefore purchased immediately as many shares as i could of the haitian debt and i gained 400 000 francs by it of which 100 000 have been honestly paid to you   13.037730184796944
grimaud was still the same and therefore he retained the entire confidence of his superior la ramee who now relied upon him more than he did upon himself for as we have said la ramee felt at the bottom of his heart a certain weakness for monsieur de beaufort   18.085036585300557
in the excess of his zeal he had accompanied the cart containing the scaffolding as far as the king s window and one of the crossbeams fell on his leg and broke it   18.786845551603562
i have made a bargain   8.3663922079411
but the queen not the less deserves all my anger   15.177172724976959
said morrel   9.576617231733099
i wished to punish myself but he has pardoned me   6.898050102446024
after which he mounted his horse and set off in the direction of surgères which was likewise the way to paris   9.922424656551645
what is monsieur voiture ill   9.06931104233052
and aramis said the duchess quickly   7.284669681433209
how should he be   11.563223423980407
what letters were marked on the linen   2.288201910508853
aramis smiled   11.287235878649907
pardon monsieur but i doubt whether he can see you at this moment   17.736845514762088
making a sign to la houdinière and cahusac to stop he alighted from his horse and went toward these suspected merry companions hoping by means of the sand which deadened the sound of his steps and of the hedge which concealed his approach to catch some words of this conversation which appeared so interesting   6.507765008431456
they have with them two corsican bandits   14.502857624614823
cried morrel with one hand leaning on the back of the chair and the other extended towards valentine   18.412022649850236
then i should become simply no   12.058347884422059
if you wish to see me the king s attorney you must desire for me some of those violent and dangerous diseases from the cure of which so much honor redounds to the physician   9.166142055445968
the number of lights had been intentionally diminished but the young woman could not conceal the traces of the fever which had devoured her for two days   15.145794136141136
but he said mouston is not so young as he was my dear fellow   17.056121588438135
he threw himself upon it and fell asleep   21.13060365004861
but today i find you are drawing on mine and that your apprenticeship may cost me 700 000 francs per month   8.703701321975828
and if i have come my dear father said gérard drawing closer to m   16.166977273445813
the devil   9.64108750965254
and pray that if you should ever be in a similar predicament he may do as much for you as he did for me   19.339291221224833
franz remained with m   13.189222395743553
repeated he within himself   7.276516118106453
the countess said morcerf was at her toilet when she was informed of the visit she was about to receive   11.054748113652312
we are very happy monsieur replied julie   5.923879199519537
21 in molière s comedy le misanthrope   11.989954365577072
said mazarin to himself what a sweet face   10.876575864265625
yes but on one condition that we begin by the coadjutor   14.822993348047136
he saw as though in a mist a black figure kneeling and buried in a confused mass of white drapery   13.458306654204607
i was taken to versailles   4.297554648679517
i am not selfish as you are   7.656810481526834
but it s all my fault   21.447230064095628
de tréville confiding to him candidly the importance of his departure when the news was transmitted to him as well as to his three friends that the king was about to set out for paris with an escort of twenty musketeers and that they formed part of the escort   8.666570847586692
20207m ground arms exclaimed the chief with an imperative sign of the hand while with the other he took off his hat respectfully   9.003390439980304
an abdication   11.352106962156084
do you intend to sit up for me   14.092561327312877
he pardoned and having pardoned he remained   16.206468694368034
monseigneur i see well that i must call grimaud   13.136815466928445
if it belongs to monsieur porthos i wish him joy   21.719868762399273
a telegraph   12.208018214575388
indeed said the cardinal whatever repugnance i may have to directing my mind to such a treason your majesty compels me to think of it   15.354272420843674
no accident has happened to him   11.448059244656447
i am now quite at your service gentlemen said he   12.135938023227084
you see it is yourself who have first named her you her father   15.62920969241229
in the name of heaven explain yourself   9.833156131186465
by a tailor a coachmaker a brewer   14.566059274550803
said he with a broad marseillaise accent and a grin that displayed his ivory white teeth   12.729096698778894
the executioner is still in the cellar where i presume he has had an interview with mine host s bottles   16.52680854224889
during this conversation dantès after having exchanged a cheerful shake of the hand with all his sympathizing friends had surrendered himself to the officer sent to arrest him merely saying make yourselves quite easy my good fellows there is some little mistake to clear up that s all depend upon it   7.866547416552998
one morning the gardener went to him and told him as if to please him that he was going to plant a bed of asparagus for his especial use   16.093399576528807
asked beauchamp   10.65030966505068
why have you not done so   8.197222268006387
now i thought that the butcher would not let his horse out like that without knowing where it was going   12.073147075385094
have you seen him   12.464861133024497
let us give the money to the lackeys not to our lackeys but to the lackeys of the englishmen   15.734004863667034
gentlemen   11.178159279431785
he thought it would be better to transact business with his old acquaintance so he sent for peppino   15.905760051460518
i am rich for you have one of the first fortunes in france   16.737814856307903
and feeling in his pocket he took thence a small pocket book which contained ten bank notes each of 1 000 francs   6.29241019403348
he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight   11.679002636230411
yes yes he said i will pardon you if you tell me all   9.301351573832028
the host gave them another chamber and served them with fresh eggs and some water which athos went himself to draw at the fountain   15.691047889112397
during the six years which had passed since noirtier first fell into this sad state valentine s powers of invention had been too often put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients for gaining a knowledge of his wishes and the constant practice had so perfected her in the art that she guessed the old man s meaning as quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted   14.342082540095825
then ali brought on the dessert or rather took the baskets from the hands of the statues and placed them on the table   10.157703539856302
said the young man   6.629615417624821
yesterday morning it appears franz declined the honor   13.344817213412414
said beauchamp with the paper in your hand my friend i need not tell you the cause of my visit   11.752183879198066
but i give you my word morrel that god who does know it will be on our side   16.097317122557797
several persons hurried up to m   10.002351849441615
cried d artagnan springing forward in his turn after the servant   11.35707820997838
a second hearse decked with the same funereal pomp was brought to m   19.279525571044083
who is that swiss   15.05081656321467
the nervous excitement of which we speak pursued valentine even in her sleep or rather in that state of somnolence which succeeded her waking hours   5.611968757725746
this calm tone and perfect ease made andrea feel that he was for the moment restrained by a more muscular hand than his own and that the restraint could not be easily broken through   7.056580595109053
i am no longer astonished that you knew me not   15.011612857009958
morrel took the head of his son between his two hands drew him forward and kissing his forehead several times said oh yes yes i bless you in my own name and in the name of three generations of irreproachable men who say through me the edifice which misfortune has destroyed providence may build up again   12.51587414805207
trial chapter lxvi   12.376597867498392
very well   13.397256475538233
and yet added he with a coldly menacing expression he annoys me   8.144342155025232
dead on the scaffold   12.473911314544006
twice or thrice thrusts were attempted on both sides without effect   9.410587886536627
asked lord de winter sternly   8.95457160367374
she said   12.988364643290204
the casket would encumber you   6.1956893689236106
then leaping down from his bed he went to the window and pulling aside the curtain tried to distinguish the figures outside but in vain   17.199109251950738
but i doubt it for his accent is bad and his pronunciation defective   6.525871634174352
you have given your word then   12.542027748388636
not badly by any means said the young man   14.114885802318753
still young for he was scarcely forty six years of age he possessed great elegance of form and was above the middle height   18.913167830143482
allow me to observe madame said the count with that kind tone he could assume so well you are really very severe with that dear clever child   13.392239841384434
yes returned the count i know who he is gentlemen   12.805681130955131
said athos   8.565196173220812
the riot becomes a revolution   16.641027088351546
on our honor as gentlemen   11.845603595586025
but i give you leave to try them upon this one   17.504252896194465
but where can i get a chisel to take the planks out a gimlet to pierce the cask   15.914163645573712
my lord de winter continued athos what is the penalty you demand against this woman   13.108758883451562
meanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast had got some water from a spring spread out the fruit and bread and cooked the kid   11.547120779079373
in fact tightly held as he was lubin endeavored still to cry out   6.623243678724387
here and there a dog barked behind a door or an affrighted cat fled precipitately from the midst of the pavement to take refuge behind a pile of faggots from which retreat her eyes would shine like peridores   12.189121165434724
oh no never mind that said the italian   14.108103181483743
i will give in my resignation as captain of the king s musketeers to take a lieutenancy in the cardinal s guards and if he refuses me morbleu   17.221633802839623
i don t know them but the four other noblemen called the englishman my lord   9.010174655351943
his eyes remained open and menacing   14.89024134687468
the inquiries soon commenced   17.594739186596932
yes so it is between perfectly upright people   10.909948030697151
no   17.612725302037198
ah i am sure he has not sold the house for what he gave for it   10.345595827001077
there you see it will not take long   15.605827507603175
yes   9.225099346348623
ing invited to dine by his holiness   11.426388163538517
and the three friends did not exchange another word till they reached their quarters except to give the watchword to the sentinels   13.79915278375098
everything considered you are very well off here   13.832007343111774
don t be in a hurry to weave crowns for our scotchman   12.38034580655178
the carriages could not move about   9.523340447455341
he is in a very picturesque place do you know the catacombs of st   18.410635169422875
and barrois turned towards noirtier who immovably fixed in his armchair was contemplating this terrible scene without allowing a word or a movement to escape him   16.362287990014142
the illustrious planchet   16.308560074346605
but who however behaved himself so admirably on this occasion that i will take the liberty of recommending him to your majesty   12.540080423961736
he took a seat and quietly awaited the arrival of the notary   11.342749090233303
no there is nothing in the world to resemble you in worth and goodness   2.6700985398555765
but as against the side of this pony rattled a sword of respectable length and as over this sword gleamed an eye rather ferocious than haughty these passers by repressed their hilarity or if hilarity prevailed over prudence they endeavored to laugh only on one side like the masks of the ancients   9.802232263573426
ah true replied the jeweller and he reset the stone   7.182893370254626
and you followed the business of a tailor   11.04172884783816
at this moment barrois entered   18.044015561943354
villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry which however improbable it might be if it did take place would leave him defenceless   15.007232119029663
but she herself felt that it was a kiss of no greater warmth than he would have bestowed on the hand of some marble statue of a saint   12.11373732673784
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions   9.502970464577817
and therefore when all paris was rejoicing in the expected return of the king appointed for the next day gondy alone in the midst of the general happiness was dissatisfied   20.26332457659457
morrel is utterly ruined   9.29063380558469
why this very morning in my rooms he made his entrée amongst us by striking every man of us with amazement not even excepting château renaud   13.527246710036891
a rich uniform half french half oriental set off his graceful and stalwart figure and his broad chest was decorated with the order of the legion of honor   15.133184811621584
but he had gone farther than athos for at the village of festubert while drinking at an inn he had learned without needing to ask a question that the evening before at half past eight a wounded man who accompanied a lady traveling in a post chaise had been obliged to stop unable to go further   7.388097587740847
if not before louvres thirty   14.811923056353566
i beg your pardon said aramis noticing his awkwardness   19.365183813845466
certes cried athos you are the best mounted poet of france or navarre   17.995544980706505
my dear said villefort in answer to his wife you know i have never been accustomed to play the patriarch in my family nor have i ever considered that the fate of a universe was to be decided by my nod   19.761796162800124
two of my good friends lord wilmore and the abbé busoni   6.551032976164532
and what do you find in it that is worthy of blame   2.1957329002990456
he has consented to enter the service of your keeper and to shut himself up at vincennes with you in order to prepare and assist your escape which we are contriving   10.057860553225806
this is the matter gentlemen   15.642389505577412
does his action appear like that of an enemy   19.276079688530437
this idea while darkening his brow drew several sighs from him and caused him to formulate to himself a few vows of vengeance   14.930552969378754
tell me   9.652128543333161
exactly so   14.263352597335908
tired   12.8703970143936
yes that i have suffered   7.410274239082725
d artagnan i am ready to follow you   11.748753006392587
moses the servant of god he was but a servant please to understand moses blessed with the hands   13.6381232741433
at the first sound of the bell they hastened into the corso by the via vittoria   13.08308764031793
and had started again on his journey saying that he should sleep at noyon   13.583198888074218
perhaps we shall have to make certain conditions therefore a solemn conference is indispensable   15.226132091805418
selim still holding in his hand the lighted match walked towards the opening in the cavern and aided by the faint light which streamed in through the mouth of the cave picked up the token   15.250824246255462
we will have him informed that his sister in law is on the point of having someone assassinated and beg him not to lose sight of her   11.254776791005922
it means that monsieur de richelieu was able to find trusty servants dozens and dozens of them   8.908905592566072
i will inquire said morrel   8.48311593851689
the baron knows as well as myself that milady de winter is a very guilty woman and it is treating her very favorably to commute her punishment to transportation   5.551331211840057
the queen smiling made a sign with her head   11.21077691397881
what did you say   16.902626708846523
d avrigny recommended the attention of the priest to the living as well as to the dead and the abbé promised to devote his prayers to valentine and his attentions to noirtier   13.83004605327541
the absence of grimaud whose name had never once been uttered by athos gave d artagnan uneasiness   13.99265952795772
the footman was withdrawing but athos stopped him by a sign   9.38656413247754
and why   13.267288149121908
and i shall find your eminence ready   13.9772234584306
come do you know of what the count of monte cristo is capable   17.78985954625448
why that question my dear host   12.156323870636887
the countess placed herself before monte cristo still holding in her hand a portion of the perfumed grapes   9.984794620210032
this kiosk appeared to me to be at a considerable distance perhaps on account of the darkness of the night which prevented any object from being more than partially discerned   4.3904155873299
tis off one of my sheep   10.097060705084656
which is not the part of a gentleman   8.666360239016766
d artagnan was thoughtful and seemed for the moment to have lost his usual loquacity   10.271234977339754
in the second were ranged bars of unpolished gold which possessed nothing attractive save their value   13.162103109699213
you are punctual said he as he drew back the door   14.695450348712422
will you tell me what you require in order to set your conscience quite at ease on the subject   14.22449128641286
god save the king   7.34609658538311
what then would be the use of all i have suffered   12.849699697091232
has the host told you nothing then   15.835072466202808
besides what would the sailors say   0.7918430897384958
he was inquired after but no one had seen him   8.060973825351269
you will leave france you will return to england   14.498816553577376
motionless with her burning and fixed glances in her solitary apartment how well the outbursts of passion which at times escape from the depths of her chest with her respiration accompany the sound of the surf which rises growls roars and breaks itself like an eternal and powerless despair against the rocks on which is built this dark and lofty castle   15.093984606742627
i have a presentiment that we shall   18.127563395654857
meanwhile the guests seeing that the two friends were longing to be alone prepared to depart when a noise of dogs barking resounded through the courtyard and many persons said at the same moment ah   19.4962414394127
to beg him to assist me in finding my wife   14.842211043170325
she prevailed upon him to leave the country   12.84170761811167
i admire candor   7.100141551911425
imprisonment menaces ill treatment she has suffered everything   9.875256667095842
i have the honor to be with respect etc   11.121978567009723
the count was of the highest nobility   4.029734476550347
you saw your wi hush   9.569435328166298
but while they were watching the departure of the count morrel had quitted his post and château renaud failing in his search joined debray and beauchamp   14.772094281113109
he wore a large brown mantle one fold of which thrown over his left shoulder served likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance while the upper part was completely hidden by his broad brimmed hat   14.38242566521227
to follow out my simile your skin has been opened by bleeding and this if repeated three or four times will cause death so pay attention to it my dear monsieur danglars   10.302013687384816
15 on the corner of a mantelpiece in a small room on the fifth floor   14.85228121626158
besides who knows whether divided we may not obtain a pardon you from the queen we from mazarin which were we all four together would never be granted   6.455629620827606
opinions held in common are a ready bond of union   13.852657658230285
tell us then d artagnan   13.519053831865943
ah   10.615177834321269
then the idea seized him that he had read incorrectly and that the appointment was for eleven o clock   8.83634227112926
then in spite of the wind and rain he fell into the deep sweet sleep of utter exhaustion   17.796032995041646
at this moment planchet entered to inform his master that the horses were sufficiently refreshed and that it would be possible to sleep at clermont   11.597713787617538
noirtier nodded his head   8.772602626279744
yes monsieur said d artagnan bowing we have had that honor   6.934822227339318
as i had nothing more to do at versailles i went to auteuil and gained all the information i could   12.69958464948229
i indeed invited them here today on your account   12.259810145801538
the comtesse de morcerf   7.550585419551501
but it is almost always sold by lackeys   20.996988667091355
i can not swim and dared not throw myself into the river   14.999903731429903

but you were just speaking on a very interesting topic beauchamp   12.242925563282913
attorney but how do you know all this   4.7320786992971104
not one of these glances nor one sigh was lost on her   6.903980278054463
the first person who sees her   12.744495894061448
what would the abbé please to have   15.040476855840062
poor fellow   11.508470369430844
yes   11.098990679418433
franz went in with his eyes blindfolded and was waited on by mutes and by women to whom cleopatra was a painted strumpet   11.056583399467794
de villefort replied the doctor my first duty is to humanity   19.61596407256598
exclaimed the procureur with a haggard expression   11.318375843501645
they will all disappear like the fabrics children build with cards and which fall one by one under the breath of their builder even if there are two hundred of them   9.63763798672198
p   8.083641124982197
he knew her well enough in all cases to know that whether acting for or against him as a friend or an enemy she would not remain motionless without great impediments   11.913264506836901
i know the french as well as if i had made them myself   20.100615055421272
stay marechal   4.726923565519656
excuse me said the banker but you will tire yourself baroness by such late hours and m   12.308196814222622
i will tell you what that is   12.928325589489615
jump in   7.804843040205616
come come murmured d artagnan rochefort has kept his promise but where in the devil is he   11.29590220382871
since she lodges with him   9.533633462998901
cavalcanti said andrea taking the major by the arm in a confidential manner how much are you paid for being my father   18.085013908345054
he was nay probably may still be a bonapartist and is called noirtier   11.465278775529725
you yourself gave me this comb   11.471606038861431
in twenty minutes they were at auteuil   17.757910069896198
four of the guards who were constantly near the prisoner assisted in picking up the tennis balls   11.092396066250647
yes the gascon answered   10.891451794850887
haydée is almost as civilized as a parisian   8.516160747617937
haydée still calm but with a calmness more dreadful than the anger of another would have been handed to the president the record of her sale written in arabic   16.86139239256513
they were in the majority   14.006125602142998
but you have by the step you have taken called my attention to the paragraph in question and it will remain until it shall be either contradicted or confirmed by someone who has a right to do so   11.156207434552341
well you will have distractions enough gentlemen be assured said d artagnan   11.885197627903151
milady was not a woman to misunderstand the meaning of this hesitation   12.819886287667371
monsieur the cardinal mazarin has been so kind as to think of me he said   15.703707706584108
gladly availing himself of this opportunity the coachman leaped from his box   18.844556968652324
never mind take these   13.585481098388112
sign it then   13.830073037441567
if we are arrested it is a matter of the place de greve   9.81428093360925
if i should be killed one of you must take it and continue the route   14.010466047977088
how   5.934106227791362
heyday madame   11.947287089556715
no   13.955527509101906

the street was laid out a name was chosen and posted up on an iron plate but before construction was begun it occurred to the possessor of the property that a handsome sum might be obtained for the ground then devoted to fruits and vegetables by building along the line of the proposed street and so making it a branch of communication with the faubourg saint honoré itself one of the most important thoroughfares in the city of paris   8.61770392308097
when he drew near to the bedroom door monte cristo expected that he was coming in and raised one of his pistols   9.326665992252053
monte cristo pressed his forehead on his burning hands as if his brain could no longer bear alone the weight of its thoughts   18.02565767818359
and my happiness at your escape from the danger that threatened you is redoubled by the consciousness that i have been the unwilling and the unintentional cause of all the peril you have incurred   11.610392270371372
i love most fondly i love madly i love as a man who would give his life blood to spare her a tear i love valentine de villefort who is being murdered at this moment   6.945579757358131

monsieur you run no risk for as i told you i will stay here   7.8946278335772515
i know it because yesterday monsieur de wardes in a saloon where i was showed a ring which he said he had received from you   8.129619190426581
yes if he be poor and inexperienced not if he be rich and skilful   2.869165335129951
noirtier looked at valentine to impose silence but she did not notice him   9.417636490368825
you know the interest we both take in this poor little madame bonacieux   9.312433058159263
the breakfast chapter 41   5.529351948859016
i take back the ring after it has passed through the hands of that infamous creature   16.069289343820543
albert who was a great smoker and who had considered it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars of the café de paris approached the table and uttered a cry of joy at perceiving some veritable puros   6.810965084091706
then said the count i refer you to your confessor   8.640031211608544
however as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last chance and making them understand that they were condemned to perpetual imprisonment a new misfortune befell them   11.338096614813214
there is a horse while on the contrary the hundred pistoles feed their master   12.275302151791843
cried albert   14.603999391138174
then he has not returned   13.527887299247173
the doctor went out first followed by m   15.172865463808261
that s good said albert with a gloomy tone   11.798572425458994

vampa in this attire resembled a painting by léopold robert or schnetz   17.149065221259708
gondy gazed on these deeds of darkness on these nocturnal laborers with a kind of fear   9.410992214501272

in six hours they reached compiegne and alighted at the peacock   16.310357957341058
at the extremity of the courtyard where close to a portico formed of ionic columns were the dog kennels rose an oblong building the pavilion of the orangery a half circle inclosing the court of honor   11.20243361692104
i should find there people who would force me to understand things of which i would prefer to remain ignorant and who would try to explain to me in spite of myself a mystery which even they do not understand   15.987025871112271
they are sixty feet high and i doubt if monsieur de beaufort is sufficiently weary of life to risk his neck by jumping off   11.448326152205443
behold nebuchadnezzar   11.915562110015589
and i also said franz   10.300340956924028

if he comes   9.459765172819752
to my great regret mordieu   10.780812244219948
at these words he rose and put off his frock coat and cravat went towards a table on which lay his son s toilet articles lathered his face took a razor and with a firm hand cut off the compromising whiskers   22.309397263546103
monsieur d artagnan is not rich and has need of his position as lieutenant to enable him to live   8.906339797287131
oh no monsieur d artagnan said raoul you are such a brave gentleman and the comte de la fere has so much affection for you   16.26194014733877
you may perhaps have hidden a thought   20.517060290947235
you jest i presume   10.635363337957575
but monsieur mazarin is a mean wretch who won t dispossess himself of his diamond in my favor   18.440077823513295
but my dear fellow those are things that bear postponement and you must put it off especially with so good an excuse to give on your return yes if i return   12.644774118821045
many citizens seeing the women flying toward the high street leaving their children crying at the open doors hastened to don the cuirass and supporting their somewhat uncertain courage with a musket or a partisan directed their steps toward the hostelry of the jolly miller before which was gathered increasing every minute a compact group vociferous and full of curiosity   5.070080111085565
you may torture torment kill me but you shall not have my signature again   14.994173214942718
at the mention of the monk grimaud became pale   12.10175323502334
madame will be tired tonight continued monte cristo and will no doubt wish to rest   8.252360990030313
now there were two to be supported and nothing to live upon   13.278311248638335
come gentlemen said he they are beating the tattoo   14.743673686586051
the slightest rustling of the foliage the least whistling of the wind attracted his attention and drew the perspiration to his brow   16.38840716613096
i shall therefore overlook your frivolous remarks   10.191433011329334
his recital finished the abbé reflected long and earnestly   6.257774614486236
my voluntary confession of the assassination at auteuil proved to him that i had not committed that of which i stood accused   11.597393220971192

but at length the two englishmen felt ashamed to draw back and the angrier one descended the five or six steps which led to the cellar and gave a kick against the door enough to split a wall   14.52233996259941
it would be impossible   8.262102139128569
porthos made no remark but obeyed with the sublime confidence he had in his friend   16.01299468413597
if you are old i will be your son   13.420321309655524
remember answered the abbé calmly as he replaced the jewel and its case in the pocket of his cassock it is your fault not mine that i do so   7.1878211303236705
what ails you   14.930150806078274
whether she goes there or not my opinion is still the same returned albert   15.600635612987368
repeated debray   5.54951425805909
is it thus you perform your charge monsieur   19.46257622112597
the very same day the occupants of the apartments on the fifth floor of the house now become the property of dantès were duly informed by the notary who had arranged the necessary transfer of deeds etc   15.41693154465718
the housemaid who had been in mademoiselle valentine s room and the servant who had replaced barrois ran in at the same moment   8.622088054675618
good   17.00639461393811
they might not be satisfied and ah ha thought danglars this is not so much like paris except that i shall probably be skinned   13.829024170473627
i know it monsieur   10.730669202559843
why should we not be   11.057305048671813
as you wish then   12.005662454710315
four shallops came off with very little noise alongside the lugger which no doubt in acknowledgement of the compliment lowered her own shallop into the sea and the five boats worked so well that by two o clock in the morning all the cargo was out of la jeune amélie and on terra firma   12.56013663737043
she wore the picturesque costume of the catalan fisherwomen a red and black bodice and golden pins in her hair   13.567946653076422
au revoir then   8.1938323991548
that is my name said athos quietly   12.801599220182492
it resulted from this that the real stake in this game which two most powerful kingdoms played for the good pleasure of two amorous men was simply a kind look from anne of austria   13.054451799313249
if you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the question i believe there is nothing to say against him and that you will be content with the way in which he has performed his duty   13.857873220256966
the history of the scuttled vessels which had appeared improbable during the day seemed very probable at night   15.533667072514962
go on   10.405652191949928
particularly when they have still a full bottle before them added danglars   13.77621050559312
madame is searching for you everywhere   12.898418482102597
those who were to fly with the court had the word of command and they were each severally desired to be from twelve o clock to one at cours la reine   11.29919595890326
from time to time chills ran through his whole body and clutched his heart in a grasp of ice   7.854514562282697
and do you comprehend grimaud   10.872333111130393
but these suspicions appeared to be disagreeable to monsieur the commissary and i no longer have them   9.089026479163966
the count withdrew his foot   9.974498290143512
who has been here   14.953520768541766
albert i am bound to give you credit for having hit upon a most capital idea   17.848626126736335
and at all events it is more difficult to replace a man in the fort l evêque or the bastille who has got out than to keep a prisoner there who is in   14.506761526916748
his glance was so full of hate of ferocity and savage impatience that villefort turned out of the path he had been pursuing to see upon what person this dark look was directed   9.780184787625998
what   13.81731635508913
replied m   14.767261086671127
but his person was so admirably shaped and so well proportioned that more than once in his struggles with porthos he had overcome the giant whose physical strength was proverbial among the musketeers   7.147845314759516
one morning he threatened her with the severest consequences if she did not supply him with what he desired and disappeared and remained away all day leaving the kind hearted assunta who loved him as if he were her own child to weep over his conduct and bewail his absence   14.450253788191835
let us be open with each other and sincere   15.030051135458354
cried the citizen   6.650456923761575
this noirtier was his father   10.418073620216875
the young man s words sounded to him like metal and he thought he could hear the rushing of cascades of louis   11.148418665809324
yes indeed count said madame danglars   7.618065709791801
which are your windows   12.4515749496042
indeed i expected it for it is a family inheritance   3.3826788482671404
and did you convey this answer to your guest   7.781617353250225
now i remember quite well that on the table round which they were sitting were pens ink and paper   10.79065172868518
but the mazzolata still remains which is a very curious punishment when seen for the first time and even the second while the other as you must know is very simple   15.872509339258905
and i swear to make all the sacrifices which this word imposes sir said morrel not only with resignation but with cheerfulness   10.091176571656007
you are a model for regular people   9.265850568007009

delaunay   7.262826115216271
women weep for the dead   13.870551824905075
danglars therefore concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the illustrious descendant of the cavalcanti who most likely in lucca fed upon trout brought from switzerland and lobsters sent from england by the same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from lake fusaro and the sterlet from the volga   14.011513555907804
and from time to time his cheeks flushed his brow darkened and a mist passed over his eyes   16.23675054871597
so dressed he really appeared the first gentleman of his kingdom   17.752221593073433
therefore i am delighted to be able thus publicly to mark my gratitude and my esteem   14.284938291159996
and the troop grumbling angrily disappeared in the darkness and took the road to paris   10.33092674563392
d artagnan saw clearly that he would get nothing out of this man who was evidently telling a falsehood in his pretended ignorance of the abode of aramis but whose lies were bold and decided   17.53466608809304
the king is either a king or no king   13.660701105104055
during this time the executioner had raised his mace and signed to them to get out of the way   14.418869943550899
answered danglars   14.351117397967172
d   12.52150262701845
my lord you have abused the royal power which you have almost usurped   11.589078111770771
they both set off to the other end of the camp but as it did not cover more than a surface of five hundred feet they quickly arrived at the tent they were looking for   10.479542277020697
e   8.06720264202698
you frighten me   12.384471851517606
the stranger might have numbered sixty or sixty five years   11.625193647991878
oh replied morcerf reddening slightly i have left the service monsieur   9.169562514290874
alas   11.6635416245527
still they did not show signs of wear and the fine cloth beneath the careful hands of the prisoner soon recovered its gloss in the parts which were still perfect for the wearer tried his best to make it assume the appearance of a new coat   15.183798151336322
what scotch   13.211490652638107
villefort rushed into the room   15.761420741610799
yes was the laconic reply   22.815502458451867
but as you have said two that are a match for twenty said athos   5.481243546158454
i too am going   17.137715543096068

mademoiselle d armilly whom they then perceived through the open doorway formed with eugénie one of the tableaux vivants of which the germans are so fond   9.177631953959095
do you really believe i can acquire all these things in so short a time   15.836073931125146
martin he would call for him on his way   15.450520067142966
for i begin to suffer again   7.553751586067524
for the last month this wretched house had presented the gloomy appearance of a lazaretto infected with the plague   10.823475200013787
i swear to you princess that if your reputation did not depend on precautions and if my life alone were jeopardized yes yes   10.468583166919371
and thou hast left him noble honored powerful for the ruin of us all   19.793245160371054
and for that reason he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate and to clear his memory should any foul spot or stain have fallen on it   7.396564942049255
tis not too warm to walk resumed d artagnan   11.416911497450917
you are going to make a patriarch of him   10.53807303934446
pardieu said i my good gentleman i have a horse to sell too   10.616938828504356
by this time his haggard eyes had the appearance of being ready to start from their sockets   12.595690270527086
there was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order to talk over and settle the affair   13.211364225314533
it was an entire army   21.4771840973203
valentine seized the count s hand and in her irresistible impulse of joy carried it to her lips   7.078980395000374
oh   12.015041716637185
a carriage had been sent to meet him and the gigantic porthos who stood a head above the entire rabble soon announced that he saw the royal equipage approaching   16.68738355305331
and the king went out of the room without either embracing his mother or even bowing to the cardinal   11.212984379720814
yes that may be   14.4750026808861
the king has no authority here   18.854002973815273
well suppose instead of joining this monsieur mordaunt we were to go and join our friends   11.912514596788839
an old man decorated with the cross of saint louis now rose and proposed the health of king louis xviii   14.20541974461602
it is yours   9.765690538979147
then there will be no blood no groans no convulsions and above all no consciousness of that horrid and compromising moment of accomplishing the act then one escapes the clutch of the human law which says do not disturb society   8.802733541584267
hush   11.196429860640981
the confusion of his mind the terror which spurred him on the cries of some of the patrol who started in pursuit of him and the hooting of the people who notwithstanding the early hour were going to their work only made him precipitate his course   7.795793783663034

now the scent bag of white satin on which her cipher is embroidered in pearls   6.795889137976442
certainly dear maximilian for if it is good i will follow it   6.847093107206352

as to your rank an annual income of 50 000 livres will enable you to support it admirably   20.206383570704837
did you know me better returned the count smiling you would not give one thought of such a thing for a traveller like myself who has successively lived on macaroni at naples polenta at milan olla podrida at valencia pilau at constantinople curry in india and swallows nests in china   9.960893522209771
her lips were about to pass his sentence of life or death   10.547206615039638
but i am sure of one thing that those who laugh at him in his presence will never laugh a second time   14.590738251681604

it was to fulfil the last instructions of captain leclere who when dying gave me a packet for marshal bertrand   4.468836231803736
he then tried to slip away under pretext of giving orders to some one   9.742980294377213
then he placed at the bottom of the valise belonging to the young man a small bag of louis called olivain the lackey who had followed him from blois and made him pack the valise under his own eyes watchful to see that everything should be put in which might be useful to a young man entering on his first campaign   12.731072673524386
he has returned said he   15.937059836443977
we do not give ourselves twice over said d artagnan   15.74745628858517
you may you may sir said the queen with a bitter smile   14.168504430064297
the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber by his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching marriage of mademoiselle danglars to the count andrea cavalcanti   11.042143894104628
bonacieux would run of meeting at the convent of béthune with milady her mortal enemy   11.0513158318543
my lord there has stood for six years at your very door a man such as i describe and during those six years he has been unappreciated and unemployed by you   11.68552758833724
the cries the noise of the shot and the intoxicating smell of powder produced their usual maddening effects   11.002250080367176
40298m yes indeed sir continued eugénie still quite calm   10.721684872142408

the count will find there a charming hotel with a court and garden   13.137482726478641

she is going to have him killed said d artagnan to porthos but at all events it shall not be by me   9.979975218933493
in about ten minutes d artagnan appeared at the door followed by the inseparable porthos   18.110991100712454
in the bedroom in which this passage ended bernouin encountered madame de beauvais like himself intrusted with the secret of these subterranean love affairs   15.609430287060311
then i may tell you all   8.738104840468182

we should look like the two sons of aymon who had lost their brother   12.181733712711834
said monte cristo   2.0737352395082933
jacopo dived into the hold and soon returned with what edmond wanted   10.373529704501003
without a doubt   7.791224347914725
are you for mazarin or for the princes   12.744327600159565
i hear she said that paris is not quiet   8.873681767056878
the room resumed its obscurity   13.354035786663486
sir replied d artagnan in the calmest manner possible you are very young   9.657131208063952
certainly not replied the count   11.134894481469978
is this your counsel also winter   5.414594909135673
the proprietors of the mansion had many years before thought it best to confine themselves to the possession of the house itself with its thickly planted courtyard opening into the faubourg saint honoré and to the garden shut in by this gate which formerly communicated with a fine kitchen garden of about an acre   7.524891147386279
yes i understand perfectly said d artagnan   16.304274651073683
porthos was resplendent with joy and pride   10.873287038641774
adieu edmond adieu and thank you   9.605667845608856
he cried   9.298371023357515
monte cristo dropped his head and shrank from the vehemence of her grief   9.757482846320631
d artagnan would have been at the height of his wishes if he had not constantly seen milady like a dark cloud hovering in the horizon   8.687443736605161
i intrust to you certain papers which are at blois   10.802146298144324
cornélie obeyed and the next minute madame danglars left her room in a charming loose dress and came and sat down close to debray   10.025300579136903
let me now endeavor to make you forget this temporary unpleasantness and offer you what no doubt you did not expect to find here that is to say a tolerable supper and pretty comfortable beds   7.918149637704472
but i thought you were a catalan and they told me the catalans were not men to allow themselves to be supplanted by a rival   12.990851396693685
oh now i may say so   17.853033682946403
oh yes my friend   11.39524541538785
d artagnan seized the hand held out to him and kissed it ardently   7.27237038846769
what does the angel of light or the angel of darkness say to that mind at once implacable and generous   16.259648135673054
but if we do risk being killed said porthos at least i should like to know what for   5.544287315296683
she must have spoken   14.625876650498368
pardieu   7.179027698823634
well then listen valentine said the count   18.023128764845055
we are cousins it appears monsieur porthos   12.742588579670864
said the old man   11.418334464996267
asked the wounded man fixing his half opened eyes on grimaud   23.550698385077403
that charming young woman with her is her daughter   14.695916344302578
bazin perceived he was wrong   11.815961554424407
porthos didn t understand any too clearly   10.639807024453534
the only time i have worn these studs was at a ball given by the king eight days ago at windsor   15.235045649843954
he then drew the pin from his cravat and placed it on the paper   15.394885907435373
what should you do in my place   11.460275416491159
he learned their numbers instead   14.76499737444078
the air they breathed was heavy damp and cold   8.571393382374309
thank you sir thank you   10.746513560764985
d artagnan did not know london   20.25971140066176
do not be too hasty m   15.763264587496439
and now that you have all you want and that we understand each other jump down from the tilbury and disappear   18.701341614387687
i have done with him all that could be done   6.393041353001403
said the cardinal opening the door   13.435062844555661
truth my friend   10.872925879180407
lord   10.053093127351682
we will see after the worthy mercer later   17.809128252554554
and what are my instructions   10.47111734273907
the young man in reply took up the chisel bent it into the form of a horseshoe and then as readily straightened it   10.364231000403006
each fish was brought over in a cask one filled with river herbs and weeds the other with rushes and lake plants   11.74136720972364
i will continue then resumed aramis   18.146043348355217
by whom are you charged   9.973814025208764
ah grandmamma murmured valentine pressing her lips on the burning brow do you wish to kill me   11.333513408339831
said d artagnan   9.761628620749722
you will send him to me   13.810596376110729
unfasten it or i will break it in   20.26887594427671
as for the remission of your sins we have the archbishop of paris who has the very greatest power at the court of rome and even the coadjutor who possesses some plenary indulgences   4.876364051704587
but are you well assured sir   11.682915905216941
only think then if mademoiselle danglars instead of being called claire marie eugénie had been named mademoiselle chastity modesty innocence danglars   6.918295462448872
besides the king i am certain awaits your majesty s reply before risking anything   9.495902361660164
ali has many faults mixed with most excellent qualities   8.445075082510565
a man who accustoms himself to live in such a world of poetry and imagination must find far too little excitement in a common every day sort of attachment such as ours   10.919518964446267
then was heard that second cry not so loud as the first and followed by a long groan   12.700780508079962
but we have not seen him   11.610701240460207
the clock struck half past eight and still another half hour was passed in waiting while morrel walked to and fro and gazed more and more frequently through the opening   12.038414607780641
i did not sleep well   15.12225666041128
the count of monte cristo   16.807391654103586
oh that would be too much   21.939744537492604
ah   10.168783374228221
no   15.309341637449215
well madame in that case my advice i know that i am very bold to offer advice to your majesty my advice is that the king should not leave his kingdom   5.271515754010417
and madame de villefort were beginning to speak in parables appeared to pay no attention to the conversation and feigned to be busily engaged in watching edward who was mischievously pouring some ink into the bird s water glass   11.345294513673418
i think only that i have known you not a whole year   6.184224499249001
listen he said   12.508634207753266
monsieur said d artagnan you must excuse famished travelers   20.97861738592715
the carriages that drove up to the door were compelled to turn to avoid a fountain that played in a basin of rockwork an ornament that had excited the jealousy of the whole quarter and had gained for the place the appellation of the little versailles   10.136128925553614
to the sheets said he   6.471334268219482
the little company started off at a trot on the road to cambrin where they expected to find the prince   8.822464733228902
we are judges of wounds we old soldiers athos added smiling   10.133046938864958
five minutes afterwards the curtain falls and the spectators depart   7.633348194655357
you will have the more time to learn to draw it only when it ought to be used   18.248633887374126
planchet took the crossroad and by seven o clock in the morning he was at armentières   15.876364946087246
still what   18.40887192071228
general quesnel it appears had just left a bonapartist club when he disappeared   10.599927671664853
having bowed to the two ladies he extended his hand to debray   11.733283191964103
cried d artagnan   7.644768222404964
de wardes must take his departure still in obscurity   10.708321997809927
and this is the more strange since the least contradiction keeps him awake all night   5.085015550918742
were he at paris and a frequenter of the theatres i should say he was a poor devil literally mad   11.54295418690589
go go at once   8.964892460698966
this sleep provincial as it was brought him to nine o clock in the morning   11.363045681857125
i told you we were informed beforehand   18.597669341273054
consequently you can understand that it is not at all likely i shall ever deny my parent   8.195326167875033
the same day the young man set forward on his journey furnished with the three paternal gifts which consisted as we have said of fifteen crowns the horse and the letter for m   11.041592009090685
are you come to fetch me   13.429639311508584
here begins the trial   7.151664319049407
asked the owner   10.590976079537043
said d artagnan monseigneur knows very well that her majesty refuses him nothing   14.669590921356724
yes   13.719500795828313
i am told it is so very amusing   9.373432563108844
what is it   10.791835031455808
without doubt   7.13754208581235
take a last farewell sir of her sad remains   18.273042652376148
and did you also discover a bitter taste   11.822569613679283
demanded milady with a certain terror   15.667730553232417
good heaven   18.088133682139247
and no doubt his motive in visiting paris is to compete for the monthyon prize given as you are aware to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced the interests of virtue and humanity   13.738198848217234
but barrois who had long forgotten what it was to love was sorely fatigued by the expedition he had been constrained to use   11.397910007319233
is it a suitable match   14.758006596522286
the coadjutor went to him and held out his hand   16.699826023415508
andrea took five and twenty louis from his pocket   15.978489432799778
then half carrying half supporting him he managed to reach the abbé s chamber when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed   11.072500926363047
milady has laid her complaints against me with that hypocritical grief which renders her so interesting and this last offense has made the cup overflow   11.972302800097394
all this is perhaps folly perhaps insanity   14.42971550115968
said porthos   10.233409046402526
all right said athos   9.788847684826962
what is the matter madame   15.644577184684051
danglars is so skilful he will soon regain at the bourse what he loses elsewhere   11.457805689716903
his breast was covered with a coat of mail   5.303724716195227
how much may it amount to   6.417308430162522
monsieur de belliere said he to one of them do me the favor to take the reins from the hands of this worthy man mount upon the box and drive to the door of the private stair and wait for me there   12.602396971038399
aramis continued my dear cousin his eminence the cardinal whom god preserve for the happiness of france and the confusion of the enemies of the kingdom is on the point of putting an end to the hectic rebellion of la rochelle   11.6516781999224
i do better than that sir i save you   9.574960915381228
and when again our attention is directed to them we are surprised at the progress they have made towards the proposed end   11.330698391806349
singular man   10.535344027061791
one day you acknowledged that you loved me and since that day my hope of future happiness has rested on obtaining you for to gain you would be life to me   14.570781349039816
and at this moment there was a tremendous peal of thunder while the livid lightning illumined the room and the thunder rolling away in the distance seemed to withdraw unwillingly from the cursed abode   12.863530978199421
this war may not only bring great catastrophes upon england and france but misfortune upon you my lord for which i should never console myself   13.968808665921195
and as there was between these worthies and himself a perpetual battle of wits he had at first thought that dantès might be an emissary of these industrious guardians of rights and duties who perhaps employed this ingenious means of learning some of the secrets of his trade   10.237846958229706
this manifestation on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the music produced not the slightest effect on the two young men who continued their conversation   14.348768442719763
villefort leaned on the back of an armchair for as the minister of police went on speaking he felt his legs bend under him   7.117014518878198
planchet much surprised at the inquiry turned back   3.3021716311302676
de villefort and begs me to present him to your majesty   14.978002754672524
possessed by this idea the cardinal resolved to know all about d artagnan immediately   10.819362012181946
exclaimed athos anxiously   8.081556876080262
gentlemen said athos she is alone within half a league of us in the direction of the river   21.959230157380063
the devil   21.94514666772475
luxury has everything   15.864628651300993
ali smiling repeated the sound grasped the reins with a firm hand and spurred his horses whose beautiful manes floated in the breeze   18.86175060917211
said athos pressing his hand   12.120223945925595
one more practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath a veil or at least have cast down her thickly fringed lashes so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes   13.346298831611577
and as he has not the honor of being a musketeer he was dressed as a citizen   11.272462601701688
here it was the tradesmen who were running from shop to shop   11.96451506896417
half an hour after the night was quite dark   9.946003130312764
the three blows were scarcely struck when the inside blind was opened and a light appeared through the panes of the outside shutter   6.237653780245263
he will be my companion on the journey sir cried raoul   2.78361794465682
yes continued the jeweller   12.115563598123469
they saw a light glimmering in the midst of some trees   7.688416756764266
then said athos in a tone of delight he is well   11.88000868719642
this toast recalling at once the patient exile of hartwell and the peace loving king of france excited universal enthusiasm   13.054466887148475
and the spies of the cardinal have served him faithfully   2.731804206365048
he turned around recognized athos and aramis and held out his hand to them   11.92756949957586
shall i receive it from my father   15.035621582513834
and these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to those of the faithful are they   5.6466323338432405
m   16.608742613670195
he was at the window calling ali a horse for m   17.861633109352667
then turning his eyes from milady to the paper he read order to conduct the name is blank interrupted lord de winter   2.2441453919173675
it is a folly i admit but still it is the fashion   8.914351464056914
young people stop there   12.079387419151615
de villefort   13.132514053427453
replied aramis   11.714947204870887
oh ay   20.695391299283393
replied noirtier fixing a majestic look on the young man   7.372150901879364
you will charge broussel to report it   11.678978538511096
curiosity had vanquished the desire of preserving his incognito and he was recognized   15.981851527214761
then my friends and i took her tried her and condemned her   6.653241934487382
de tréville   9.964285330726366
fernand understood nothing except that dantès was absent   9.833561324352665
a great service what was that   12.031566838194593
d artagnan started   6.660809725966789
i am very anxious to see this man   9.375823886191691
said d artagnan   17.606580053575723
never mind in the meantime he marries mercédès the lovely mercédès at least he returns to do that   14.236295590858786
yes interposed porthos four hundred pistoles   15.060201125694448
in the corridor he met mme   5.1379148908254635
i resolved to set out and did set out at that very instant carrying with me the beginning of my great work the unity of the italian kingdom   13.022482723872187
enough said morrel   11.874426343061499
we can scud like the pharaon under bare poles   9.91340204964286
but in spite of all his efforts to free himself from the shot he felt it dragging him down still lower   12.917243558169226
i have brought him up   8.266857476285725
the hungry friends followed by their lackeys were seen haunting the quays and guard rooms picking up among their friends abroad all the dinners they could meet with   11.44455106150413
said the boy there s our beadle who is going a journey   13.493146511628039
if the musketeers did not appear things were to go on as had been agreed   12.988531595345268
but after all said he lowering the point of his spit where is this letter   24.12688396244983
dantès made no resistance   11.358322077440265
but the world being round has many ends so that he did not know which way to turn   12.884956399028823
tis that exactly   5.707576911416654
the agent of thomson french had not been again seen at marseilles   14.648798339967119
otherwise i would not fight with m   12.51741977433629
happy rogue said caderousse   14.16120136855044
the swiss became as purple as a peony   11.669605461445329
org   19.204366084507512
ha ha   12.446015417154577
cried the queen in the fullness of a broken heart   17.402072192777403
seeing a stranger escorted by two turnkeys holding torches and accompanied by two soldiers and to whom the governor spoke bareheaded dantès who guessed the truth and that the moment to address himself to the superior authorities was come sprang forward with clasped hands   8.44102865324072
pooh   9.533146282724484
said la ramee shuddering   19.312728204864282
morrel expected villefort would be dejected   10.832487596514483
de villefort entered his father s room followed by madame de villefort   13.521652498995108
you are a native of marseilles i am do you know then now what you are   10.771427862711334
but tell me said beauchamp what is life   11.758072534730568
oh my mother it was you who said you were free you had a beloved father you were destined to be almost a queen   12.985117741020069
we came merely to inquire after your health and to take your orders   16.6848846583608
said the young man   5.218479105497264
d artagnan in his fortieth year   6.533710071624774
he tried says richelieu in his memoirs to conceal it from them as long as possible closing all the ports of his kingdom and carefully keeping watch that no vessel should sail until the army which buckingham was getting together had gone taking upon himself in default of buckingham to superintend the departure   15.485262674315688
53   10.005860949101224
what say you   9.90673214760518
you agree that the foundation the trademark owner and any distributor under this agreement will not be liable to you for actual direct indirect consequential punitive or incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such damage   13.481405545565407
bonacieux   10.061857403603849
yes he continued sadly shaking his head yes it is as you said misfortune indeed has overtaken us   14.333158346873748
go laporte said the queen   16.820979425233702
cocles remained in m   20.96455124223182
one may well perceive young man that you are inexperienced   5.826490338784327
i know you now   11.940159081737779
then we will not talk of it until tomorrow   18.605294032232194
impious task   12.192943914298535
why should i do so   14.07063602049824
then it appeared to him that monte cristo smiled not with the strange and fearful expression which had sometimes revealed to him the secrets of his heart but with the benevolent kindness of a father for a child   21.742208499539363
dear d artagnan   9.427059723504348
and why has the count bought a rock   15.328786873325903
thank you my lord said the mendicant in a hoarse voice   17.12980002028001
all this the young man perceived and yet to his praise we speak it he did not hesitate a second   13.623390444082052
and he took the invaluable paper from the pocket of his uniform   9.737420015134045
albert refused the pipe which the nubian offered him   10.934680920788132
caderousse seemed to reflect for a few moments then said no truly it would take up too much time   10.705910519023218
capital   14.048710869962513
what letter   12.330201553235714
bonacieux   17.29605916620074
but milady started up pushing her away   17.131707941627283
the count did not notice the introduction in which the speaker announced that his communication would be of that vital importance that it demanded the undivided attention of the house   11.058597107270177
madame i have never been false to my word   16.200746239647117
juxon   11.693896015527654
happily there is nothing of the kind and your majesty has just acquired a new proof of it   16.595105158631682
a dull and heavy sound was heard and the man dropped like an ox on his face and then turned over on his back   8.75701039129596
well then said d artagnan gaily let us sell the diamond and say no more about it   8.39356643614808
albert understood his thoughts   7.960205170111065
essed of ingots gold money   5.702650482501685
what do they say   12.35060469169189
monte cristo looked upon morrel with indescribable tenderness   15.468846600282177
inquired athos   16.5664414306127
grimaud drew near and kissed it respectfully   16.323110341442533
if one s lot is cast among fools it is necessary to study folly   6.956171027296645
mercédès has no fortune   10.59044802299658
monte cristo with a smile on his lips uttered in the depths of his soul a groan which would have made villefort fly had he but heard it   16.168413861112008
lazare and gave it to villefort in the meanwhile take this cross   5.489283847426279
his eyes were fixed upon the little pavilion situated at the angle of the wall of which all the windows were closed with shutters except one on the first story   6.511161031316909
the doctor without shaking hands with villefort without adding a word to what he had said went out amid the tears and lamentations of the whole household   14.686780853295478
then open the door directly   13.893214010049824
the jesuit and the curate quite started from their chairs   10.542163243844856
perhaps you had a spy at your heels   8.899880322531432
friends   10.7009636452582
go to sleep soon louis said the queen for you must be awakened very early   18.554029377080635
the island of tiboulen chapter 22   9.061768656957167
monsieur de gondy would pay a hundred thousand francs for such a secret   12.287361536134288
and what shall i do in scotland   8.321900182056787
morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless   8.396683932715936
do not let us despond but wait at rueil for my conviction is that they are at rueil   11.897542107421845
he then returned to his place but did not sit down   9.589212884428944
then continued château renaud since you have an establishment a steward and a hotel in the champs élysées you only want a mistress   10.165172605426195
ah ah   9.846489338551688
at eight o clock in the evening athos ordered the horses to be saddled and lord de winter and his friends notified that they must prepare for the expedition   11.37618076744357
the comte de rochefort   13.002904673182114
thanks father thanks   10.386816473402884
his wife   13.031878530981523
at what time   13.405521881638125
yes that is inevitable said porthos   5.1676817027115645
said the count simulating total ignorance   16.030427743373593
only take care that i am not seen through the wicket   10.322409421714104
both were free from the fear of pursuit   13.931802432302838
silence child   13.995725597505155
exclaimed mercédès if it were so if i possessed free will but without the power to render that will efficacious it would drive me to despair   13.424023898405654
five full casks   17.56688208087781
the apartment consisted of two small rooms and a parlor   14.57952419122891
what do you think of the story chalais s esquire relates   10.791442890272608
and does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason   15.297095809900794
yes you are at once from provence and spain   12.48449632404932
i am going wherever it may please the count to take me said morrel with a smile full of grief   9.998396654704749
1   14.93811147393374
aramis said that as these sorts of affairs were mysterious it was better not to fathom them   7.911217867784314
it may be observed that there was a proper proportion in his sentiments toward the governor of the prison and the minister toward the subordinate and the master   14.602425269835491
he   9.942903949471017
milady began to have doubts of the issue of this terrible duel in which her enemies showed as much perseverance as she did animosity   6.2275089302235225
in vulgar phrase what may you term this composition for which to tell the truth i do not feel any particular desire   11.9619761431981
but still we have quite lost our dear eugénie   13.32606695995232
with his instinctive delicacy edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord and faria had been equally silent   9.868790057334849
pale and trembling milady repulsed d artagnan s attempted embrace by a violent blow on the chest as she sprang out of bed   12.420235512471145
monsieur de tréville must think us dead   12.982974454715055
do you not form a very rash judgment emmanuel   14.941468482427355
as to the time it will not require very much more than the generality of wills   11.743138911202696
our magnificence makes you smile count said maximilian who had followed him with his eyes   9.051891561516161
noirtier how   9.928683089349752
said porthos opening his large eyes   11.844280717542434
go on with the lights said the inspector   5.238026929189406
repeat what i have told you   11.223367553616924
it is he   4.345360007703495
unruly comminges smiled   18.9939305083194
said danglars   13.549024389100001
and after thinking in which direction he had better turn his steps in order to accomplish this important act of the day he reflected deeply and decided that councillor broussel should bear the cost of this repast   8.11602832999377
and i am the more grateful to your eminence replied anne of austria with a smile that proved she was not the dupe of this ingenious gallantry from being certain that these two studs alone have cost you as much as all the others cost his majesty   10.813493960693302
and now said milady without appearing to remark the change of the duke s tone toward her now that i have received the instructions of your eminence as concerns your enemies monseigneur will permit me to say a few words to him of mine   14.249125236838632
a mantle piece with two modern sèvres vases a timepiece representing cupid with his bent bow a mirror with an engraving on each side one representing homer carrying his guide the other belisarius begging a grayish paper   15.520182780666593
the house was of white stone and in a small court before it were two small beds full of beautiful flowers   1.2297563293650828
i have the true idea   5.472667474935396
mon dieu   12.523944399543161
like all other things of this world after having had a beginning had an end and after this end our four companions began to be somewhat embarrassed   7.752391156074084
i seemed everywhere to hear your moans behind me in the bed and i dared not turn around   9.316932500015104
it was at the brigantine that had left in the morning and the tartan that had just set sail that edmond fixed his eyes   9.854374137579208
you see it s evident where the count got the name   13.212294456477773
incendiary   20.610823101749094
we had better take the opposite direction eh   12.776317032244688
but how shall we be happy   8.248425492258253
one of these two men was a woman disguised as a cavalier   11.043589547470349
the state which is now threatened would be safe and you and i   11.351101368678993
leave me then to act and have no fears for the result   6.900876991715654
asked harrison of d artagnan   10.502607833472231
excuse me said d artagnan reappearing under the shoulder of the giant but i am in such haste i was running after someone and and do you always forget your eyes when you run   11.109231447904682
aramis awoke   23.31628249958814
the devil   10.250110692325034
did you hear   11.032546215689937
said kitty   17.02048472451499
an expedition sir   11.555145535641119
what say you to that monsieur du vallon   13.16360541908396
yet i think this will all pass off and that you will one day see her enter your study   13.754593823865006
thanks my lord i will speak to him myself   17.86669030614182
danglars thought of the old man whom in his hours of delirium he had seen groaning on his bed   19.47872293986123
de morcerf   14.207526398518068
apropos   18.496559132948825
cried all the brigands when they saw the chief   16.68325747480052
shall i see you again soon   11.659649626166757
the knife fell to the ground   10.610501927169333
he was calm and radiant was he not   13.636678099519969
he owed three quarters rent and they threatened to turn him out   10.557033207387628
then rising in despair he exclaimed the chief the chief   21.761543286966894
the queen s paleness if possible increased   9.292833838589058
he was on the point of sending the letter to the commissary of police notwithstanding the advice of his anonymous friend or perhaps because of that advice when suddenly the idea occurred to him that it might be some personal enemy whom he alone should recognize and over whom if such were the case he alone would gain any advantage as fiesco17 had done over the moor who would have killed him   10.324705203155652
oh yes sir he told me   16.009907602348505
no matter   9.935839964219353
the matter was no longer doubtful   14.108399532261423
but nothing betrayed a hostile design on carlini s part   3.467229782591465
when you have discovered where they lodge come and await me at the town gate   14.35940911577634
and as i have said the auditors seeming to have great deference for the narrator they every moment burst into fits of laughter   13.534094501222429
he wore a mask   10.745037174151477
die   5.394666829333806
idiot   17.33380001173765
explain to me how it happens that following so peaceful a business you had such warlike inclinations   9.311270418607556
the cart must be tastefully ornamented   17.37310328575178
what s to be done   8.55628208557671
here am i milady here am i   17.153991923328057
she is not the less guilty monsieur duke   15.028043113434165
ten curious heads were glued to the tapestry and became pale with fury   14.663806855068229
de boville formerly an inspector of prisons sends to me from the prefect of police   13.38786374112943
are you sure of what you assert   15.53693660899241
asked he   14.322827802578995
because having neither arms nor password we shouldn t take fifty steps in the court without knocking against a sentinel   11.688210481738858
my mass   6.571537195378502
de tréville on receiving it assured him that by two o clock in the morning the four leaves of absence should be at the respective domiciles of the travelers   10.58574448664679
a war of partisans unworthy of a king   7.632347453314347
by kitty s chamber he could gain that of her mistress   12.307908081808591
asked raoul   10.040649357432034
a sort of book written upon strips of cloth   9.782045776074856
ah porthos   16.71122595862153
then everything was still excepting that valentine heard the almost noiseless sound of some liquid being poured into the glass she had just emptied   17.660864926685846
and this marriage broken off without a reason being assigned yes it is all from the same cause   15.649014418462007
and besides if it is not the prince then monsieur de gondy but monsieur de gondy is to be made a cardinal   7.992723159846149
to that exclamation of porthos s succeeded a groaning low and profound which seemed to come from behind a door   10.6811892254328
exclaimed the executioner did you see the monk   7.622873833988533
hurrah for you then my beautiful lady cried the captain   13.26868436726706
well then said franz let us to the colosseum   6.768757273053841
face to face with lord de winter her plan of conduct was more easy   7.30278002795464
he extinguished the lamp carefully concealed it and then went away closing as well as he could the entrance to the secret passage by the large stone as he descended   8.567540171716876
present arms   10.703019751514983
you have told me yourself madame that i have been drawn into a snare   15.156299322139732
what could they take from me   13.6960488866642
oh his name his name   17.20294709415277
but thanks to the current of the stream and a fair wind his vessel passed so quickly that he had little more than a glimpse of her   9.377199823488795
porthos took advantage of this circumstance to ogle the women   14.67881961712539
the cellar what cellar   17.497616368914613
true   9.365085825177342
de monte cristo in his house you are quicksighted have much knowledge of the world more tact than is usual at your age do you think the count is really what he appears to be   13.899658899000332
on the next day mathieu molé the chief president whose courage at this crisis says the cardinal de retz was equal to that of the duc de beaufort and the prince de condé in other words of the two men who were considered the bravest in france had been attacked in his turn   13.582035853270485
the count breathed with difficulty   9.493991121928593
i will tell you all said valentine   5.176005443630841
and at these words lord de winter passed his arm through that of felton and led him out laughing   5.138229032202743
i have entered into no engagement and consider myself quite free   15.350712672792083
so much the worse at least for the queen for to day she has need of the same courage and the same devotion   13.589731855045557
a rondeau   15.10193278565193
continued athos   14.766023306121632
albert de morcerf to return to paris and franz d épinay to pass a fortnight at venice   6.217101172867903
nevertheless she remained motionless   10.318897963759984
yes and i would rather face your majesty however threatening your smile than face those demons who accompanied me hither and who sprung from i know not whence unless from deepest hell   12.8594550007315
all i do know is that i was just nineteen when i was arrested the 28th of february 1815   16.896457545349307
you have befouled the face of your king   10.778759523857477
at this moment a horse neighed   15.232957999285338
my lord excuse me   13.960862378169306
that montague is in the bastille and that the torture may make him say things he remembers and even things he has forgotten   12.358865668008725
felton turned his eyes toward the part of the wall of the apartment before which he had found milady standing in the armchair in which she was now seated and over her head he perceived a gilt headed screw fixed in the wall for the purpose of hanging up clothes or weapons   20.321830775590954
he is waiting in his carriage at the gate of the garden of the palais royal   10.01419757458115
cried d artagnan   15.018674846691221
just so   14.259880360441397
well said d artagnan to athos you see my dear friend that this is war to the death   8.481491252623174
monsieur returned villefort i was then a royalist because i believed the bourbons not only the heirs to the throne but the chosen of the nation   17.5210406479194
that s right   9.173186791172487
to the wall   14.7979528705103
monsieur continued dantès i know it is not in your power to release me   7.637289996009272
and after dinner   6.770783762904168
danglars is guilty he shall cease to live or i shall die   10.211148917298845
i kill my boy   13.654309743621836
you will know that to morrow evening said the coadjutor smiling   15.761917204930343
but never mind tréville come still by the back staircase   13.724327982657485
are we not two despairing creatures   12.60458833613232
why i have related the events to you   15.793613812928402
decidedly and honestly   14.201694272490277
himself my lord   14.115914530714573
a capital blow you gave   8.923037982832371
caderousse set the example and attacked the breakfast with good appetite praising each dish he set before his visitor   14.855922130502508
this execution quieted the ill disposed who resolved to allow themselves to die of hunger this death always appearing to them more slow and less sure than strangulation   10.931992609137236
bravo said maximilian   13.88885004557738
did he send you   11.714617127609603
he was the friend of the king who honored highly as everyone knows the memory of his father henry iv   11.329181997942541
but tell me now count exclaimed albert delighted at the idea of having to chaperon so distinguished a person as monte cristo   11.119177801907444
i may sleep perhaps at an inn   12.609990162550634
what time do you breakfast albert   12.717986395550824
monte cristo had already seen the breakfast room and the salon on the ground floor   10.898374280185102
monsieur bonacieux there was in all this as may have been observed one personage concerned of whom notwithstanding his precarious position we have appeared to take but very little notice   12.880441296340216
as bertuccio was leaving the room to give the requisite orders baptistin opened the door he held a letter on a silver waiter   15.830906885916562
he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum and again entered the cavern   10.631993408764208
in the first place said milady it is possible i may be deceived and that d artagnan and his friends may really come to your assistance   5.672350663084746
would you like me to send edward to you for a short time   0.2544278042169825
i do assure you grandpapa ah m   8.618839664836425
why didn t the baron come himself   20.546133108428972
that is to say each rested his head on the other s shoulder   11.763329992519207
and your swords they saw the light of day i presume   13.653384143304294
parbleu   8.76912807004024
one minute cried albert without giving monte cristo the time to reply   15.86018619582255
he then made a sign for mousqueton to come to him   11.117292685556205
all fell to their knees   7.807508716787087
good lord   13.242055417486416
and seizing the butcher by the throat porthos said he kill this fellow for me with a single blow   8.528002736223074
i as a tender father and i as a dutiful son as they choose that i shall be descended from you   12.553090276476118
but athos put his hand upon his shoulder with a smile and d artagnan understood that it was all very well for such a little gascon gentleman as himself to drive a bargain but not for a man who had the bearing of a prince   10.747713005499659
tomorrow you shall be free   10.567553090280363
de villefort who considers him already as one of the family   9.839069921523782
he had still a nose but his cheeks fattened out each took a portion of it unto themselves   5.3602418264741
you say excuse me and you believe that is sufficient   11.04304664464166
i swear to heaven on the contrary that if they fall upon him i will fall upon them   13.911248375416708
as he came within two or three hundred paces of the grotto he thought he heard a cry   13.625113287078383
you are too fortunate in your love for play not to take its revenge   13.52552397440908
i don t know   11.782200824339206
i do indeed   11.38652231635962
instead of that air of life of comfort and of happiness that permeates a flourishing and prosperous business establishment instead of merry faces at the windows busy clerks hurrying to and fro in the long corridors instead of the court filled with bales of goods re echoing with the cries and the jokes of porters one would have immediately perceived all aspect of sadness and gloom   7.997990384543107
haul taut   15.559543210753969
franz   17.332401639709317
no monseigneur no it is not he   14.40071139586362
he would be condemned to die but he was about to die of grief and despair when this miraculous noise recalled him to life   9.453348119491423
no said maximilian you shall not leave him   5.065932140702596
at saint mande   15.015648045574011
he died a more wretched hopeless heart broken prisoner than the felons who pay the penalty of their crimes at the galleys of toulon   12.717336416213447
but this was not what louis xiii   15.782739141077307
the young girl raised her tearful eyes towards monte cristo as she said with touching earnestness whether we return to the east you mean to say my lord do you not   14.311614917681256
without caring about them myself i live among those who are much occupied in them   12.66315265939374
she wept abundantly   13.978316619979248
you can change them idiot   18.816712527506038
and what treatment do you adopt for this singular complaint   9.213966908498998
said valentine uneasily   9.382634326662394
the queen immediately exhibited strong emotion   16.007888769501804
at this moment the accuser concluded with these words the present accusation is preferred by us in the name of the english people   7.075416450488918
bravo villefort   15.463986041177588
said porthos it appears there s something fresh here   11.524008702050761
it was a fan which madame de villefort had left in the carriage   7.253191783403217
that dark point yonder is the isle of dogs   12.91470378621019
during the scene of tumult andrea had turned his smiling face towards the assembly   12.201511829844428
woman was created for our destruction and it is from her we inherit all our miseries   9.366037466684144
when franz had once again set foot on shore he forgot for the moment at least the events which had just passed while he finished his affairs of pleasure at florence and then thought of nothing but how he should rejoin his companion who was awaiting him at rome   3.803887717204308
of many things   16.128133451817472
and if that did not restore her courage he pointed to a crow perched on some dead branch took aim touched the trigger and the bird fell dead at the foot of the tree   19.042889376084187
meanwhile as the little troop drew nearer to lens the noise of the cannon sounded louder   11.803926374996502
the count of monte cristo   16.947049310085973
what does he appear to be   11.781211030553012
and believe me dear friend we ought not to lose our time it is precious   9.585356981182708
we will return someday to pray over her grave   7.808494803787548
he paused exchanged two words with the sentinel   11.534827222577627
i must have been mistaken   14.536152337363728
glad   11.326742773985018
edmond then cast his eyes scrutinizingly at the agitated and embarrassed mercédès and then again on the gloomy and menacing fernand   16.35709185434441
the monk   19.195256537230954
some day the people will burn that house as they burned that of the marechal d ancre   6.481356683720562
in that case porthos will assist us   10.051897313551457
oh you ll know it someday aramis   12.796104336558086
the king s children next arrived the princess charlotte a beautiful fair haired child with tears in her eyes and the duke of gloucester a boy eight or nine years old whose tearless eyes and curling lip revealed a growing pride   11.691507085776639
our valets are well armed and yours seems to be tough enough   11.622590063464095
if you would but accept my offers   8.79271640577822
gad he was not so proud then he was an under clerk to the good m   19.897714782022675
still it seems to me that as you profit by it danglars shrugged his shoulders   4.924028018999879
if you die my lord i will die with you   8.073704122971607
and i am so still said porthos bowing to harrison   12.070390801563983
and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the doors and the blinds   15.583260994792125
it is not he she murmured and waited in the assurance that this was but a dream for the man to disappear or assume some other form   22.55469582367268
do so   16.133250503026318
ah said monte cristo 1815 is not yesterday   8.024904217957342
and my faith the governor of the province one of the gentlemen i expected today seemed to have such a wish for him that i gave him to him   10.82265046042951
no no my boy   19.239165320639867
has he wit or not this demon d artagnan   10.258622511098316
gentlemen said d artagnan it is half past four and we have scarcely time to be on the road of chaillot by six   11.46866018395225
you had already passed half your life in coveting that which you might have honorably acquired   8.45338305801826
for in a society such as ours satire inflicts a painful and incurable wound   15.407782629631775
by the countess s visiting the colosseum as we did last night by moonlight and nearly alone   9.598619825119012
one day when benedetto was about five or six our neighbor wasilio who according to the custom of the country never locked up his purse or his valuables for as your excellency knows there are no thieves in corsica complained that he had lost a louis out of his purse   18.614852060483358
the fool   10.094358090707571
it was a movement of vengeance upon milady   12.944703477925241
this hole communicated with a kind of loft the space between the floor of the king s room and the ceiling of the one below it   15.155174657301517
morrel was kinder to his wife more affectionate to his daughter than he had ever been   10.397865154514177
buckingham gave d artagnan a chamber adjoining his own   14.926771814365207
have you informed him of it   12.619585763964373
are our lackeys sufficiently devoted to us to risk their lives for us   11.253937282961907
at once   5.070873660945003
said porthos protruding his lips with contempt   6.136501290999621
that has weakened my purse   11.896565785026565
said the queen   5.584927778663003
it was a good augury   16.21093948839031
no doubt now we shall hear that our friend is released   10.427615907494513
alas they have taken everything   13.353814893816763
thrones are at this time shaken and it is to little purpose for devoted hearts to serve the interests of princes   4.754866033592997
no no cried bertuccio setting down the lantern at the angle of the interior wall   23.100298243362268
the host had not quite so good a bargain as he at first hoped for but he made amends by slipping in two bottles of anjou wine instead of two bottles of champagne   9.826851801661896
conceal your wounds when you have any   8.435626475598635
i have suffered deeply madame answered monte cristo   18.14612944903605
now we are alone dear aramis said d artagnan tell me how the devil you managed to alight upon the back of planchet s horse   12.63311040260208
this time bonacieux became so pale that d artagnan could not help perceiving it and asked him what was the matter   5.847651396246341
certainly   13.265079536183812
i have heard enough from the lips of oliver cromwell to know what to expect   13.199341095615438
in that case sir rejoined madame de villefort i will leave you overwhelmed with gratitude and happiness at your prompt acquiescence to my wishes   10.690204591940761
i assure you madame replied the woman it is as i have said   16.44409254743873
asked albert   9.39168218073249
they returned to the hotel   12.310563859580492
in twenty minutes they were on the spot named   10.264948972826547
but he is gone and can no longer send us news of himself either to me or to your father   12.128105559468006
fernand was enrolled in the active army went to the frontier with his regiment and was at the battle of ligny   10.854410337843527
but quick as a bird she glided between his hands and when he wished to speak to her her finger placed upon her mouth with a little imperative gesture full of grace reminded him that he was under the command of a power which he must blindly obey and which forbade him even to make the slightest complaint   13.5831425088015
and a brave captain of spahis can not risk this even to gratify a pretty woman which is in my opinion one of the most sacred obligations in the world   17.252995066241464
the wound was in the top of his skull and blood was flawing copiously   13.296354332034245
bernouin entered   9.615712577997538
seeing d artagnan about to leave her milady recalled his promise to avenge her on the comte de wardes   13.892543005156481
she passed her finger slowly down the columns and when she came to the word will m   14.534827679468176
the same said villefort   10.394070160290395
let us then take advantage of it   4.043039367268372
yes monsieur   12.578456477603256
doubtless both of them understood that the situation had become too serious to lose time in useless words and aimless wrath   9.766419836592549
what   11.725030366491964
and unwilling to interfere with the pleasure he so evidently felt took up albert s glass and began in his turn to survey the audience   12.297323664068003
rich   13.794274976910076
and you allow then sir that spheres exist and that these marked and invisible beings mingle amongst us   9.273248341237517
was an accomplice of the duke s and escaped along with him   6.434217762189895
oh continued she placing her hand modestly over her beautiful eyes never   9.032662777280454
and brisemont which was the name of the convalescent poured the wine which was a little shaken by its journey carefully into decanters   3.6863102291501306
his hair like his beard which he wore under his chin was thick and curly and in spite of his age but slightly interspersed with a few silvery threads   11.434370574751329
don t you understand porthos   13.598231625254433
who are you in the first place to ask me to take a turn with you   19.482690946310775
undeceive yourself again   14.886293964539341
this answer and especially the tone in which it was uttered chilled the heart of poor morrel   10.768301905437813
two months ago you were dying with hunger   9.20487476427901
but if it is a woman who writes said aramis and that woman desires not to be seen remember you compromise her d artagnan   8.359974916189017
asked m   15.472338868083735
but i found you proud and blood thirsty and i left you in the hands of god   9.99372162156387
has he not come   7.26442842813756
courted by my step mother who regards him as the epitome of human wisdom   13.082758664065436
bertuccio hung down his head before the imperious look of his master and remained motionless without making any answer   11.713772551803538
the curious suck our tears as flies suck the blood of a wounded hart   23.563997567918587
he again ran back to the château   10.20404677831769
and he closed his eyes with a groan   14.160188142076223
i have a hundred pounds weight less upon my chest   13.000111031824662
ah   16.963593527554828
the young man reflected for a moment then an expression of sublime resignation appeared in his eyes and with a slow and sad gesture he took off his two epaulets the insignia of his rank   8.077669204246373
what are you going to do this evening   16.70618165661623
ah   9.299632235730524
oh mercy mercy monsieur   10.759588843146567
thus for instance the excellent abbé adelmonte of whom i spoke just now made in this way some marvellous experiments   16.182067172517463
morrel said not a word   17.06693264836725
alas dear friend   16.060080896008543
is that true and do you speak seriously   11.664595264965385
he called her milady   13.958640181983604
and on what have you written all this   10.606528938764924
noirtier wants said the notary   12.6951109460798
yes i speak five of the modern tongues that is to say german french italian english and spanish   18.032508943353847
she fancies too that she saw a phantom enter her chamber and even heard the noise it made on touching her glass   10.138696455588049
asked planchet   5.599037850769181
of how much does he rob you every year   7.808791770591768
but it is understood that what i offer you i offer him at the same time   14.02421123445513
still consider that although i may not be strictly speaking what is termed an illustrious match for you i am for many reasons not altogether so much beneath your alliance   12.992055297838345
do not appeal to me mademoiselle   7.836069828770276
he who has negotiated these matters forgive me if i begin by speaking of myself but i must claim that importance which has been given to me not assumed by me he who has arranged matters for the return of the cardinal ought it appears to me in order that his reward may not be unworthy of your majesty to be made commandant of the guards an appointment something like that of captain of the musketeers   19.611484008880435
he would no doubt have believed that he had returned to the times of florian and would have declared on reaching paris that he had met an alpine shepherdess seated at the foot of the sabine hill   10.1154720686364
ah yes i know   9.689092884721326
there is the half pistole   15.401664831912054
well said franz to him   6.430658392531171
and i my dear aramis quietly replied athos i think it would only change monsieur de retz s appearance   10.398973157824056
what do you say   10.116661910009585
and it was in her own room and from the lips of madame de villefort that she heard all the strange events we have related   13.05602459755982
which you sir struck twelve times answered raoul smiling   6.764411530056751
oh my brother does not allude to its value although it has been estimated at 100 000 francs   9.739505447329082
come guitant come along and let s see if they keep watch at the quinze vingts as at the barriere des sergens   11.753945356329144
danglars accompanied him to the door where he again assured albert that no motive of personal hatred had influenced him against the count of morcerf   9.55192157748301
the musketeer leaped lightly into the saddle   14.012201000581632
no no she vociferated no you can not wish that   3.2362180259557167
grimaud going in advance followed the course which they were to take in the evening   7.631022096844621
i believed that madame loved him   11.840144879718638
it was only five hundred two hundred one hundred steps in advance   6.032564769795539
oh that goes for nothing said gaetano   8.343597861831809
sir thanks   12.255325983910208
felton took the bag and threw it to the foot of the wall   18.059362392300542
and you you d artagnan a man sprung from the ancient nobility of france bearing an honorable name carrying a good sword have helped to give up a king to beersellers shopkeepers and wagoners   13.53445166874794
my poor brother was ignorant of this sentence   12.413442892274498
said he that man would henceforward lay down his life for me   15.099166895264732
speaking to you as a friend i can say that the prince does not yet appear all he will be   10.919862782301912
i think not sir replied m   9.572239070929783
and on the other hand my lord you have lost it and now in accordance with the law of war sir you must buy it back again   7.716070592943568
no   8.377016187280056
do not think so bertuccio replied the count   14.03816033327396
a fresh practical joke now occurred to the duke   15.36460036973039
he threw them on the table without looking at them so sure was he of victory   17.566997060618014
cried franz was luigi vampa in the carriage with the roman peasants   8.633128394132562
oh said morrel carried away by his friendship you do not know him and i do   16.39461455780939
and is the written report of the gownsmen to be placed in comparison with the word of honor of a swordsman   18.195917871608398
debray was admitted to the house for this grand ceremony but on the same plane with everyone else and without any particular privilege   14.009309424093761
and a comforting one too added d artagnan seeing the delight that his intelligence gave the young man   0.8423341446102359
but you shall not kill me today   5.600248434673323
chapelain   13.395157053958624
d artagnan was secretly touched with remorse not at inducing porthos to enter into schemes in which his life and fortune would be in jeopardy for porthos in the title of baron had his object and reward   5.722570297782513
dantès followed him   14.621854522698413
the duke who had latterly been allowed a fire burned the letter but kept the ball and went to bed hiding the ball under his bolster   10.356477981199665
it is the custom in war said d artagnan why should it not be the custom in a duel   8.981639768506529
bets were offered to any amount that she was bound for spain   9.985323944354384
she was an angel on earth before being an angel in heaven   13.703089440317624
suppose he is dead and that this property now belongs to some one who bears his name   11.61769911185134
my dear fellow it is perfectly ridiculous stupid   5.511853769560788
the two musketeers met at the gate   6.814283965437973
madame de motteville who was on especial duty that evening followed to aid and undress her   16.706239839652675
and now at the moment when i reckoned upon success my hopes are forever dashed from me   16.01755560668067
the whole   6.2108397354813265
porthos and aramis placed themselves at the table and began to play   12.516497117370061
monsieur d artagnan   9.875036391862103
and you forget one thing   13.99941264243878
ah   4.2290665556743505
ah mon dieu yes you are right athos replied   7.942486209165351
do you think it can be a trap that they are laying for us   6.383899707134829
is my wife s fortune five hundred thousand livres   13.790282412159298
my lord perhaps they are not in paris   16.66993261055767
with this key i open the abyss   11.16016220769426
tell me what this count of monte cristo has done for you   11.478528610117399
and in an open cabinet a collection of german pipes of chibouques with their amber mouth pieces ornamented with coral and of narghiles with their long tubes of morocco awaiting the caprice or the sympathy of the smokers   6.666569866298638
the nephew replied no   13.81262833569702
i know well that the proposition is tempting but at present it is impossible to accept it   17.569665852191285
but four hundred what   7.990852827041572
he exclaimed   8.47091801644044
one fact more than the rest brought his friend sinbad the sailor back to his recollection and that was the mysterious sort of intimacy that seemed to exist between the brigands and the sailors   14.426319391092164
besides you are right in another respect which is in thinking that if we were to meddle in politics there could not be a better time than the present   8.739967196975325
come monsieur   15.1821739281557
the count was dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity   10.703636472967819
yet he entertained a marked preference for this gentleman   18.18457911253567
i will have those letters   3.0848531188674873
if she had not yet taken any repose he at least was already up   11.620017190625536
however inclined mordaunt was to have recourse to violence he understood the reasons d artagnan had given him   11.414676277577588
but you remind me   9.631285035727403
i adopt the wisdom of the ancients and feel my way for my friendship for your family and my respect for you are as a twofold bandage over my eyes   11.365442979529
yes but calumny seized upon all those follies in which i took no part as you well know my lord   16.32275999816798
the prince de marsillac my old friend will recommend our young friend to madame de longueville who will give him a letter to her brother the prince who loves her too tenderly not to do what she wishes immediately   15.389683931664296
ho   12.423231386234177
i have no doubt of it   4.680028456900913
noirtier is spared because nothing is expected from him   15.512692220962318
but you will see and judge for yourself   17.871825339608172
de winter smiled sorrowfully and shook his head   5.513382860176186
the dread with which the pale and motionless baroness listened to this was equalled by the calm indifference with which debray had spoken   9.273394295896303
lord a mercy my lord   8.460895471500521
it was therefore near seven o clock   13.144261608549074
the abbé busoni had watched till daylight and then left without calling anyone   17.198528318492688
villefort i beg to remind you my mother speaks to you   13.17571002692574
the count with outstretched neck and glaring eyes stood in an attitude ready to pounce upon morrel upon the first occasion   12.658093611709976
said d artagnan that matters little   12.00056707896685
well continued mazarin the time has come to put to use your talents and your valor   10.3526604148658
said he what does this mean   14.461074819865981
my poor girl in ten years i shall be old and you will be still young   9.655614563255881
certainly a call to the visitors room had scarcely astonished andrea less than themselves for the wily youth instead of making use of his privilege of waiting to be claimed on his entry into la force had maintained a rigid silence   12.311192077713896
the fact is maximilian that i was there and my presence had the effect of rendering you unjust in your comparison   16.97415998727035
felton stood before this strange apparition like one petrified   6.767061600392129
and as if the weakness of the woman overpowered the enthusiasm of the inspired fanatic she said but no it is not for me to be the judith to deliver bethulia from this holofernes   16.203375066441613
with whom is he then   10.035408314425613
she expected every moment that she should see morrel appear pale and trembling to forbid the signing of the contract like the laird of ravenswood in the bride of lammermoor   16.143591396419854
secondly i learned it from beauchamp s journal   12.520462330398452
not the least noise was to be heard   13.786178011696165
oh yes returned monte cristo   18.580664726394758
ah   18.93477308872177
i am sure that whatever you do is well done   13.072724232071778
i have given the signal   16.262865061712745
said eugénie in a tone which a vestal in the amphitheatre would have used when urging the victorious gladiator to finish his vanquished adversary   10.077034506919516
i shall take a cutlet on my way to the chamber   14.653737254449268
millionaires like yourself my lord are rare in france   11.445555952502657
i am not only the most miserable of queens but the most unhappy of mothers the most wretched of wives   5.2653503390995775
men would have said that the king had escaped human justice and been overtaken by god s   3.37502110920067
yet he did not return home   12.847482838511647
halloo   0.46579943654177924
and close on their heels are the horses of madame danglars who always go at six leagues an hour   19.559643867421066
after he had remained through the heat of the day unconscious on the battle field the cool freshness of the night brought him to himself   7.88281581057921
and even then all that could be obtained from the celebrated dappled grays now changed into a couple of dull sluggish stupid brutes was a slow pottering pace kept up with so much difficulty that madame de villefort was more than two hours returning to her residence in the faubourg saint honoré   8.261604051540445
unwilling to injure them by praising them too highly he replied they   7.738564821457539
and i will prove it to you by putting the dots to the i or rather by naming the persons   12.340771164834122
knowest thou not then mordaunt   11.515261804193806
i confess if the court would do justice to my claims and give the head of my house the title of prince and if my brother de turenne were reinstated in his command i would return to my estates and leave the court and parliament to settle things between themselves as they might   13.914329085529936
i am condemned to witness those gentlemen every day said beauchamp   12.915391519477154
but i could not reach the bolster   11.546440586159383
m   13.787268295240036
do you then know in what manner fernand injured dantès   20.36777574486429
bonacieux had remained insensible to vulgar seductions   9.072958983371574
it would have required the penetration of œdipus or the sphinx to have divined the irony the count concealed beneath these words apparently uttered with the greatest politeness   13.5623800850379
not at all said athos calmly   16.861556727062958
what can have been the reason of so singular a difference in parties and politics   18.720260962805384
it is with madame   11.081090846688811
and she opened the letter and read madame being unable to have the honor of writing to you myself by reason of a wound i have received in my right hand i have commanded my son the count de guiche who with his father is equally your humble servant to write to tell you that we have just gained the battle of lens and that this victory can not fail to give great power to cardinal mazarin and to the queen over the affairs of europe   3.8954542261688516
the novice let her speak then seeing that she paused she said don t you know a gentleman named athos   15.30326390905224
i can show you answered the gascon   11.876489720145534
as for the two others i had so much the habit of calling them by nicknames that i have forgotten their real ones   14.606033801262582
de villefort how would you advise me to act   16.7947306129026
as for the accused himself many remembered him as being so amiable so handsome and so liberal that they chose to think him the victim of some conspiracy since in this world large fortunes frequently excite the malevolence and jealousy of some unknown enemy   14.49808711983867
the three friends surrounded him and the three lackeys grouped themselves again near the wine jar   6.4644406326155766
and as he was very avaricious he was in an excellent humor   15.107969909382234
he had just acted the inexorable judge with her he had condemned her to death and she crushed by remorse struck with terror covered with the shame inspired by the eloquence of his irreproachable virtue she a poor weak woman without help or the power of defending herself against his absolute and supreme will she might at that very moment perhaps be preparing to die   9.473918712710628
you are a noble minded woman and it was your grief that disarmed me   13.033448169521705
what is the use of one horse for us two   10.665144440973622
speak italian sir   10.568307396983753
cried the guards and they drew back respectfully to let the two friends pass   6.700310122818993
andrea seized the certificate of his father s marriage and his own baptismal register and after having opened them with all the eagerness which might be expected under the circumstances he read them with a facility which proved that he was accustomed to similar documents and with an expression which plainly denoted an unusual interest in the contents   14.378551050786449
bonacieux to join her   8.133114101984459
where do we go first   5.932107923356686
at that instant the moon inquisitive perhaps like d artagnan came from behind a cloud and by her light d artagnan recognized the large blue eyes the golden hair and the classic head of the duchess de longueville   11.436503568753592
i thought it was understood that we should not talk of that until tomorrow   8.460393593265694
you villain will you finish   15.081597317264345
well this letter gives the count of monte cristo unlimited credit on our house   12.399186191013355
but i have striven to repress it   8.435931276328052
yes sir replied mousqueton   16.5643280817529
chapter xiv   8.77790668993247
danglars hidden behind a curtain watched the departure he had been waiting for   8.289563629356508
d artagnan declined all others being unwilling to take the first chance from those who had the priority   16.317080493969378
morrel and i shall say that he is a man honorable to the last degree and who has up to this time fulfilled every engagement with scrupulous punctuality   19.55384498215557
de villefort   2.2976754008246445
be content i will do my best   7.629961253482697
i can not recollect whether it was by steel or by poison   13.509969458003615
i wish to be there i expect to get something by it   14.673804168489216
i wish monsieur du vallon to sup well more especially as i have news to give him that will improve his appetite   13.644480459651527
full then of this conviction he pulled his cap down over his eyes and endeavoring to copy some of the court airs he had picked up in gascony among young traveling nobles he advanced with one hand on the hilt of his sword and the other resting on his hip   16.405437754486417
god is always the last resource   15.955431689702113
but the count replied that as he was going to the palli theatre the box at the argentina theatre would be lost if they did not profit by it   13.69602546595809
five millions a pretty sum eh peppino   11.668033000877497
d artagnan was passing along a lane on the spot where the rue d assas is now situated breathing the balmy emanations which were borne upon the wind from the rue de vaugirard and which arose from the gardens refreshed by the dews of evening and the breeze of night   2.4971572709308294
two inches an hour does not seem much but in twelve hours that makes two feet and three we had before that makes five   5.54241002129567
know that monsieur de bracieux is rich enough to drink a tun of port wine even if obliged to pay a pistole for every drop   17.19302620754377
perhaps continued villefort he had put it in the foundling hospital   12.386969253055167
and the other   11.429039333592042
what   11.707402364019751
to him who is called the comte de la fere   12.625586285555343
wait said athos   11.670833745350413
your debaucheries and crimes would vouch for it   9.747828181190721
fernand agreed to do so deserted his post and followed the general   5.445755963445053
porthos meantime asked d artagnan to give him his instructions how to proceed on his journey   6.9029507365765665
de tréville post dated the leave to the morning of the twenty fifth   5.810705147760851
aramis does the same to porthos   15.6599537672166
he gave a ball every year at which he appeared for a quarter of an hour only that is to say five and forty minutes less than the king is visible at his balls   17.501608079283685
the astonishment of mazarin and of anne of austria was great when it was announced to them that the city which the previous evening they had left entirely tranquil had awakened to such feverish commotion   15.389430238413697
stop sir look yonder he whispered   18.876241857535543
he remained there all night not knowing where he was   9.325372941249315
i was brought up in the country and my father in his leisure time was something of a poacher   16.0740604580889
they were playing together as usual when seven o clock sounded   12.254446952610138
asked athos   14.49029400489723
cried planchet   11.903025839036674
then a singular thing occurred   14.041236525017732
who can tell   11.478442778752935
add five lire a day more for extras that will make forty and there s an end of it   15.186482329190412
yes   16.537909684590936
i only make a remark   14.05011731451009
kitchens   9.57493875077147
if there are three let yourself be slain but save the king   16.8183125868622
this time milady really pushed him away from her   8.410604101804322
he is a wise man according to his own showing   11.792051661499457
d artagnan made all these remarks with the rapidity of a most minute observer and doubtless from an instinctive feeling that this stranger was destined to have a great influence over his future life   16.457633985063115
and am i not a hundred times better thus   16.566624046712338
responded dantès almost terrified   12.99179398985921
give me therefore one more day before i invite you   12.702156307055926
because replied d artagnan the queen desired every one to leave and i thought that this command was intended for us as well as for the rest   15.293654372140665
1   10.270434796790079
my lord said athos in a position so precarious as ours we must examine the earth and not the heavens   7.358752160391196
have you served under the usurper   13.623887370668994
then he slowly uttered these words who is now dying in your house   9.228893897790241
what my god   3.997927504609917
that is well   9.492019072124634
be tranquil and go wait for me in my chamber   9.025621703188783
merely the 5 000 000 you have about you   4.165742939681414
mazarin smiled but became very pale   17.25508683108983
by aramis is meant simara which is the name of a demon   7.389212430747597
all   13.506962625364196
mousqueton was in the third heaven and would have embraced d artagnan had he dared   7.614001708093221
the arrest produced no sensation indeed was almost unknown and scarcely interrupted the course of events   14.322351412176596
the queen was seated on a fauteuil and before her were standing two or three gentlemen and among them the duc de chatillon the brother of the nobleman killed eight or nine years previously in a duel on account of madame de longueville on the place royale   9.76460634844608
a thousand thanks said the count your invitation is most gracious and i regret exceedingly that it is not in my power to accept it   14.040884197055746
i am brave   17.674704658143487
the queen unconsciously touched here upon the exciting question   9.110847746072222
then i will not leave you   9.262842049625656
that is what deceives you debray   9.438693479936035
come you understand me   10.33697345887373
if they should arrest him i know that sometimes prisons afford means of escape will you leave him in prison   11.004401882128413
resumed mazarin with his artful smile   13.044186755541814
i thought so   10.82132488362825
see   15.49924481187932
fernand gave a groan which resembled a sob and dropped his head into his hands his elbows leaning on the table   12.199293886753324
beyond portsmouth the sea was covered with vessels whose masts like a forest of poplars despoiled by the winter bent with each breath of the wind   13.281553284144435
have the kindness to keep it safely for me until i quit my prison   14.063720018844858
listen to me mother and do not yield too much to agitation   12.177633272434758
well then this noise of thunder however much your majesty may have wished to continue playing has said go in sire   14.105807838921008
chapter lxxxviii   14.394123599330861
without doubt senor   10.26846420874935
i see nothing in that very extraordinary   18.645488819014567
bah said athos we were always dry   13.31880494430391
she took successively all the other papers out till the drawer was empty   10.10729267056556
i have never inquired the amount of her fortune which however limited it may be exceeds mine   10.209014763323355
entered the tunnel again drew the bed against the wall returned to the other cell took from the hiding place the needle and thread flung off his rags that they might feel only naked flesh beneath the coarse canvas and getting inside the sack placed himself in the posture in which the dead body had been laid and sewed up the mouth of the sack from the inside   9.988784666674457
oh i should wish nothing better than that he would come and seek a quarrel with me   10.643108485182692
morrel raised his two hands to heaven with an expression of resignation and sublime gratitude   11.144728712598274
but you know that even such an acquaintance as that might warrant my doing what you ask   14.183712975277576
most assuredly   9.16404796571934
it was in italy most probably replied monte cristo   13.990758994783048
if my pardon be complete we shall return triumphant to yanina   19.284804221802297
and five minutes after a boat appeared rowed by four men   6.961084023852552
the comte de la fere himself   14.137419153233363
at this moment an officer with a pleasant face opened a door continued to exchange some words with a person in the next chamber and then came up to the prisoner   15.825356658968232
they were both orphans and had only their employers leave to ask which had been already sought and obtained   10.711369271726044
no i had no such idea   18.45225273204666
the cardinal in deep thought and in silence began to take off the robes of state he had assumed in order to be present at the sitting of parliament and to attire himself in the military coat which he wore with a certain degree of easy grace owing to his former campaigns in italy   12.089144203332518
i recollect him perfectly   15.714125425600157
you must be mad to run against people in this manner   9.923156071072487
meaning to say rejoined monte cristo that however thomson french may be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and folly the baron danglars is not disposed to follow their example   7.751322689077698
danglars   6.679780324218352
then when he could not possibly entertain any doubt of the matter his eyebrows slightly bent and with an accent of irony and insolence impossible to be described he replied to d artagnan i was not speaking to you sir   9.182728056673163
be satisfied of that   8.991241956616173
m   16.152118820735673
and if i refuse to retract you wish to fight do you   11.8303272544123
now my dear host while your young man was insensible you did not fail i am quite sure to ascertain what that pocket contained   16.119861426958103
with black eyes black hair black eyebrows   16.11626679752122
though it was scarcely daylight our four travelers found the town in a great bustle owing to the reported approach of harrison and the king   9.953606639029154
everything was in readiness   17.20049765621627
without uttering a word they bandaged his eyes with a care that showed their apprehensions of his committing some indiscretion   18.730645551773378
at this athos and aramis could not help exchanging not only a look but a smile   13.243151357948385
had the old man s face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less emotion at this news than was now to be traced there   14.05035664722704
rest assured cried the duchess i shall do what i can   9.806322626846574
describe to me your abduction i pray you   11.084572724846339
0051m fernand probably excited beyond bearing pricked by danglars as the bull is by the bandilleros was about to rush out   15.377926067200786
who had taken him rich brave glorious beloved by women feared by men to cut off his life s best happiest years   12.529654759195681
asked he with a more sorrowful than angry tone   10.560082300348975
and if you were at rome the house of thomson french would make no more difficulty about paying the money on my receipt than you have just done   17.858774391037777
and instead of four musketoons and twelve balls we shall have fifteen guns and a hundred charges to fire   7.109676572609122
i swear not only that it shall never again be pointed at your breast but that in the bottom of my heart there will never in future be the slightest hostile sentiment   9.186106528367462
listen if you please till i have finished speaking replied monte cristo   18.470889259706798
no certainly not said the count with a haughty expression   7.3734862488053325
porthos told him of it in his calm manner   7.195149805009995
planchet had just done the same when an unexpected weight fell upon the back of the horse which sank down   12.927165599523507
morrel unhappy   8.591055672319117
oh quite the contrary dear friend i swear   17.98884403245123
forsooth i don t know   9.920653039793995
does she know you   11.635868896135818
i have received no orders on that point   12.90753585054855
mousqueton trembled in all his members   16.5296929075419
athos uttered a groan and let his head sink on his hands   10.613820639312785
bonacieux with great emotion in my name i beg you   13.406569055505406
mordaunt put his hand into the hat took out one of the three papers and disdainfully dropped it on the table without reading it   19.225332809746963
but aramis was livid   1.3071303609471414
unquestionably edmond s star is in the ascendant and he will marry the splendid girl he will be captain too and laugh at us all unless a sinister smile passed over danglars lips unless i take a hand in the affair he added   13.147162559802526
said francis i   10.818090438868857
pray do so i delight in stories cried the cardinal   14.620258089615326
m   7.019053435251988
and his immense riches whence does he procure them   11.96576040067588
the next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of slate and began   10.573472780157111
i have answered for you   12.59164638461573
afterward   8.490681811755767
she howled as the hurricane howled   5.901345725102802
the ribbons which held them have been cut with scissors   11.001983985985955
before god and before men said he i accuse this woman of having caused the assassination of the duke of buckingham   11.160423656772597
ah my dear monsieur bonacieux you are generous in this matter   12.443794952491954
at what hour   12.214019717539335
yes said danglars darting at edmond a look gleaming with hate   10.298993839324078
where if you please   15.237418432290642
and there will be fine doings if you do not take care   9.964825264379387
yet on his arrival morrel did not utter a complaint or say one harsh word   13.140678570606857
but these tears flowed for another   8.70227798154952
oh no   12.545348906127389
but these 200 francs   11.371947461941119
one takes no note of time   18.391809508479945
good very good said porthos   11.339332913556696
it must be aramis   13.890347059733777
perhaps this would not have been so had it been possible to get rid of m   7.867384925765028
bertuccio made amends however by loading the antechambers staircases and mantle pieces with flowers   14.73632005747975
i wager that i uttered a thousand extravagances   6.863166478138405
there is here no question of crime or treason   13.445749430393203
it had long been an object of ambition for porthos   15.358921480390897
and this very tool has sufficed me to hollow out the road by which i came hither a distance of about fifty feet   9.263411635424449
on reaching the courtyard they heard the noise of a carriage which stopped at the gate   22.713143945604358
do you expect news from him   15.351957829043503
yes here we are said porthos   18.045034814946035
peppino obeyed and franz and the count were in utter darkness except that fifty paces in advance of them a reddish glare more evident since peppino had put out his torch was visible along the wall   9.806786109904674
if beauchamp be disposed to retract you ought at least to give him the opportunity of doing it of his own free will the satisfaction to you will be the same   17.51238139594729
well then do me the kindness to give him my regards and tell him that i am his neighbor   16.03857609538576
i offered you tyburn said lord de winter   10.932914067088873
although the day had been fatiguing neither of them was inclined to sleep   5.788173686999115
he was thinking by himself and even seriously racking his brain to find a direction for this single force four times multiplied with which he did not doubt as with the lever for which archimedes sought they should succeed in moving the world when someone tapped gently at his door   11.706161970488527
i will denounce you before men as i have denounced you before god   17.023048300600262
the bed which she had kept from prudence and that they might believe her seriously wounded burned her like a bed of fire   23.77039364617447
it was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which i should soon be under the necessity of adopting   11.993913086958528
d artagnan perceived that it would be disobliging athos not to leave him alone   11.323640667179184
is what you tell me true   6.390712679020275
have i not always fought for your glory and interests   5.295634851827955
what to do   9.661009546804294
i have nothing more to do with them nor they with me   18.883623306759116
cried porthos   7.424245377239655
that was the name which the traveller gave to vampa as his own   2.8416093383197634
no monseigneur for the only thing for which i could be arrested is still unknown to your eminence   12.767931444284207
de morcerf interrupted morrel   13.890717630980285
and you athos   12.374228330222254
it was on another   18.41767426209559
bah said debray   2.4985987846854396
on the staircase he met athos and porthos who were coming to see him   6.534280974047737
but it is not the same with travellers   12.061408235434392
no monseigneur   6.753852354631749
yes   0.6218187901814147
30175m yes looked the invalid his eye beaming with delight at the ready interpretation of his meaning   8.184583557016182
morrel accompanied the count to the harbor   10.612959719846112
the last alternative seemed the most prudent so he waited until twelve o clock   7.7918288839374235
now it is time that the malady should be over said she   9.371832188805646
i wish he said with his cunning smile to prevent them from being ungrateful to me   15.246903957201956
in fifteen or twenty days i shall set out for la rochelle with the army   9.59989599208767
chapter lxxii   14.747695297478952
no no continued d artagnan it was not the measured step of a foot soldier nor was it the gait of a horseman   8.412634374237465
athos moved toward the door   9.638279521514356
let me at least reach a shady spot said andrea   3.5609331339552917
most assuredly responded madame de villefort in the same tone   12.865979151126114
father said mercédès stopping when she had reached the centre of the table sit i pray you on my right hand   9.77975904215553
my lord said raoul blushing might examine the spanish prisoner   14.72038532545529
and this king s attorney was named villefort   13.487429141816285
it was the plan of alexander vi   11.269280220509614
were you a party man   5.720807484621994
so would you   12.321464878053716
yes my dear father and with your permission now i have seen you and know you are well and have all you require i will ask your consent to go and pay a visit to the catalans   12.672681426808348
and now said morrel when he had finished the first part of his recital now i have told you of my love and my hopes may i inform you of my intentions   16.48473497732285
why   14.126143974647327
no   12.44924172715805
well every time i have seen mercédès come into the city she has been accompanied by a tall strapping black eyed catalan with a red complexion brown skin and fierce air whom she calls cousin   9.276918884749302
château renaud perceived him and immediately alighting from his coupé joined him   6.7887452523581215
you have often heard me speak of them have you not my friend   15.242123583940586
d artagnan checked him by a glance from the corner of his eye   13.757168667915588
and as he spoke he put his hand on the holster of his uncle s saddle bow   9.827743190605966
these gentlemen wage war on private account and in buying them up by granting them what they wished monsieur le cardinal has made a good bargain   7.896862736305401
come come continued the count i see you are still the same an assassin   6.443970574837202
sitting alone in the front of a box immediately opposite but situated on the third row was a woman of exquisite beauty dressed in a greek costume which evidently from the ease and grace with which she wore it was her national attire   11.09963016770515
ah count said albert i assure you madame de morcerf speaks freely to me and if you have not felt those sympathetic fibres of which i spoke just now thrill within you you must be entirely devoid of them for during the last four days we have spoken of no one else   11.305976450861207
said she clasping her hands forgive your child for being the bearer of evil tidings   13.823550270342427
the man who lives to see shall see   14.035604235736937
again he climbed the rocky height he had ascended the previous evening and strained his view to catch every peculiarity of the landscape   11.035877044358614
good it is by my side   13.724674338687558
the abbé took the note   5.752359068250843
and remember that two legged tigers and crocodiles are more dangerous than the others   17.961048673702813
so that what we presumed to be merely the betrothal feast turns out to be the actual wedding dinner   18.34558157890304
ah you speak spanish   7.615774579166471
in a splendid chamber of the palais royal formerly styled the palais cardinal a man was sitting in deep reverie his head supported on his hands leaning over a gilt and inlaid table which was covered with letters and papers   16.23924361348054
a pen a pen   6.759070939912958
oh madame   10.017233299737565
said milady in that harmonious voice which like that of the ancient enchantresses charmed all whom she wished to destroy   10.926064260150147
an infallible one   9.12507840772464
finally i call those third rate fortunes which are composed of a fluctuating capital dependent upon the will of others or upon chances which a bankruptcy involves or a false telegram shakes such as banks speculations of the day in fact all operations under the influence of greater or less mischances the whole bringing in a real or fictitious capital of about fifteen millions   12.447303184897027
the profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused over his features a refined intellectual expression   11.476460506625452
but when i have found them then tremble sir   11.068663701587154
if your friend remains another week in my cellar i shall be a ruined man   13.532779021233875
only they sent mousqueton to tell planchet that his master was requested the instant that he left the trenches to come to the quarters of the musketeers   7.878134272760346
as for me said planchet i seem to smell from this place even a most delectable perfume of fine roast meat and to see the scullions in a row by the hedge hailing our approach   6.146914333677397
ah pardon me said château renaud   7.0309345825381495
how does that annoy you   12.331165490687361
you ve missed me cried aramis but i swear to heaven   13.83655119190787
this young boarder of yours has she tried to fly   13.804623330548708
said mousqueton   16.47726158473093
yes he s not a man to allow himself to be taken anyhow   9.166463171730221
the young man was too well acquainted with the business of the house not to feel that a great catastrophe hung over the morrel family   5.823098356821937
your dinner has been a real feast   8.257492207382853
the sultans and viziers who rule over society there and who constitute what in france we call the government are really haroun al raschids and giaffars who not only pardon a poisoner but even make him a prime minister if his crime has been an ingenious one and who under such circumstances have the whole story written in letters of gold to divert their hours of idleness and ennui   13.216901900101385
parliament indeed   15.536070154946756
this concerns your head i warn you   13.54332526493624
ah said the count watching andrea s countenance i do not demand any confession from you   4.632295725391442
you were saying my dear friend no   17.846992082592905
well come   16.809331432986294
cried broussel trying to disengage himself from the grasp of his two daughters and by a look restrain his son who seemed determined to dispute authority   14.57702939329765
when m   11.291960203047974
but she she was very beautiful   10.627289718740588
well i should think so since the count has found him a false father since the count gives him four thousand francs a month and leaves him 500 000 francs in his will   6.8482508224082075
i know it is very bitter said valentine   14.155738999434755
don t mention it   12.361493763403665
to saint helena   11.802480767424765
porthos tried and passed the upper portion of his body through   15.34681292275826
we will then return to breakfast and you shall attend to your affairs and i to mine   14.751178957076538
well speak if it depends on me   11.15457099773535
i am very ignorant of these matters said the abbess at length   6.352943214109955
c below   13.690314270315348

chapter xv   14.078052827578489
my mother in law expended gold caresses dignities on concini who ruined her   8.388091314759444
this idea was one of vengeance to me and i tasted it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my captivity   3.37683886841182
if you like replied the latter   18.108561273400078
a man wrapped in a cloak appeared at the door but seeing a stranger he beckoned to his companions and two men who were drinking in the inn went out to speak to him   10.211779866826976
and where did they live   10.06672758353924
asked franz somewhat incredulously   15.928624981672156
then turning towards edmond who was walking away a pleasant journey he cried   9.549100800971306
30169m notary said she do you want a notary dear grandpapa   16.617006985631924
yes yes   11.695597090496216
crushed and impoverished by taxation imposed by mazarin whose avarice impelled him to grind them down to the very dust the people as the advocate general talon described it had nothing left to them except their souls   10.068068231532452
shall my father be informed of your wish   12.101775381282613
gentlemen said athos addressing at the same time his companions and their adversaries are we ready   5.890379011864549
but i can not accept the offer of anyone of these gentlemen since my habitation is already prepared   9.346472317764256
there was an energy a conviction and a sincerity in the manner of the young man which silenced the tumult   7.8594545410467695
said the queen   7.610497254261119
well said he do you still doubt   13.387861818214473
it was very boldly written if disguised   14.44835498469937
then you permit me to go you are not angry in your heart   18.003017327011044
for owing to the good taste of mercédès one was sure of finding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing or even copying in case of need   8.878669158956647
speak i beg of you   9.348247628948258
rascal   13.390653848330103
ali reappeared for the third time and drew back the tapestried hanging which concealed the door to signify to his master and albert that they were at liberty to pass on   14.060918305841614
the lightning answered the captain our felucca   10.068182935812805
all is paid   7.720061940222539
monsieur said the prince turning toward raoul i know that you have a letter from my sister madame de longueville   13.258002433544636
oh sir reply i entreat you is not the comte de la fere a noble whom i remember handsome and brave a musketeer under louis xiii   10.685403570628388
the accusation comes from monsieur de la trémouille from the duke himself   8.26667679035225
heaven forfend   16.272317503906024
and athos i don t see athos   14.591170541401253
this is terrible said athos   4.983960743094169
haydée would it please you not to leave me   16.235053443245967
asked albert in his turn astonished at this strange theory   5.554875179634298
of all his friends athos was the eldest and the least resembling him in appearance in his tastes and sympathies   10.035872944124048
he perfectly understood them and undertook to procure for me a man s passport and two days after i received this to which i have added with my own hand travelling with his sister   10.283746326524673
standing before the chimney was a man of middle height of a haughty proud mien   13.055690524274652
for what purpose   11.789537188602994
to arms   7.599801628861786
he stammered edward   14.278776757808377
but likewise upon our word as gentlemen added athos knitting his brow monsieur d artagnan shall not leave us   15.448559284598995
another method of assassination   20.08434353829299
cried the baron   9.39301999947176
and moreover monte cristo had told him when half distracted he had rushed to the count s house that if she were not dead in two hours she would be saved   22.031472558367618
this last expression of richelieu s conveyed a terrible doubt   10.716903372198322
for i saw the account and copied it down   11.878630839654564
cried the owner greatly delighted   7.943042790379075
franz did not disturb him whilst he absorbed his favorite sweetmeat but when he had finished he inquired what then is this precious stuff   16.555423164711808
i fancy myself there and that i see him staggering and hear him stammering said planchet in a piteous tone but at all events we shall soon know the real state of things for i imagine that those lofty walls now turning ruby in the setting sun are the walls of blois   14.063428125595781
hush gentlemen here is the court   14.140049129803998
of how many does it consist   21.688886225034942
but by degrees carlini s features relaxed his hand which had grasped one of the pistols in his belt fell to his side   12.18303609322822
another time at my own house in the country in my château at when i had a château   8.357441941344902
if that is all it is easily done said porthos   12.133850432939154
i your son as you call me i will not let you   8.783312626529131
the count turned round as he heard the entrance of danglars into the room   8.183074651812504
it is hoped that no ties of friendship or humane consideration will induce you to conceal the truth   7.181396169964349
and madame de saint méran   10.757308045815979
nevertheless aramis was in a good situation and able to defend himself   11.97324802140488
julie and emmanuel have a thousand things to tell you   15.226500902320357
your feet too said grimaud   11.235730072215542
what i am about to say is very serious   11.839766631376477
you would wish a notary to be sent for then   4.949938950519041
as your excellency pleases   14.244024503589296
yes replied d artagnan   8.605343296896317
de villefort   14.881127264350983
yes   17.187618817478835
franz read it twice before he could comprehend what it contained   10.840058301952217
around the schooner lay a number of small fishing boats belonging to the fishermen of the neighboring village like humble subjects awaiting orders from their queen   13.756169777485898
but look me in the face   13.061425135828122
i now understand why you are in the service of cromwell   6.237727441885503
for he had risen from his seat and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong upon his rival when mercédès smiling and graceful lifted up her lovely head and looked at them with her clear and bright eyes   16.718391840873686
the hostler enchanted with the good day s work he had done returned to the yard   10.068881635209852
the two children met sat down near each other let their flocks mingle together played laughed and conversed together   17.600017052019922
madame he said kneeling look upon the unhappy man at your feet   13.363392330012875
willingly replied de chatillon   20.428247167587664
as a soldier the man ranks well   13.34161776226033
on our arrival in paris we shall still have four hundred besides the harnesses said porthos   13.87538326154183
mazarin wiped his forehead and looked around him   19.40973496786101
the door being closed the four friends waited in expectation   13.113175069889415
murmured the young woman ought i to confide such a secret to you monsieur   12.676676727728239
what is the matter   20.21803891194139
with this animal which he called pistache he was often shut up for hours alone superintending as every one supposed its education   12.150702385827218
her majesty did me the honor to grant me that favor   11.57234688778637
let us try what we can do then said the notary   13.520472953521313
at this moment athos perceived a man walking on the seashore parallel to the jetty and hastening his steps as if to reach the other side of the port scarcely twenty steps from the place of embarking   13.960290442292807
we have served them to the best of our poor means and god will recompense the will forgive the want of power   14.822732055412002
said he   10.247731852968398
and he had no doubt but that with his eccentric character his characteristic face and his colossal fortune he would produce a great effect there   8.685643106301322
and the third time made this large wound   5.530091695674521
yes he had us conducted into the orangery by monsieur bernouin his valet de chambre and from there we followed him to visit the comte de la fere   9.30213816944076
all night he heard the subterranean workman who continued to mine his way   5.868687987141667
be silent i will write   9.295876868052057
he remained there ten minutes motionless and dumb listening to the beating of his own heart   16.289954787849027
two guards attended the mercer who made him traverse a court and enter a corridor in which were three sentinels opened a door and pushed him unceremoniously into a low room where the only furniture was a table a chair and a commissary   12.476989373941155
oh heavens   12.865846294706351
you can not be speaking seriously athos   15.317496967643086
cried anne of austria   13.419459057635974
cried comminges   11.163898400248662

his head fell back and the lower extremities of the body began to stiffen   11.69399144969462
it was proposed for the museum   13.504862754938497
the sick man was not yet able to speak but he pointed with evident anxiety towards the door   15.162080742003637

for that which almost proved that he was the son of richelieu was his everlasting pretension   11.448164323437483
every kind of revenge was practiced upon the duke by the governor in return for the insults of the innocent pistache   17.504451476667143
tomorrow immediately when you please   7.681284982000163
said fourreau whose teeth chattered with terror i wanted to get him out of the way that i might drink myself   7.529506676252255
asked debray   10.987056050940739
speak out there s a worthy fellow   11.253414077499896
yes said albert but this has nothing to do with the existence of the count of monte cristo   18.693513622009352
the cries which the police officer repeated twenty times in the king s name were powerless against this formidable multitude seemed on the contrary to exasperate it still more   10.941547032707671
it appeared as if the ceiling sank upon my head and crushed me with its weight   7.949193885479495
how they had gone together to the tennis court and how upon the fear he had manifested lest he receive a ball in the face he had been jeered at by bernajoux who had nearly paid for his jeer with his life and m   11.141864969532122
i have an infernal spirit   9.641366260261876
morrel rushed forward to tear it from him but monte cristo perceiving his intention seized his wrist with his iron grasp   5.525182360801336
two or three hundred roman crowns   10.956541887757917
asked he   16.40793664575429
silence is the last joy of the unhappy   14.666354617023996
twenty five years old   16.169259718048956
well a pleasant journey   15.048314618312888
and being a musketeer but for a time i only fight when i am forced to do so and always with great repugnance   12.824906479160166
but where are you going to eat my breakfast   6.396883767425264
for seeing that i hate drinking by myself you shall drink with me   11.916796299389643
then through the grating to which she had drawn near milady saw the young man make a sign with delirious fervor and depart in an apparent transport of joy   17.990547179632035
valentine was looking at her grandfather with a smile of intense gratitude and villefort was biting his lips with vexation while madame de villefort could not succeed in repressing an inward feeling of joy which in spite of herself appeared in her whole countenance   10.526316725834072
d avrigny accosted the priest   10.15127772844235
so let us go and get killed where we are told to go   16.791843273434655
d artagnan rose and taking a letter from his writing desk presented it to raoul   13.709855466396569
i disturb you perhaps my dear aramis continued d artagnan for by what i see i am led to believe that you are confessing to these gentlemen   2.6605671035108642
i hope we shall have something better to do to night than to draw the sword   6.003185476935663
that is precisely what i mean said danglars almost digging his nails into his breast while he preserved on his harsh features the smile of the heartless though clever man   3.4963627039554552
no sentinels no one at any of the windows   8.752164496456196
yonder is the house porthos said the gascon   11.78658238139524
besides they say i am already rich in right of my mother too rich even   19.654290228882083
all i can say is if ever i should get such a chance the living should be my theme   9.989943649337551
that communication had arrived too late   15.977249133228383
so for the last time steer to monte cristo   6.208147508672917
in a few hours they were in the capital   13.226048242936043
mercédès begged for six months more in which to await and mourn for edmond   8.934157270882782
believe me continued tréville in enterprises of this kind in order that one may arrive four must set out   8.236829403631171
you madame de villefort and her son   17.957798695361998
and two paces farther is the grave in which he had just buried his child   12.047218635910452
mazarin went to the right hand and aramis could see the prisoner disappear at the turning of the avenue   13.794859041820608
nevertheless you must not exaggerate the evil said monte cristo for by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into another   15.955896690868574
but when the cardinal added that not only mme   21.442623464397492
nor the nobles nor the princes who are the military power of france   12.424358415367394
baptistin left the room without waiting to answer and in two seconds reappeared bringing on a tray all that his master had ordered ready prepared and appearing to have sprung from the ground like the repasts which we read of in fairy tales   14.262531657006477
monsieur mordaunt he said since after running after one another so long chance has at last brought us together let us have a little conversation if you please   13.861861256249604
what is it sir   1.884798139445829
yes as far as i am personally concerned   17.06184712773513
i am cold sir said mousqueton   8.821380326592063
well what does your instinct tell you now   12.689058838482174
i know not whom   10.995753528588095
said mazarin with a grimace which he always made when spoken to about money   12.273273471830233
i will do without a promise and voluntarily all that i can do to serve the king and be agreeable to the queen   9.616316719095405
she was my mother   7.672307516486772
suppose i were a soldier like you and ordered to carry a certain redoubt and you knew i must be killed in the assault would you not say to me as you said just now go father   24.132876700103935
be clear short and precise   11.729832697009426
she is already late   14.130096396194556
then he saw beneath a thick clump of linden trees which were nearly divested of foliage madame de villefort sitting with a book in her hand the perusal of which she frequently interrupted to smile upon her son or to throw back his elastic ball which he obstinately threw from the drawing room into the garden   16.105437991204973
said the novice   12.737734607932115
said m   8.398082109010643
oh there is no difficulty in that   12.885116559352804
i prefer listening to you here my dear m   10.838111300917989
i leave behind me as a pledge this pin worth ten times the amount   8.321410713625069
i think he is violently agitated   10.299112765848799
said athos   12.083925924050487
it is not a wonder they are fat sleeping all day and only waking to eat all night   7.277587793569639

felton named lord de winter   8.242940538193706
when i am at the mercy of every scribbler in the palais royal who covers waste paper with nonsense or of every country squire in the kingdom   8.831762125767812
inquired a turnkey   10.806209684972039
yes   7.5746877793426695
when the day after the arrival of this answer your father came by the advice of monte cristo to ask my daughter s hand for you i decidedly refused him but without any explanation or exposure   6.3710393149454925
athos at that moment extended his hand with the air of supreme command which characterized him alone drew out his sword and the scabbard at the same time broke the blade in the sheath on his knee and threw the pieces to his right   11.43546251736418
very good said the queen be as grateful as you like it does not implicate me   2.7081510164656244
and instantly grimaud sitting upon the board as if on horseback commenced his perilous descent   12.787827713888545
i can not explain myself   17.5052436563841
mazarin opened the coffer   11.633406558469307
conversational   15.79341297221881
to day flatter and caress or you are only a common woman   12.301128667734094
athos and aramis walked down toward the port   12.803858965409884
he dressed in the picturesque costume worn upon grand occasions by the inhabitants of the south of france bearing equal resemblance to the style adopted both by the catalans and andalusians   3.6945070650830854
an instant after porthos and aramis re entered the surgeon and m   14.03973746281529
come my friend come let me embrace you   9.794390731271303
does he desire to play the part in france that cromwell plays in england   18.746720711084276
yes there were some people on the way who delayed me   9.848404483029942
felton leaned for support upon a piece of furniture   6.108688849903824
exclaimed the count   16.588897657615757
oh command and i will obey   13.596858587708063
how monsieur   21.594523396601858
but monsieur porthos murmured the procurator s wife who began to feel that to judge by the conduct of the great ladies of the time she was wrong   9.742979351117587
well i am come to ask a favor of you   14.926020399847772
their names   12.08786903117381
the second notary had also arrived   13.581988330436294
and at these words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the catalan who as if fascinated by it came slowly towards edmond and offered him his hand   15.833305851317533
gutenberg   5.3358427194219145
he looks like a big bug said another   12.18340163971205
but though she could not see she could hear and the sneers of the crowd reached her in the carriage   15.281948577628867
the officer sprang out of the apartment with that alacrity which all the servants of the cardinal displayed in obeying him   9.36058417808409
what fortune has she   13.26961391030022
athos knelt down and the king passed the ribbon down from left to right as usual raised his sword and instead of pronouncing the customary formula i make you a knight   8.36334270967132
he no longer doubted that the daughter of king charles i   15.036642175736079

whence have you these ideas of death   8.680991721968052
oh it is no trouble to spend that   10.752996288176151
milady fell down and seemed to be in a swoon   14.889664425051613
for my part i am going to pay a second visit to this woman who i fear entertains sinister intentions upon her own life and i have received orders to watch her   10.951193440326993
porthos knocked at the door of a house to the right whilst d artagnan knocked at the door of a house to the left   9.913748309928451
there is a similarity of feeling at this instant between ourselves and the countess nothing more   8.633624944902746
the poor girl pale as death and trembling in all her limbs wished to delay her lover   7.603020255493193
ah   5.209197062992956
madame de villefort sent for him half an hour ago   8.078252843942758
the opening of this door disclosed a brilliant light and she disappeared   11.447773062585771
is it my father   4.132251470807836
yes   8.446412907784413

de boville who took it without ceremony and quickly drew up the required assignment while the englishman counted out the bank notes on the other side of the desk   19.72968748283862
he leaped on a rock from whence he could behold the sea   13.61959979893907
we must leave you said monte cristo   7.411263865477591
said athos useless   13.196728999431397
if it were one of your friends you would hesitate then   16.47201106634293
the truth is replied dantès that i am too happy for noisy mirth   10.983369340899515
at the end of an hour he heard a faint noise which increased   9.408020978561103
asked athos   14.816170487082726
ah but what is the matter with your hand d artagnan   17.39516875746074
there again monte cristo was assailed by a multitude of thoughts   7.946445403078332
hart was the originator of the project gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone   10.404515398862639

cried the priest with a laugh which made the dying man s hair stand on end   13.489384473686952
20291m and asked the count did you ever know the name of this woman   1.410299833496289
to take spies and hang them to make hazardous expeditions upon the dyke or the sea to imagine wild plans and to execute them coolly such were the pastimes which made the army find these days short which were not only so long to the rochellais a prey to famine and anxiety but even to the cardinal who blockaded them so closely   10.734946960643574
no replied d artagnan   14.482533469329313

he was des roches le masle canon of notre dame who had formerly been valet of a bishop who introduced him to his eminence as a perfectly devout man   9.764357123963183
monsieur baptistin said the count you have been in my service one year the time i generally give myself to judge of the merits or demerits of those about me   11.044011986229535

the shipowner smiling followed him with his eyes until he saw him spring out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng which from five o clock in the morning until nine o clock at night swarms in the famous street of la canebière a street of which the modern phocéens are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world and with that accent which gives so much character to what is said if paris had la canebière paris would be a second marseilles   10.471995679292903

that would spoil my plans   9.462425799818
raoul has no fortune other than i possess poor child   10.750655526247392
would you like a proof of it   2.5279377934278813
better for him in future that he should be supposed never to have seen me   12.496385550330954
why not   8.456613688924186
on seeing them athos and aramis stood still   6.430757325850589
noirtier uttered a kind of hoarse rattling sound   20.676969217413845
they have abducted her added the commissary   6.950703340750399
oh exclaimed dantès you are goodness itself   9.019447242555898
now to the work i have in hand   7.713436722221309
the balls might be heard peppering the facade of the palais royal and one of them passing under d artagnan s arm entered and broke a mirror in which porthos was complacently admiring himself   9.989130891540764
cried the surrounding group   11.098417604651761
at last however we succeeded and worked up to arles   14.361535736837045
yes and i say to you if you are really strong really superior really pious or impenetrable which you were right in saying amounts to the same thing then be proud sir for that is the characteristic of predominance   6.9601522563841165
i repeat my words aramis and then if you desire it and if they desire it let us separate forever from our old friends   9.775647880249199
0056m yes   9.62425640956954
really i like him extremely   16.761169060180567
and if i am guilty to be shot   22.07212738595768
does the letter contain anything valuable   10.966965625176751
i pretended that i disliked the idea that a house belonging to my wife s father and mother should pass into the hands of strangers   13.310855853963378
we wish to judge you according to your crime said athos   15.313903862825528
on the contrary it is a matter of the utmost importance edmond   6.758445846593947
sulpice and st   18.385970382922075
say i am condemned sir if you please   15.125856591617996
i hoped your house would have been some other one than this   15.528587458888522
besides the name of the comtesse de winter which she had heard the abbess pronounce was wholly unknown to her and she was even ignorant that a woman had had so great and so fatal a share in the misfortune of her life   13.689867756994229
the ball chapter 71   4.48186262187058
another shot of a carbine was heard   18.64609081982335
your excellency may depend upon me   8.755348989368457
yet through a singular impulse it was neither to her mother nor her brother that she applied but to emmanuel   12.776207771364898
d artagnan i ask your pardon for having yesterday crossed swords with you   1.372889336629541
the hostess who knew d artagnan s skill with the sword began to weep and tear her hair   18.704971301308483
ah you are only one and twenty and can forget the past   15.981452151742781
he is as you see a very valuable animal said maximilian   12.873187662206686
the four others were french and wore the uniform of musketeers   13.179472862116448
in a second i had disinterred the box   12.286899317735482
but how shall i ascertain   9.671626402971357
i feel the same as regards yourself   10.138982848349537
the one seemed to be deprived of reason yet he was meditating   9.55695198726821
for the persons of whom i am about to talk are rich and powerful and if they only laid the tips of their fingers on me i should break to pieces like glass   16.68583152263587
hold your tongue said he and let me answer   9.9544274738513
on the capture of charles stuart   14.29709006016876
have a care cried porthos to his opponent   15.553396480320405
so i went to danglars who would not even receive me   13.618117574754477
he could not believe in such a miracle   21.67931125244883
ah it is no then   10.408764798465526
these studs can not be trusted to anybody   8.119623031557744
and the legs of mutton of the salt marshes said porthos smacking his lips   9.978882154361251
yes my lord   13.40969027219295
said athos   12.618617284421273
in the intervening time buckingham perhaps sent him to paris as he did the horses   10.045293008590821
ah it is certainly you   14.366909898733372
muttered athos   10.323108188977303
plaints made in common are almost prayers and prayers where two or three are gathered together invoke the mercy of heaven   13.74222163924625
besides you compensate for your mistakes in so gentlemanly a way that one almost feels obliged to you for having committed them   12.63067883113987
well pardieu   8.925978196213112
his name had been mentioned as a name of terror at the palais royal   12.523815251384416
with difficulty but he can speak   17.35694096228223
that is true said d artagnan let us call the others   14.956867563673367
albert was right   10.734546225652569
night overtook her   14.912507105920547
cried a hostler running out and looking after the stranger monsieur here is a paper which dropped out of your hat   12.787655421247448
will you permit a grandson of henry iv   11.07964079429208
screamed d artagnan throwing open the window   16.836512471901194
but you are not the king my son and can never be so while they are alive   7.094797220058991
four men one of them wounded and a youth say you   9.545718928191654
if the four friends were assembled at one of these moments a word thrown forth occasionally with a violent effort was the share athos furnished to the conversation   14.665907338963521
now to follow out this reasoning what is the marvellous   11.315358571962415
a single portrait signed by léopold robert shone in its carved and gilded frame   17.43949753886006
and the situation in which you are is a bed of roses compared to that in which you wished to place us and in which you have placed monsieur groslow and his companions   12.617192732504883
the first carriage which arrived after that of the queen was that of the prince de condé with the princess and dowager princess   7.7201947867680705
but take care for i fear that this man is entirely devoted to the cardinal   14.494512858901736
athos required no more   13.568725819326048
while in his eyes shaded by thick black lashes was concentrated as it often happens with an organ which is used to the exclusion of the others all the activity address force and intelligence which were formerly diffused over his whole body   10.889963103731926
as the count s title sounded on his ear he rose and addressing his colleagues who were members of one or the other chamber he said gentlemen pardon me for leaving you so abruptly   15.905161612838665
it is well replied mercédès with her eloquent glance   6.986246125838367
and the musketeer rose grumbling took his sword hat pistols and cloak and followed the officer whilst porthos alone and sole possessor of the bed endeavored to follow the good example of falling asleep which his predecessor had set him   19.945922952320668
yes madame   4.530066517615384
but might he not by this means destroy hopes far more important than the short lived satisfaction of his own curiosity   8.931835397884004
all this showed d artagnan that there was a veil which concealed something   12.98671884329358
and his scotch guard to louis xi   14.607605872902944
for brave men are very dear to the king and the king knows that his musketeers are the bravest on the earth   11.79741227539808
do you wish me to leave   10.099418558232252
yes   2.311805153218387
and the duke put the quill to the paper   13.494726662608805
the day after my return to lille my brother in his turn succeeded in making his escape   10.873853909796882
yes   3.6314465952055475
he then took franz s tablets out of his hand   16.10212609826267
peter   11.178261342239258
yes very well   11.865018143787633
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements   18.678450515590786
the monks had no longer an instant of repose   14.662818329660626
doubtless you wish to make me appear a very eccentric character   17.436393171021823
in crossing the principal street in derby the four friends perceived blaisois standing in the doorway of a handsome house   18.740228712132005
who s there   12.382746699897565
oh   15.441605607014745
i know because it is my office to know everything   4.511171116547938
another to our holy father the pope who had it set in his tiara opposite to one nearly as large though not so fine given by the emperor napoleon to his predecessor pius vii   14.137999749919295
be satisfied replied felton   11.408370721034492
indeed he does and in a most lavish manner i can assure you   17.293617662803925
porthos could hardly keep his countenance   1.9277755321036878
d épinay   11.369852267405715
de chevreuse who told it to two or three of her intimates that yielding to his vocation he had retired into a convent only into which nobody knew   11.023810816605717
alas how gladly would i exchange the half of this wealth for the happiness of at least sharing my father s love   10.455552820513928
d artagnan walked quickly in the direction indicated and found one of those exterior staircases that are still to be seen in the yards of our old fashioned taverns   18.005410885398305
but what he was really anxious for was to discover whose hand had traced them   12.057662908430467
i always obey madame when i am commanded by so gentle a voice   13.945105856810631
the bargain was concluded   12.709141963764099
he probably had succumbed   5.932461727384829
for the first article of the constitution is the king can do no wrong   8.704800104424066
ah   12.499168989101694
the carriage continued to roll on with frightful speed   17.31901244831456
he will wear on his doublet twelve diamond studs   18.86839808053053
0175m but said the abbé i would speak to you of a large sum amounting to five millions   10.722156615098829
by her husband who was a nobleman of your acquaintance continued d artagnan looking intently at athos   9.731489152886942
i   14.732074639922335
and i have always observed that the devil most obstinate to be expelled is a secret   10.302789605427789
well i wait patiently do i not   15.046129630666822
ah   8.637954879337272
you have dared my lord to imprison her majesty s musketeers   12.36439989344767
there is another way said morrel   16.68110143359963
he fixed on him a look of greater assurance than before and said you may perhaps be better satisfied that i should not go farther into particulars   13.827689643293805
i only wish i could see it now as plainly as i saw it lying all crushed and crumpled in a corner of the arbor   10.44417169076196
excellency returned bertuccio joining his hands and shaking his head in a manner that would have excited the count s laughter had not thoughts of a superior interest occupied him and rendered him attentive to the least revelation of this timorous conscience   16.282948415289436
i will run for it sir   10.861917056340648
we have so many worlds in the year of grace 1838   14.942703453855502
asked porthos   12.428801259334417
he has the true military style   19.220411008504108
andrea was indebted for this visit to the following circumstances   15.44644320751397
which   13.458608951909028
at this moment planchet brought out athos s horse   17.171455562688866
yes   10.980848080635274
what man   14.387021625641845
friend d artagnan continued he speaking to himself with all the amenity that he thought due himself if you escape of which there is not much chance i would advise you to practice perfect politeness for the future   13.60101672600386
at that moment the steward came in to consult his master upon the proceedings of the next day and also with regard to the shooting party which had been proposed   9.616573305024055
mazarin sprang forward   8.710432371489432
i could go in as well as grimaud said mousqueton a little piqued   9.590248064284573
exactly so said the host   15.033671209030901
then the postscript well   10.92489003514144
said monte cristo   9.524820099686696
i was expecting you   9.349619215448847
unless indeed you are disposed to offer me a supper and a bed in the neighborhood   5.109422927684776
since as i told you before i do not wish to comprehend it   3.4547273287639317
but scarcely had he stepped out of his carriage when the porter met him with a parcel in his hand   17.912741599710987
bonacieux who convinced by what she had just said saw nothing in this woman whom an instant before she had believed her rival but a sincere and devoted friend   12.436450515034482
i am always prepared to go only as you know i never do go and perhaps shall go this time as little as before   13.50566414508008
my apartment will be close to his   17.809157911975632
valentine was on the point of relating all that had passed but she suddenly remembered that in doing so she must reveal a terrible secret which concerned others as well as her grandfather and she said at some future time i will tell you all about it   14.701065727309198
ah   11.417671001492156
why when i found myself utterly destitute i thought my old friends would perhaps assist me   7.383693944545429
0313m two hours afterward dantès sailed from the port of genoa under the inspection of an immense crowd drawn together by curiosity to see the rich spanish nobleman who preferred managing his own yacht   12.82652455430695
i am like nero cupitor impossibilium   15.30944383247287
the more reason said mazarin   15.353236573800274
i am but a poor friend to you   17.703901914230496
ah   9.76725995446451
the queen clasped her hands in enthusiastic gratitude whilst her daughter threw her arms around her mother s neck and kissed her her own eyes streaming with tears   13.54712126393665
good said monte cristo to morrel who was at his house when the news arrived of the strange reverse of fortune of which danglars had been the victim i have just made a discovery for twenty five thousand francs for which i would have paid a hundred thousand   14.830193400703315
but with that exception i am a good drinker   6.645080659875826
add these four to the nine others that would be thirteen days lost thirteen days during which so many important events might pass in london   20.257461547265088
oh   11.946774299948649
but what is the matter with you   7.386302771754307
mazarin as a statesman will understand the politic necessity   15.882060998802128
the remembrance of strafford was a source of lasting remorse to him the shadow that haunted him by day and night   9.759426926154696
again you make a profit upon each article you purchase for my toilet amounting in the course of a year to a sum equalling your wages   16.61088430885533
i could the more easily distrust you   11.053783928579614
what said the count do you still regret anything in the world and yet die   10.32781671479556
i knew you were a corsican   5.313387389299284
therefore their first idea was to join the enemy   5.686266095196349
i shall bring that forward as an extenuating circumstance replied eugénie   3.974965516729867
cried mordaunt   16.31330306637385
here your excellency said peppino taking the fowl from the young bandit and placing it on the worm eaten table which with the stool and the goat skin bed formed the entire furniture of the cell   18.57053443867272
more more   9.118337560610232
at last the reflection rested on the summit of the mountain where it paused an instant like the fiery crest of a volcano then gloom gradually covered the summit as it had covered the base and the island now only appeared to be a gray mountain that grew continually darker   16.329342276939812
i sank exhausted with fatigue and terror into an armchair   16.204074995163595
you are a worthy daughter of epirus haydée and your charming and poetical ideas prove well your descent from that race of goddesses who claim your country as their birthplace   15.312234320099707
yes   9.03544456813456
maximilian stared for a moment at the corpse gazed all around the room then upon the two men   11.659072801026321
but he will draw upon his head the punishment reserved for the damned   11.93983273165877
but we could throw them into the ditch said porthos after having assured ourselves they have nothing in their pockets   11.380149697274716
ah you begin to awaken my regret   14.295398081360121
he will be found   10.349204797829247
m   13.84005715936266
in dying i will say to those around me what voltaire wrote to piron eo rus and all will be over   10.797009083024316
you have to do with that woman   9.013632492647167
then seeking the wall to support him he glided along close to it until he reached the door through which he went out backwards uttering this single mournful lamentable distressing cry edmond dantès   18.57886125191096
shall you see him on your return monsieur count   15.777448985720323
returned the abbé listen to what i have to say   18.98988333425001
well when you receive the remaining 40 000 you shall give me a receipt in full   18.499563601087196
praise god monsieur replied they bowing together   12.170384974664524
so you may plainly see tréville interrupted the king it was they who attacked   8.24252739481594
the red duke is capital   12.487983082658145
as to d artagnan he sprang toward jussac himself   14.325472794236674
you wish it you are inflexible   6.828502659968874
50237m no   9.820253394720003
all this was of such incredible immodesty of such monstrous effrontery that d artagnan could scarcely believe what he saw or what he heard   11.467820760209323
that i may relate my misfortunes for you to treat them as fables   5.48126806591159
and we were impatiently waited for at paris were we not   16.507379752630555
she had however just power to give one parting look to her grandfather who in losing her seemed to be resigning his very soul   19.005270207633796
the rabbit died   11.372823655087497
the governor laughed   9.521048992477798
you ought to know   9.375746310627193
the count is here said the officer and requests to speak with your eminence instantly   9.750008212944113
my father looked at his watch and paced up and down with a countenance expressive of the greatest anguish   22.02727218800914
raoul did not doubt this was the gentleman and his escort   7.731559572289956
what is that   12.274130679012906
monte cristo reflected one instant   3.2036555966474705
but it is not the case my dear count on the contrary   15.021195280834032
i did   13.100004868799722
of me   16.786467937958676
there has been no arrest   11.297096248190119
all the formalities have been gone through   11.282351386388028
a lieutenant in the corsican battalion   14.71506380086692
i have denied god and he has abandoned me   16.35193743214778
it may be remembered that he had the saddle which came from buckingham   13.84047565932008
the courtyard of this quarter is enclosed by enormous walls over which the sun glances obliquely when it deigns to penetrate into this gulf of moral and physical deformity   11.903457418782722
oh god   5.9662512432356
villefort pronounced these words with an accent which would have made the count shudder had he heard him   18.32315883609507
he was awaited by his family with extreme anxiety for from this journey to paris they hoped great things   11.232683691740142
i shall endeavor to be prepared for all suppositions   7.9863252084205625
de tréville we fancy that we have each cause to complain of the other and i am come to endeavor to clear up this affair   5.894831988905759
i saw you were unhappy and your unhappiness interested me   10.810699037800248
wilt thou allow the frightful projects of this man to be accomplished   5.701871152599485
every one stood up   13.046611143311571

he was thinking of mme   11.492874474473265
instead of running after adventures i shall accept an invitation from porthos   22.904425654969582
i implored heaven that he might come   11.124675665872726

and who   21.37161227730428
i own that this woman terrifies me   12.985497212844706

yes madame   14.263633354665831
but that beauty had gradually withered beneath the devastating influence of the slow fever so prevalent among dwellers by the ponds of aiguemortes and the marshes of camargue   9.53596696885758
but they are calling me   12.654516199727867
ah monsieur said planchet i saw one fall at each of his two shots and he appeared to me through the glass door to be fighting with his sword with the others   12.758408389398344
you are mistaken   9.148126300598276
the young man was opening the door of the stable   6.898319201152096
cried villefort   8.350344371926038
almost immediately bazin came downstairs   9.520068420947272
if they were not yet to be seen it was because the road made an elbow   8.21594705585319
beware   10.736503648977001
monsieur de mazarin is not a man of genius as i thought he is a man of no origin once a servant of cardinal bentivoglio and he got on by intrigue   10.67275177254805
so saying madame de saint méran extended her dry bony hand to villefort who while imprinting a son in law s respectful salute on it looked at renée as much as to say i must try and fancy tis your dear hand i kiss as it should have been   7.1961107705931076
but all my fortune is in england   12.511864874015403
i shall still continue to preserve the same respect toward m   12.94820531573705
so long as you are rich   16.03942892564944

always painful always ready to bleed when touched they remain fresh and open in the heart   8.368194310144151
what for   14.238908146485507
but it must be said that if he had seen it he attached so little importance to this scrap of paper and so much importance to his two hundred thousand francs that he would not have opposed whatever the englishman might do however irregular it might be   15.778149962764783
never mind   13.845940177926403
shall i go and fetch it doctor   14.241491806362939
it is very ingenious said the count   15.448308783742869

so they said   13.74755886758787
cried the poor tutor   17.425599206129647
you eat at everybody s mess   6.680640576886162
have you brought your arms   12.071044539220619
but my love came out from it more ardent and more eternal   11.768370265455422
athos you are not in your right senses i swear   10.252907205592646
where the devil didst thou learn it   16.570376970115866

everything shall be done as you say athos   15.169762631678472
monte cristo entered the tower which was divided into three stories   7.9057360262856395
and you my dear companion said he you speak of the baronesses countesses and princesses of others   8.467636120038303
in truth the walker who during the observations of the two friends had passed and repassed behind them several times stopped at the name of de winter   14.146158691601116
but you are only two   15.538566625934962
that is an idea   8.504324168094964
yes cried d artagnan raising his voice in turn i am here my friend   13.267900534676404
but i come to offer you a dress which will become you still better   8.153222929395254
milady shut the window extinguished the lamp and went as felton had desired her to lie down on the bed   6.2376457720523355
in fact at half past eight in the evening the grand salon the gallery adjoining and the three other drawing rooms on the same floor were filled with a perfumed crowd who sympathized but little in the event but who all participated in that love of being present wherever there is anything fresh to be seen   12.657801662939793
only imagine but do tell me viscount whether you really are acquainted with it or no   9.009886339897264
i will come directly cried valentine aloud   5.891209221322414
then said villefort more and more amazed and really supposing he was speaking to a mystic or a madman you consider yourself as one of those extraordinary beings whom you have mentioned   11.110908458769542
firstly at a given signal which shall be the words at last you each plunge a dagger into the heart of the soldier nearest to you   21.879730669218095

ah lips that say one thing while the heart thinks another murmured edmond   10.066752464109552
we listen monsieur athos   10.321943345820204
if that were so he was indeed a highly favored prince   13.797938223827499

bertuccio my steward takes me for a roman   12.99124882205315
what is done to infanticides in this country   13.622486513006708
yes   22.06734514144954
only his glance flashed like a sword in returning the furious looks of the queen   15.211034612932636
but you are not always travelling   7.3614850263307465
danglars   7.22602875979463
but all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which was familiar to d artagnan and a well known voice said monsieur i have brought your cloak   8.790497486679385
the woman was english then   2.5883460709703083
inquired he   12.54924425942409
now another object not less terrible suddenly presented itself   8.669275185941636
porthos   12.876259462038364
i recommend the cardinal to your attention   11.307660079299794
why she did not know but yet she did not the less feel that these reproaches were merited   15.777273338015501
and without adding another word grimaud profiting by the astonishment and terror into which he had thrown his auditors rushed from the room   9.909062482609375
take it i pray   12.17619864858476
we will discuss that subject at length some future time said he   7.960924585532171
no replied villefort   8.311329023636093
d artagnan took the soldier s arquebus made him go on before him and urged him toward his companion by pricking him behind with his sword   13.077889550174117
a convulsive shuddering shook her whole body   9.419698792478671
silence then   15.877729353088107
but as if the multitude had waited only for this demonstration to burst out all the sentiments of hostility that possessed it exploded simultaneously   8.404909738839422
monsieur said the old man ask me nothing   15.088436173464814
he felt as if each stroke of the hammer fell upon his heart   10.890179805371377
inquired aramis   9.79140704559003
well said franz with a sigh do as you please my dear viscount for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation   13.056731207734881
upon the whole however the trip had been sufficiently successful to satisfy all concerned   5.6306257336911765
i think you hailed me mademoiselle julie   14.258931996828847
he cried in a tone which electrified the coachman   16.142746645061578
he cried   14.5519675729588
how you manoeuvre my instructions count   15.4313790060988
my dear aramis said d artagnan if these are the prunes that are sent to you from tours i beg you will make my compliments to the gardener who gathers them   6.569183126110843
and d artagnan poured out a glass of wine   16.40976024094161
30 the miser in molière s comedy of l avare   15.031955582227745
you see said porthos this is my usual style   6.609816023497062
de saint méran   14.775169858103263
how he had returned   5.772149839860263
until that time continued the young girl in a calm and self possessed tone of voice we will conform to circumstances and be guided by the wishes of our friends so long as those wishes do not tend finally to separate us   6.7736897975404595
it is well said monte cristo whose countenance brightened at these words   8.241136970406012
this was a good omen for morrel for he knew that nothing but happiness could have the power of thus overcoming valentine   10.386176969088277
chapter 115   10.359417588880321
said the count with that calm tone and penetrating eye which characterize the man who knows his cause is good   18.114966439935948
i recollect this because the poor devil s death was accompanied by a singular incident   1.1541397575649075
said athos   15.524520439905842
whither should i go   6.183266421458718
said d artagnan   15.565067042226298
rather say to take him back with you into the world   11.286487124496972
so that now continued caderousse he owns a magnificent house no   12.295913311251535
as she spoke she extended her beautiful hand to the cardinal and showed him a superb diamond which sparkled on her finger   15.971802161570162
stop a bit   13.416918115992734
cried the old soldier   8.02684201374181
then they must put horses to mine   11.004532901941689
my clothes were near me on a chair   6.021583039491709
d artagnan i have always loved you as my son   17.35605787414038
no madame i will not thus waste your time   10.503052831264347
porthos paid his compliments to m   11.372073655015509
the young girl s lover was in cucumetto s troop   13.025055415264587
yes they appear to be searching a wounded or dead man   2.7641904568172393
but it was very late   8.284502171586855
twas not your right place i think as you were not equipped for an engagement   13.046111841363858
besides mother why should you make up your mind that i am to be killed   13.897758757161187
really my dear gondy said the duchess you remind one of the apocalypse   4.056062931633272
nay madame i pray you pardon this little traitor   15.197874593401561
a bad sign to find the door open   11.570778899617578
as for planchet he had been lifted from his horse as stiff as a rush   7.113353120642841
father and daughter volume five chapter 96   13.412697111150802
the two harnesses were worth three hundred pistoles   12.640899975585896
it is very fortunate said d artagnan to himself   11.677998647696667
only tell him tréville since he wishes to be considered your friend that i also wish to be one of his but he neglects me   15.669880472823152
you have doubtless heard the adventures of m   15.951342119867547
here you laugh   14.551933915394125
possessed with but one idea he cleared the last four steps with a bound and rushed into the kitchen where he saw the decanter about three parts empty still standing on the waiter where it had been left   12.033687107120821
and behind the surgeon the door closed   8.833773817149403
but does your grace know that the name of charlotte backson is not the true name of this young woman   11.307984311440979
this was the gist of his strange story the first barrel that grimaud had found on passing into the compartment he struck it was empty   13.084604982378153
this man has often made me shudder   7.693735248360378
in the room of the english nebuchadnezzar replied the staunch puritan   15.117407906156378
sermons   10.456148988656844
oh look at me closely and discover if you can even the semblance of a reproach in me   4.5829747770563465
yes in your own way   22.135155672817405
he followed with his eye each movement of teresa and her cavalier   21.39558890750318
planchet art thou there   7.883545666551666

the scotchman   10.076682803390446
sir i do not deny the justice of your correction but the more severely you arm yourself against that unfortunate man the more deeply will you strike our family   8.240560902895291

and tell me did you ever see at the court of ali tepelini whom you so gloriously and valiantly served a more exquisite beauty or richer costume   9.055784347283954
but is this all that is known   12.778578238360968
my heart told me what your mouth has just confirmed that is to say with what view you have exposed yourself to the dangers of a sea so perilous or at least so troublesome at this moment and i sent my cutter to meet you   16.148247173409857
you have been to yanina   15.049251183275778
of what companion are you speaking dear constance   9.228750351719283
asked this person   13.734824675824422
well then come here my dear said d artagnan establishing himself in an easy chair   6.177330505687244
go and see mercédès and afterwards come to me   13.745587122523203
athos said the musketeer   9.045812868567621
that is agreed upon   6.6093162407321975
the count went to the window of the apartment that looked on to the street and whistled in a peculiar manner   7.589560563862634
there he said is our road   5.975466872765448

you have told me as yet but one of them let me hear the other   15.865690420734897
i hope said d artagnan bowing that you give it my lord without hesitation and with the conviction that i am worthy of it   9.800091143462296
we have them ready made   16.009301071002017
everything is ready is it not   8.987486464717229
ah   16.27567308729858
but the sound of the clock had not died away when germain announced his excellency the count of monte cristo   14.294343381607574
and if you do not give it up well   9.897397413686148
at a quarter to six o clock monsieur de gondy having finished his business returned to the archiepiscopal palace   16.30373474542897
planchet said d artagnan i commit the corpse of this poor devil to your care   10.14536291124584
monsieur is about to ask for some men of good will for a dangerous mission but one which will do honor to those who shall accomplish it   20.48916610899711
there said the king that consoles me   12.768875135418195
but i guessed what these bundles were and that he sold by degrees what he had to pay for his subsistence   6.485226727920298
so long as three or four years ago he used to adorn and adore his little idol whom he will some day fall in love with in right earnest if he remains here   10.243159695279822
i answered mazarin i shall not sleep at all   14.918843125407378
d artagnan did the same   11.826355827048204
i require a surgeon not a priest   14.294348592992602
inquired cromwell   8.651513163678114
and it was not the magistrate slave to his duties but the friend the loyal friend who roughly but firmly cut into the very core of the corruption   12.99500813980051
that was something   3.4909468658828455
that is a little regret is not unsuitable in an offering to the lord   7.13955771222277
will go night and day   13.58381336258339
then in these trunks i presume you have given orders to your valet de chambre to put in all you are likely to need your plain clothes and your uniform   5.863318627257208
it is i mousqueton said a mournful voice whilst a sort of shadow arose out of the side of the road   14.67403203379689
hallo   8.25215151544732
bonacieux lamentations to which besides they must have been pretty well accustomed the two guards took the prisoner each by an arm and led him away while the commissary wrote a letter in haste and dispatched it by an officer in waiting   9.355129187357953
but mon dieu   8.846533271846498
and what did you do with this same letter while returning from porto ferrajo to the vessel   13.217065190647832
a merry morning to you sunshine   10.787930550896396
the first opportunity you have undeceive him i beg and tell him i am nothing of the kind   15.247165122041967
bazin quickly covered the table with a damask cloth and arranged upon it so many things gilded perfumed appetizing that d artagnan was quite overcome   9.483867405147269
at this moment the neighing of a horse struck his ear coming through darkness and space   10.539131626967052
it alarmed d artagnan more than a menace would have done for it was a warning   9.741389741295333
asked grimaud   17.26447839309167
count de guiche said the prince it is a long time since you saw your father remain here with him   6.1254450095600355

he having seen them crossing the yard took care not to answer and they rang in vain   9.285307599634812
truly my daughter replied he with a smile you are all you boast of being excepting one thing   2.933034240439877
intact my dear friend   7.85977268890555
inquired the first speaker   16.74907994987458
then for the odd cash making i think about 110 000 francs here is a check upon my banker who not being m   4.423568722754161
morrel had agreed to meet him   17.719957453124685
to prison with him   7.034338915613057
the king excited by the cardinal made a terrible clamor   13.769963731637763
he wished to have the young man at hand not that he at all mistrusted him but for the sake of having someone to whom he could constantly talk of the queen   19.007360389560702
i understand   16.75662769382034
his face was hidden under the wide brim of his hat   13.185592524588321
without reckoning mousqueton s wound for which i had to have the surgeon twice a day and who charged me double on account of that foolish mousqueton having allowed himself a ball in a part which people generally only show to an apothecary   9.390046734765821
that is possible monsieur   9.063320132462843
he uttered a cry   12.674231558407163
as he said this d artagnan gave a glance at parry who was standing in front of the king to show him that the news was meant for him   17.06088562828997
as he was finishing this work the sound of horses prancing in the yard and the wheels of a carriage shaking his window attracted his attention   11.514667502874335
cried buckingham making a step toward the door   15.698406602504058
among them was one of a very singular form which appeared to have come from a distance   10.671660934504656
and i thought from having his foot upon it the handkerchief was his   20.40244672109654
d épinay it is not perhaps the moment for mademoiselle valentine who is in deep distress to think of a husband   10.706865578766836
if he tells the baron said she i am lost for the baron who knows very well that i shall not kill myself will place me before him with a knife in my hand and he will discover that all this despair is but acted   9.663648657486684

de tréville was at the moment in rather ill humor nevertheless he saluted the young man politely who bowed to the very ground   6.535840934784373
i avenge myself   6.085464282877311
villefort had never been so concise and eloquent   4.824586365215695
you are fastidious château renaud replied debray   11.164719526287598
answered the voice of her he sought   13.364811724682365
very well   11.97972172484045
ah   17.25298583471457
it is he said she   16.917074084637704
in addition to this everything forgotten or unperceived before presented itself now to his recollection   9.58892441037073
what he had done you the honor to remain here   8.707377300782923
he saw franz and m   17.32505154049896
false gentleman   15.565951598241462
felton was sent away   10.30911756893111
and how did this despatch reach you   10.723205753976258
replied the count frowning   17.08949005262246
cried d artagnan   9.813788394561033
that proof satisfied him so completely that as a sign of satisfaction he has sent me as your majesty may see to consider with you what reparation should be made to gentlemen unjustly treated and wrongfully persecuted   14.572048000339235
she was in tears and strange as it was in spite of the emotions he felt at the sight of these tears he looked also at madame de villefort and it appeared to him as if a slight gloomy smile had passed over her thin lips like a meteor seen passing inauspiciously between two clouds in a stormy sky   10.534259993705751
what do i see   10.904164750712093
de winter shrank back from the fire of those scorching eyes   11.041663063047588
you have forgotten it porthos   12.345217027986527
the next following days were occupied in trivial movements which resulted only in the carrying off of a few herds of cattle and the burning of two or three houses   15.742695065239053
unable to have me for your wife you will content yourself with having me for your friend and sister   14.286688173164587
it was mousqueton who was obeying his master s command   11.011324261237702
d artagnan only required one reason to be satisfied   13.508892787342813
0103m it is a conspiracy then   19.72498047815467
i mean as i love   10.807708005358123
and are there no cardinals that can fight   12.438536473212027
perhaps not so great as you think porthos   8.048966428646157
still hoping to find some imperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings he added then if you were not furnished with pens how did you manage to write the work you speak of   10.295890461620607
the cavalier laughed aloud which appeared to exasperate milady still more   10.215462685482432
the young man was more pale than usual and his eyes reddened by want of sleep denoted that he had passed a feverish night   9.030645578803366
of latude from the bastille   11.270918849157486
why we must inquire into that was caderousse s reply   3.6607294436269555
where that is true said blaisois   15.657197141473688
what i know is that like a fool a greater fool than he of whom i spoke just now i mistook for this peasant girl a young bandit of fifteen or sixteen with a beardless chin and slim waist and who just as i was about to imprint a chaste salute on his lips placed a pistol to my head and aided by seven or eight others led or rather dragged me to the catacombs of st   9.284578302290285
judge not rashly say the gospel and the cardinal replied athos   10.613513341572295
curiosity prevailed over prudence   20.981410888425003
meanwhile the cardinal was rubbing his hands in great satisfaction   15.422670842380027
he invited me to dine with him on saturday which was a very natural thing for him to do   11.336185375174708
he pressed aramis s hand and went in search of porthos   13.79742249318252
i am ready said maximilian   9.853202936803715
why i says i still think you ve got too much on   6.306783179448326
well madame said mazarin bowing i desire that you give me a share in your friends as i have shared with you the little industry and talent that heaven has given me   15.489638012170785
and the worthy captain who on his side felt a lively interest in this young man so brave and so resolute pressed his hand kindly wishing him a pleasant journey   16.44456665562244
the other of mature age seemed to have the former one under her charge and was cold dry and yellow the true type of a duenna or a devotee   0.3717928870015186
permit me to remind you that you are not in the chamber my dear viscount   6.672322987939954
your majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the island of elba has maintained his relations with italy and france   11.252985517335144
they bit their lips till the blood came and grasped the hilts of their swords with all their might   15.771394163955971
but you will not follow me   14.75619720152935
oh mon dieu   18.398122486956954
it was not whether danglars or monte cristo was more or less guilty   20.112934171701717
danglars   14.131057497236537
but my lieutenant said a soldier less stoical than his chief and who had approached milady this woman is not asleep   15.975550286166813
bertuccio clasped his hands and as in all these evolutions he did not let fall the lantern the light showed his pale and altered countenance   7.222350227919849
it is always an event at marseilles for a ship to come into port especially when this ship like the pharaon has been built rigged and laden at the old phocee docks and belongs to an owner of the city   16.406251369405933
he approached the hole he had dug and now with the aid of the torch saw that his pickaxe had in reality struck against iron and wood   7.655700407881815
a groan from barrois accompanied by a yawn which seemed to crack the very jawbones attracted the attention of m   12.55034761106016
take it and there ends the matter   3.4413800264290533
he was profoundly versed in hunting and falconry and had one day when conversing on this great art astonished even louis xiii   16.127446869193555
i don t speak of my brother   3.0521402691738757
besides our supper can t delay you much   13.328513262654136
i knew you were gloomy and always brooding over some old history of the vendetta   10.099129009164587
but the mourning   7.088223163749369
should he however be guilty in this present epoch impunity would furnish a dangerous example and i must do my duty   5.763358378325228
albert vented his anger on a pile of newspapers which he sent flying all over the office by switching them violently with his stick   1.958293337594025
imitate me   19.19796389206672
the marechal de la meilleraie added that in case the coadjutor should appear on the field of battle it would be a pity that he should not be distinguished in the melee by wearing a red hat as henry iv   10.258542023149205
but if you should ever feel inclined to pay me a second visit wherever i may be you shall be welcome   9.601355578936978
you are now almost a man since you have made your first passage of arms and have acquired the right to go where you will without consulting me   15.769489839287512
sir said d avrigny to villefort call mademoiselle valentine s maid if you please   3.9315498488610032
asked the governor   8.187616480609732
really my dear m   13.390578290608653
i will listen   8.014655490784383
do you require my services now   12.40896535171634
athos and aramis again questioned planchet but he had seen nothing of d artagnan   17.134341442085457
said mme   22.153114700981988
oh not much from twelve to thirteen hundred thousand francs   10.314580768874004
there s my hand i promise   16.634125273318027
chapter lxxxii   11.879743002020847
i am free then sir   12.574222925610474
you are going into the garden   15.381149541428488
château renaud albert and morrel went one way and debray and beauchamp the other   21.33332137010263
ah said madame de villefort why did he not take wine   15.220587138756542
said gondy   7.743598223350595
it is quite enough to have those dissipated which i had formed of my fellow creatures   10.482112330960263
that voice that voice   14.009954485844844
so porthos sat down to table without another word and ate with an appetite that did honor to the confidence that was ever inspired in him by d artagnan s inventive imagination   10.782109798071332
have you a good horse monsieur de bragelonne   10.008471463018344
noirtier had once made a will against you against your family in favor of the poor in fact   4.407890556970146
cried the duke   12.119511708744188
indeed the last three days some odd adventures have happened but what is the matter   13.915319918452527
no said villefort burying his face in his hands no a hundred times no   14.392312415172421
when i say anyone pardon my urgency to anyone living i mean   5.254904630191173
i give you my word that you will find the cardinal where you leave him   6.974361669222285
this time without knowing why d artagnan felt a cold shiver run through his veins   11.654337197500977
these proceedings made d artagnan and porthos draw back   18.530808152888156
athos and aramis started with delight to find that the king was lying with his clothes on   15.06575381337532
in the name of heaven madame said villefort where is the doctor   11.73532224574824
cried d artagnan   11.261307387980134
inquired aramis   11.284373064787648
a love as tender as that of a lover for his mistress dwells undoubtedly in some paternal hearts toward a son   7.564910291628504
escape as lord de winter had thought milady s wound was not dangerous   14.879541437746472
that is one more than m   12.857966011669086
au revoir   6.553300359964648
he tore the dress of the countess to pieces   11.950701176084197
and who is beppo   19.889786406896604
there used to be a dog let loose in the yard at night but it has been taken to the house at auteuil to that you went to you know   14.64068760137651
you ride on our lackey s horses and have your own gallant steeds led along carefully by hand at short stages   9.874415310735856
it was then generally reported that mademoiselle de villefort the heiress of the marquis and marchioness of saint méran had regained the good graces of her grandfather and that she would ultimately be in possession of an income of 300 000 livres   11.619847355014478
as they were going down d artagnan laid his hand on the shoulder of their leader   7.189883286355415
the stranger was about to reply   11.134968171432293
oh growl as much as you please cried lord de winter but don t try to bite for i warn you that it would be to your disadvantage   11.606239842243177
i should never have the courage to come down again   14.555566995404941
a thousand thanks and now for the letter   14.836449980684456
he lives at the bedford tavern greenhall street   7.898995223656322
he turned his head looked around him and saw no one   11.100046652564226
will he be at home at eight o clock this evening   6.451978979894424
felton arrived at the palace of the admiralty covered with dust and streaming with perspiration   14.48662451381368
noirtier which she can not be when she becomes the baroness d épinay   15.000730557947495
beat the messenger   10.073135217591858
and you have reason for she is much to be pitied   7.332912306072022
you have done since i knew you not only your duty but more than your duty   4.121022816134171
arrived there he fastened according to the orders of his master both horse and mule to the knocker of the procurator s door   8.223625698547743
yes but your excellency will permit us to take all due precautions   16.315125327811486
there you stood stammering stupefied annihilated   14.98414522652723
but no said valentine no i tell you it is all past and it was nothing   11.153449255317138
young or old   2.005554052395402
asked morrel while d avrigny looked inquiringly   7.050708103359924
that s your opinion   7.12542551143607
andrea had fled   10.536229339602626
now then franz when for services so promptly and unhesitatingly rendered he but asks me in return to do for him what is done daily for any russian prince or italian nobleman who may pass through paris merely to introduce him into society would you have me refuse   14.658503909173522
said d artagnan placing his hand eagerly on his ring   14.806981123720385
that is another thing said porthos   12.35744410935773
ah my time is not valuable replied the man with a melancholy smile   14.445030974082496
farewell   7.493029249928899
do you then suspect anyone   8.917380636785307
you see i am a good sort of a man   9.197871599360065
that you will fire first   13.795498719695848
bonacieux   12.689350392714706
besides we feel always a sort of mental superiority over those whose lives we know better than they suppose   9.315665260150668
thought d artagnan   18.343828918331578
he asked pointing to the captain s cabin   18.239756700265975
it appears to me that this cavalier has made you very angry   13.811966959561198
the matter was arranged as d artagnan had suggested and when he returned he found the king already seated at his little table where parry waited on him harrison and his officers sitting together at another table and in a corner places reserved for himself and his companions   7.489929254579386
you see sir he is really dead said the doctor   13.488455737796126
we can not see your signs   15.273021391069392
i will question and do you answer me   4.496441823633144
well sir by the help of two signs with which i will acquaint you presently you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather is still in the full possession of all his mental faculties   8.60752611588142
i perceive what you are intending to propose to me   11.801744168329758
but surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you are expecting to receive   6.240326365411294
the cold sweat sprang to the young man s brow and his teeth chattered   16.496297634702024
i really must ask you to excuse me m   14.959758793624333
perhaps it was some man of rank who had grave reasons for hating the fallen king and who learning that the king was about to flee and escape him threw himself in the way with a mask on his face and an axe in his hand not as substitute for the executioner but as an ambassador of fate   12.030857538182525
and albert took out of a little pocket book with golden clasps a remnant of his old fancies or perhaps a tender souvenir from one of the mysterious and veiled ladies who used to knock at his little door albert took out of this pocket book a note of 1 000 francs   9.207957028231654
i think i shall send him to paris   12.360738660479235
well be it so let us not dispute about words   16.794954451651268
how lofty how magnificent monsieur athos was that day when he said to his adversary you have insisted on knowing my name sir   15.44497667850218
cried d artagnan wringing his hands   12.35471147471342
at first like you he seemed distressed   14.778306217439702
for that letter must have led to your condemnation   7.381787328403533
four days to go and the same to return with one day to discharge the commission entrusted to me is all the time i shall be absent   16.885990447568776
scarcely had he descended the first stair when a hand of iron seized him by the belt and stopped him   7.327843695416622
in short the king impatient as has been said had come by forced marches and had that moment arrived with all his household and a reinforcement of ten thousand troops   12.737058700748534
the day on which d artagnan presented himself the assemblage was imposing particularly for a provincial just arriving from his province   9.42712329369571
germain   13.905808524921941
8 or 1   10.901281929237113
28 rue de la fontaine in a room hung with red damask   7.523029860364798
at last he rose and taking his handkerchief steeped it in the blood of the martyred king   21.603897196782313
was it from london you brought that beautiful diamond that glitters on your finger   11.579852962857165
the major s eyes dilated with pleasing astonishment   9.558709175915734
the true one as you say   0.2970563775724955
oh yes in spite of all i could say   21.018265105240076
hush   16.38890482080576
he can t go out without being mobbed by his admirers   16.514085509020653
said monte cristo   8.275033084415753
what had taken place during this long sleep   15.879932142717106
there is not one of those women egyptian turkish or greek whom here you call good women who do not know how by means of chemistry to stupefy a doctor and in psychology to amaze a confessor   12.996214294198358
he took cucumetto one side while the young girl seated at the foot of a huge pine that stood in the centre of the forest made a veil of her picturesque head dress to hide her face from the lascivious gaze of the bandits   14.867561316323636
they continued their inquiries and at last met with a light dragoon who had formed one of the guard which had escorted d artagnan to rueil   12.93900698206923
yes   12.840665123063431
exclaimed haydée her eyes flashing with rage   12.7271473488012
thank you replied the jeweller it must be getting late and i must return to beaucaire my wife will be getting uneasy   17.21530504293254
dantès endeavored to renew the subject   10.20191598472306
well then i count on you   17.100888125341903
3 1627 it is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has done   9.996763945844929
those are all   19.15898963837707
in stock   13.814836662503659
the galley slaves breathed the fresh air of heaven and saw each other   14.258562878030085
then the guilty person is absolutely in custody   16.411103180963636
mon dieu   17.747911219266733
the passageway sloped in a gentle descent enlarging as they proceeded   9.022140771403347
you know i am not familiar with the french language which you monsieur le coadjuteur both speak and write so well   18.468564256219796
he awaits the answer   6.426896435815733
but at last the lieutenant s horse refused to go on   8.928853724901845
cried athos with a voice in which it was easy to detect strong emotion   9.852296815359695
you have nothing to do but to overtake it   2.389011033129309
i am lost   11.691479891357544
we at least must keep close to monseigneur   10.290247451181454
asked a gendarme   6.428378714932582
i think we are all taken prisoners except aramis and that our chances of getting out are lessened since one more of us is caught in mazarin s mousetrap   13.082796857234568
oh i am very presuming i am aware   10.781816313919387
how many people thought he and not one true friend   6.224246600631183
de villefort to m   16.168304751747485

months and years rolled on   16.208318100688157
yes   14.201100055132585
i fight in the cause of honor   28.10839504179021
every article of dress hat coat gloves and boots was from the first makers   10.486191561336675
if he should have known me again   8.155710299342683
yes that is true reverend sir   11.162250031832128
and all this all this because my heart which i thought dead was only sleeping   17.62049326139771
continued franz   5.872572193794206
cried he on perceiving d artagnan ah   10.867258084027547
said the notary   9.10750052074351
the punishment of death replied lord de winter   18.83172549403063
she listened attentively holding her breath till she was nearly suffocated   10.990009213418267
then remarking the strange expression of milady s countenance she said pardon me madame   17.351796483222227
the count of monte cristo continued the servant begs these gentlemen s permission to wait upon them as their neighbor and he will be honored by an intimation of what time they will please to receive him   15.681668690068076
de villefort started from his seat then in a moment fell down again silent and motionless   11.98267110786828
said d artagnan there are two of them then   11.659471346129482
take every care of him i beg of you   15.880340294468109
felton remained behind   2.950640059734498
just as he was his mind perfectly clear but the same incapability of moving or speaking   9.480304381096433
good   4.9474578337704695
an illustrious person awaits you   11.012028131741213

they are calm as if by enchantment   13.072214917964121
it was evident that he had touched the shore   3.7114844067215227
d artagnan bowed to mme   8.03866413904328
but said andrea if my father had met me i doubt if he would have recognized me   11.399442884965708
peppino had a little spare time so he had a game of morra with the facchini lost three crowns and then to console himself drank a bottle of orvieto   11.189199936890118
have it your own way   11.974247254534312
you have a noble heart   10.614838542554388
the frenchman made some resistance and nearly strangled beppo   10.551863623280186
he knew that like nero he was in search of the impossible and nothing astonished him but wishing to judge with his own eyes how far the count s orders had been executed he accompanied him to the door of the house   9.404169968882282
yes yes i understand said danglars and then in a low tone he added to paris no doubt to deliver the letter which the grand marshal gave him   10.164499177562105
a man who had sworn vengeance against my father and had long watched his opportunity to kill him had introduced himself that night into the garden in which my father buried me   13.774805368120335
his breast heaved   11.666312839265798
oh oh   5.053213938938465
replied raoul her fall is a very serious one and without any ostensible injury the physician fears she will be lame for life   11.596590827724743
the jailer entered and placed the bread on the table   13.664611887739882
and here you are running headlong after another   13.324398340636755
he sent for the two men whom he was wont to summon when in especially bad humor   8.996505863042312
but at the first words she read she became livid   4.151850001860729
gentlemen said the man who was young and pale bowing with ease and courtesy pardon my curiosity but i see you come from paris or at least that you are strangers at boulogne   9.601935423016414
they descended into the plain by the ladder   10.871378345123187
go for i see how impatient you are   13.186786838278955
he firmly adhered to a purpose once formed when it seemed to him to spring from conscience and to be prompted by a sense of duty   18.01886550764769
the italian s accommodi is untranslatable   9.2185121581375
but as soon as they were out of sight he said raoul we set out to night for paris   5.599921477959624
how much do you want   12.332852987005754
here said the prince handing him a purse here is for rocroy   6.641593570281362
i should wish to keep my illusions concerning insects unimpaired   7.6447912450661475
he restores to you more than he takes away and it was time i should die   12.930756909841202
the queen has not only one son but two   10.951317249877475
as he gazed at him mazarin shook his head slightly as much as to say this is a man who does not appear to me fit for much   10.280175075458011
no   11.861444942275417
but i want to know in what way m   12.750280224325977
he wore a vest of garnet colored velvet with buttons of cut gold   11.621275997530034
i took it and advanced towards the thicket   10.942133770854735
what is this   12.924026150053077
monsieur laporte said d artagnan finish dressing his majesty   9.416480207346252
but at the first words which issued from her mouth she plainly saw that the young fanatic stood more in need of being moderated than urged   13.427852723738432
raoul bent respectfully before the two princesses and bowing to de winter departed   14.610514073221612
de tréville which informed him that at his request the king had promised that he should enter the company of the musketeers   5.736576201478089
neat remarked d artagnan   15.796268814329837
now not a second to lose for a second lost will perhaps save them   9.0338174964008
his eminence will continue to be prime minister and her majesty s favorite if he will grant to me and my friends what we demand for france and for ourselves   12.473852362793306
pray said the lackey say nothing about it monsieur   14.704752362471432
they had not exceeded their leave of absence and that same evening they went to pay their customary visit to m   13.318936962367646
on perceiving him beauchamp stopped   14.76149849704226
and she has ten or twelve days as lord de winter her fraternal and terrible jailer has told her   13.685313724986104
chapter xviii   18.79619968493774
30 champs élysées   11.161445898179474
with the enmity of the government   8.39519150240747
he cried or you are a dead man   10.468433016343887
the light streamed forth on the gilt mouldings and the silk hangings   9.24622973315703
but what is the use of teasing me with going all over that again   15.873235681293192
yet replied beauchamp haughtily there are occasions when probity commands m   14.533210059147391
and then he walked rapidly to and fro and pressed his burning forehead against the fence   6.919586330989184
the handkerchief was thrown down and the iron heeled shoe replaced on the foot of the wretch to whom it belonged   14.742724590772799
what is the matter then with this dear child   8.660846502737263
the occupant of the box in which the greek girl sat appeared to share the universal admiration that prevailed   8.320695208914518
the countess had this portrait painted during the count s absence   12.135428594036842
take him and teach him to be as brave and loyal as you are yourself   4.367811144040037
the rascal is rich then   12.426249723969377
the officers perceived that they had not to deal with a gentleman and they treated him like a very peasant   13.476088603603579
on the evening of the 4th of september m   18.39826451451254
athos did not reply   17.082822215056424
but tell me how you made his acquaintance   18.658700106681145
good evening maximilian   13.543754064829756
on the contrary said athos it must be preserved carefully   14.025381899829618
i fear that is true said d artagnan in a low tone   12.506335529189354
noirtier paler than even the young girl more eager than villefort for the decision was watching also intently and affectionately   14.983335924138668
her ladyship is waiting to receive you gentlemen said the servant who had gone to inquire the pleasure of his mistress   11.247743223414416
a step a gesture a word on your part denoting an effort to escape and you are to be fired upon   15.538007235114415
asked mazarin   13.372270222227517
oh my god   9.696840871662527
olivain bowed and slipped the crown into his pocket   16.668002919710833
danglars leaped from his chair and raised his eyes and arms towards heaven   4.831365108369444
everything relating to this young man is true   17.303426409634945
you will know when you reach london   7.272548394766164
debray is one of your friends   7.789766760359057
la ramee   16.95507494138363
thank you viscount continued the prince laughing and i appoint you from this moment my interpreter   7.046665795670205
he might have been executed at that moment without his making a single gesture in his own defense or uttering a cry to implore mercy   15.556517520911841
all the weight of his fallen fortune seemed suddenly to crush him   11.805606232449684
madame he is very happy in owing any obligation to you   11.700260055754047
cried morrel throwing away his cigar and hastening to the carriage   10.838186479655496
that is policy   17.0395109334357
cried the cardinal with violence   16.583110185018302
and now when are we to go   11.505077224243374
yield   12.140714469440407
well   10.12500080346815
go sir replied the tutor   10.964390196026013
athos started   15.790963288976313
ah said he they have sent some fencing master to fight with me   15.308567315722506
he therefore dined very silently in spite of the officious attention of his host who presented himself two or three times to inquire if he wanted anything   15.09806647565016
have you nothing more to do there   9.602352711355103
madame de saint méran had three successive attacks at intervals of some minutes each one more serious than the former   13.751879795670424
midnight struck   7.507793796656358
but don t let us hinder you mousqueton   3.4806564683620618
but if there be any letter he will give it to me   17.921309550380712
asked the officer   6.465527004457898
and that is the very thing that alarms me returned dantès   13.548541233265244
but whether it be for recompense or punishment i accept my fate   11.134259491350122
at six leagues from marseilles after having eaten some of the lozenges he is accustomed to take he fell into such a deep sleep that it appeared to me unnatural   18.09322302848897
of a woman who calls herself your friend   6.711835584814167
there   8.858386036185419
milady however saw that this sort of narrative amused her very much and kept at it   15.814559069828675
oh tis here tis here tis over my sight is gone my senses fail   10.444956348129946
well we will reflect and perhaps we will beg him   13.589844081567461
we will then terminate this conversation   9.808816012338834
nevertheless they had not the power of convincing milady   15.707275746941818
he cried   6.366891378657648
i understand why you accepted it and i grant you my pardon   15.804019850039472
do not let her flee from your embrace   14.03899658421281
this rochefort cried porthos if i were the esquire of poor chalais should pass a minute or two very uncomfortably with me   18.64740965261409
the first advantage had been gained by buckingham   11.279364138211028
d épinay to whom i had promised the interest of this sum shall receive it even if i endure the most cruel privations   15.710387126941248
this malady admits but of one remedy   12.772139893818771
ali observed his master as the nubian entered the chamber you have frequently explained to me how more than commonly skilful you are in throwing the lasso have you not   7.045634884799676
yes said the physician i repeat it   7.830367959954769
8 or 1   11.261316289128402
i have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at auteuil at the house of the count of monte cristo replied madame de villefort turning away with marked coldness of manner   10.436767564711234
replied d artagnan affecting hesitation in order to make her believe him ignorant   3.458369623006181
true said caderousse   12.498030724596854
the repast was magnificent   9.119295148763612
ah yes   14.381663794335006
it might have been thought that he hoped the beverage would be mortal and that he sought for death to deliver him from a duty which he would rather die than fulfil   11.984705058176958
hence that immense fortune which in lord wilmore s opinion possibly amounted to one or two millions per annum a precarious fortune which might be momentarily lost by the failure of the mine   12.857200364053519
i hope the world will not call me cowardly for acting as my conscience dictated   10.058701704842282
i will come at once to the point   16.86228940138355
i know not why you meddle said fernand seizing his arm   7.2600244594225725
what she had regarded as something distressing was in reality a disgrace   19.82199562274054
the masks could not appear   9.116201877432166
and i said aramis with his soft melodius voice remember that i will roast you at a slow fire like a savage   10.52290852285554
morcerf did not pursue the subject and monte cristo himself fell into a silent reverie   13.674746746307472
he exclaimed thy vengeance is sometimes delayed but only that it may fall the more effectually   13.846575108236767
for d artagnan had assumed a threatening attitude and planchet modeled himself after his master   10.093028570793802
the young man you speak of said villefort abruptly is a great criminal and i can do nothing for him mademoiselle   11.741808602723678
our swords   7.903216326033994
oh nothing worth speaking of said morrel   12.563630661020923
bring him here at eight o clock sir and may heaven bless you as i bless you   16.057928558983082
my friend   11.339400717588994
remove from me the remains of doubt which if it change not to conviction must become remorse   9.91933227654242
benedetto never again appeared at rogliano neither have i since that day either seen or heard anything concerning him   10.156841223133748
ah   11.984184923374421
chapter xi   14.153473188779447
but buckingham was incapable of going to any excess against a woman particularly if that woman was supposed to have acted from a feeling of jealousy   11.658772376984462
madame said lucien playing with a little dog who recognizing him as a friend of the house expected to be caressed i am not the only one who makes similar complaints i think i heard morcerf say that he could not extract a word from his betrothed   9.068170952269478
well sir said de guiche are you going to reply   14.083471399810882
she continued then as if she had not heard his exclamation or as if she thought the moment was not yet come to reply to it   16.257904954257288
and in the midst of the greenhouse marvellous alike to sight and smell was a billiard table which looked as if it had been abandoned during the past hour by players who had left the balls on the cloth   16.8033010146524
he is going to turn his house into a badhaus as the germans term it   7.163129646177536
the englishman then turned round and described the combat without omitting a single detail   9.441161575029685
dantès concealed two or three of the sharpest fragments in his bed leaving the rest on the floor   11.748631290380702
lord de winter   8.732477399475329
i could kill an ox with a blow of my fist   18.70457165693293
there was something mournful solemn and terrible in the count s manner   16.2143444490865
you think me rather parsimonious don t you   2.6355090480388093
and he is a count   6.725423953424846
nonsense   5.996435036879334
my faith   11.836656711425634
but i have always given it up   16.625639242279114
and as soon as he saw the two cavaliers he ran to them with open arms   11.530317158121107
yes your excellency   13.316407595767368
this menace smothered the young man s passion   13.94678335032587
those are really aces and twos which you see but my shots have turned them into threes fives sevens eights nines and tens   12.985316769367405
i am not surprised that you refused to recognize me   11.352901224000702
morrel was only thirty one barrois was sixty years of age   15.559918972563633
here i am ready to give you any explanation you desire   11.432243166818601
yes yes said lord de winter who perceived what was passing in her mind   18.061080526181264
and even when one is killed one rises again the proof of which is that here we are   16.695469294668158
be easy said d artagnan he will know all before night   19.895136197394915
before daybreak m   13.345770982023144
we will pay our compliments to that poor man   13.077223811124124
for if you have discovered nothing at least you have had the good sense to persevere in your suspicions   17.617002615956647
the boat must be waiting for us and there is our sloop at anchor do you see it there   10.155590633156727
follow him said villefort to dantès   8.047189730011988
the doctor flew to his patient   10.491251837749417
pooh pooh   4.533101489029606
and your excellencies will do well not to think of that any longer   16.18626469053239
your name   12.870279811043927
explain yourself   6.944868830115565
i am glad of it   14.922110358928375
none   19.68053068698497
yes yes make your mind easy he shall be decently interred in the newest sack we can find   7.633674717000453
i drew my sword in my turn and as he came back to the charge i fancied i felt that in throwing himself upon me he let it pass through his body   18.004011360884096
spada a prudent man and greatly attached to his only nephew a young captain of the highest promise took paper and pen and made his will   14.606533296784255
in recalling all he had been through he foresaw all that raoul might suffer   14.287081725599425
in a few minutes valentine re entered the garden alone   10.437439284345938
crushed enfeebled he remained standing and with listening ear   16.533141377946563
but his majesty s decision is always necessary   12.550283302383942
you are sure replied the stranger that she did not suspect the intentions with which you went out   9.302894491773849
i wish after such a scene to be alone   17.15016803406789
and you are right said his host   11.85674177434987
save my husband   15.87814751621971
whom do you expect to find with me at this hour   17.208058427009618
but that is not all madame   13.50639812394991
said he showing d artagnan a place where it had been pierced through   10.233506541887806
how   11.52835146465751
i   14.128768941794068
he took the opportunity of calling out his guard the swiss troops and the musketeers and he had planted them round the palais royal on the quays and on the pont neuf   17.521957217273393
ah good morning my dear count said he   14.695741896368476
do you know the numbers   13.764863863231776
they denounced edmond as a bonapartist agent   10.11863198550932
my sole heir that i have bu   4.2646968752904035
asked the duke when they were alone   16.448966614964313
you are the queen   16.817959596998065
the sides of the walls seem to close in even to press against him   15.303487281574721
we who have faced fifty foes on the high road can well meet two in the place royale   11.566921103221627
murmured the king   8.541800599259421
i will be with you directly   16.25956387666366
said he   6.304550474180778
no   14.246610514134845
a natural son   7.618744488953182
moreover something had been said of a marriage with mazarin s niece   10.507230405538172
during this time olivain had finished his bottle and eaten his pie   6.178003281466968
not all   10.836778547618541
they went on a hundred and fifty paces in this way and then were stopped by who comes there   9.838560866376671
so then the wedding is to take place immediately m   4.670898098006535
at the end of twelve days after having made a splendid dinner he reckoned his accounts and found that he had only 50 000 francs left   13.787084459252103
nevertheless monsieur de tréville s company of musketeers alone can not maintain a war against the cardinal who disposes of the forces of all france and before whom the queen is without power and the king without will   9.362997955204799
i hope to kill all four of you but i am more likely to kill the first than the second the second than the third and the third than the last   14.233631114454823
our friends   6.819106253568335
asked the young man after a moment s pause   9.96702377881919
you grow a little too warm in my opinion about the fate of madame bonacieux   7.440606862189546
be off you wretch   10.073506933640209
and he retired discovering mazarin who was in great confusion to the astonished gaze of aramis   10.905049653201575
well then said milady i confide in my brother   15.45645820128443
as he thought thus he looked alternately at the window with red curtains and the three windows with white curtains   12.101339823316094
edmond still heard the sound   18.403258123978777
oh these plans of retreat have been formed for a long time   14.357691221621453
i believe he s swimming toward us   13.127334913238949
that s very simple replied athos   9.367513994794184
without reckoning said athos that if he had not rescued me from the hands of cahusac i should not now have the honor of making my very humble reverence to your majesty   14.238684131188919
if i can get enough to rebuild artagnan which my ancestors impoverished by the crusades allowed to fall into ruins and to buy thirty acres of land about it that is all i wish   17.649204750367375
i will then   3.4390421935853652
oh yes   12.544773648785032
in hôtels that do not flourish everything is in confusion and the traveler is a victim to the embarrassments of his host   16.189230721802975
have you never experienced for anyone that sudden and irresistible sympathy which made you feel as if the object of it had been your old and familiar friend though in reality it was the first time you had ever met   17.464219921757685
i promise you that   8.040436713039362
from him whom you have rendered the happiest of men comte de wardes this note was in the first place a forgery   9.980941782769156
well listen morcerf   11.262786769450043
but however profound was this darkness my eyes began to accustom themselves to it   13.430862590896421
well   14.350531219255874
you have guessed rightly madame replied monte cristo smiling   6.3520951718348
upon these conditions i will pay for the pen the price of the bottle and for the ink the price of the pie   15.17685990628879
and the fact is i have gained 16 000 francs by the sale of them   7.191482462667671
his teeth chattered like those of a man under a violent attack of fever and yet he was deadly pale   11.76543912763332
you know the only reply that i desire said d artagnan the only one worthy of you and of me   9.300315469492169
then the soldier gagged and bound was placed upon the hearth the fire of which had been previously extinguished by the two friends   13.750573654416124
copies were put up at the corners of the streets   15.870232831670151
go to the kitchen and get me some syrup of violets   12.42414725728077
she had only one day left   6.029056173503727
is it you   13.299164186372952
pray go valentine said   5.73832481495727
parry said the king rising too my horse   0.04716485041323715
the bandit gazed on this scene with amazement   19.72367495681331
the gascon and the italian   11.041910265284345
said d artagnan they will have left a chicken at least   12.86115776583832
these horses belong to monsieur de montbazon   10.238316254062049
said he   22.25966776109214
i love my poor constance more than ever and if i knew the place in which she is were it at the end of the world i would go to free her from the hands of her enemies   6.970726895091631
here were not as in other tombs ignoble drawers one above another where thrift bestows its dead and labels them like specimens in a museum   9.730296870519538
and while acknowledging the justice of your reclamation i refuse it on account of the form   8.093250775311741
i believed i had a right to endeavor to find her   16.28114169115046
let us see for you know my dear captain a judge must hear both sides   13.934453266529085
interrupted monte cristo   10.548868653823245
yes your excellency   13.02962043941061
well   11.33094526001817
suddenly two dark forms seemed to separate from the mass advanced grew in size and as they loomed up larger and larger assumed the appearance of two horsemen   12.612324891324967
every frondist must put a knot of straw in his hat   5.409478256823552
each time he had been brought into contact with his father something terrible had happened   8.69025128974004
well what do you see from this window   11.683922106689115
oh how our hearts palpitated   13.425391290144956
exactly so   11.02631918035249
if bonacieux knew where his wife was one might by extreme means force the mercer to open his teeth and let his secret escape   8.942929596234192
a slight appearance of foam was visible around the mouth and he breathed painfully and with extreme difficulty   6.39660794434038
he is an abbé   15.67530307371689
and how much did she give you for this fine enterprise   14.148813147003324
i have told sir murmured milady lowering her voice and allowing herself to sink overpowered to the ground   9.41211792564597
bertuccio   19.381243115481894
remain here and i will send you your clothes by the boy   8.249567129750226
d artagnan examined her with a rapid glance   11.530533388657288
0147m who could know that i was here already   7.175142188102861
they saw or rather continued to see the image of what they had witnessed   10.624122077148293
no dear morcerf   10.772353128596025
besides my friend providence has warned us that we may be on our guard   7.672446533656566
who could say how far the vengeance of such a woman would go   14.417750490827864
what   9.892895335924667
yes yes to mine   5.168472501789922
he passed over my head and i heard the flooring creak beneath his footsteps   10.843973272979095
why how extraordinary   12.85703406899019
de tréville s as nine o clock had just struck and as planchet who had not yet made the bed was beginning his task a knocking was heard at the street door   15.19992330916493
i resisted   17.124008109251914
i shot two with my double barrelled gun and two more with my pistols but i was then disarmed and two were still left   14.888153556987664
give me your word gentlemen that you will not attack me otherwise than one after the other   15.047533370952804
that is all i want   8.471585857081898
and only two windows looking toward the road one of which was in a pavilion parallel to that which aramis occupied the other belonging to aramis himself   13.744427509040516
oh no   8.977922929681299
out even to me   14.676450589620812
the vanquished must not be dainty in the choice of means   14.12682965753347
go gentlemen he said   13.852987528495664
said the listener not through doors but through windows   12.497231510903275
but in attempting to execute this command the soldiery were attacked in the market place with stones and halberds   12.362394518200855
true said louis xviii   12.32849235408431
mordaunt sustained this new attack without wincing   7.312702929621488
at two o clock   12.77271541347323
yes i know what brand you are talking about   20.486110203115693
go said he   18.24061532169847
m   16.257365493345077
we became orphans i at five he at eighteen   14.104144272899436
but the animal not liking him as well as debray and attempting to bite him danglars seized him by the skin of his neck and threw him upon a couch on the other side of the room   13.750899163208807
before god and before men i accuse this woman of having urged me to the murder of the baron de wardes   8.7688873924946
the marchioness raised her head at this word and beholding the man who so forcibly reminded her of her deeply regretted child who still lived for her in valentine she felt touched at the name of mother and bursting into tears she fell on her knees before an armchair where she buried her venerable head   11.465786394868402
well she is a monster who at twenty five years of age has been guilty of as many crimes as you could read of in a year in the archives of our tribunals   9.972550445259044
i wish you to write from time to time to the captains in charge of the two vessels so as to keep them on the alert   15.736191159079759
you don t know them   11.773877900885644
d avrigny soon restored the magistrate to consciousness who had looked like a second corpse in that chamber of death   4.544571520909803
the tempest was let loose and beating the atmosphere with its mighty wings   13.699695749170669
cried mousqueton his fat cheeks swelling out and his whole frame perspiring with joy   16.842425110423186
i shall be excused for leaving at daybreak for i was ashamed   11.889774554710332
cried felton   10.621985105989232
can you sir produce any witnesses to the truth of what you have asserted   12.658413270417391
ah   7.065131755985615
yes said porthos i see him   7.147666775867572
true he replied and my protector is very kind   16.053893442213273
here is a glass with one already prepared said villefort entering the room   16.906426065672093
my kingdom is bounded only by the world for i am not an italian or a frenchman or a hindu or an american or a spaniard i am a cosmopolite   15.646593638577201
you must have had enough for today   14.92343343518898
but i think i have it said athos   10.259530921423796
i suppose you have a blue ribbon in your pocket   12.015745100077895
well said la carconte after a moment s pause you are not a man   8.75091234706071
up   2.006764812522242
but he was present at the deathbed of a man who knew him   11.880217471777199
now as at the moment in which d artagnan fixed his eyes upon the gentleman in the violet doublet the gentleman made one of his most knowing and profound remarks respecting the béarnese pony his two auditors laughed even louder than before and he himself though contrary to his custom allowed a pale smile if i may be allowed to use such an expression to stray over his countenance   13.143763549750798
cried raoul swimming on   10.93091105844959
continued caderousse half rising and with his fist on the table hallo edmond   11.16753118698372
indeed sir said milady you must be either drunk or mad   13.714442897093429
i mean to ask if you are married   12.524001679894399
why should i   10.47739505927581
dearest valentine said the young man the difference between our respective stations makes me fear to offend you by speaking of my love but yet i can not find myself in your presence without longing to pour forth my soul and tell you how fondly i adore you   18.11562625450326
while i watched the window he guarded the door   9.209304625694072
the fact is said porthos aramis is of the same height and something of the shape of the duke   16.880638454338364
cried the young man whose agony drawn breath at times when his head went under water under the wave exhaled and made the icy waters bubble   13.510633675083813
all the nobility of rome will be present and if your fair incognita belong to the higher class of society she must go there   11.880650128111094
scarron s house   15.014981042987582
and passing his hand through the broken glass the count opened the door   4.681254322447058
asked athos   11.640759497326126
yes count you know what i told you   11.547303511862342
the sign of the red dovecot chapter xliv   10.471751539399666
ah   15.687523505465578
one throw is soon made   13.34902430850852
his hands of which he took little care were the despair of aramis who cultivated his with almond paste and perfumed oil   14.397514211043378
said d artagnan to himself and darted into the passage   15.451759638069433
franz d épinay   17.351513667989806
said m   12.892985630659103
his heart ceased beating he closed his eyes and leaned upon the table   19.10669827752386
answer me do not these crimes exist   13.240822672487525
mordaunt who has brought it and is charged with its execution   10.561344666779265
said raoul blushing   19.259380786496674
aramis because you are a knight of malta and won t mix with fellows like us   9.310249831478622
this latter party was composed of ill looking fellows who resembled bandits more than anything else   14.579107337140572
i suspect no one   11.840168785142174
nevertheless after several attempts at conversation with olivain he foresaw that many days passed thus would prove exceedingly dull   13.743142316607372
good said the brigadier   11.55914104515283
pardon me said albert i was not aware that he was a prince   6.433737995030642
admirable sire   5.549885714668211
i will go directly was edmond s reply   11.40917194760777
d artagnan followed him amid cries which strongly resembled curses   10.36887754410318
how dreadful   11.373955469935638
precisely monsieur replied monte cristo with one of those smiles that a painter could never represent or a physiologist analyze   14.574292787590071
there has been fighting then   16.32682207055005
tomorrow   12.14741203043756
you know what it is to be in love   20.201417938194645
i had vague perceptions of space traversed of the rolling of a carriage of a horrible dream in which my strength had become exhausted   8.757127326882143
i would rather die a hundred times oh yes die   10.671462207073592
at the last large door in the street   10.888557656514017
for i feel eagle s wings springing out at my shoulders and with those wings i could make a tour of the world in four and twenty hours   13.593260427016679
i thought so my lord said felton   20.405463404415492
come here my lad said la ramee and hear what i have to say   6.1710317822806235
the other a brunette with a fierce and haughty expression and as straight as a poplar   13.880214911048919
d artagnan was lifting a glass to his lips   19.569710960991742
and was he not so   11.068119120986227
what are his means of existence   16.132228891122672
cried de chatillon   10.254515574110934
rochefort   14.679174287229005
i was at the festival of my marriage monsieur said the young man his voice slightly tremulous so great was the contrast between that happy moment and the painful ceremony he was now undergoing   12.32794633946071
what a gourmand you are growing   22.871056138262343
where must we place him   13.557079699688583
and he then related to raoul the story of the bastion and raoul fancied he was listening to one of those deeds of arms belonging to days of chivalry so gloriously recounted by tasso and ariosto   10.660916857620412
he will gain himself a reputation   11.521745162132778
no monseigneur   14.492295665520505
let them grow pale in their drowsiness if they are disposed to do so and pray do you remain in peace who have no remorse to disturb you   13.891106771157025
the day after this important information had been given to the king s attorney a man alighted from a carriage at the corner of the rue férou and rapping at an olive green door asked if the abbé busoni were within   9.058736976358054
then three or four shots were fired   18.042708711991864
muttered he   13.911661450619292
and must i tell you my lord what they wished us to cry as well   14.258555036396139
oh said monte cristo it would be quite superfluous for you to tell me for i already know it   12.017695022607983
enough replied the questioner   10.668716076959484
but to insure this you must rely on me   11.555494353091003
a weak obstacle is sometimes sufficient to overthrow a great design   8.699385803805924
jesus seigneur   11.602759934972
lord de winter   9.786198918877648
on whom do my hopes rest   16.172931838149616
do you know that he holds terrestrial beings under his control   17.153513341460908
and you sing chorus replied guitant laughing   12.648124616589943
for you are the only young man to whom i have hitherto spoken as i have done to you   6.613289430953606
he found her in a charming humor   15.459424566621394
you have evidently seen and observed everything   11.837133262005896
on the contrary everything is in the kitchen   11.989970159042196
even before the coachman had hailed the concierge the massy gates rolled on their hinges they had seen the count coming and at paris as everywhere else he was served with the rapidity of lightning   13.65265930172303
20255m oh no said morrel   12.422689254067754
all we require to insure success is courage and that you possess and strength which i am not deficient in   8.33514156981345
repeated the baroness   8.12571906772627
i do not hold life dear enough to be afraid of death   15.238346918793905
summer balls are fashionable   14.73389460388087
you do not consecrate your days and nights wholly to the king s service   10.975840812937552
gentlemen once more take him to prison and keep him under key as long as possible   15.103669806694851
besides he wore the uniform of the guards which next to that of the musketeers was most admired by the ladies   13.647527261702638
you have then overheard our conversation   8.659676021450322
cried athos   10.622500586979083
i returned to the seminary   13.647507913387178
can not monsieur cromwell wait a little   18.760077159885107
but he feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police minister although he saw that dandré was irrevocably lost   12.476619425851021
peppino turning around shouted a fowl for his excellency   16.017451479564286
i hoped to find some traces which had escaped me in the darkness   10.544972433396566
i beg you will remove your bandage   11.041798940603089
you forget count that i have often told you of the deep interest my mother takes in you   8.804649121658306
said aramis   10.522187279577528
that of informing you beforehand of my coming   11.066146146146124
d artagnan ran to the door and pushed the bolt   7.472807019551216
chapter xvi   11.008772823971512
so you and the cardinal have been talking about me   15.402544048665497
the king has nothing like it   12.187391200771458
he will inform against you   12.038059147063537
it carries me away   15.136997914098625
count said the banker things are constantly occurring in the world to induce us to lay aside our most established opinions or at all events to cause us to remodel them according to the change of circumstances which may have placed affairs in a totally different light to that in which we at first viewed them   15.933564416647421
and how the devil did you escape   9.44422896010329
disinterestedness is the brightest ray in which a noble sword can shine   7.703130657406682
continued beauchamp hoping to take him at a disadvantage   13.938145947252977
have you a spanish prisoner   17.927442994396063
while around each chamber luxurious divans were placed with piles of soft and yielding cushions that needed only to be arranged at the pleasure or convenience of such as sought repose   15.089184496748022
this boat contained an officer a mate and eight rowers   15.261650349492303
daughter of a prince i restore to you the riches and name of your father   17.776329716085716
the prisoner is hostage for the security of the messenger   11.77185529283937
these words redoubled the eagerness of d artagnan who urged his horse though he stood in need of no incitement and they proceeded at a rapid pace   6.987454955163006
what do i see   10.002902540855915
cried mazarin to the coadjutor   14.351848309176301
we are first said morrel looking out of the window   14.173431179681833
but parry withdrew thinking he was dreaming   12.489478855859717
exactly so   13.172955364370004
and you confess that if that word were heard you would be ruined   8.746512489448953
alas   17.997035002559343
who sent away madame de chevreuse after she had been persecuted twelve years under the last reign   11.699604286036726
his complexion was brilliant and beautiful   5.748845142278088
he passed his tongue over a spoonful of preserves and stuck his teeth into the sticky pastry of mme   10.60248061466337
yes   10.67679110786717
noirtier raised his eyes it was the sign agreed on between him and valentine when he wanted anything   15.082512370420119
and if anything can be done well we will make it our business   12.880326893876695
he tore himself from the arms of porthos and aramis and threw himself like a madman on the corpse of his mistress   15.44471771344837
